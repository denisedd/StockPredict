{"Headline": "Chinese Tech Company Blocked From Buying American Components", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s second-largest maker of telecommunications equipment will not be able to use components made in the United States after the Commerce Department said it failed to punish employees who violated American sanctions against Iran and North Korea.ZTE\u2019s products for the infrastructure of telecommunications networks, as well as its smartphones, use an array of American parts, like microprocessors from the chip maker Qualcomm, glass made by Corning and sound technology from San Francisco-based Dolby.In a call with reporters on Monday, a senior Commerce Department official said the action was not connected to a broader intellectual property investigation into China.But the tough restrictions on ZTE may be perceived as a new salvo in a deepening economic conflict between the United States and China as the Trump administration and the Chinese government trade threats of increased tariffs on everything from washing machines to soy beans. The Trump administration\u2019s move to counter what it terms unfair trade practices by China has prompted threats of hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs on products that travel between the two countries.That trade clash now centers heavily on cutting-edge technology. The Trump administration accuses China of using coercion and illicit means to obtain American technology. In particular, it has criticized an industrial plan known as Made in China 2025 that seeks to make China a world leader in industries like robotics, electric cars and medical devices.In a bid to stop China from dominating these industries, the White House has proposed limiting American exports of semiconductors and advanced machinery to the country. That could happen through new investment restrictions, which are set to be announced in the coming months.In a Twitter post Monday morning, President Trump also took aim at China, accusing the country of devaluing its currency.China, the Treasury report said, has allowed its currency to appreciate only gradually, and \u201cthe distortion in the global trading system resulting from China\u2019s currency policy over this period imposed significant and long-lasting hardship on American workers and companies.\u201dZTE representatives could not be reached for comment.Before the settlement, the Commerce Department had provided two internal ZTE documents to bolster its case.One, from 2011 and signed by several senior ZTE executives, detailed how the company had \u201congoing projects in all five major embargoed countries \u2014 Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria and Cuba.\u201d Another document, in a complex flow chart, laid out a method for circumventing United States export controls.The 2017 settlement, which did not block ZTE from buying technology made in the United States, appeared to be a reprieve for the Chinese tech company.But the Commerce Department said Monday that ZTE had violated the terms of the earlier agreement by making false statements to the United States government. ZTE did not take a number of actions that it said it had: the company did not reprimand employees involved in the banned sales and did not cancel their bonuses.\u201cZTE misled the Department of Commerce,\u201d Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said in a statement. \u201cInsead of reprimanding ZTE staff and senior management, ZTE rewarded them. This egregious behavior cannot be ignored.\u201dThe department said it would reinstate the limits on the company that the 2017 settlement had set aside.Without access to key components from companies in the United States, ZTE\u2019s smartphones will likely have to be redesigned. Even if new suppliers can be found, the transition will represent a significant disruption to production of the company\u2019s phones.The ban also comes at a bad time for ZTE. Revenue from the expansion of Chinese 4G cellular networks has slowed, and its smartphone business faces major competition from new Chinese handset makers, as well as its much larger Chinese rival, Huawei.With the United States increasingly focused on barring China from accessing its high-tech products through tariffs and investment restrictions, the new punishment for the Chinese company could be viewed as an escalation.In response to the initial settlement, ZTE said it had strengthened its compliance policies and changed its top management.\u201cZTE acknowledges the mistakes it made, takes responsibility for them and remains committed to positive change in the company,\u201d said Zhao Xianming, chairman and chief executive of ZTE, in a statement last year.Ana Swanson reported from Washington.

{"Headline": "Surgery Lit by Cellphone: Togo Doctors Strike Over Deplorable Hospitals", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOM\u00c9, Togo \u2014 The air-conditioner was broken in the sweltering neonatal ward of Togo\u2019s largest hospital, and only one nurse was on duty to attend to the two dozen infants with life-threatening conditions.Mothers with babies in the ward were imploring friends and family for loans to buy basic medical supplies from pharmacies around Lom\u00e9, the capital, because items like drugs, saline solution, latex gloves and packets of clean water were not available at Sylvanus Olympio University Teaching Hospital.One infant, Tresor Tsolenyanou, was born in February with gastroschisis, a condition in which the intestines are partly exposed through a hole in the abdominal muscles. He shared a crib with several other babies, his bulging torso wrapped in gauze.In the United States, the survival rate for gastroschisis is 90 percent. But because of the high risk of infection in this overcrowded, understaffed and undersupplied hospital, Tresor was likely to die, said Steven Kagni, the ward\u2019s attending nurse.Fed up with situations like Tresor\u2019s, Togo\u2019s public hospital workers are demonstrating their disgust with the level of care they are able to provide, adding their voices to a growing swell of political protests that have shaken this small, West African country.As they have done half a dozen times since the beginning of the year, doctors and nurses again went on strike in late March, walking out of the central hospital, blocking new patients from entering and encouraging existing patients to seek private treatment elsewhere.\u201cWhen you accept to work in these conditions, you might be complicit in a situation that could cause death. You are responsible,\u201d said Dr. David Dosseh, a surgeon at the central hospital who helped organize the strikes. \u201cSo at a certain moment, you have to ask if it\u2019s better to just stop working.\u201dCritics say the pervasive problems in Togo\u2019s medical system \u2014 where equipment frequently malfunctions, electricity and water supplies are unreliable and new doctors earn less than taxi drivers \u2014 are the result of government corruption and ineptitude.But the current unrest in Togo extends far beyond the nation\u2019s troubled health care system.While doctors have kept clear of street demonstrations and confined their opposition to strikes, their status as medical professionals, and their intimate involvement with the daily miseries of life in the capital, has put them at the forefront of the movement calling for Mr. Gnassingb\u00e9 to be removed from power.\u201cPeople have a lot of respect and consideration for the doctors,\u201d said Farida Nabourema, a prominent opposition activist. \u201cThe strikes are a key part of the resistance.\u201dMr. Gnassingb\u00e9, who succeeded his father as president in 2005 in an election marred by violence and accusations of fraud, supported legislation introduced last fall that would put in place presidential term limits \u2014 but which exempted his current and previous terms, allowing him to run again in 2020 and 2025.That bill was angrily voted down by opposition lawmakers and led to demonstrations around the country.Mr. Gnassingb\u00e9\u2019s government countered with sweeping arrests of opposition politicians, internet blackouts, crackdowns on social media and, according to Amnesty International, beatings and torture by the federal police.In February, the government agreed to negotiate with opposition party members, a meeting brokered by President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana. Since then, large-scale political protests have waned, with activists awaiting the outcome of the discussions.But the health care workers continue to forge ahead with strikes, regularly leaving the central hospital with few or no staff members for days at a time.I. Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School and an expert on health law and bioethics, said medical ethicists generally agree that the potential benefits of a doctors\u2019 strike can justifiably outweigh the potential risk to patients, if the dispute is about the quality of patient care (as opposed to, for example, pensions or vacation time). A recent peer-reviewed study of doctor\u2019s strikes around the world found no evidence that they lead to an increase in patient mortality, he said.\u201cWhen you agree to become a doctor, you do not agree to work under any possible condition with whatever quality of care that might mean for patients,\u201d Professor Cohen said.The government in Togo has retaliated against some leading doctors. Two weeks ago, Ihou Majest\u00e9, the vice dean at the University of Lom\u00e9 medical school, was arrested and detained by the federal police for several days after an audio clip, said to be in his voice, circulated comparing the health ministry to a broken down car.Experts at the United Nations say that Togo scores about average for a country of its income on metrics like vaccine availability, deaths from noncommunicable diseases and average life expectancy. Its newborn mortality rate, 26 per 1,000 births, is better than war-torn Sierra Leone, but worse than countries like Niger and Burkina Faso that are less developed than Togo.But official health statistics in Togo are often sparse, outdated and unreliable, said Dr. Agbessi Amouzou, a Togolese public health professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who studies health systems in sub-Saharan Africa and who called Lom\u00e9\u2019s main hospital \u201ca disaster.\u201dMoustafa Mijiyawa, the health minister, did not respond to email inquiries asking for an interview. Reached on his cellphone, he hung up without commenting.Doctors here point to their own statistics: only four doctors per 10,000 residents of Lom\u00e9, when the international standard calls for 20; five often broken CT scanners for a city of 837,000; one nurse for every 13 beds at the central hospital, when experts recommend a ratio of one to four.The government spends $16 per capita on primary health care, among the lowest in the world, according to research backed by the Gates Foundation.A French-trained neurosurgeon at the central hospital said he recently had to perform brain surgery on a motorcycle accident victim with no electricity, using his cellphone for light. By the time the power returned, the man was in a coma and has yet to regain consciousness.The central hospital is known around Lom\u00e9 as \u201cthe Morgue,\u201d as locals say you\u2019re more likely to come out dead than alive. Patients are routinely forced to pay out of pocket for basic supplies, even in emergency situations, before they can receive treatment.\u201cIn the emergency room, if you don\u2019t pay, you die,\u201d said Dr. Atchi Walla, a surgeon there.Medical ethicists, in part, judge the permissibility of a health care strike on the probable outcome, said Professor Cohen. If the strikes are unlikely to lead to improvements, they may not be worth the risk to patients.And so far, the strikers in Togo do not have much to show for their efforts in terms of government action. But the doctors and nurses have not indicated they plan to stop, and that is fine with some of their supporters.Ms. Nabourema, the opposition activist, said her father, who has high blood pressure, was among those discharged prematurely from the hospital in March because of the strikes.Still, she said, the strikes \u201care the right thing to do,\u201d even if they are more likely to incite the government to escalate its reprisals than extract concessions.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way for them to ask for anything,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Most Responsible for Global Warming?", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:This week, we\u2019re previewing Scott Pruitt\u2019s testimony, answering your climate questions and updating you on current events. (That last one is a bad pun \u2014 you\u2019ll see why.)It might not rise to the level of James Comey\u2019s testimony before the Senate last year, or even Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill this month, but when Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, appears before two congressional committees on Thursday it is certain to be worth watching.Environmental groups have already planned morning protests ahead of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s testimony, while Senate Democrats intend to hold a news conference demanding \u201cethics accountability\u201d from the administrator.Today\u2019s highly industrialized economies \u2014 the United States and Europe \u2014 got a big head start on burning fossil fuels. But China and other developing nations have ramped up output in recent years. In total, the United States pumped more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other nation between 1850 and 2014, the latest year for which the center\u2019s data is available. The European Union, including Britain, was the second-largest source of fossil-fuel emissions over that period; China came in third.But China is today\u2019s biggest emitter, by a mile.The rapidly industrializing country overtook the United States as the world\u2019s biggest source of carbon emissions in the mid-2000s, and has doubled its output since then. In 2014, China released 10.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and industry; the United States released more than 5.2 billion metric tons that year.China\u2019s emissions per person are still much lower than the United States\u2019.China may emit twice as much carbon dioxide as the United States today, but the country is home to four times as many people (about 1.4 billion compared to 328 million). Divvying up national emissions by population gives us a different view of \u201cresponsibility.\u201dSmall countries with fossil-fuel-intensive economies, like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, tend to top the per capita emissions list. But among more populous nations, the United States, Canada and Australia rank highest.In 2014, the average American was responsible for more than twice as much carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere (16.2 metric tons per person) as the average Chinese citizen (7.5 metric tons); two and a half times as much as the average Briton (6.5 metric tons); and 10 times as much as the average Indian (1.7 metric tons).The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, a conveyor belt of ocean currents that move warm, salty surface waters northward and colder, deeper water southward, is in the news again.The science, if not the movie, was widely panned. But researchers who study ancient climates know that the currents (which include the Gulf Stream) have collapsed in the past. Because the AMOC serves to transfer heat from the tropics into the North Atlantic, where it warms the atmosphere, when it collapses the Northern Hemisphere can cool relatively rapidly. That in turn can affect patterns of precipitation and atmospheric circulation around the world (but nothing like what was portrayed in the film).But that\u2019s ancient history, and those collapses occurred when sea levels were much lower than they are today. What\u2019s happening with the AMOC now?Climate models have suggested that as the world warms the AMOC should weaken somewhat, because warmer water is more buoyant and because more precipitation, coupled with melting of the Greenland ice sheet, should reduce the salinity of the surface waters.\u201cBut nobody really knows if that instability will occur in the future as it did in the past,\u201d said Summer K. Praetorius, a paleoclimatologist with the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.Direct measurements of current flow taken since the mid-2000s do, in fact, show some weakening. (And because that has led to some cooling, \u201cit\u2019s not all bad,\u201d Dr. Praetorius said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably been dampening global warming over the last few decades in some sense.\u201d)But is the weakening a result of climate change, or is it a reflection of natural variability unaffected by warming?What about the future? An abrupt collapse of the AMOC this century could result in several feet of additional sea level rise and changes in hurricane activity, among other effects. \u201cIf it would completely collapse in 10 years you would see an enormous signal that would completely overpower at least for 20 years anything related to global warming,\u201d said Sybren Drijfhout, a professor of climate dynamics at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.While the models generally agree that there will be a weakening of the AMOC, they also don\u2019t expect a complete collapse. \u201cIt definitely doesn\u2019t say yes, we\u2019re on the verge of an imminent collapse,\u201d Dr. Praetorius said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t think that\u2019s an option anytime soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Wants to Close Trade Gap, but Leaves Export Agency in Limbo", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "The Export-Import Bank has been effectively crippled, and big business groups are angry that the board of the bank has been left completely vacant.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As trade tensions mount, an 84-year-old Washington institution could have been a powerful tool for President Trump. The institution, the Export-Import Bank, was created to help American companies compete overseas and bolster exports by providing cheap government-backed loans.But the institution, which once financed multibillion-dollar projects, has been effectively crippled by the Trump administration. The bank has been without a chairman since Mr. Trump took office and the last of the bank\u2019s five board members quit in March. Since 2015, it has not had the quorum of at least three members it needs to finance deals or projects worth more than $10 million.The effective shuttering of the bank has put American manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric at a global disadvantage, prompting a frenzied lobbying campaign by business groups worried that the White House is undermining its own trade goals.\u201cThe Export-Import Bank plays a vital role in supporting American companies as they work to sell their products to customers across the world,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cBut as long as the seats remain vacant, U.S. businesses are at a disadvantage relative to global competitors.\u201dIn the past, the bank had been used by large corporations like Boeing and General Electric, which received loan guarantees to sell products like airplanes, satellites and industrial equipment to developing countries, lifting sales and supporting American jobs. It has provided loan guarantees to overseas airlines looking to buy American-made jets and helped organizations like the Environmental Chemical Corporation build water facilities in Africa.Proponents of the bank, including some lawmakers, argue the institution could be a powerful weapon for a president who wants to increase domestic manufacturing and narrow the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports overseas.Ex-Im provides the kind of government subsidies that other nations regularly use to help domestic companies compete abroad. Mr. Trump regularly blames those subsidies for a flood of cheap imports, saying they exacerbate the United States trade imbalance.To business groups, manufacturers and veterans of the bank, Mr. Trump appears to be undermining his own trade aspirations by leaving Ex-Im in the lurch.\u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s really being well served,\u201d said Fred P. Hochberg, the most recent chairman of the bank, who departed in 2017. \u201cIf you want to be able to reduce trade deficits and you want to be able to export more, particularly capital goods, that\u2019s what an Export-Import Bank does.\u201dIn recent years, the bank has been barely functional. According to its most recent annual report, Ex-Im authorized just $3.4 billion of mostly short-term export credit in 2017. That is down from the $20 billion that it authorized in 2014, the last year that the bank was fully operational. The report points out that China provided $34 billion in medium- and long-term financing for its exports in 2016, underscoring the competitive disadvantage that the United States faces.The bank\u2019s crippling has been costly for both companies and their workers, including Boeing, which Mr. Trump has hailed as an emblem of American innovation. In the last two years, two deals involving the sale of its commercial satellites have been canceled and one was significantly delayed given the lack of a quorum at Ex-Im. The stalling of these deals alone has cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cRestoring the Export-Import Bank to full strength is the single best thing Washington can do right now to build on the economic momentum of tax reform, shrink our trade deficits and level the playing field so American workers can win,\u201d said Tim Keating, Boeing\u2019s executive vice president for government operations.\u201cCountries in Europe and beyond have been luring U.S. manufacturers to set up shop overseas to take advantage of foreign export financing because the U.S. system is effectively broken,\u201d Mr. Timmons said. \u201cManufacturers in the United States have lost billions of dollars in deals, and tens of thousands of American workers have lost opportunities for well-paying jobs supported by the exports that the Ex-Im Bank could have helped secure.\u201dAt a congressional hearing last week, Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, pressed Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, about the fate of the bank and argued that not using its financing amounted to a lost opportunity. He suggested that some in the Trump administration wanted the bank to collapse.\u201cThe president says he wants to see the trade deficit shrink, here\u2019s a way we can do it,\u201d Mr. Dent said.In an interview after the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin would not say when the president would nominate a new leader for the bank, or whether some of his colleagues were rooting for its demise, but he insisted that Mr. Trump supported keeping the bank alive.\u201cThe president does want it to function,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\u201cSo instinctively you would say it\u2019s a ridiculous thing, but actually it\u2019s a very good thing and it actually makes money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it actually could make a lot of money.\u201dBut the White House has done little to advance its nominees and politics continue to be an obstacle. Conservatives have traditionally disliked the bank because they argue that it amounts to corporate welfare and rewards rich corporations that do not need taxpayer assistance.\u201cThey distort markets, impose risk on taxpayers and they\u2019re bad policy for everybody,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of Ex-Im and favors private financing alternatives.Mr. Toomey has used procedural tactics to delay the nomination of the remaining nominees to the bank\u2019s board. He said he wanted Mr. Trump to pick a \u201creformer\u201d like Mr. Garrett, who does not believe in the current mission of the bank. And he said he hoped that the president would urge other countries to unwind their export financing banks as part of his trade negotiations.Democrats who support the bank are growing increasingly impatient.\u201cOne of the best things we can do to help the economy support jobs is to get Ex-Im fully functioning as soon as possible,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and \u201cthe full Senate should immediately confirm the bipartisan nominees so we can continue to support American businesses, manufacturing and jobs.\u201dAction does not appear to be forthcoming. An aide to Mr. McConnell said that votes on Mr. Trump\u2019s other nominees would not be held until he names a new chairman.For now, Ex-Im is ambling along. Veterans of the bank say that career employees are increasingly heading for the exits.

The 1996 law gives Congress the power to nullify rules formulated by government agencies but has primarily been used to void recently enacted rules.Republicans have long derided the consumer bureau, created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, for exceeding its authority, and President Trump\u2019s pick to lead the agency on an interim basis, Mick Mulvaney, has largely frozen its rule-making and enforcement.Democrats and consumer watchdogs criticized the move and warned that Republicans were making broader use of the Congressional Review Act to advance their deregulatory agenda.\u201cBy voting to roll back the CFPB\u2019s work, senators have emboldened banks and finance companies to engage in racial discrimination by charging millions of people of color more for a car loan than is justified,\u201d said Rion Dennis of Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group. \u201cLawmakers have also opened the door to challenging longstanding agency actions that are crucial to protecting workers, consumers, civil rights, the environment and the economy.\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, warned that rescinding the guidance would lead to a flood of unfair, predatory lending.\u201cThis truly repugnant resolution ignores the unacceptable, undeniable truth that consumers\u2019 interest rates are regularly marked up based on their race or ethnicity \u2014 a disgusting practice that continues to run rampant across the country,\u201d he said.The Department of Justice can still bring lawsuits against auto lenders for discriminatory practices, even if the guidance is nullified. However, legal experts say the government could be less successful in bringing such cases without the guidance from a government agency saying the practices are viewed as improper.The settlements rankled Republicans who argued that the consumer bureau was using \u201cjunk science\u201d to make the case that auto lenders were discriminating against customers on the basis of race.But business groups and Republicans cheered the move, saying it would ease lending restrictions for car purchases.\u201cThe legislation is a measured response to the CFPB\u2019s attempt to regulate the $1.1 trillion auto financing market, avoid congressional scrutiny by issuing \u2018guidance,\u2019 and impose a new policy without necessary procedural safeguards,\u201d said Peter Welch, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association.Mr. Toomey hailed the rollback of the auto-lending restrictions as the repeal of an \u201cill-conceived regulation\u201d and a sign that Congress was ready to reassert control over government agencies that have exceeded their authority.\u201cAny guidance, in fact any rule-making, ultimately, should be subject to congressional review,\u201d Mr. Toomey said.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the auto lending restrictions epitomized the consumer bureau\u2019s rogue approach under its previous leadership. He said that the bureau had abused and exceeded its legal authority in trying to prevent discrimination in auto lending.\u201cI look forward to finally repealing this harmful and flawed bulletin very soon,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Seeks Quick Nafta Deal, but Allies Balk as It Gives Little Ground", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is pushing to reach a deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement by the beginning of May. But the timeline could be complicated by its refusal to budge from contentious proposals aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the United States.The administration has not significantly softened its position on rules that automakers would need to meet to qualify for zero tariffs under Nafta, according to a summary of the American proposal reviewed by The New York Times. While the administration has removed a requirement about the percentage of a car that must be made in the United States, it has added other rules that North American automakers say could be costly and complicated to meet.Some in the administration had been pushing for an announcement to coincide with the president\u2019s trip to Peru this weekend to attend the Summit of the Americas, where President Trump was expected to appear alongside leaders from Canada and Mexico.On Monday, the president said the United States was \u201cfairly close\u201d on a Nafta deal, but he also reiterated his threat to withdraw from the pact if a new agreement is not reached.The administration\u2019s desire to quickly resolve Nafta could give Canada and Mexico more leverage. Trade experts say a Nafta deal seems more likely than it has in months, since the United States sees new urgency to conclude talks and is at least offering different proposals. But the United States does not appear to be ceding much ground. Larger concessions will need to be made to reach a deal, observers say \u2014 and those could come in the final moments.Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a former Mexican diplomat in the United States, said he believed a deal would be possible in the coming weeks if negotiators were prepared to compromise. However, he said, \u201cI think the biggest threat to Nafta is the United States overplaying its hand and not being flexible enough.\u201dThe Nafta provision regarding automobiles has been among the most contentious, given Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on the car industry and its importance to all three nations\u2019 economies.American negotiators have dropped an earlier demand that half of the value of an automobile be made solely in the United States to qualify for Nafta\u2019s zero tariffs. Instead, they are asking for an unspecified percentage of each vehicle to be made by workers earning at least an average wage rate for the North American industry, to be recalculated each year. According to preliminary calculations, that wage could be approximately $16 to $17 an hour.However, other parts of the proposal are unchanged, or add layers of rules. In keeping with its earlier proposal, the United States is asking for 85 percent of the value of a car to be made in North America to qualify for Nafta\u2019s benefits, up from 62.5 percent under the current Nafta deal. But it has set up a complex tiered system for other auto parts, for example requiring 85 percent of engines and advanced batteries to be made in North America, as well as 70 percent of monitors, wiring sets and autonomous vehicles parts, and 50 percent of brake pads and spark plugs.It also requires 70 percent of certain auto parts made of steel and aluminum to be made in North America \u2014 a further boon to the American steel and aluminum industry, which the Trump administration has sought to protect.These auto rules may be subject to a periodic review, for example every five years. Car companies would have three years to work on redesigning their supply chains before the rules went into effect.Mexico has countered with an offer to raise the overall requirement for North American content in Nafta cars to 70 percent, up from 62.5 percent currently, people close to the talks said. It has also agreed to accept a proposal by Canada to add in the value of research and development when calculating how much of a car is produced in North America. But Mexico continues to reject the other provisions in the American proposal on automobiles, and insists that the industry be given seven years to transition to the new rules, rather than three.Auto parts makers, which would likely see their sales rise as a result of the new rules, seemed more amenable to the proposal. But some auto manufacturer representatives said the new proposals were as \u201cequally unworkable\u201d as the original ones. They said the tiered system was excessively complicated and could drive up administrative costs as companies try to comply with the rules.Many valuable car components \u2014 electronic systems, for example \u2014 are largely made in Asia, and rebuilding a manufacturing base for these parts in North America in just three years would be no simple matter.Since the United States levies only a 2.5 percent tariff on cars imported into the country, tougher Nafta rules might just push companies to automate their production facilities or make cars elsewhere, critics say. At a certain point, companies may find it cheaper to manufacture cars in China or Southeast Asia, and import them into the United States instead.The United States also appears to be largely standing firm on other contentious issues, including rules for government purchases, methods of settling trade disputes and a provision under which Nafta would automatically expire every five years, unless the countries voted to reapprove it.The Trump administration has said those changes are necessary to revive American manufacturing and undo incentives that encourage companies to move their factories to low-cost countries like China and Mexico. Company representatives counter that the use of global supply chains has now become the norm in many industries, and without the ability to source products from around the world, American companies would simply not be able to compete.Advertisement"}

Monique Heart, who lent The Vixen the wig that completed her \u201cBest Drag\u201d look, was, like many of our nation\u2019s citizens, tired of simply being safe, and wailed that she was not winning enough.The queens were then contracted to the maxi-challenge: to write and perform commercials for dating apps geared toward \u201clonely, underserved consumers.\u201d These included \u201cEnd of Days,\u201d for doomsday preppers; \u201cMadam Buttrface,\u201d for those looking only for a hot body; and \u201cFibstr,\u201d for pathological liars \u2014 all of which I would love to see Kickstartered, so as to prevent those of us swiping our way through extant apps from wasting any more time unwittingly serving these consumers.Monique, the Team Fibstr captain, went about setting the limits of their scene, and when the muscle queen Kameron Michaels auctioned off her role, Mayhem Miller was asked to switch, and she quietly assented. Later, as Mayhem was beating her face, Monique asked her, \u201cCan you do something strong and dominatrix-like?\u201d to which she submissively replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Her bit was muddled, and when asked how she wanted her scene partner to react to her, her breath was controlled and she went mute. For a dominatrix, she did not have a very tight grip on her gag.The gorgeous Asia O\u2019Hara, made down to resemble \u201cLucy, the missing link,\u201d proved to be the found link of the challenge.

Vanjie!Despite the presence of the conflama addict The Vixen and the oratory addict Eureka, the sweet-faced Blair softly guided Team End of Days through a very funny, freewheeling bit \u2014 Eureka purse-slapped Miz Cracker, for which the latter offered retroactive consent: \u201cDrag is a contact sport!\u201d She really is great.The Vixen was cast in the role of a street doomsayer, wearing a sandwich board bearing the prophecy, \u201cThe End Is Near.\u201d (Here\u2019s hoping that this also prophesies the fate of her stint on this show.) She crabbed that Eureka\u2019s charismatic scene theft was somehow rigged, and yet, had she spent less time rolling her admittedly lovely eyes and just a few minutes making a distinctive choice and committing to it, she could have chewed that sandwich board and made a meal of her character.Back in the workroom, Blair popped the cork on a bottle of sparkling kiki and opened up about how much she missed her mother, and how close they are, despite her family\u2019s strong religious beliefs. The Vixen\u2019s attempt to derail the story by picking a fight with Aquaria about a borrowed wig (it should be mentioned that, for a millennial, Aquaria seems surprisingly resistant to the sharing economy) was blessedly concluded by a Deus ex arachnia (A spider was discovered crawling on a dress, sending into a squealing fever all of the queens save for the strapping Kameron, who calmly captured it and, hopefully, released it outdoors, far from where it could hear any more fighting.)The heretofore under-heralded Dusty Ray Bottoms snatched the open kiki bottle and poured out the heartbreaking tale of her ostracism from her religious family. They were so hidebound that, after sucker punching her into coming out, they subjected her to an exorcism, claimed that she was \u201cpossessed by a gay demon\u201d and sent her to conversion therapy, where she was told that \u201cin a homosexual relationship, you\u2019ll never find success, you\u2019ll never find love.\u201dIn the kind of moment that is the apogee of this show, she wept and recounted that she then stopped the \u201ctherapist,\u201d packed her car and drove off to a \u201cbeautiful life,\u201d a hot fianc\u00e9e (a photo confirmed this as hard fact), and the revelation that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have to compromise or change for someone\u2019s small-minded view.\u201d She then blew what was left of our minds by saying, \u201cI still believe in God, because I cried out, and I was heard.\u201d Thank you, Dusty, for reminding us that sometimes, you have to get away from Jesus in order to truly come to Jesus.Monique offered a moving coda, saying, \u201cHearing everyone\u2019s story is truly helping me see the truth of who they are. We come here with big makeup, big hair, and it\u2019s easy to live behind a character. So, it\u2019s so great to see vulnerability.\u201d I raise my glass of sparkling kiki to that.The Vixen, smelling blood in the bubbles, savaged the moment by dusting the cobweb off the Aquaria fight, barking, \u201cThe problem with Aquaria is, she likes to poke the bear and run. This bear will chase you.\u201d Under this bear\u2019s pointless pursuit, Aquaria exited the workroom, and the others chided The Vixen for her constant combativeness.\u201cYou knew I was a pit bull!\u201d she retorted. This demon just cannot stop vomiting soup \u2014 Dusty, do you still have that exorcist\u2019s number?Ru ushered in the runway challenge, titled simply, \u201cFeathers,\u201d which released a flock of toothless avian puns from the judges that largely did not fly.The guest judge Nico Tortorella, who is living proof that a polyamorous pansexual relationship can also bring you success and love, presided, along with Courtney Love, who is living proof that the end of a love relationship can bring you success.Standouts included Aquaria as a wounded bird pierced by two arrows (presumably slung by the outrageously fortunate The Vixen), and Asia O\u2019Hara, in a daring Tweety Bird raiment, who, owing to her equally brave and unique performance in the maxi-challenge, was deservedly named this week\u2019s winner.The bottom two: Yuhua, whose look called to mind an ill-advised remake of the \u201cBirds\u201d featuring Carrie Bradshaw \u2014 on second thought, that is a \u201cSex and the City 3\u201d concept that I would actually watch \u2014 and the spiritually hogtied Mayhem Miller.Mayhem was flogged for her failure to take control of her scene, and for her lack of discipline in her exchanges with those in power. She was ordered to throw off her restraints, push herself to her edge and assume the dominant role in her own Ru-demptive arc.(My kindred sister Mayhem: I strongly recommend that you fully inhabit this role, as it really does help a late-blooming lady to discover, articulate and demand the reaction she wants from a partner.)Mayhem finally found her inner mistress and dominated the lip sync, to Hole\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Skin.\u201d By the end she was ripping madly at her feathered collar, a caged bird wanting to break free. The molting, jolting Yuhua was cropped from the competition, and sent back down to the dungeon to pack her toys.Hope is the queen without feathers. Our dreamgirl Mayhem is changing.

{"Headline": "Kosovo\u2019s War Ended, but the Shooting Didn\u2019t. A Court Promises Justice.", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRUD, Kosovo \u2014 Fetah Rudi, a former schoolteacher and political activist, has been using a wheelchair for 17 years, ever since unidentified gunmen unloaded 14 bullets into his stomach and shoulder in a drive-by shooting near his small village in central Kosovo.He has watched in dismay over the years as the United Nations and then the European Union \u2014 which have both tried to establish the rule of law in this tiny Balkan nation since it broke free from Serbia in 1999 \u2014 failed to deliver justice for a wave of violence that followed Serbia\u2019s retreat.The new court, based in The Hague but governed by Kosovo law, will focus on judging not Serbian atrocities during the 1998-99 war but crimes committed during and after the conflict by the Kosovo Liberation Army, or K.L.A., an ethnic Albanian guerrilla force whose former commanders now run the country.The court, Mr. Rudi said, is \u201cthe last chance to finally make our people free.\u201dIn the nearly two decades since it split from Serbia, Kosovo has been governed as a United Nations protectorate and, since February 2008, as an independent state. Throughout that time, it has been dogged by demons left from its violent birth and a culture of impunity left by its failure to come to terms with the fact that some of Kosovo\u2019s most powerful figures have been accused of major crimes.The special court, which is expected to issue its first indictments soon, is supported by the United States and Europe, Kosovo\u2019s main backers and funders. But it poses risks for them, too, as it will examine crimes directly related to the foundation of the West\u2019s state-building project in Kosovo: its alliance with the K.L.A. during NATO\u2019s bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999; its failure to disarm the K.L.A. after the war ended; and its inability to protect not only ethnic Serb residents who stayed behind, but also the K.L.A\u2019s ethnic Albanian political rivals.In a sign that United States support for the court is perhaps flagging under President Trump, the American chief prosecutor, David Schwendiman, stepped down recently after the State Department declined to extend his appointment by two years to enable him to complete his term with the court, despite assurances during the Obama administration that he would be able to do so.Both attacks occurred despite the presence of more than 45,000 NATO troops in Kosovo, a force that, wary of confronting the K.L.A., did little to halt post-conflict score settling.Both Mr. Rudi and Mr. Mustafa were outspoken supporters of the Democratic League of Kosovo, an originally pacifist group led by Ibrahim Rugova that shared the K.L.A.\u2019s desire to end Serbian oppression but, once the Serbs left, challenged the self-declared right of the group\u2019s fighters to run Kosovo as their own fief.The expectation of imminent indictments has delighted Mr. Rudi, who was held in a secret K.L.A. prison and violently beaten toward the end of the war and, after the conflict ended, was targeted for assassination by what he suspected was a K.L.A. hit squad. He said he would leave Kosovo and move to Western Europe with his wife and four children if the court flubbed its mission.In an interview on the eve of a visit to Washington in February to attend a prayer breakfast with President Trump, President Hashim Thaci \u2014 the K.L.A.\u2019s political commissar during the war, when he was known to his comrades as \u201cthe snake\u201d \u2014 denounced the special court as a \u201chistoric injustice\u201d but pledged to let it proceed.\u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d he said, insisting that the K.L.A. as an organization never imprisoned or murdered its ethnic Albanian rivals, massacred Serbian civilians or committed other war crimes, despite the persistent allegations that prompted the establishment of the special court.Mr. Thaci (pronounced THAH-chee) conceded that some \u201cindividuals\u201d in the K.L.A. had taken the law into their own hands, and he said he wanted to see their crimes punished. At the same time, he complained that \u201cyou can\u2019t put an equal sign between the crimes of the Serbs and those of the K.L.A.\u201dFew if any Kosovars would dispute that but, with Serbian forces long gone, many are asking why so few of the hopes raised by the K.L.A.\u2019s NATO-enabled victory in 1999 have been fulfilled \u2014 why nearly 60 percent of young people are unemployed, why corrupt politicians, many of them former K.L.A. fighters, can ransack the economy with impunity, and why witnesses in criminal cases against senior K.L.A. figures keep disappearing or refusing to testify.\u201cWe thought it would be completely different,\u201d said Mr. Rudi, the former teacher. \u201cWe thought we would have a functioning country with laws, institutions, security and a developed economy. We never thought there would be all this killing and stealing.\u201dBeriane Mustafa, the daughter of the murdered journalist, said she did not know who killed her father, \u201cbut I do know it was a political murder, probably by political opponents.\u201d Mr. Mustafa\u2019s murder and the attack on Mr. Rudi followed the defeat of the K.L.A., which had been reconfigured as a political party, in local elections in early October 2000.The timing, Ms. Mustafa said, suggested \u201ca kind of revenge\u201d by fighters who, furious at being denied the political support they thought they deserved, calculated that \u201cif we kill these people we will come to power.\u201dBy 2007, the K.L.A.\u2019s political party was the country\u2019s dominant political force. Mr. Thaci became prime minister in 2008, one month before Kosovo declared independence, and then president in 2016.The report had been commissioned after ghoulish allegations of organ trafficking by the K.L.A. appeared in a book published by Carla del Ponte, the former chief prosecutor at United Nations war crime tribunals in The Hague.The accusation of wartime organ theft has never been substantiated, but the issue continues to haunt Kosovo, fueled in part by the discovery in 2008 of an organ trafficking ring operating out of a medical center near the capital, Pristina. The man accused of leading the ring, an Israeli citizen, Moshe Harel, was arrested in January in Cyprus.Instead, he said, future indictments against former K.L.A. commanders should focus on their responsibility for \u201ca campaign of persecution\u201d directed at Serbs and other minority groups, as well as \u201ctoward fellow Kosovo Albanians whom they labeled either to be collaborators with the Serbs or, more commonly, to have simply been political opponents of the K.L.A. leadership.\u201dIn his interview in February, Mr. Thaci dismissed the Marty report as part of a Russian-orchestrated program of \u201cfake news,\u201d a farrago of lies and disinformation intended to undermine Western influence in the Balkans.Calling Kosovo \u201cthe most pro-American country in the world,\u201d he said that by blackening its name, Russia, a firm ally of Serbia, wanted to damage the United States. He produced no evidence that Russia had a hand in Mr. Marty\u2019s report.Whether the special court can get to the bottom of what happened nearly 20 years ago will depend to a large extent on whether witnesses will agree to testify and, if they do, whether they and their family members can survive.Ms. Mustafa, the daughter of the murdered journalist, said she was \u201cnot optimistic\u201d about the court\u2019s ability to succeed where the United Nations and European Union had failed, but added, \u201cIf you want to consider yourself a real state, a serious state, you have to deal with all crimes, no matter who committed them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trade War Could Leave Investors With Few Places to Hide", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe long calm in the stock market has been broken by confirmation that the Federal Reserve intends to combat inflation aggressively and by signs of a trade war that could threaten global economic integration and the prosperity it has helped engender.What happens from here may hinge on the speed and severity of Fed interest rate increases and the speed and severity with which the United States and China impose tariffs on each other\u2019s goods.At their most extreme, investment advisers warn, each factor could subdue growth, and protectionist policies could do much worse. Until signs emerge that economic damage will be limited, they say, stocks could remain under pressure.\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a more toxic issue than we\u2019ve had to deal with in this bull market,\u201d said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential for causing a global recession, and that\u2019s something investors are worrying about.\u201dThey seemed not to have a care in the world as 2018 began. Stocks recorded a string of record highs as Wall Street contemplated the benefits from reduced corporate and personal income tax rates that had just been enacted. But Treasury bond yields rose steadily through January as indicators of economic strength, particularly the persistently low unemployment rate, raised the prospect of rising inflation.Around the same time, President Trump began to impose tariffs intended to protect American industries from foreign competition. Solar panels and washing machines were his first targets. Then came steel and aluminum.Tariffs may or may not help the targeted industries, which in these cases are not significant segments of the economy, anyway, and the taxes are almost universally viewed as harmful to consumers, who have to pay more for the affected goods. And then there\u2019s the impact of tariffs imposed by foreign governments in retaliation, which came swiftly from China, the main target of the trade war that Mr. Trump has threatened to wage.The potential impact of the back-and-forth trade moves, and the ones that yet may come, helped send stocks on one of the swiftest plunges on record starting in late January \u2014 11.8 percent in less than 10 trading days for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.That was followed by a rally that recouped most of the loss, and then another decline that took the index close to a fresh low, leaving it down 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year, the first quarterly decline since 2015. The early days of April have been rocky as well.If a trade war really has begun, some household names in corporate America could become casualties, Andy Rothman, an investment strategist at Matthews Asia, warned.\u201cThere are already a lot of U.S. companies doing really well in China,\u201d he said. \u201cG.M. sells more cars in China than in the U.S., Boeing sells more planes in China than in any other market, and Apple derives 20 percent of its revenues in China. Those are big listed names.\u201dThe impact would go beyond sales in China, he added. American companies that obtain parts and supplies there could see that conduit disrupted.As for the Chinese economy and stock market, Mr. Rothman said, they are mostly immune.\u201cVery few listed Chinese companies export stuff to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if Trump disrupts U.S.-China trade, the impact should be negligible.\u201dA trade war, therefore, \u201cwill hurt us more than them,\u201d he said. That\u2019s why he expects the president\u2019s protectionist tendencies to be reined in.\u201cThe odds of a full-blown trade war are extremely low,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. Not only is the Chinese leadership eager to avoid one, but \u201cTrump must be coming under a lot of pressure not to do this for the damage it will do to the U.S. equity market.\u201dTobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, also foresees limited damage to the economy and stocks from an unraveling in trade relations. He pointed to the exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs offered to big trading partners like Canada and Mexico, and he expressed hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s words and actions merely reflected his penchant for eccentric deal making.\u201cTrump has a unique negotiating style,\u201d Mr. Levkovich said. But \u201cif he takes it further, it could be a problem and hurt growth in a more meaningful way.\u201d As for the impact of the president\u2019s tactics on investments, he added, \u201cit doesn\u2019t help.\u201dMr. Yardeni said he thought a trade war could be forestalled, although the mere prospect of one could depress the stock market. He agreed that \u201cthis could be Trump\u2019s art of the deal \u2014 take an extreme negotiating position and wait for people on the other side to say, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about this.\u2019\u201dTighter monetary policy is a more run-of-the-mill concern. But investors should not underestimate the potential it has to harm their portfolios with valuations elevated across the board and inflation threatening to return.\u201cPrices across just about every asset class look high historically,\u201d said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation for the asset management firm GMO. \u201cWhat they all have in common is that when you squint, they make sense if you assume cash rates are going to stay low for some time. If inflation is up, then you need significantly tight monetary policy. That\u2019s bad for bonds and also stocks.\u201dMr. Inker is concerned about a trade war, like many other investors, but he emphasizes the risk of higher prices on goods \u2014 inflation \u2014 that it might cause.\u201cThe nightmare scenario is a general rise of economic nationalism and the mercantilist view that trade has winners and losers,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you get a retreat from globalization, which has helped the economy grow without experiencing significant inflation.\u201dWhen stocks fall, so usually do yields on high-quality bonds, sending prices higher in a so-called flight to safety. But one ominous development during the first leg of the decline in stocks, from Jan. 26 to Feb. 8, was that the yield on 10-year Treasury securities rose to 2.85 percent from 2.66 percent. Yields were steady during the second wave of selling in stocks, but they rose overall during the first quarter, to 2.74 percent from 2.4 percent.That means that bond prices, as well as stock prices, fell.Terri Spath, chief investment officer of Sierra Investment Management, warned in a note to clients that the traditional balanced portfolio, split 60/40 between stocks and bonds, might not provide the protection through diversification that it used to if the bond bull market that began in the early 1980s is over, as she believes.\u201cTightening Fed policy, inflation, rapidly growing deficits and their impact on rates can sometimes move bond prices violently,\u201d Ms. Spath wrote. \u201cJuly 2016 marked the lowest level in rates I will likely see in my lifetime,\u201d with the 10-year Treasury yield reaching 1.33 percent. \u201cIf interest rates continue the climb up from that level, traditional bonds and the 60/40 will continue to die, as foreshadowed during the first correction of 2018.\u201dMs. Spath is not alone in disdaining bonds. The latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of global fund managers, released in late March, showed bonds to be the second-least-favorite of 22 asset classes \u2014 behind only British stocks \u2014 relative to how managers have rated them throughout the survey\u2019s 17-year history.Bond funds and domestic and international stock funds all fell in the first quarter, though not by that much. The average taxable bond fund declined 0.5 percent, according to Morningstar, led lower by portfolios specializing in longer-term issues.The average domestic stock fund fell 0.4 percent, with consumer defensive and natural resources groups faring worse than most and technology being one of the few clear winners, up 6 percent. International funds declined 0.3 percent, although specialists in China and Latin America recorded gains.With interest rates rising, stock market valuations still high and protectionist impulses threatening to ignite a full-blown trade war, advisers encourage investors to indulge protectionist impulses of a different sort when it comes to their portfolios. They recommend keeping less money in stocks or being more selective about the ones investors own.\u201cYou\u2019re better off investing pretty much anywhere other than the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Inker said about stocks, although he prefers Treasury bonds to foreign bonds.The only type of investment he recommends outright, rather than in comparison to others that he deems even worse, is \u201cthe cheap half of emerging\u201d markets, in particular technology stocks in places like Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia.\u201cOther than emerging market value, we don\u2019t see assets that deserve to go up a lot,\u201d he said.Citi\u2019s analysts prefer emerging markets and Europe, where stocks are cheaper and central banks are doing more to prop up the markets. Mr. Levkovich counters that stocks are cheaper abroad for good reasons: American businesses have higher returns on equity, and American benchmark stock indexes are heavier in technology and lighter in the financial industry.Mr. Levkovich recommended that investors prune their portfolios to enhance return prospects. In particular, he would be cautious on tech and usually defensive areas like utilities, consumer staples and telecoms, and emphasize traditional industrial companies and the materials industry, including chemical producers.Mr. Yardeni remains optimistic about stocks, but he\u2019s in no hurry to buy.\u201cYou have to recognize that if you\u2019re thinking of buying stocks, you\u2019re not exactly getting in early,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have a shakeout here until we get clarity on protectionism.\u201dHis advice is to be patient in the likelihood that stocks can be bought at lower prices. When the time feels right, he said, he would look at exporters and other companies that would be on the front lines in a trade war, which he expects to be averted.\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to find some good opportunities in blue-chip stocks with exposure to tariff issues,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. But for now, he cautioned, risks in the market have risen.\u201cThis probably will turn out to be a panic attack, like before,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it has the potential to be a more serious correction than we\u2019ve had in some time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blockchain Will Be Theirs, Russian Spy Boasted at Conference", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last year, representatives of 25 countries met in Tokyo to work on setting international standards for the blockchain, the technology that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin and has ignited intense interest in corporate and government circles.Some of the technologists at the meeting of the International Standards Organization were surprised when they learned that the head of the Russian delegation, Grigory Marshalko, worked for the F.S.B., the intelligence agency that is the successor to the K.G.B.They were even more surprised when they asked the F.S.B. agent why the Russians were devoting such resources to the blockchain standards.\u201cLook, the internet belongs to the Americans \u2014 but blockchain will belong to us,\u201d he said, according to one delegate who was there. The Russian added that two other members of his country\u2019s four-person delegation to the conference also worked for the F.S.B.Another delegate who had a separate conversation with the head of the Russian group remembers a slightly different wording: \u201cThe internet belonged to America. The blockchain will belong to the Russians.\u201dBoth of the delegates who recounted their conversations did so on the condition of anonymity, because discussions at the International Standards Organization, or I.S.O., are supposed to be confidential. Neither the Russian organizations overseeing the delegation to the I.S.O. nor the Russian delegates responded to requests for comment.The sentiment expressed by the Russian delegate is as clear a sign as any of the significance that some governments are assigning to the blockchain \u2014 a technology that is now being applied to things as varied as financial trading and voting \u2014 and the degree to which it is becoming a subject of geopolitical battles.The Russian interest in the normally wonky technical sessions has caused concern among other delegations, who worry that individual countries could push standards that would make the security of the blockchain technology vulnerable to surveillance and attack.The I.S.O., based in Geneva, was created in 1947 to ensure that important technologies are built or measured in the same way all over the world. Over the years, it has created standards for food safety, film sensitivity and much more.Russia is not the only country sending high-powered delegations to the I.S.O. technical committee focusing on blockchain standards, which got its start last year. The 25 countries with committee delegations sent over 130 people to the last meeting to discuss matters like a common method for security. China sent officials from the finance ministry while the United States had delegates from IBM and Microsoft, according to participants.\u201cIt is a very sought-out technology today, because it really does create the foundation for the future that is coming,\u201d said Gilbert Verdian, the head of the British delegation working on blockchain standards at the I.S.O. and the founder of the company Quant Network. \u201cTo get behind it and back it now is going to put people at an advantage, either politically or economically.\u201dThe original blockchain is the shared database on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. It is kept by a distributed network of computers managed by many people, rather than one central authority. While there are now many virtual currencies, each with its own blockchain, there are also many government and corporate efforts looking at ways to use blockchain technology to securely record other kinds of data.There are still significant questions about whether the technology will live up to expectations \u2014 and few projects have proceeded beyond the pilot stage aside from virtual currency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Within the young blockchain industry there is a widespread belief that the companies and countries that establish an early lead could guide the direction of the technology, for both commercial and national security purposes.Emma Channing, a lawyer who frequently works with blockchain start-ups, recently raised an alarm about the intrigue at the I.S.O. standards group.Ms. Channing said she was worried that countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity.\u201cIn the context of software it is the perfect Trojan,\u201d said Ms. Channing, a co-founder of the Satis Group, an American company that advises blockchain projects. \u201cIf something gets buried in it, these things will get adopted wholesale \u2014 and won\u2019t be questioned on the way in.\u201dMs. Channing recently emailed dozens of blockchain experts, trying to get them to volunteer as representatives to the I.S.O. delegations in their countries, so that the process does not become dominated by a few countries.The chairman of the I.S.O. blockchain committee, Craig Dunn, rejected the idea that any country could shape the process. While I.S.O. proceedings are generally confidential, new standards must go through many stages, with many rounds of voting \u2014 first with smaller working groups and then with full national delegations.\u201cThere has to be agreement and consensus across the member countries to take a standard forward,\u201d said Mr. Dunn, who is also the head of the Australian delegation to the committee.Another member of the Russian delegation, Alexey Urivskiy, told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti last year that the delegation at the I.S.O. committee was supposed to get Russian cryptographic algorithms into the standard. The Vedomosti article said that the head of the Russian I.S.O. delegation, Mr. Marshalko, was affiliated with the F.S.B.Russia is not the only country pushing hard on the blockchain. Many Chinese government offices have been public about their interest in taking advantage of the blockchain technology for tasks like tracking people and products moving through industrial supply chains.At the I.S.O. meetings last fall in Tokyo, the Chinese government sent one of the largest delegations, with at least nine people, including representatives from the finance ministry and the Chinese central bank, according to a delegate from another country who met the Chinese participants.The United States delegation was led at the last meeting by a Microsoft employee and included a delegate from IBM. Microsoft and IBM are two of the global companies that have pushed hardest to develop blockchain technology.At the first meeting of the I.S.O. blockchain group, the Russian delegation led a study group on security and privacy issues, which caused discomfort among some delegates from other countries, according to the two delegates who spoke to The New York Times. At a second meeting, oversight for these issues was transferred to a working group led by France.Mr. Verdian, the head of the British group, said lots of delegations were jockeying to get an edge on the new technology.\u201cIt will change how our society can operate, but at the same time, in harnessing this technology people might want to leverage that for their own gain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all owe it to each other to do it right so that it benefits all of us rather than a few.\u201dOleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Navigate the Complicated World of Credit Card Points", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal TravelerCredit card points are generally more valuable than points or miles attached to a specific airline or hotel group. The reason? Flexibility.There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, but investing in a credit card rewards program can land you pretty close to the mark. Credit card points are generally more valuable than points or miles attached to a specific airline or hotel group. The reason? Flexibility. With a trove of credit card points, you can get flights, hotel rooms or even cruises. While Capital One and Bank of America are coming into their own, the three major players in the travel rewards game are American Express, Chase and Citi. Here\u2019s a basic rundown of their current programs.How much points are worth is relative, but generally speaking, you should avoid redemption options that attach a value of less than a penny per point. That means while you certainly can redeem your points for Marriott or Walmart gift cards, you\u2019ll be getting fewer than .7 cents per point, which is not optimal.Many of the same principles as American Express apply to Chase: While you can redeem your points for things like gift cards or a statement credit (one cent per point) or purchases on Amazon (less than one cent per point), that\u2019s not your best value proposition. Sapphire Preferred cardholders can redeem points toward travel at a value of 1.25 cents per point; Sapphire Reserve cardholders fare even better, getting 1.5 cents out of each point, or a 50 percent bonus. That means a $600 flight will cost you only 40,000 points \u2014 not bad.Amassing value becomes even easier when you use multiple cards in tandem for everyday purchases, like a Sapphire Reserve card with a Chase Freedom or Freedom Unlimited card. The Chase Freedom earns quintuple points (up to $1,500) on rotating quarterly categories that can include department stores, PayPal, and gas stations. The next part is a little tricky: Freedom cards are technically cash back cards that earn points redeemable at a penny each. But those points become much more powerful when you transfer them to a Sapphire or Business Preferred card (which is done easily on the Chase website), as you can then redeem them for a bonus in the travel portal and transfer them to travel partners.This quarter (April through June), for example, those categories include grocery stores. That means $100 worth of groceries earns you 500 points, or five percent back on your spending. But those points can be transferred to your Sapphire Reserve and redeemed for travel at a 50 percent bonus, meaning it\u2019s an effective return rate of 7.5 percent. The Freedom Unlimited, which is uncapped and gives you a 1.5 percent return on all categories, can also transfer points to the Sapphire Reserve, earning that 50 percent bonus. This equates to a 2.25 percent return on all spending when you redeem for travel. As with American Express and Chase, I\u2019d generally recommend forgoing the use of points to pay for purchases, merchandise and gift cards. A couple of things to keep in mind: Some cards have high annual fees \u2014 Chase Sapphire Reserve is $450, American Express Platinum is $550 \u2014 that only are offset if you manage to collect the bonus. Always make sure you can hit the target spend amount before signing up. Most importantly, I don\u2019t recommend juggling a bunch of new credit cards to anyone who can\u2019t pay their balance in full every month. The point is to make money, not give it back to the banks.I\u2019m fastidious about avoiding interest and late fees, and don\u2019t feel guilty canceling high annual fee cards once I\u2019ve collected my bonus, thus I rarely hesitate to jump on a good sign-up offer. If the banks want to help pay for my next trip, at little or no cost to me, I\u2019m all for it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Canada, 2 Provinces Feud Over Pipeline: Will It Bring Jobs or Spills?", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 While much of the world may be focused on President Trump\u2019s threats of a trade war with China, Canada\u2019s attention right now is on a commercial feud within its own borders.The provinces of British Columbia and Alberta are locked in a battle over a $7.4 billion expansion of a pipeline that runs from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to a tanker port near Vancouver, a plan approved long ago.Many British Columbians fear that increased tanker traffic could lead to spills along a coastline that is a global tourist attraction. Alberta argues that the pipeline is vital to its energy industry and the entire Canadian economy.The rhetoric and threats from both provinces has often been intemperate, and the dispute has put Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a difficult situation, forced to choose sides in an argument that boils down to the economy on one hand and the environment on the other.The dispute has been festering for months. But the tension peaked when the pipeline\u2019s owner, Kinder Morgan of Houston, said last weekend that it is suspending all nonessential spending on the program.Given the intransigence of both sides, even Mr. Trudeau\u2019s top officials are downplaying the idea that the conversation will end the battle. But it may provide a glimpse of how Mr. Trudeau intends to grapple with an issue in which any resolution will inevitably alienate some voters, and on which there isn\u2019t a clear national consensus.\u201cCanadians are quite divided,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a nonprofit polling firm based in Vancouver. \u201cSo much of this debate is rural versus urban Canada.\u201dLike the Keystone XL pipeline to the Gulf Coast of the United States, which was quashed by President Barack Obama and revived by Mr. Trump, the expansion of the existing Kinder Morgan pipeline is the latest attempt by the oil sands industry to push more of its product out to market. The pipelines have not expanded at the same rate as output from the oil sands, leaving many producers relying on expensive rail shipments to get their product to the United States, which currently buys almost all of Canada\u2019s oil and gas exports.Tankers filled by the current Kinder Morgan pipeline now sail to refineries on the West Coast of the United States. The extra capacity from an expansion could, in theory, allow oil sands companies to also begin shipping to Asian markets where demand for oil is growing, said Andrew Leach, an energy and environmental economist at the University of Alberta.Ms. Notley, and her left-of-center New Democratic Party, surprised the Canadian political world in 2015 by bringing four and a half decades of Progressive Conservative rule to an end in Alberta. While she vowed in her campaign to take on the big oil interests in the province, politically she has no choice but to be a booster of the pipeline. Polls show that Albertans overwhelmingly want the expansion to go ahead.To defend the expansion, the premier has shown a willingness to get tough with her provincial neighbor to the west. Earlier this year, Ms. Notley briefly banned imports of wine from British Columbia.And unless the meeting Sunday changes her mind, Ms. Notley\u2019s government is expected to introduce legislation next week that will give it the ability to restrict oil and gas shipments to British Columbia, and so driving up prices in the province.\u201cIf the national interest is given over to the extremes on the left or the right, if the voices of the moderate majority of Canadians are forgotten, the reverberations of that will tear at the fabric of Confederation for many, many years to come,\u201d Ms. Notley said on Monday, referring to the power-sharing system that Canada adopted in 1867.This past week, Ms. Notley suggested that if Kinder Morgan decides not to go ahead with the expansion, the provincial government may buy and build the pipeline. Officials in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet have suggested that the federal government might support such a plan.For Mr. Horgan in British Columbia, the political calculus surrounding the pipeline expansion was more complex. The project is widely opposed in the areas around Vancouver and Victoria, the provincial capital, according to Ms. Kurl, the pollster. But support is strong for it elsewhere in the province, where resource industries are big employers.So Mr. Horgan plans to ask a court to determine if British Columbia can use local permits and provincial environmental laws to block the pipeline.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government has cited several decisions, including some from the Supreme Court, that it contends give Ottawa complete authority over interprovincial pipelines. But it appears that the federal government can do nothing to stop Mr. Horgan from going to court. Any judicial review could at least delay the project.The sparring between the two premiers may prove to be the least of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s worries in the pipeline fight, as he tries to balance Canada\u2019s economic dependence on the energy industry with his climate change commitments.Many environmental groups are using the pipeline expansion as a proxy in the fight against the oil sands, a source of fossil fuels that they condemn as excessively polluting.\u201cIn an ideal world, we would like to see the federal government recognizing that it made an egregious mistake in approving this pipeline,\u201d said Cam Fenton, a Canada strategy manager for 350.org, a nonprofit that opposes new fossil fuel projects. \u201cAt the end of the day polls change, science doesn\u2019t. And it says we cannot deal with climate change and build pipelines.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Across Midwest, Farmers Warn of G.O.P. Losses Over Trump\u2019s Trade Policy", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "China\u2019s proposed tariffs on soybeans would hit hard in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, North Dakota and other states with highly competitive House and Senate races.Supported byCASSELTON, N.D. \u2014 Here in the largest soybean-producing county in the country, a snowy winter has left North Dakota farmers like Robert Runck with time on their hands before spring planting \u2014 time they have spent stewing over how much they stand to lose if President Trump starts a trade war with China.\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing to the nation by doing what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s going to be a one-term president, plain and simple,\u201d said Mr. Runck, a fourth-generation farmer who voted for Mr. Trump. Pausing outside the post office in this town of 2,300, Mr. Runck said the repercussions could be more immediate for Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican whose bid against Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, has been complicated by the proposed tariffs.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t get resolved by election time, I would imagine it would cost Kevin Cramer some votes,\u201d he said.Stern warnings are coming from all over the Midwest about the political peril for Republicans in Mr. Trump\u2019s recent course of action, in which the tariffs he slapped on foreign competitors invited retaliatory tariffs on American agriculture. Soybeans are America\u2019s second largest export to China, and that country\u2019s proposed 25 percent duties on the crop would hit hardest in states like Iowa, Kansas and Minnesota \u2014 where there are highly competitive House races \u2014 as well as Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, whose Senate contests may determine control of the chamber.By proposing the tariffs, Mr. Trump has moved to fulfill a central promise of his campaign: confronting those countries he believes are undermining American industry. Yet his goal \u2014 to revive the steel and aluminum industries, thereby aiding the Rust Belt states that were crucial to his election \u2014 has effectively prioritized one element of the Trump political coalition over another, larger bloc of voters. That larger segment, the farm belt, is essential to Republican success in the midterm elections and beyond.From the still-thawing soybean fields of North Dakota and Kansas to the corn and pork farms of Iowa, voters across the political spectrum say the president\u2019s attacks on American economic rivals could do grave damage to an already unstable commodities market.\u201cThey\u2019re not in touch with the reality of the Midwest and the impact that the tariffs would have,\u201d said Bart Bergquist, a biology professor and part-time farmer who lives on 10 acres just south of Waterloo, Iowa. Mr. Bergquist, who voted for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election, added that commodities prices had already taken a toll on the area.\u201cI know my neighbors are not rolling in money \u2014 they\u2019re trying to supplement whatever else they can do to keep going,\u201d he said.Representative Rod Blum, a Republican, represents much of eastern Iowa and is facing a highly competitive race in what is the second-largest soybean-producing congressional district in the country. He and other politicians are facing a \u201cnervous\u201d farm community across the state, according to Grant Young, an Iowa-based Republican strategist.\u201cI listen to the farm show over the noon hour on WHO daily,\u201d Mr. Young said of Iowa\u2019s leading radio station. \u201cThey are usually a happy-go-lucky bunch promoting industry and holding a two-hour infomercial for the Farm Bureau. But the last couple of months I\u2019m wondering if they need to take the sharp objects out of the studio.\u201dIn Kansas, Bob Henry, who grows corn and soybeans in another up-for-grabs House district near the Nebraska border, said the country could ill afford to tangle with a market that American farmers rely on.\u201cFor the United States soybean grower, China is the 800-pound gorilla in the room,\u201d Mr. Henry said. He suggested that Beijing is exacting political payback against the Republican heartland: \u201cChina knows who got Trump elected.\u201dAfter an initial round of tariffs on a modest share of American exports, the Chinese have displayed a more keen awareness of the electoral map and moved to punish those industries whose misfortune will be felt most intensely in states and districts pivotal in 2018.Karl Rove, the former strategist to President George W. Bush, said a trade clash \u201cwould limit Midwestern enthusiasm from our base and limit our ability to hold what we have and pick up more seats.\u201d Mr. Rove also grumbled that Mr. Trump \u201chas little to no understanding of the farm coalition.\u201dHe may have a slightly better appreciation after a meeting last week in the West Wing with a small group of farm belt Republican senators and governors, during which two of them brought up the adverse impact that tariffs on exports could have in the midterm election, according to officials briefed on the conversation.Mr. Trump used the session to direct a pair of his top economic advisers to reconsider whether the United States should join a free-trade pact with a group of Pacific nations. But just hours later he signaled on Twitter that he was unlikely to reverse course on that agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Instead, there are already whispers, in Washington and in agriculture states, that the president is risking a replay of President Jimmy Carter\u2019s grain embargo on the Soviets, which contributed to the massive losses Democrats suffered in 1980.Indeed, after a year in which Mr. Trump only mused about pulling out of Nafta and was stymied by Congress in his attempt to slash the Agriculture Department\u2019s budget, there is now a sense in the farm belt that Mr. Trump\u2019s yearning to punish China could inflict real economic and political damage on his own political base.\u201cThis is the first time it\u2019s in your face, especially to us in the Midwest,\u201d said Ed Schafer, a Republican former governor of North Dakota who was agriculture secretary under George W. Bush.There may be no other race in America that is at once as significant as the Senate contest here and as shaped by whether China\u2019s tariffs take effect this year. Most of North Dakota\u2019s votes are in the eastern end of the state, in the Red River Valley \u2014 a region that also happens to be home to the three largest soybean-producing counties in the nation.Senator Heitkamp won her seat by fewer than 3,000 votes in 2012. She remains personally popular, a valuable asset in a state with just 570,000 voters, but North Dakota has turned sharply away from Democrats in recent years.But Mr. Trump has now handed her what may be a political gift.\u201cSenator Heitkamp will jump on the big, bad Trump and the stupid policy that\u2019s coming out of Washington hurting our farmers,\u201d Mr. Schafer said. \u201cThat\u2019s a strong message in North Dakota.\u201dOr as Rob Port, a conservative talk radio host and columnist in the state, put it: \u201cThis is the perfect issue for her. Her base eats up the Trump bashing, but it\u2019s also an economic argument that\u2019ll have rural Trump voters saying, \u2018Maybe blind allegiance to Trump isn\u2019t such a good thing.\u2019\u201dMs. Heitkamp is already testing out such a message against her rival, Mr. Cramer.\u201cClearly he sees his role is to be a vote for President Trump in the United States Senate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I believe my role is to be a vote for North Dakota in the United States Senate.\u201dMr. Cramer, who Mr. Trump repeatedly wooed to run for the Senate, accused his opponent of \u201chysteria\u201d and said she was overstating what are at this point only trade negotiations.\u201cPeople in North Dakota prefer humility to hyperbole, and that kind of hyperbole I don\u2019t think sells very well politically,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly not good for our farmers or good for our economy.\u201dBut on a local talk radio program, Mr. Cramer let slip his frustration with the president\u2019s actions. \u201cHe tends to have rather emotional responses,\u201d he said of Mr. Trump.North Dakota is not simply another red state where Democrats are bound for extinction. There is an enduring populist streak here, dating back to its mistrust of distant bankers and millers in Minneapolis, Chicago and New York. To this day, the state retains a state-controlled bank and mill.\u201cWe\u2019re Republicans until it comes to subsidies for farmers,\u201d said George Blank, only half-jokingly, as he sipped coffee with a half dozen fellow retirees at their daily breakfast-and-bull session in Casselton\u2019s Country Kitchen.And, Mr. Blank noted, \u201ceverything drives on ag in this state.\u201dRecalling his years running a construction supply business in a state where one in four jobs is agriculture-related, he said: \u201cWhen the price of corn went down that impacted us greatly.\u201dNow, though, soybeans have become the go-to commodity, said Vanessa Kummer, who farms 4,000 acres with her husband and son near Colfax, N.D. \u201cIt has become our cash crop and the most reliable crop to go to,\u201d she said.Nancy Johnson, who leads the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association, reached for a measure of cheery, upper-Midwest optimism as she expressed hope that the threat of tariffs was merely \u201ca negotiating tactic\u201d by Mr. Trump. But Ms. Johnson, who wears a soybean pendant necklace, said her farmers \u201care rightly concerned, because we\u2019re being used as a weapon.\u201dOver on William Hejl\u2019s farm in Amenia, N.D., just north of Casselton and part of the 86 percent of the state that is made up of farmland and ranches, the anxiety is as difficult to miss as the April snow crunching underfoot.Showing a visitor his gleaming, green John Deere tractor, still in its shed for winter, Mr. Hejl said to \u201ccheck back in August\u201d \u2014 and not just to find better weather.\u201cIf this thing hasn\u2019t been resolved, that\u2019s when it\u2019s going to hurt,\u201d he said of the outset of harvesting. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pay for the fuel and for the people to drive the combine.\u201dKevin Skunes, a neighboring farmer who is also president of the National Corn Growers Association, joined Mr. Hejl and a visiting reporter for coffee, a brownie and a chance to sound the alarm.\u201cIn an already depressed farm economy, if we take another hit on soybeans and corn it\u2019s going to be disastrous,\u201d Mr. Skunes said.Back outside the post office in Casselton, Mr. Runck found his voice nearly drowned out by the sound of the speeding Burlington Northern Santa Fe \u2014 the same freight train that will be carrying crops west to the Pacific this fall.But his answer carried clearly when he was asked whether he would support Ms. Heitkamp or Mr. Cramer: \u201cI think the president has got to do the right thing between now and the election.\u201dMitch Smith contributed reporting from Kansas, Ann Hinga Klein from Iowa, Meg Lindholm from North Dakota and Natalie Kitroeff from New York.Advertisement"}

I interviewed a parent whose bill included thousands for his newborn\u2019s circumcision \u2014 even though his son was never circumcised. If a contractor charged you for a kitchen when he only renovated the bathroom, it would be fraud. When hospitals do the same it\u2019s regarded as an honest mistake. I have seen the bill a patient got for a hip replacement in Belgium. It is easier for me to understand than an American bill even though it\u2019s in Flemish.One New Jersey couple went to a hospital, a doctor and an anesthesiologist within their insurance network for the birth of their daughter. But when their newborn had trouble breathing, requiring a stint in intensive care, they discovered that the pediatricians there were not in any network, resulting in a surprise bill for $10,000. A number of states are passing laws to shield individuals from surprise charges. But the laws put the onus on the patient to dispute the bill. The providers can still attempt to collect, and they do so aggressively.Doctors must be clearly in-network or not. I had one gastroenterologist\u2019s office tell me that she is in-network for a polyp removal but not for a routine colonoscopy, generally a far less lucrative procedure under current insurance rules. Doctors shouldn\u2019t be able to cherry pick \u2014 they must be in-network for all the procedures they normally perform and on all days of the week they practice. If a provider is listed as in-network but is not, the insurer should take care of the charge.I buy my insurance policy for a year. If my doctor or insurer stops participating in my network within that year or in the midst of treating me for an acute disease, I should still be billed as an in-network patient. This would prevent a bait-and-switch: A patient goes to a physical therapy practice for a knee injury, for instance. The first sessions are in-network. Then that therapist leaves the network or the patient is scheduled with a different therapist who doesn\u2019t participate, resulting in a $450 bill.Patients should know if their doctors own a financial stake in a testing or procedure facility before a test or procedure is ordered or scheduled. They should know if a hospital is paying its doctors according to how much revenue they generate or how much they bill, and be informed of any other mutually beneficial financial relationships.A procedure can come with different price tags depending on where it is performed. A Stanford faculty member I interviewed scheduled some minor hand surgery for a time that was convenient for her and her surgeon. On different days, the surgeon operated at different locations. She chose a day he worked at a hospital, so the facility fee was $11,000, and her co-pay was $2,200. If she\u2019d chosen one of the days he worked at a surgery center, it would have cost her $2,000.These prices are often just a starting point for negotiations, after which insurers end up paying much less. But they still matter. About 40 percent of Americans have high-deductible plans that require them to pay more than $1,000 before insurers step in. And of course patients without insurance pay the full fare. \u201cInformed consent\u201d is a bedrock principle of health care. That should include financial liability as well as medical risk.Many doctors recommend the most expensive course of care and don\u2019t tell patients that there are other options. One example: Instead of ordering months of thrice-a-week physical therapy after a hip replacement, hospitals should tell patients they can also do a few instructional sessions and then do the exercises at a gym. That is the norm in many countries, and researchers have found it works just as well.I know these rights might seem like a fantasy in our current system, with its overwhelming complexity and cost. But they are actually quite similar to the rights we expect in any other sector of our economy. A month after I\u2019ve paid for and taken a flight, I can\u2019t be told that the pilot\u2019s fee was not included. When I pick up bread and yogurt at the supermarket, I don\u2019t have to guess what they might cost. Bill collectors don\u2019t start harassing me when I\u2019m disputing a charge on my Visa bill.When the product is our health and the bills are potentially bankrupting, don\u2019t we deserve as much? Maybe, at the very least, it\u2019s time to replace that \u201cright to a smoke-free environment\u201d with some of the above.Elisabeth Rosenthal, a former New York Times correspondent, is the editor in chief of Kaiser Health News and the author of \u201cAn American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Change a Country, Change Its Trains", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr.\u00a0Zoellner is the author of \u201cTrain: Riding the Rails That Created the Modern World \u2014 from the Trans-Siberian to the Southwest Chief,\u201d among other books.President Emmanuel Macron of France, on a quest to liberalize the economy, has now confronted a towering foe that has humbled would-be reformers before him: the railway unions.Britain provides a useful nearby example. That nation\u2019s extraordinary network of iron rails sprung to life in an atmosphere of corporate chaos in the 1830s \u2014 a signature development of the Industrial Revolution \u2014 and came under state control as British Railways in 1948 as a part of the nationalizing wave of the postwar years. As Margaret Thatcher reversed those trends and privatized large segments of the economy in the 1980s, she targeted the British Railways onion, peeling off its catering and hotel functions one property at a time, then selling off the Sealink ferries. Her successor John Major succeeded in spinning off the once-unified system into 25 \u201ctrain operating units\u201d run by franchisees \u2014 since then, a source of reliable complaint from passengers but a powerful symbol of British capitalism.Or look to the United States, which once had 20,000 passenger trains roaring down a quarter-million miles of active track every day: a dynamic country fueled on the coal and steam of locomotives. After World War II, a powerful coalition of Texas oil interests and Detroit auto manufacturers helped push through the Federal Highway Aid Act of 1956 that jump-started the interstate highway system. Railroad companies were encouraged to dump passenger service, and this \u2014 among other factors \u2014 helped bring massive structural transformation to the country: broadening the footprint of suburban sprawl, addicting Americans to petroleum, changing agricultural and retail patterns and, as a footnote, sending the once-mighty American passenger train into the perpetual nursing home of Amtrak.Other global examples, both historic and recent, show how state metamorphosis manifests in the railbed. Russia became a bicontinental power by extending its rails into Siberia. Benito Mussolini famously took credit for Italian rail upgrades. The British unified thousands of principalities in colonial India not through language but through railways, and when the government of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sought to ramp up the economy in the mid-2000s, it cut hiring quotas at Indian Railways and promoted round-the-clock freight loading. China sought to hit six percent growth targets through the last decade by building a stupendous $508 billion network of high-speed trains knitting together its major cities. Last year, Kenya opened the Madaraka Express between the port at Mombasa and the capital of Nairobi that can carry 22 million tons of cargo a year, strengthening its dependence on imports and deepening its reliance on Asia.The calls to reform France\u2019s SNCF is partly coming from the outside \u2014 the European Union requires members to open railways to competition by January 2019. Still, Mr. Macron is taking aim at an institution that \u2014 for all its glories and faults \u2014 comes close to representing the soul of France itself, a representation of the permanent state indifferent to the winds of politics ever since Emperor Napoleon III provided a state guarantee of interest to bondholders in 1852, and instructed Georges-Eugene Haussmann to give the marbled palaces of railway stations an honored place in his redesign of Parisian boulevards.From 1910 onward, the unions have made rail strikes a predictable element of the national vocabulary and a fearsome weapon deployed against unfriendly French politicians. When he was prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9 tried to reform the SNCF. He lasted only two years in office after a set of strikes in 1995 made commuters miserable and turned him into a pariah. Mr. Macron is not just trying to repeal regulations; he is fighting an employment culture with lengthy taproots and outsized influence across other sectors.France is an excellent case study in the truism that a national rail network is the spirit of the country in miniature, a little state within the state. For Mr. Macron to successfully take SNCF \u2014 and with it, France \u2014 in a different direction would be an act of true Napoleonic audacity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would Americans Accept Putting Health Care on a Budget? ", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareThe intuitive appeal of such a system is growing, and it\u2019s getting a test in Maryland. If you wanted to get control of your household spending, you\u2019d set a budget and spend no more than it allowed. You might wonder why we don\u2019t just do the same for spending on American health care.Capping hospital spending raises concerns about harming quality and access. On these grounds, hospital executives and patient advocates might strongly resist spending constraints in the United States.That brings us to Maryland\u2019s experience with a capped system. The evidence from the state is far from conclusive, but this is a weighty and much-watched experiment for health researchers, so it\u2019s worth diving into the details of the latest studies. Starting in 2010 with eight rural hospitals, and expanding its plan in 2014 to the state\u2019s other hospitals, Maryland set global budgets for hospital inpatient and outpatient services, as well as emergency department care. Each hospital\u2019s budget is based on its past revenue and encompasses all payers for care, including Medicare, Medicaid and commercial market insurance. Budgets for hospitals are updated every year to ensure that their spending grows more slowly than the state\u2019s economy.Led by Eric Roberts, a health economist with the University of Pittsburgh, the study examined how Maryland achieved its Medicare savings, using data from 2009-2015. Like RTI\u2019s report, it also compared Maryland hospitals\u2019 experience with that of comparable hospitals elsewhere.However, unlike the RTI report, Mr. Roberts\u2019s study did not find consistent evidence that changes in hospital use in Maryland could be attributed to global budgeting. His study also examined primary care use. Here, too, it did not find consistent evidence that Maryland differed from elsewhere. Because of the challenges of matching Maryland hospitals to others outside of the state for comparison, the authors took several statistical approaches in reaching their findings. With some approaches, the changes observed in Maryland were comparable to those in other states, raising uncertainty about their cause.Changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act, which also passed in 2010, coincide with Maryland\u2019s hospital payment reforms. The A.C.A. included many provisions aimed at reducing spending, and those changes could have led to hospital use and spending in other states on par with those seen in Maryland.A limitation of Maryland\u2019s approach is that payments to physicians are not included in its global budgets. \u201cMaryland didn\u2019t put the state\u2019s health system on a budget \u2014 it only put hospitals on a budget,\u201d said Ateev Mehrotra, the study\u2019s senior author and an associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u201cSlowing health care spending and fostering better coordination requires including physicians who make the day-to-day decisions about how care is delivered.\u201d\u201cMaryland hospitals are only beginning to capitalize on the model\u2019s incentives to transform care in their communities,\u201d said Joshua Sharfstein, a co-author of the editorial and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u201cThis means that as Maryland moves forward with new stages of innovation, there is a great deal more potential upside.\u201d As former secretary of health and mental hygiene in Maryland, he helped institute the Maryland hospital payment approach. Can this system work across America? Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hurricane Aid Has Eased Puerto Rico\u2019s Finances. It May Not Be Enough.", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a meeting in San Juan of the territory\u2019s federal oversight board, members called on Puerto Rico to reform its labor laws and fix its insolvent government pension system quickly, while it still had the benefit of both the disaster money and court protection from creditors under a special new bankruptcy law for United States territories.Retired government workers would see their pensions, already less than $25,000 a year for many workers, cut by an average of 10 percent; current government workers would be shifted into a 401(k) plan; and workers in Puerto Rico\u2019s private sector would lose mandatory perks like a holiday bonus, usually $300 to $600 a year.The top Puerto Rican financial official at the meeting, Gerardo Portela, called the oversight board\u2019s insistence on more cutbacks \u201cinhumane,\u201d coming so soon after a catastrophic natural disaster.And Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, who has sought to avoid painful cuts to pensions and compensation, accused the board of overstepping the limits of its legal authority and said he did not intend to do its bidding.\u201cOur position has always been clear,\u201d he said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cIssues that are not in line with my government\u2019s public policy will not be carried out. Period.\u201dEven before Puerto Rico was raked by Hurricane Maria last September, its finances were in disarray. For many years, it had borrowed money to plug holes in its budget and to repay previous borrowings, building up a debt of more than $70 billion that it could not repay. Today its debt and unfunded pension obligations total more than $120 billion, or twice the size of its economy. And the economy has been shrinking, as residents leave for better prospects on the United States mainland.However, the hurricane has led to a big influx of disaster relief and private insurance payments, a bonanza that led Mr. Rossell\u00f3 to project that the island could end the next five years with a cumulative surplus of $6.3 billion.But the oversight board warned that without significant fiscal and economic reforms, Puerto Rico would be left, after the current flurry of storm-related activity, back where it started \u2014 with an unproductive economy and too much debt.The board meeting was called to certify Puerto Rico\u2019s new fiscal plan, a document intended to chart the way forward. Six of the seven voting members voted in favor of an amended plan that includes the new austerity measures.In exchange for those extraordinary powers, Congress required the island to submit to a federal oversight board. The law gives the governor of Puerto Rico the right to develop the all-important fiscal plan, but the board must certify it. If it does not find the governor\u2019s fiscal plan credible, it has the authority to impose its own version.But Mr. Rossell\u00f3 has clashed repeatedly with the board, saying that as Puerto Rico\u2019s elected leader, he has the final say over economic policy.\u201cOur position has always been clear,\u201d he said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cIssues that are not in line with my government\u2019s public policy will not be carried out. Period.\u201dPuerto Rico has already been through the process once, certifying a fiscal plan in March 2017. But it soon became clear that the governor was not carrying out the parts he disagreed with, and the oversight board took him to court. Before the lawsuit could be adjudicated, Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck, leaving all financial planning in a shambles.The two biggest flash points over the new plan now under review on Thursday appeared to be labor law reform and the cost of the pensions due to Puerto Rico\u2019s retired government workers. On many other elements of the fiscal plan \u2014 reducing health care spending and subsidies to cities; lowering tax rates while improving collections; and cutting red tape for businesses \u2014 the oversight board and the governor appear to be in agreement.But board members said none of that would be enough unless Puerto Rico also softened labor laws that make it harder than anywhere else in the United States to lay off workers, which in turn makes employers on the island reluctant to hire people. Employers are also required to provide extensive paid vacations and annual holiday bonuses.Other board members noted that since the hurricane, young Puerto Ricans have been fleeing the island to look for work in the 50 states, even those with much less protective labor laws.But the board does not have direct authority over the island\u2019s labor laws, only its fiscal policies. Amending the labor laws would require an act of the Puerto Rican Legislature, and Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said he would \u201cnot propose any bill that reduces vacation and/or sick leave, nor will we eliminate the Christmas bonus.\u201dBy contrast, fixing the government\u2019s insolvent pension system is a matter of fiscal policy. Retired government workers are counting on future monthly payments worth more than $50 billion in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 and the pension funds already are essentially penniless. The money appears to have been spent on other things.Puerto Rico is planning to revert to a pay-as-you-go pension plan, in which the government will pay retirees their monthly benefits directly from its general fund. That will severely strain the general fund, so the oversight board is calling for 10 percent average cuts in the pensions \u2014 people with the biggest pensions would get the biggest cuts.\u201cThe board wants to make sure they\u2019ll get their pensions, even though there\u2019s no money,\u201d Natalie Jaresko, executive director of the oversight board, said at Thursday\u2019s meeting. But the pain of bankruptcy, she said, had to be fairly shared with all other government creditors, along with younger residents who rely on government services.Mr. Portela, the chairman of Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority, disagreed with that, calling governmental retirees \u201cthe most vulnerable of Puerto Rican society.\u201d He reminded the oversight board that teachers in Puerto Rico, like those in many of the 50 states, do not participate in Social Security.And the governor said he had no intention of cutting anybody\u2019s pension.\u201cOur position regarding pensions has always been crystal clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not allow for a vulnerable sector of our population to be attacked. It is wrong and immoral to reduce the benefits for those that have contributed to the economy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of debt built up by Puerto Rico. It was more than $70 billion, not more than $70 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Build a Beautiful Savory Tart Out of Your Leftovers", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEatEarly in the morning, Natasha Pickowicz ducked into the walk-in refrigerator, the one all the way at the end of the dishwashing station in Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso\u2019s kitchen, and studied the family shelf. As usual, the tidy nook was stacked with plastic containers of odds and ends, leftover prep from the night before, set aside for staff meal. A pint of blanched broccolini stems here, a lump of blue-cheese butter there. But where anyone else might have seen a random muddle of junk, Natasha Pickowicz saw tarts \u2014 big, beautiful tarts that would feed the whole kitchen before noon.She gathered a few pint containers: ham and red-onion scraps, spare confit leeks and yesterday\u2019s mashed potatoes, tatters of provolone and raw cauliflower debris. She reached for fluttery maitakes, a sticky paste of caramelized onions and a handful of cold, slightly sad-looking boiled potatoes with their skins still on. Pickowicz set everything on the counter, just across from a cook smashing raw beef for carpaccio. \u201cIt\u2019s really satisfying to find a purpose for all these things,\u201d she said, already seeing how the bits and pieces would come together on cold discs of pie dough.Pickowicz is a pastry chef, known for desserts like her glamorous fruit crostatas and the pastries she makes at both Altro Paradiso and Flora Bar in New York. She started baking savory tarts at an old job when there was an excess of squash one summer, and now she builds a few out of whatever\u2019s on hand each morning, working quickly among the tasks on her to-do list so that she can set out a late breakfast for herself and the cooks. Her approach is spontaneous but deliberate, which is to say, the scraps are random, but there\u2019s nothing random about the way that Pickowicz composes them. \u201cI\u2019m always thinking critically about how they\u2019ll cook,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about creating layers, so when you bite into it, you\u2019re transitioning from tender dough through body and structure.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what she meant, until I watched her make four tarts.For one, she layered mashed potatoes and cauliflower over dabs of caramelized onion. After it came out of the oven and cooled, she covered it in parsley leaves and lemon zest and draped over those thin, soft pieces of ham. She arranged the leeks over smudged mascarpone and lemon zest, keeping it simple. For the third, she broke the potatoes apart with her hands, creating rough, jagged edges that would go golden as they roasted on the pastry \u2014 which she coated first with smears of ricotta and an oily condiment of preserved lemon. The maitakes, after they were roasted with red-onion pieces and caramelized onion for the very last tart, would be covered with crisp, dressed leaves of pink radicchio del Veneto.Repurposing leftovers, making something entirely whole and new from fragments, isn\u2019t only about economy and efficiency in the kitchen. There\u2019s joy in limiting yourself to what you already have, in finding a use for every scrap and stretching a little into a lot. At home, I made Pickowicz\u2019s pastry dough, with its giant flecks of butter, using as little ice water as possible to bring the crumbs together, and tucking some extra dough into the freezer for another day\u2019s tart. It was only technically spring in New York, so I didn\u2019t have much to work with. Some ricotta, some small boiled potatoes and a single shallot. I asked myself, what would Natasha do?I smeared ricotta all over the cold dough, grated lemon zest over the top and cracked a little bit of black pepper. Then I broke the potatoes up into big pieces with my hands, mixed in the sliced shallot and dressed it all with olive oil and salt. That went on top of the ricotta. I filled a few gaps with torn up provolone, using the last few slices in the fridge. And when the tart came out of the oven, when it had cooled down to room temperature, I seasoned it again and covered it in dressed radicchio leaves, which wouldn\u2019t have been quite enough to make a meal on their own. It was a delicious and inexact emulation, a spontaneous salad tart, and somehow it was big enough to feed six.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Ryan, the House speaker, was not around to hear them, having just wrapped up a trip to the Czech Republic.But Randy Bryce was.But Mr. Bryce is not the only candidate hoping to dethrone a congressional king. Another Democrat, a schoolteacher named Cathy Myers, is also running for her party\u2019s nomination. She is irked that national Democrats and progressives \u2014 including Senator Bernie Sanders, the former presidential candidate \u2014 have thrown their weight behind Mr. Bryce.\u201cIt\u2019s a circus,\u201d sighed Mark Graul, a seasoned Republican strategist here. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up.\u201dMr. Ryan, meanwhile, has been coy about his intentions. After passing a landmark tax overhaul that fulfilled a career-long dream, he has not yet announced his candidacy for re-election, saying he will make a decision after consulting with his wife in the spring. That has prompted speculation that he will retire, which his aides have dismissed as nonsense.History shows it is not impossible to knock off a congressional leader. In 1994, when Republicans swept the House during the first midterm election of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, they also swept the Democratic speaker, Thomas S. Foley, out of office.\u201cRandy Bryce is a more formidable candidate on the resource side and the notoriety side than any opponent Ryan has faced,\u201d said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, run out of Milwaukee. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s a wave election, who knows?\u201dAt 48, Mr. Ryan has represented this corner of southeastern Wisconsin for nearly two decades. People here still remember him as a fresh-faced young congressman with a compelling personal story. His father died when he was 16, and he saved his Social Security benefits to pay for college. He is viewed as a nice guy and a family man.\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in him,\u201d Steve Johnson, 69, a former Janesville School District administrator, said while drinking coffee with a friend at Mocha Moment, a local cafe. Mr. Johnson, who says he votes Republican about half of the time, has known the speaker since Mr. Ryan was a student council representative, and has voted for him for years.\u201cHe always had a good head on his shoulders, a good set of values,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI supported him for all this time, but I won\u2019t now, especially since he won\u2019t stand up to Trump. That\u2019s a big surprise to me.\u201dOthers complain that Mr. Ryan no longer holds town-hall-style meetings (his aides say he hosts telephone call-ins where constituents can voice their concerns) and spends more time outside the district than in it.\u201cHe\u2019s just changed so much from the beginning of his career until now,\u201d said Chris Rice, 68, a Democrat who works in health care. \u201cI think he\u2019s lost his values.\u201d\u201cEver since I\u2019ve known Paul, tax reform was near and dear to his heart,\u201d said Kim Travis, who represents Mr. Ryan\u2019s district on the executive committee of the Wisconsin Republican Party. \u201cSo to get that passed is huge. I don\u2019t think any of his opponents stand a chance.\u201dEven so, some political observers are seeing cracks in the speaker\u2019s armor. Stan Milam, a longtime Janesville journalist and former radio host, said that neither Mr. Bryce nor Ms. Myers has what it takes to beat Mr. Ryan this year. But he does see the speaker showing some signs of weakness.\u201cEvery politician, if they have a lengthy political career, becomes more vulnerable than usual,\u201d Mr. Milam said, \u201cand I believe that\u2019s where Paul Ryan is.\u201dEven Democrats concede that capitalizing on that will be an uphill battle. For one thing, they are fighting among themselves. In Washington, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has targeted Mr. Ryan\u2019s district to flip from Republican to Democratic. Many here see Ms. Myers, who now holds a seat on the Janesville School Board, picking up steam.Her backers view Mr. Bryce as a creation of Hollywood and the national news media, and insist she is the more substantive candidate. They vow a strong grass-roots campaign.\u201cNo one has been able to answer this for me: Why is Randy Bryce a better candidate to beat Paul Ryan?\u201d Ms. Myers asked in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m talking about his qualifications, not his money.\u201dMr. Bryce, 53, a longtime union activist who has waged three previous unsuccessful bids for local and state office, is pitching himself to voters as a man of the people, a kind of Joe Six-Pack who understands their everyday concerns. An Army veteran and a survivor of testicular cancer, he burst onto the political scene with a video campaign announcement that went viral.In it, he offered to trade places with Mr. Ryan, declaring, \u201cYou can come work the iron, and I\u2019ll go to D.C.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to that coming up; that\u2019s why I\u2019m running,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019ve busted my rear end for the past 20 years to keep my head above water. That\u2019s proof that I understand what it\u2019s like to struggle.\u201dOn the day the students marched last week through Janesville, demanding that Mr. Ryan take strong action on gun control, Mr. Bryce was among hundreds of people who turned up at a rally that was rife with anti-Ryan sentiment. Dressed in jeans, work boots and a paint-splattered, beaten-up brown work jacket, he hung back in the crowd, listening quietly as they shouted \u201cShame on Paul! Shame on Paul!\u201d\u201cI love everything you stand for,\u201d she gushed.An earlier version of this article misstated the nature of the occupation of Cathy Myers, a Democratic challenger to Paul D. Ryan.

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Upholds Procedure That\u2019s Said to Combat \u2018Patent Trolls\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpponents say the procedure violates the Constitution by usurping the role of the federal courts, violating the separation of powers and denying patent holders the right to a jury trial.By a 7-to-2 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the procedure was a permissible way for the agency that administers patents to fix its mistakes.Stephanie Martz, general counsel of the National Retail Federation, said the court\u2019s ruling was \u201ca major step toward stopping patent trolls and their attempts to commit extortion against retailers and other businesses that have done nothing wrong.\u201d\u201cMaking it clear that many cases can and should be resolved by fixing patents at the patent office rather than rushing to court to sue for infringement makes it much easier for our members to fight patent trolls,\u201d Ms. Martz said in a statement.But Adam Mossoff, a law professor at George Mason University, said in a statement that the Supreme Court had taken a wrong turn.The decision, he said, \u201cdestabilizes the foundation that patents provide to the U.S. innovation economy, as stable and effective property rights are the necessary platform from which inventors, venture capitalists and companies create the new products and services that have made life a modern miracle.\u201dThe case grew out of a dispute involving Oil States Energy Services, which owned a patent for protecting wellhead equipment during hydraulic fracturing while drilling for oil. A competitor, Greene\u2019s Energy Group, successfully challenged the patent under the procedure, called \u201cinter partes\u201d review, which is Latin for \u201cbetween the parties.\u201dOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed.\u201cThis court has recognized, and the parties do not dispute, that the decision to grant a patent is a matter involving public rights \u2014 specifically, the grant of a public franchise,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the majority. \u201cInter partes review is simply a reconsideration of that grant.\u201dJustices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the majority decision.Justice Thomas wrote that it was irrelevant that the administrative proceedings resembled an adjudication.\u201cThis court has never adopted a \u2018looks like\u2019 test to determine if an adjudication has improperly occurred outside\u201d a federal court created by Article III of the Constitution, he wrote. \u201cThe fact that an agency uses court-like procedures does not necessarily mean it is exercising the judicial power.\u201dIn dissent, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said the majority had done damage to the power and independence of the federal judiciary.\u201cUntil recently, most everyone considered an issued patent a personal right \u2014 no less than a home or farm \u2014 that the federal government could revoke only with the concurrence of independent judges,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut in the statute before us Congress has tapped an executive agency, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, for the job.\u201d\u201cSupporters say this is a good thing because the Patent Office issues too many low-quality patents; allowing a subdivision of that office to clean up problems after the fact, they assure us, promises an efficient solution,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd, no doubt, dispensing with constitutionally prescribed procedures is often expedient. Whether it is the guarantee of a warrant before a search, a jury trial before a conviction \u2014 or, yes, a judicial hearing before a property interest is stripped away \u2014 the Constitution\u2019s constraints can slow things down.\u201dChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined Justice Gorsuch\u2019s dissent in the case, Oil States Energy Services v. Greene\u2019s Energy Group, No. 16-712.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can It Happen Here? Madeleine Albright Examines Fascism Then and Now", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.How far away those days seem. What happened to this optimism? Why has the momentum toward democracy and international comity slowed? Why, as Madeleine Albright asks early in her new book, \u201care we once again talking about fascism?\u201dAlbright does this via an examination of cases in Europe and America from World War I through the present day. From this, some patterns emerge.While the turmoil in Europe after World War I was extreme, Albright notes similar dynamics in other places and times: Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s recent rise to power was fueled by deteriorating social and economic conditions and growing inequality in Venezuela; Viktor Orban came to power as Hungary was experiencing the painful fallout of the financial crisis; and Vladimir Putin emerged as Russia was in the midst of economic and national decline similar to that experienced by interwar Germany. (During the 1990s Russia\u2019s economy shrank by more than half.)But problems only become opportunities for fascists and other antidemocrats if their opponents can\u2019t or won\u2019t address them. A second factor emerging from Albright\u2019s cases is weak and divided oppositions. In interwar Italy liberal governments dithered while the country slid into chaos and the two largest parties, the Socialists and Christian Democrats, were more interested in defending the interests of their particular constituencies than democracy. In the Weimar Republic, the country\u2019s largest party, the Social Democrats, was more committed to democracy than its Italian counterpart, but it too faltered during the Great Depression and was continually attacked by antidemocratic left- and right-wing forces. While their opponents fought among themselves and let their country\u2019s troubles deepen, fascists offered voters simple explanations of their problems in the form of enemies like nefarious foreign powers or Jews, and simple solutions to them, namely replacing weak and unresponsive democracies with strong dictatorships truly responsive to \u201cthe people.\u201d Adolf Hitler once explained: \u201cI will tell you what has carried me to the position I have reached. Our political problems appeared complicated. The German people could make nothing of them. \u2026 I, on the other hand \u2026 reduced them to the simplest terms. The masses realized this and followed me.\u201dFinally, Albright\u2019s cases reveal a third factor in fascism\u2019s rise: the connivance of conservatives. In both interwar Italy and Germany conservatives believed they could control fascism and use its popular support to achieve their own goals. In Italy King Victor Emmanuel III and in Germany President Paul von Hindenburg were persuaded by conservative advisers to hand power over to Mussolini and Hitler, respectively, even though neither had won electoral majorities.So where does this leave us today? There are worrying parallels: Although the situation is not nearly as dire as the interwar period, Western democracy currently faces significant challenges. To avoid having these snowball into the type of crisis fascism feeds off, Albright hopes antifascists will learn from history. In the United States this means Democrats and Republicans must work together again to solve our country\u2019s problems \u2014 and Republicans must not allow the fervidness of Trump\u2019s supporters to blind them to the danger to democracy that he represents.There are international parallels and lessons as well. During the interwar years Europe\u2019s problems were aggravated by America\u2019s withdrawal from the global stage; Albright worries that Trump\u2019s isolationism, protectionism and fondness for dictators are eroding America\u2019s ability to lead and help solve international challenges, deepening divisions within the West and emboldening antidemocratic forces.Sheri Berman is a professor of politics at Barnard College, Columbia University.

I am disbursing funds to enable our 12th graders to take the standardized West African Examinations Council examination and attend universities across the region.The most effective way to improve the lives of the poor and reduce inequality is to ensure that government officials do not skim public resources. I intend to use legislation and build upon our current code of conduct to limit conflicts of interest involving government employees, enhance transparency over public processes and punish violators.We are also drafting legislation to make our ministries more effective and efficient in addressing the specific challenges they face. We are decentralizing the government to make it more accessible to the people. We are reforming our land rights regulations to ensure equity for all Liberians. We are investing in infrastructure and roads to improve connectivity across the country and promoting agriculture to ensure self-sufficiency and nutrition for all.To sustain a peaceful and stable Liberia, we are examining ways to strengthen national integration by enacting laws promoting national unification. We are working on reforming our judicial system to ensure the basic rights of all citizens are protected.It will require sustained engagement from both my government and the citizens of the country.

{"Headline": "Lula, Brazil\u2019s Ex-President, Can Be Jailed, Court Rules", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOA VISTA, Brazil \u2014 Brazil\u2019s top court ruled early Thursday that former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva can be sent to prison while he continues to appeal his corruption conviction \u2014 an explosive decision that upends the nation\u2019s politics and appears to quash his bid to return to power.The 6-to-5 ruling against the former president, who has called his prosecution an underhanded ploy to keep him off the ballot, is likely to call into question the legitimacy of the election in the eyes of many Brazilians.\u201cNo matter how many roses the mighty kill, they will never manage to stop spring,\u201d Mr. da Silva\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party said in a statement posted on Twitter after his fate became clear.Chief Justice C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia Antunes Rocha cast the deciding vote after midnight, at the end of a marathon session.Mr. da Silva, who served as president from 2003 to 2011, appealed the sentence to the country\u2019s top court, the Supreme Federal Court, asking to be allowed to remain free while additional appeals are pending \u2014 a process that could drag on for years.On Thursday, the court gave its answer: It decided to maintain the status quo, which holds that defendants can be imprisoned after an appeals court upholds a verdict against them. With the ruling in hand, S\u00e9rgio Moro, the federal judge who presided over Mr. da Silva\u2019s trial, is expected to issue an arrest warrant for the former president in a matter of days.Prosecutors regard Mr. da Silva\u2019s case as the highest-stakes prosecution in their long crackdown on corruption, an effort that enjoys widespread support among Brazilians.Thousands of the former president\u2019s critics demonstrated Tuesday night, demanding that the justices uphold their 2016 ruling that allows trial judges to jail defendants after a first appeal has been rejected. More than 5,000 prosecutors and judges have signed a petition supporting that position.But Mr. da Silva still commands the loyalty of millions of Brazilians. His supporters contend that removing the country\u2019s most popular presidential candidate from the ballot would be an affront to democracy. They say the case against him is nothing more than political persecution, and they vowed to take to the streets if the court ruled he can be imprisoned.\u201cWe are living in times of intolerance and intransigence,\u201d she said. \u201cThe strengthening of Brazilian democracy depends on civic unity for the peaceful coexistence of everyone. Different opinions must be respected.\u201dJustice Roberto Barroso, who voted against Mr. da Silva, noted that the president left office with high approval ratings and an impressive set of accomplishments.\u201cWe are not debating about a political legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is whether jurisprudence that the court settled must be applied to all people. It is a test of our democracy.\u201dThe ruling does not technically disqualify Mr. da Silva\u2019s candidacy. Instead, a different body \u2014 the Supreme Electoral Tribunal \u2014 will review each candidate\u2019s eligibility forms starting in mid-August. It is widely expected to reject Mr. da Silva\u2019s bid for office under the \u201cclean slate\u201d law, which disqualifies anyone who has a criminal conviction that has been upheld by an appeals court.Legal experts say that Mr. da Silva could try to fight the electoral court\u2019s ruling if he remained free, but that his imprisonment makes that quest all but impossible.Thousands of people on both sides of the issue had gathered in Bras\u00edlia, the capital, for the court\u2019s decision.It was a rare venture into politics that was widely interpreted as saying that the Supreme Federal Court should rule against Mr. da Silva.In a country that was ruled by the military from 1964 to 1985, critics reacted with alarm, calling the comment inappropriate pressure at best, and at worst a veiled threat of military intervention if the former president prevailed in court.But many others backed the army chief. His posts were shared more than 10,000 times and liked by more than 20,000 people in just three hours.In Mr. da Silva\u2019s trial, Judge Moro found that the former president had accepted bribes \u2014 in the form of an oceanfront apartment \u2014 in return for steering contracts to a construction company.The corruption allegations against Mr. da Silva are only a small part of the wide-ranging Car Wash investigation.The inquiry, which began in 2014 with a seemingly routine look into money-laundering accusations, has ensnared scores of powerful business executives and politicians across the political spectrum.But Mr. da Silva\u2019s case carries tremendous legal and political implications for the country.Jorge Oliveira, 50, a former army paratrooper, said he hoped that Mr. da Silva would be jailed soon and that his downfall would be the first step toward a drastic political transformation.\u201cThe guy needs to be jailed,\u201d Mr. Oliveira said. \u201cThen a general needs to take power, oust Temer, hold things together for three years and call for new elections.\u201dJ\u00e9ssica da Silva Facundo, by contrast, said she had been rooting for Mr. da Silva, largely out of nostalgia for the prosperity Brazil experienced during his time in power.\u201cDespite the fact that he stole, during his government I was doing better,\u201d said Ms. da Silva, who is not related to the former president.Ernesto Londo\u00f1o reported from Boa Vista, and Shasta Darlington from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

Under the old industrial roof, the message was clear: This working-class city is doing everything it can to recast itself as an innovation hub for South Australia and the world.\u201cThere\u2019s a corps of people here who will be driving into the innovation economy,\u201d Mr. Hajdu said. \u201cYou get on the bus or you get out of the way.\u201dAdelaide is the understated capital of South Australia, a mostly rural depopulating state. Like so many rust belt cities worldwide, it is trying to recover from a manufacturing decline by hunting for innovation buzz \u2014 that glow of techno-progress that can propel a place from downbeat to in demand.But this city of 1.3 million \u2014 with its aging population and unemployment rates that are often among the highest in the country \u2014 needs an even bigger jolt. Frustrations have been building for years as Adelaide\u2019s factories shuttered, with Holden closing its plant last year, bringing an end to Australia\u2019s auto industry.The response is what\u2019s interesting: Quiet Adelaide, a former industrial center now seen as a laid-back community of churches and retirees, is banging the table for change.Last month, voters kicked out the Labour Party after 16 years of running South Australia, electing the more conservative Liberal Party and its leader, Steven Marshall, the owner of a furniture business, on the promise of economic growth.Call Adelaide a boring country town, as many Australians have for decades, and they\u2019ll point to the beaches and wine regions nearby, emphasizing that housing here is more affordable than in Sydney or San Francisco.Talk about the death of Australia\u2019s automobile industry, and they\u2019ll point to workers who have adapted by joining the city\u2019s new start-ups.Question Adelaide\u2019s sophistication, and they\u2019ll argue that because this is the first city in Australia to be founded by free settlers rather than convicts, the culture is more open-minded and creative.\u201cThe Paris and Rome of today are not necessarily the Paris or Rome of tomorrow,\u201d said Mr. Hajdu, who moved to Adelaide in 2015 and is now a paid innovation consultant for the South Australian government. \u201cIt\u2019s total world transformation.\u201dMr. Hajdu says things like that a lot: sweeping techno-prophecies that he seems to be beta testing for a larger audience.His smartphone has a cracked screen \u2014 and his official title is \u201cchief innovator.\u201dLast year, South Australia\u2019s Labor government gave him a three-year contract, paying him 300,000 Australian dollars a year (around $230,000) for innovation advice.Is it worth it? South Australia\u2019s new Liberal government declined repeated requests for interviews about that.One of Mr. Hajdu\u2019s first projects involved helping Adelaide get what most of this wealthy, otherwise developed country lacks \u2014 superfast internet connectivity.South Australia is now investing 7.6 million Australian dollars to roll out new fiber optic cable to 29 innovation precincts.Officially, Adelaide is now the first non-American \u201cgigabit city,\u201d making it part of a program that connects innovators and researchers to their counterparts in other cities with advanced network infrastructure, including Chattanooga and Austin, Tex.One afternoon, Mr. Hajdu pulled together a few of the people he sees as helping lead Adelaide\u2019s revival.Sitting at a rooftop bar with views of a skyline reminiscent of Tulsa, Okla., he introduced Terry Gold, an American who moved from Colorado to run a tech incubator.Clustering universities, start-ups and government support is, after all, the Silicon Valley model.The question is whether it can work for Adelaide.Inside Tonsley, the converted Mitsubishi factory, the company we visited, called Sage Automation, made devices used for self-driving cars that are put together in small batches \u2014 a far cry from the mass production of cars in the factory\u2019s heyday.But a tipping point like Chattanooga\u2019s or Pittsburgh\u2019s has yet to be reached. Unemployment is still rising. Around Tonsley, there are rundown stores and pubs struggling to stay open.Inside, there are wide expanses of empty gray floors, waiting to be used.Advertisement"}

He was 70.His death was announced on the Burning Man website. Mr. Harvey had a stroke on April 4.New York Times writers have described it as, or compared it to, a \u201cweeklong cyberhippie carnival,\u201d a \u201cfringe culturefest,\u201d \u201ca hallucinogenic state fair,\u201d \u201ca full-scale countercultural declaration of independence,\u201d \u201cthe internet made flesh\u201d and \u201cthe Whitney Biennial reimagined as a rave party.\u201dBurning Man is run by Burning Man Project, a nonprofit organization that has an annual operating budget of about $30 million, according to the website. At his death, Mr. Harvey\u2019s title was board president and chief philosophic officer.The festival\u2019s 10 official principles, written by Mr. Harvey, include civic responsibility, communal effort, gifting and immediacy. But the one cited most often is radical self-expression.Early on, the event became popular with the digital subculture, lending credence to the belief that primitivism \u2014 even ironic primitivism \u2014 and great technological leaps make happy bedfellows. Mr. Harvey saw a connection.The festival\u2019s so-called gift economy is central to the experience. There may be whiskey bars and sandwich shops at Burning Man, but everything is free. Burners, as the participants call themselves, offer their products and services as gifts. (The only things for sale, by the organizers, are coffee and ice.) No one is allowed to display a corporate logo or even wear one on a T-shirt.Mr. Harvey preferred to call the system a \u201cgift culture,\u201d because visitors spend plenty of money ahead of time on the supplies they bring. But he believed even a temporary experience with that culture was worthwhile \u2014 to counter economic norms.He escaped by serving in the Army. He gave college (Portland State University) a try, with the help of the G.I. Bill, but was disillusioned by what he saw as his professors\u2019 small-mindedness.He and a girlfriend, Janet Lohr, moved to San Francisco in the 1970s, and he took jobs as a bike messenger, a taxi driver, a cook and eventually a landscape gardener. He made friends with artists who were making a living as blue-collar workers.Mr. Harvey was married once, briefly, to Patricia Johnson, and he raised their son, Tristan, who survives him, as a single father. He is also survived by his brother, Stewart.Mr. Harvey remained fully involved with his creation until his stroke, supervising design decisions and choosing this year\u2019s theme, \u201cI, Robot.\u201dThe 2018 festival, scheduled for Aug. 26-Sept. 3, will go on, the organization said in a statement: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we know for sure, Larry wants us to burn the man.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Mr. Harvey\u2019s former girlfriend Janet Lohr, with whom he moved to San Francisco in the 1970s.

{"Headline": "Focusing on a Manager\u2019s Best Stock Ideas May Not Be a Good Idea", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock funds with concentrated portfolios \u2014 30 or 40 holdings, tops \u2014 are supposed to contain only the managers\u2019 best investment ideas.It turns out, though, that those ideas generally haven\u2019t been good enough to help the funds beat more diversified rivals.In the first quarter, and in the one, three and five years that ended on March 31, the average such stock fund, known as a focus fund, failed to beat at least half of the funds with the same objective \u2014 large-company growth, Asian smaller companies, whatever \u2014 according to Morningstar.At our request, Morningstar examined all actively managed stock funds that had no sales load, a minimum investment of $10,000 or less and at least $100 million in assets. A focus fund was defined as being in the 10 percent of funds with the fewest portfolio holdings, meaning it owned fewer stocks than any of the other 90 percent.Despite the so-so performance of focus funds as a group, some did exceptionally well, and that reveals the good and bad news about them: Their portfolio concentration can accentuate the gap between the best and worst.\u201cConcentration can propel you to greater heights and drive you to greater depths,\u201d said Christopher Davis, a senior analyst specializing in equity strategy for Morningstar. \u201cA concentrated fund is harder to own.\u201dAmid the ordinariness, or worse, there were many apparent standouts. A greater number of concentrated funds performed in the top 10 percent within their respective investment objectives in each period than would be expected by chance, the Morningstar data reveals.In the year through March, for instance, in a universe of 1,938 funds, 19 or 20 in the group with the 10 percent fewest holdings should be in the top 10 percent of returns, strictly by chance, but 26 were.Todd Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded fund and mutual fund research at CFRA, views the wide performance range among focus funds as a silver lining.\u201cConcentrated funds put only their best ideas into the portfolio and tend to stick with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be more volatile, as they are driven by a smaller number of stocks and tend to be more concentrated in certain sectors.\u201dThat may give any of them a chance to beat the market. Diversified portfolios, in contrast, may not deviate much from benchmark stock indexes, he said, and so \u201care more likely to lag a considerably cheaper Vanguard index mutual fund.\u201dThe potential to substantially outperform allows providers of focus funds to charge more money. The average focus fund has annual expenses of 1.06 percent, compared with 0.98 percent for the average actively managed stock fund, according to Morningstar. Focus funds also typically have smaller asset bases, providing fewer economies of scale.\u201cConcentrated funds start off deeper in the expense hole and have a deeper expense gap to traverse,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIf you bet on the right one, your upside potential is all that much greater. Investors choose to make that bet. If they choose well, the expense ratio doesn\u2019t really matter. If they don\u2019t, the additional expenses will add insult to injury.\u201dThere have been clear, consistent winners among focus funds, even if their inherent volatility can cause periodic weakness. Many names appear on several lists of top concentrated portfolios this year and over one, three and five years, with seven funds on all four.One of those, Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators, maintains a portfolio of about 30 stocks. They are often the same ones because the managers like to hold positions for many years.As the fund\u2019s name suggests, its managers \u201ctry to identify companies that use innovation to drive their growth,\u201d said Matthew Page, one of those managers. \u201cWe believe that, ultimately, companies like that should outperform because they\u2019re smarter and better than their average peers. That means higher growth prospects and profits.\u201dAmong the themes that appeal to him are big data and machine learning. The first refers to the storage, processing and analysis of immense sets of related data. The second involves developing programs that allow computers to learn from and make predictions about data almost instantaneously, a skill that will be needed for technologies such as self-driving cars.It\u2019s hard to invest in these areas directly, Mr. Page said, so the portfolio holds stocks in related ones, including Nvidia, which makes graphics processing units, Fanuc, a Japanese robotics business, and Infineon, a German maker of semiconductors for the automotive industry that is expanding into chips for electric and self-driving vehicles.The Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund, another that appears on all four lists of top-performing focus funds, favors large companies that sell for less than their intrinsic worth because investors misunderstand their businesses, Alex Umansky, the fund\u2019s manager, says. He adds that there are so few mispricings among these well-researched companies that the fund usually holds just 30 to 35 stocks.He keeps most of them for long periods \u2014 \u201cour time horizon is forever,\u201d he said \u2014 and accepts price swings that other managers try to avoid by maintaining bigger portfolios.\u201cWe think overdiversification has been massively value-destructive over the last decade because people are worried about managing volatility,\u201d Mr. Umansky said.The fund\u2019s largest constituent, accounting for 15 percent of its assets, is hardly obscure \u2014 Amazon \u2014 but Mr. Umansky contends that its price is too cheap, even at 235 times its earnings for the last four quarters. That extravagant valuation is misleading, he said, because Amazon has a history of forgoing earnings today by investing in new business lines that will pay off tomorrow.Other portfolio holdings include Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant; and Mastercard and Visa, which dominate the credit card business. Mr. Umansky called Mastercard \u201cthe digital railroad\u201d taking financial transactions from paper to the electronic world, a process that he expects to be larger and more lucrative than investors anticipate.Mr. Rosenbluth recommends the Guinness Atkinson and Baron funds. Others that he likes and that appear on at least one of the lists of top-performing focus funds include Columbia Select Large-Cap Value, Axa Loomis Sayles Growth and Parnassus Endeavor.Mr. Davis is a fan of the Baron and Parnassus funds, though he is agnostic about focus funds generally.\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to discern a real advantage investing in concentrated portfolios, but there\u2019s not a big disadvantage, either,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should expect to have a range of outcomes the more concentrated the portfolio is,\u201d he added. \u201cEven some of the best performers over the last five years underperform their peers sometimes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The $17 billion tunnels faced daunting costs and opposition from environmentalists and some Californians who saw it as another in a long line of water heists from the north by Southern California and Central Valley farmers.Mr. Brown insisted that in a time of climate change and drought the tunnels were essential to assure the integrity of a water system central to this state\u2019s economy, as it moves water to farms and the bustling, arid southern parts of the state.The project received a huge boost on Tuesday as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California voted to commit nearly $11 billion to help finance it. It stepped in to fill a financial void created after agriculture districts in the San Joaquin Valley refused to pay for a project, deeming it to be too expensive.The Metropolitan Water District is calculating that it will recapture the money it is investing once the 35-mile tunnels are done and it has water to sell to needy farmers.Potential obstacles lay ahead, including lawsuits and regulatory permits. Still, this project \u2014 which has daunted Mr. Brown throughout his years as governor \u2014 seems as close to reality as ever. \u201cThis is a historic decision that is good for California \u2014 our people, our farms and our natural environment,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s visit to Capitol Hill was highly anticipated in both Silicon Valley and Washington, and the internet was along for the ride Tuesday.There was plenty of jeering and cheering throughout the day, some inside the room and a lot more online. In one particular exchange that caught people\u2019s attention, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah asked Mr. Zuckerberg if it was his intention to keep Facebook free. Mr. Zuckerberg responded affirmatively.\u201cWell, if so, how do you sustain a business model in which users don\u2019t pay for your service?\u201d Mr. Hatch asked. A slight pause followed.\u201cSenator, we run ads,\u201d responded Mr. Zuckerberg, his mouth suddenly curling into a big smile. Others in the room laughed. The internet dug in.\u201cTo my mind, the real issue here is transparency, it\u2019s consumer choice.

{"Headline": "As Trade Tensions Rise, Here Are Some Lessons From Brexit: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Another bank takes steps toward gun safety.\u2022 The next steps in the tariffs tit-for-tat.\u2022 Investigators are looking into the motive behind the shooting at YouTube\u2019s headquarters.Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union provides pointers for investors as President Trump ratchets up trade tensions with China.In the weeks following Britain\u2019s vote in 2016 for \u201cBrexit,\u201d fears grew that the post-war economic order was under serious threat. But European stock markets recovered, including Britain\u2019s. Investors came to see that the European Union was not going to break up, and Britain was not going to erect tall walls around its economy. Looking back, the panicky early reaction to Brexit seems to have sprung more from a fear of the unknown than any big threats to the global trading system. Investors took a deep breath and gained some perspective.Movements in the United States stock market suggests the same thing is happening in response to President Trump\u2019s trade policies. China on Tuesday evening announced the tariffs it plans in retaliation against those President Trump is threatening. Reacting to China\u2019s announcement, the S.&P. 500 index plunged early on Wednesday but recovered strongly to close up 1.2 percent.Investors may believe China\u2019s move will lead to drawn-out negotiations. Here, Brexit is again illustrative. As the back and forth between the European Union and Britain has gone on, investors have gained more clarity and confidence. If talks between the U.S. and China gain steam, the uncertainty now clouding relations between the two countries may gradually clear.But the standoff between the U.S. and China differs in important ways from the Brexit tensions. The U.S., for instance, is in a much stronger position than Britain. China exports far more to the U.S. than the U.S. does to China. Limiting access to the U.S. economy could hurt China\u2019s growth at a time when it is trying to overhaul important economic sectors. If investors believe that the U.S. can successfully exploit its advantages to make China more friendly to foreign businesses, they may even see the trade skirmish as positive for the global economy.But Brexit also flashes a warning to those expecting a big win for Mr. Trump. One of the reasons that the European Union has presented a united front is that it sees Brexit as a threat to its values and goals. Similarly, China may believe that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade attack puts some of its most deeply held aspirations under threat \u2013 and will fight back hard.- Peter EavisAfter Citigroup announced plans to limit firearms sales by business customers, the question was which lenders would be the next to make a move on guns.

Keith Mestrich, said in a news release:\u201cCollectively, banks and lenders have the power to promote responsible business practices from gun manufacturers and distributors, and ultimately contribute to a safer society for all.

The company\u2019s stock is down sharply since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported on how Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired users\u2019 data.The company released the revised estimate of affected users in an extended statement on Wednesday about its plans for handling personal data. The company said it will start alerting users on April 9 about whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.In related Facebook news\u2022 Earlier on Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington had said Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11 about the company\u2019s handling of sensitive user data.And is dragging down the Dow Jones industrial average.

{"Headline": "A Trump Nobel Peace Prize? South Korea\u2019s Leader Likes the Idea", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Several months ago, South Koreans considered President Trump as dangerous as North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, as the two traded threats of nuclear annihilation.Mr. Moon\u2019s endorsement of a Nobel for Mr. Trump, who has faced one ethical scandal after another at home, came as the South Korean leader presided over a meeting of his senior presidential staff on Monday. During the meeting, Mr. Moon received a telegram from Lee Hee-ho, a former first lady of South Korea, congratulating him for a successful summit meeting with Mr. Kim on Friday and wishing him a Nobel Peace Prize.\u201cIt\u2019s really President Trump who should receive it; we can just take peace,\u201d Mr. Moon was quoted by his office as saying.In recent months, Mr. Moon and his senior aides have repeatedly thanked Mr. Trump for making a rapprochement between the Koreas possible. Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d approach of tightening the noose around the North with economic sanctions and military threats was largely responsible for forcing Mr. Kim to the negotiating table, they said.If they were genuinely grateful to Mr. Trump, they were also seen as stoking the ego of the impulsive American leader so that he would continue to support South Korea\u2019s efforts to resolve the North Korean crisis through dialogue.On Monday, Mr. Trump mentioned in a tweet the possibility of meeting Mr. Kim at the border between North and South Korea, where Friday\u2019s meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon was held.Mr. Trump has also been eager to take credit for Mr. Kim\u2019s shift in behavior as the inter-Korean summit has fanned speculation that he could receive the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201cThat\u2019s very nice, thank you. That\u2019s very nice,\u201d a visibly flattered Mr. Trump said in response. \u201cI just want to get the job done.\u201dBut some were skeptical about Mr. Trump\u2019s chances \u2014 including his own son. \u201cThe globalist elite would never give him that win,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Friday.No matter what the likelihood is for Mr. Trump\u2019s getting a Nobel, his public image among South Koreans has been improving markedly as the mood on the Korean Peninsula shifts from fears of war to hopes of peace.During their summit meeting, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon agreed to push for talks with Washington to negotiate a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, an agreement that, to the pleasant surprise of many South Koreans, a usually tempestuous Mr. Trump has eagerly endorsed.Last year, as tensions escalated on the Korean Peninsula, with Mr. Trump\u2019s administration openly threatening military action against North Korea, Mr. Moon publicly denounced such talk, swearing that no such military action would take place without South Korea\u2019s consent. When Mr. Trump visited Seoul in November, weeks after he threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea, protesters took to the streets in Seoul, calling him \u201ca war maniac.\u201dThese days, it is easy to find citizens and political analysts in South Korea who mouth something few would have imagined a few months ago: support for giving Mr. Trump, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon the Nobel Prize together should they achieve lasting peace.Such talk reflects rising hopes for coming discussions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, the first summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea, which could happen by early June.Skeptics, however, say that Mr. Kim might be duping Mr. Moon and Mr. Trump into a false peace.To whet Mr. Kim\u2019s appetite for a deal, Mr. Moon on Friday handed Mr. Kim a computer thumb drive that contained detailed plans to rebuild the North\u2019s decrepit economy if Mr. Kim denuclearizes his country, aides to Mr. Moon said.And when Mr. Kim talked alone with Mr. Moon, without aides, he sought Mr. Moon\u2019s advice for his coming talks with Mr. Trump, they said. Mr. Moon found Mr. Kim forthright and courteous, they said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Is Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, Cuba\u2019s New President?", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut one mystery remained: While nearly everyone knew of Cuba\u2019s president, Ra\u00fal Castro, his handpicked successor, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez, was virtually unknown.So when members of the United States Congress visited Cuba in early 2015, they peppered Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel with questions: What did he think of the revolution that defined the island\u2019s politics and its place on the world stage?\u201cI was born in 1960, after the revolution,\u201d he told the group, according to lawmakers in the meeting. \u201cI\u2019m not the best person to answer your questions on the subject.\u201dMr. D\u00edaz-Canel, who became Cuba\u2019s new president on Thursday, the day before his 58th birthday, has spent his entire life in the service of a revolution he did not fight.He took the helm of government on Thursday morning to a standing ovation from the National Assembly, which elected him in a nearly unanimous vote. Mr. Castro embraced him, lifting the younger man\u2019s arm in triumph.Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s slow and steady climb up the ranks of the bureaucracy has come through unflagging loyalty to the socialist cause \u2014 he \u201cis not an upstart nor improvised,\u201d Mr. Castro has said \u2014 but he largely stayed behind the scenes until recent years.Now, as leader, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel is suddenly taking on a difficult balancing act. Most expect him to be a president of continuity, especially because he arrives in the shadow of Ra\u00fal Castro, who will remain the head of the armed forces and the Communist Party, arguably Cuba\u2019s most powerful institutions.Such credentials have been the bedrock of political power in Cuba ever since Fidel Castro seized control of the nation in 1959. In the ensuing years, the Castros ruled over Cuba with ironclad control, bolstered by a cadre of loyalists, nearly all of whom had fought alongside them in the revolution.In the end, the most effective opposition to the Castro brothers was time.After opening up the economy to private investment and entrepreneurialism, expanding travel in and out of the country and re-establishing ties with the great enemy, the United States, Ra\u00fal Castro has selected Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel to fill his shoes.But \u201che is someone who has very little exposure to U.S. political or cultural figures,\u201d Daniel P. Erikson, a former State Department official, said of Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel. \u201cFrankly, he isn\u2019t that well-known in the rest of Latin America, either.\u201dIn his speech before the National Assembly, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel offered many of the same revolutionary talking points of his predecessors, but perhaps with less of the verve or creativity of Fidel Castro or the gravitas of Ra\u00fal.Ra\u00fal Castro said Thursday that he thought Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel would serve two terms as president, for a total of 10 years. After that, Mr. Castro said, he envisioned Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel taking over as party leader in 2021, when Mr. Castro suggested that he would retire from that post for good. This, to some, is a glimpse of the future leadership structure of Cuba after the Castros.Ever since Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel was named first vice president in 2013, Cubans and Cuba watchers alike have scrambled to find out more about the enigmatic heir apparent, combing through his track record as party leader in the provinces of Villa Clara and Holgu\u00edn, and later as minister of higher education, for clues on how he will lead.In each position, according to those who knew him at the time, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel has been a quiet but effective leader, seemingly open to change. Many called him a good listener, while others described him as approachable, free of the rigidness and inaccessibility of typical party chiefs.Through it all, he has also been a relentless defender of the revolution and the principles and politics it brought.Stories of his Everyman qualities have spread widely in recent years: how he rode his bike to work instead of taking a government vehicle during gas shortages; how he defended the rights of a gay club in Santa Clara in the face of protests; how he patiently listened to academics grouse (sometimes about him) as minister of higher education.More recently, he was a leading voice in the push for internet access in Cuba, arguing that the nation could not seal itself off from the outside world. Though his beliefs remain very much within the party line, those who know him say he does not adhere to the belief that Cuba can exempt itself from the modernization necessary to participate in the global economy.But in Cuba, the continuum of political thinking is not black and white. Often, conventional definitions of progressives versus hard-liners do not apply. Leaders can be both, and Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel is an example of that. While he is seen as open to the ideas of others, as a younger man he led a campaign to stifle students who read and discussed literature that was not approved by the Communist Party, according to those who knew him at the time.Last year, a video was leaked of Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel addressing a group of party officials. In it, he lambastes the United States, claiming that Cuba had no responsibility to meet its demands under the reconciliation brokered by President Barack Obama.He then went on a diatribe against a website whose work he considered subversive. He told fellow officials that the government would shut it down \u2014 no matter whether people considered it censorship.The video was seen as a way for Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel to shore up his credentials with hard-line factions within the government, and yet a review of his career shows that he has not shied away from confronting activities deemed out of bounds by the government, either.Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel grew up in the central province of Villa Clara, about three hours from Havana, the son of a schoolteacher and a factory worker. He studied electrical engineering at the Central University of Las Villas, where he was active in political life.He was viewed from an early age as a rising star within Cuba\u2019s Communist Party.As a young man, he joined the Union of Young Communists, the party\u2019s youth league, where he stood out among his peers. He later worked as a bodyguard to Ra\u00fal Castro. According to a friend who knew him at the time, the assignment allowed him to show loyalty to the cause, and drew Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel close to both Ra\u00fal and Fidel Castro.He served three years in the army, another node of power in the country, after which he resumed his slow climb up the party ladder.In his 20s, he was named the party\u2019s liaison to Nicaragua, the only other Communist government in the region at the time, a posting viewed as important to the Cuban government.Rodolfo Stusser, 72, recalled meeting Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel in the late 1980s, while working as a doctor during Nicaragua\u2019s civil war. Dr. Stusser felt the other doctors around him were lazy, not serious about their work. And just as he began liking his life in Nicaragua, he was being deployed elsewhere. He took his complaint to the Cuban Embassy, where he ran into a young Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel, who offered him a ride.Dr. Stusser unloaded, listing the various injustices he felt were being visited on him. It was almost therapeutic, he recalled. Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel, an up-and-coming member in the party at the time, sat quietly and listened for the duration of the 40-minute drive, he recalled.\u201cHe just heard me,\u201d Dr. Stusser said. \u201cHe did not say anything at all. It helped me.\u201dNot long after, Dr. Stusser found his fortunes reversed in Nicaragua. He was allowed to stay. And an official who was giving him the runaround made time to see him.Dr. Stusser, who defected in 2010 and now lives in South Florida, always suspected that the soft-spoken Communist Party official who listened but did not speak had quietly worked his connections in Havana and Managua to sort out his issues.Juan Juan Almeida, 52, recalls hearing Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s name come up years later in conversations with his father, who was a prominent member of the Cuban Communist Party at the time. He remembers his father coming home one night in 1993 after a meeting in which officials discussed future leaders of the country.Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura, a member of the Cuban old guard, proposed a slate of young leaders and Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s name was among them.\u201cRa\u00fal responded: He\u2019s trustworthy, but too young,\u201d Mr. Almeida remembers his father telling him after the meeting. \u201cThis was the first time I had ever heard the name Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel.\u201dFrom then on, he said, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s name came up often. He moved from one prominent job to another \u2014 including provincial posts where he developed a reputation as an effective and loyal functionary.As first secretary in Villa Clara Province, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel came to office during the so-called special period, when the generous aid flowing to Cuba from the Soviet Union was abruptly cut off after its collapse.Back then, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel took his bicycle to work rather than ride in the air-conditioned car he was entitled to as a prominent leader. It was the sort of move people still talk about in Villa Clara and its capital, Santa Clara.Mr. Almeida, who also defected to the United States, said he and Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel had many mutual friends, in particular musicians and artists whom Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel had taken the time to support in their careers. The new president also has a son who is a musician in Argentina, Mr. Almeida added.\u201cHe mixes with the intellectual class, goes to concerts and is close to young people,\u201d Mr. Almeida said. \u201cAll of the people I know who we have in common speak very well of him. They don\u2019t speak of him in dictatorial fashion.\u201dAcademics and others in Havana declined to be interviewed about Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel, because the government did not give them permission.In Santa Clara, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel is remembered for his Bermuda shorts at a time when party officials wore more formal attire, and for wearing his hair long.His beliefs also skewed liberal, residents say. He lent his support to one of the country\u2019s only gay clubs, El Mejunje. When it opened decades ago, the club was a point of contention. But Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel, who took his children to the club when it hosted children\u2019s activities, consistently backed the club in the face of controversy.\u201cHe supported us anytime there was a complaint made against us,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n Silverio G\u00f3mez, the club\u2019s director. \u201cHe was an ally. And one day when I saw him he said, \u2018You can keep counting on my support and my understanding.\u2019\u201dYet some saw Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s persona as crafted and less genuine than is often supposed. Sure, he rode his bike to and from work. But he was always trailed by his personal security in vehicles, others said.\u201cIt was a bit of demagoguery,\u201d said Guillermo Fari\u00f1as, a well-known dissident and Cuban psychologist who grew up with Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel in Villa Clara. \u201cIn terms of the gasoline, he was on a bicycle, but there were cars with security going behind him. It was a bit a manipulation of the people.\u201dMr. Fari\u00f1as recalled how one night, while he was hospitalized, the power went out. This was during the time of greatest shortages in Cuba, in the 1990s.At about 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel, who was first secretary in the province, went to the hospital and began going from room to room, checking on patients and apologizing for the blackout.Even back then, Mr. Fari\u00f1as was a known dissident. He was in the hospital recovering from a hunger strike.\u201cWhen they were outside my room, I could hear the state security agents telling him, \u2018No, don\u2019t go to that room. That\u2019s a counterrevolutionary\u2019s room,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cD\u00edaz-Canel was like, \u2018What do you mean, don\u2019t go to that room? Of course I\u2019ll go to that room!\u2019\u201dMr. D\u00edaz-Canel entered, shook Mr. Fari\u00f1as\u2019 hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about politics.\u201dThe men chatted briefly before Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel rushed off to see the next patient.\u201cMy impression was that he was doing politics,\u201d Mr. Fari\u00f1as said.Mr. Fari\u00f1as also recalled how, after graduation, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel became a teacher and party functionary at his university, joining a nationwide campaign to fight \u201cnegative tendencies\u201d in Cuba.\u201cThey tried to convince people that if you were not a real communist, you had to be sanctioned,\u201d Mr. Fari\u00f1as said of Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel. \u201cHe was the head of that at the university.\u201dIt was part of the duality of Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel, he added. Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel could be accessible, friendly and modern \u2014 mingling with locals, playing basketball with the youth and listening to rock music. But he could also be a staunch advocate of communism and the revolution, willing to silence critics.\u201cHe was very active, very militant and very unconditional in his loyalty to the regime,\u201d Mr. Fari\u00f1as said.Azam Ahmed reported from Havana, and Frances Robles from Miami.

{"Headline": "I.M.F. Sees Global Risk in Trump Trade Threats", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The global economy is looking stronger than it has in years, but as world leaders gather here this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund, they will be particularly attuned to possible economic disruptions stemming from decisions being made just a few blocks away at the White House.In a report released Tuesday morning, the International Monetary Fund said stronger business investment and trade were buoying the world\u2019s economy. Global growth is on track to reach an annual rate of 3.9 percent this year and next, propelled by the economies of Europe, Japan, China and the United States. That would be up from 3.8 percent in 2017, which was the strongest growth since 2011.But the spring version of the World Economic Outlook, the fund\u2019s semiannual report card on the health of the international economy, outlined big risks \u2014 including the growing likelihood of a trade war and government policies that could overheat the United States economy.In a news conference detailing the report Monday morning, Maurice Obstfeld, the director of the research department, said there was a particular risk that fears of a trade war could dampen business investment and spark a sell-off in stock markets and other financial assets.\u201cI suspect if you keep poking at the economic expansion, it could turn around and bite you,\u201d Mr. Obstfeld said.\u201cThere can be no doubt about it, the big elephant in the room continues to be trade policy,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.Companies are already paying higher prices for materials such as steel and soybeans and are beginning to feel uncertain about how to plan for the future, Mr. Slok said. \u201cThis is hanging as a big dark cloud over the spring meetings this year,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to economic policy has sometimes brought him into conflict with international organizations, which he has criticized as ineffectual. The I.M.F. cautioned Tuesday that the multilateral, rules-based trading system of the World Trade Organization was \u201cin danger of being torn apart.\u201dAnother risk is Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut which, along with other budget changes, is expected to boost the United States economy by 1.2 percent by 2020, according to the I.M.F. There is concern the tax cuts could cause the economy to overheat, spurring inflation, which in turn could prompt the Federal Reserve and other central banks to raise interest rates. That could derail future growth and cause financial problems in fast-growing, but risky, emerging markets.In the short run, the I.M.F. expects the tax cuts to help lift economic activity. It forecasts the United States economy to grow by 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.7 percent in 2019 \u2014 up from 2.3 percent in 2017 and faster than the fund\u2019s previous projections.Speaking at a rally in Hialeah, Fla., on Monday, Mr. Trump cheered the effects of the tax cut and the strength of the economy. \u201cThis could be one of the greatest booms ever,\u201d the president said. \u201cCongratulations, enjoy your money.\u201dOutside the United States, global growth is roaring along, lifted by surging exports to China and strong consumption in India. Prices of commodities are going up after two years of declines, and that is good news for countries, like Brazil and Russia, that are big exporters of oil, gas, metal and agricultural products.As it did in earlier reports, the I.M.F. emphasized that the prolonged period of economic growth would eventually end and that policymakers needed to act now prepare for the next downturn. The fund urged governments to make tough adjustments to increase their economic productivity now, while growth remained strong.\u201cThe present good times will not last for long, but sound policies can extend the current upswing,\u201d Mr. Obstfeld said.Advertisement"}

Storing even a fraction of that would not be easy. But it\u2019s not impossible. How Oman\u2019s Rocks Could Help Save the PlanetIBRA, Oman \u2014 In the arid vastness of this corner of the Arabian Peninsula, out where goats and the occasional camel roam, rocks form the backdrop practically every way you look.But the stark outcrops and craggy ridges are more than just scenery. Some of these rocks are hard at work, naturally reacting with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turning it into stone.Veins of white carbonate minerals run through slabs of dark rock like fat marbling a steak. Carbonate surrounds pebbles and cobbles, turning ordinary gravel into natural mosaics.Scientists say that if this natural process, called carbon mineralization, could be harnessed, accelerated and applied inexpensively on a huge scale \u2014 admittedly some very big \u201cifs\u201d \u2014 it could help fight climate change. Rocks could remove some of the billions of tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide that humans have pumped into the air since the beginning of the Industrial Age.Area ofdetailSaudiArabiaOmanYemenDubaiGulf of OmanUniteDArabEmiratesMuscatRockformationIbraOMAN50 milesArea ofdetailSaudiArabiaOmanU.A.E.YemenGulf of OmanMuscatRockformationIbraOMAN50 milesArea ofdetailSaudiArabiaOmanYemenDubaiGulf of OmanUniteDArabEmiratesMuscatRockformationIbraOMANSaudiArabia50 milesArea ofdetailIranSaudiArabiaOmanYemenDubaiGulf of OmanUniteDArabEmiratesMuscatRockformationIbraOMANSaudiArabia50 milesIranDubaiArea ofdetailSaudiArabiaOmanGulf of OmanYemenUniteDArabEmiratesMuscatRockformationIbraOMANSaudiArabia50 milesThe New York Times | Source:  Peter B. Kelemen, Lamont-Doherty Earth ObservatoryAlthough many researchers dismiss direct-air capture as logistically or economically impractical, especially given the billions of tons of gas that would have to be removed to have an impact, some say it may have to be considered if other efforts to counter global warming are ineffective.The carbon-capturing formations here, consisting largely of a rock called peridotite, are in a slice of oceanic crust and the mantle layer below it that was thrust up on land by tectonic forces nearly 100 million years ago. Erosion has resulted in a patchy zone about 200 miles long, up to 25 miles wide and several miles thick in the northern part of the country, including here in the outskirts of Ibra, a dusty inland city of 50,000. Even the bustling capital, Muscat, on the Gulf of Oman, has a pocket of peridotite practically overlooking Sultan Qaboos bin Said\u2019s palace.Peridotite normally is miles below the earth\u2019s surface. When the rocks are exposed to air or water as they are here, Dr. Kelemen said, they are like a giant battery with a lot of chemical potential. \u201cThey\u2019re really, really far from equilibrium with the atmosphere and surface water,\u201d he said.While the formations here are special, they are not unique. Similar though smaller ones are found in Northern California, Papua New Guinea and Albania, among other places.Dr. Kelemen first came to Oman in the 1990s, as the thrust-up rocks were one of the best sites in the world to study what was then his area of research, the formation and structure of the earth\u2019s crust. He\u2019d noticed the carbonate veins but thought they must be millions of years old.\u201cThere was a feeling that carbon mineralization was really slow and not worth thinking about,\u201d he said.But in 2007, he had some of the carbonate dated. Almost all of it was less than 50,000 years old, suggesting that the mineralization process was actually much faster.\u201cSo then I said, O.K., this is pretty cool,\u201d Dr. Kelemen said.For much of this decade he has also led a multinational effort to drill boreholes in the rock, a $4 million project that is only partly related to carbon capture. In March the drilling was nearing completion, with scientists and technicians sending instruments down the holes, which are up to 1,300 feet deep, to better characterize the rock layers.There is a lot that is unknown about such an approach, however. For one thing, while pumping water deep into the earth, where temperatures and pressures are higher, could make the process of mineralization go tens of thousands of times faster, so much carbonate might form that the water flow would stop. \u201cYou might clog everything up, and it would all come to a screeching halt,\u201d Dr. Kelemen said.Dr. Kelemen and Dr. Aines have had preliminary discussions with California officials about the possibility of experimenting there. \u201cWe would certainly be a willing and eager partner to help them with it,\u201d said David Bunn, director of the State Department of Conservation.Such rocks are found in large amounts at mines around the world, as waste tailings. Platinum, nickel and diamonds, in particular, are mined from rock that has a lot of carbon-mineralization potential.\u201cWe don\u2019t think from a scientific perspective it would be that difficult or expensive \u2014 we can be carbon-neutral,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the mining industry that is extraordinary.\u201d\u201cRelative to the global problem, it\u2019s really just a drop in the bucket,\u201d Dr. Mervine said. \u201cBut it sets a really good precedent.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. While it accounts for four-fifths of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, it is not the most prevalent heat-trapping gas.

They toured more than a half-dozen potential sites for a new campus and talked about the technical talent available in the area.But they also did something that surprised local officials: Quiz them on how, if Amazon chooses to settle there, the company could avoid the problems it confronts in Seattle, the only hometown it has ever known.If Amazon moves in, bringing up to 50,000 high-paying jobs to town over time, how would the officials deal with traffic on its roads? And how would the company\u2019s tax dollars contribute to the creation of affordable housing in the region?\u201cI think they feel in Seattle they\u2019re the scapegoat every time there\u2019s an issue in the community and traffic,\u201d said Sam Bailey, vice president of economic development at the Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, which is managing the area\u2019s bid for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.Amazon wrapped up its visits in mid-April to all 20 finalist locations for its HQ2, as Amazon calls its second headquarters. The company is now following up with the cities, from Los Angeles to Indianapolis to Toronto, seeking further information as it narrows its search.The company has a long wish list, including plentiful flights at local airports, a stable, business-friendly government and nearby recreational opportunities for employees.But local officials did not anticipate Amazon\u2019s interest in how to tackle some of the troubles that have turned it into a polarizing symbol of Seattle\u2019s booming economy. The e-commerce giant is celebrated by many in Seattle for being the city\u2019s biggest employer and adding tremendous wealth to the area. But it is villainized by others for bringing too much change, too quickly.In Denver, Amazon and local officials talked at length about public transit options and the creation of bike lanes, said Mr. Bailey. They even discussed the possibility of Amazon financing a new light-rail station for its system, though no commitments were made, he said.In Atlanta, the company spoke to a representative of the Westside Future Fund, a nonprofit working to prevent displacement in an area being redeveloped. The fund will pay for the increases in property taxes for residents who have lived in the area since at least 2016 so that they\u2019re not priced out of their homes.In Amazon\u2019s visit to Toronto, the company discussed its potential impact on the labor market and the affordability of housing, said Ed Clark, the business adviser to Kathleen Wynne, the premier of the province of Ontario.\u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about what could be gentrification or displacement, how do we deal with that,\u201d said Aisha Glover, president and chief executive of the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation, which is involved in the New Jersey city\u2019s bid.Adam Sedo, a spokesman for Amazon, confirmed that public transport and housing affordability were important topics in conversations with the finalist locations but declined to elaborate further.While Amazon is not the only reason for all the change, it has become the most convenient target for groups worried about home prices and paralyzing traffic.\u201cThere was clearly a sensitivity both to the real and to the perceived impact when they come in to a place,\u201d Mr. Clark said, referring to Amazon\u2019s discussions in Toronto.\u201cThe pace of change has been so fast and housing supply has not kept up and the transit system has not kept up,\u201d said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research group in Seattle focused on sustainability. \u201cThere\u2019s a visceral public reaction to the whole rapid pace of change in the city symbolized by, and perhaps blamed too much on, Amazon.\u201dIn May, Seattle\u2019s City Council plans to vote on a tax \u2014 dubbed the \u201cAmazon Tax\u201d by locals \u2014 on the city\u2019s largest employers. The tax is expected to raise $75 million annually, with most of the money being funneled into building affordable housing. The remainder will go to support services for the homeless.\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re getting massive pushback from ordinary people in Seattle,\u201d said Ms. Sawant.Growing cities with thriving local tech scenes are already grappling with affordable housing challenges, even without Amazon. Mr. Clark, the adviser involved in Toronto\u2019s bid, said it helps that Amazon isn\u2019t ducking the problem.\"To have someone coming in and worried about this issue and wanting to work with you to solve the issue is a big plus,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 T-Mobile and Sprint have their eye on regulators.\u2022 HNA is set to drop its pursuit of SkyBridge Capital\u2022 How close are the U.S. and Europe to a trade war?But from that, Mr. Legere sought to change the way U.S. wireless providers did business:\u2022 Lowering prices\u2022 Ending some long-term contract requirements\u2022 Offering unlimited data plans\u201cThe company took off like a rocketship and has sustained that momentum ever since the AT&T merger was blocked,\u201d the analyst Craig Moffett of the research firm MoffettNathanson told me in an interview.More on the legacy of Mr. Legere, from my and Cecilia\u2019s story on the deal:Those policies helped T-Mobile add nearly 40 million customers over the last five years, with 5 million new customers added last year alone. AT&T, Verizon and Sprint all followed suit, and in recent years the overall price of basic wireless plans has stayed flat or fallen, according to Obama-era regulators.The Un-carrier campaign helped propel T-Mobile ahead of Sprint in 2015. As of Dec. 31., the company had 58.7 million retail subscribers, compared to Sprint\u2019s 40.9 million. T-Mobile\u2019s market value also outstripped that of Sprint\u2019s, contributing to the structure of Sunday\u2019s deal: Mr. Legere would become C.E.O. of the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name.In an ironic twist, completion of the Sprint deal would put T-Mobile ahead of its former suitor, AT&T, in terms of retail subscribers. AT&T had 93.2 million at the end of 2017.But Mr. Moffett said that the very success of Mr. Legere and T-Mobile could pose problems for the Sprint deal, since it proves that regulators\u2019 opposition to the two companies\u2019 effort to merge in 2014 was justified.When I asked about the tweet in a phone interview on Sunday \u2014 which also involved Marcelo Claure, Sprint\u2019s C.E.O. \u2014 Mr. Legere chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to remember tweets from 2014?\u201d he responded.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe 5G aspects that are critical for the country and critical for us really was the flipping point as to this is the time.\u201d\u201cServices are going to be broadened, prices are going to go down, speeds are going to go up. The 5G capability is going to be beyond anything the United States has seen before. Jobs are going to go up from day one.\u201cIf you liked the competition before, you\u2019re going to love what\u2019s coming with this one. \u201dT-Mobile agreed to buy Sprint in an all-stock deal, which valued Sprint at $26.5 billion or $6.62 a share. At that deal price, Mr. Claure\u2019s long-term award of 10 million Sprint shares is worth $66.2 million. Those shares \u201cwill fully vest if he\u2019s terminated within 18 months of the deal\u2019s completion, or if his responsibilities change materially.\u201dHe also \u201cis eligible for cash severance of about $11.6 million and $54,000 of other benefits.\u201dSo far this year, companies and other buyers have announced $1.68 trillion of acquisitions, according to Dealogic. That\u2019s the biggest total through the first four months of a year on record, topping the $1.64 trillion of deals struck in 2007.Merger activity is also on a record pace in the United States. Acquirers have struck $674 billion of deals for U.S. companies through April 30, the highest level on record and exceeding the $607 billion agreed to through the same period in 2007.Whether they will succeed is another matter. Michael and Cecilia Kang point out that while the F.C.C. commissioner, Ajit Pai, has signaled an open mind toward mergers, many antitrust staffers at the Justice Department are the same people who opposed the deal in 2014.No matter how much hyperbole Sprint and T-Mobile expend, it is hard to see how the deal will pass muster with regulators.\u201cIt would not surprise me if they can come up with an economist with a model that says this is all unicorns and cupcakes,\u201d said Michael Kades, a former lawyer at the F.T.C. who is now the director of markets and competition policy for Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cBut the market concentration is presumptively anticompetitive.\u201dFrom AnnaMaria Andriotis, Telis Demos and Emily Glazer of the WSJ:The financial companies have explored creating a new credit-card code for firearms dealers, similar to how they code restaurants, or department stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Another idea would require merchants to share information about specific firearm products consumers are buying, some of the people said.If the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a \u201cbest practices\u201d policy \u2014 like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick\u2019s follow \u2014 and the ones that don\u2019t. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with.But such a move might concern opponents of gun control, who worry that keeping tabs on firearms sales would be contrary to the government\u2019s hands-off approach to monitoring such transactions. And then there are general privacy concerns: Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown, told the WSJ: \u201cThere\u2019s the slippery slope danger if it\u2019s guns today maybe it is pornography tomorrow and the day after it\u2019s right-wing literature.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe country says it will refuse to discuss President Trump\u2019s two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks.Keith Bradsher of the NYT reports:The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America\u2019s $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing\u2019s $300 billion plan to bankroll the country\u2019s industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft.What\u2019s behind China\u2019s stance? Beijing feels its economy has become big enough and resilient enough to stand up to the United States.Mr. Koum, who co-founded WhatsApp and had insisted that strong encryption be built into the service, was perturbed by the amount of data that Facebook collected on people and had advocated for stronger protections of that information, the executive said.Mr. Koum\u2019s exit is the highest-profile departure from Facebook after months of controversy at the social network.The gathering reliably draws leaders from Wall Street, Hollywood and sports to Los Angeles to discuss trade, health care, investing and more. This year\u2019s conference will touch on hot topics like the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the #MeToo movement, the planned talks with North Korea, and the backlash against Silicon Valley.Attendees include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo, Leon Black of Apollo Global Management and Eric Schmidt of Google.The worries of some critics, according to Nathaniel Popper:Countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity.More from Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Rachel Abrams:While Nike executives have told investors that the women\u2019s category was a crucial part of its revenue growth strategy, former employees said it was not given the budget it needed to roll out the sophisticated marketing campaigns that were the hallmark of traditional men\u2019s sports, like basketball.Advertisement"}

Instead, they\u2019ve toted up gains in holdings as diverse as Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group and Wix.com.Many people misunderstand the investment case for Dunkin\u2019, associating the company with its doughnuts and its omnipresence in the Northeast, particularly New England, Mr. Bonavico said. Its promise instead lies in caffeinated beverages and in the company\u2019s potential for growth in the rest of the United States.\u201cCoffee is the major driver \u2014 it\u2019s a daily purchase, it\u2019s habit-forming, and it\u2019s got a 90 percent margin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s an enormous opportunity for them to add franchisees west of the Mississippi.\u201dWix, for its part, is known as a website builder for small businesses.

{"Headline": "Trump, Having Denounced Amazon\u2019s Shipping Deal, Orders Review of Postal Service", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump abruptly issued an executive order on Thursday demanding an evaluation of the Postal Service\u2019s finances, asserting the power of his office weeks after accusing Amazon, the online retail giant, of not paying its fair share in postage.In the executive order, issued just before 9 p.m., Mr. Trump created a task force to examine the service\u2019s \u201cunsustainable financial path\u201d and directed the new panel to \u201cconduct a thorough evaluation of the operations and finances of the U.S.P.S.\u201dThe president does not mention Amazon in the order, but it is clear that he intends for the panel to substantiate his repeated claim that the financial arrangement between the Postal Service and Amazon, its biggest shipper of packages, is a money loser.Postal Service experts and even Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers have privately urged him to back off the accusations, noting that the huge number of packages shipped by Amazon is actually helping to keep the Postal Service financially solvent.While the service has consistently reported net losses for a decade, much of its financial woes are the result of a prolonged decline in the volume of marketing mail and first-class mail. The service makes money on packages, and Amazon is the service\u2019s biggest single shipper of packages.\u201cThat amounts to Billions of Dollars,\u201d he continued.Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated attacks on Amazon have focused in part on the company\u2019s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. People close to Mr. Trump have said the president\u2019s tirades against the retailer often come after The Post has published negative articles about him.At one point last month, Amazon\u2019s stock price tumbled after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets and a suggestion that he might direct the government to take action against the company.Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment late Thursday.But until Thursday night, Mr. Trump had limited his attacks to ones on Twitter. The White House had said the president did not have immediate plans to take any action against Amazon and had given no warning that the executive order was coming.In the order, the president calls on the task force to examine various parts of the Postal Service\u2019s business, including ones that appear to directly involve large parts of Amazon\u2019s business.That includes the \u201cexpansion and pricing\u201d of the package delivery market and the service\u2019s role in competing with other, private delivery companies. The task force should look at the decline in mail volume and the implications for the service, Mr. Trump said.The order also calls for the task force to look at the service\u2019s \u201cuniversal service obligation,\u201d which requires the service to deliver to everyone in the United States, given changes in technology and e-commerce.Some parts of the order appear to hint at further privatization of the Postal Service, indicating that members of the task force should examine \u201cthe U.S.P.S. role in the U.S. economy and in rural areas, communities, and small towns.\u201dIn the order, Mr. Trump said that the longstanding financial problems at the Postal Service demand some kind of action.\u201cA number of factors, including the steep decline in First-Class Mail volume, coupled with legal mandates that compel the U.S.P.S. to incur substantial and inflexible costs, have resulted in a structural deficit,\u201d Mr. Trump says in the order. \u201cThe U.S.P.S. is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout.\u201dIt is unclear how quickly the task force will be assembled, or when its review might result in changes at the Postal Service that could directly affect Amazon and other shippers.In May, Mr. Trump created a similar commission to examine what he said was evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the 2016 election \u2014 a claim that was repeatedly debunked by election experts from both major political parties.But he dissolved the commission in January after several legal challenges and a lack of cooperation from Democratic and Republican election officials in a number of states.In the case of the Postal Service order on Thursday night, Mr. Trump demanded that a report of findings be delivered to him by summer\u2019s end. He urged the task force to recommend administrative and legislative changes that could be made.Mr. Trump\u2019s task force does not address the president\u2019s other complaint about Amazon: that the online retailer fails to pay sales taxes, giving it an unfair advantage over brick-and-mortar businesses.In fact, while Amazon used to benefit from tax-free sales, it now charges sales tax on the sale of virtually all of its own products. Many third-party merchants who use the service to sell their own goods on Amazon\u2019s sites still do not charge sales tax.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting from Washington, and Nick Wingfield from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Shipping Costs Have Put Amazon in a Bind: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Does Amazon have its shipping costs under control?\u2022 What will come out of the Merkel-Trump meeting?\u2022 Why Deutsche Bank was so late to make necessary cuts.\u2022 More complaints have emerged about NBC News\u2019s response to harassment allegations.Amazon\u2019s shipping costs have suddenly become a hot subject, not just to President Trump, but also to the 100 million people who have Amazon Prime.Higher shipping costs are a reason Amazon is raising the cost of Prime membership to $119 a year from $99.But a 20 percent hike is a lot for even a popular service, and it could turn customers off. So why did Amazon do it? The e-commerce giant\u2019s results provide some clues.Members of Prime get free shipping, though their membership fees partially pay for that perk. As the Prime program covers more goods, it\u2019s getting more expensive for Amazon. \u201cOur two-day shipping, it\u2019s now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014,\u201d Brian T. Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s C.F.O., said on a conference call Thursday when announcing the increase in the Prime membership fee.The cost pressures from shipping are getting uncomfortable for Amazon. Worldwide shipping costs totaled $6.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, equivalent to 22.5 percent of Amazon\u2019s sales from its online stores during the period. That\u2019s up from 2017, when quarterly shipping costs averaged 19.9 percent of online sales. By bringing shipping costs back down to 20 percent of online sales, Amazon could, in theory, save over $2.5 billion a year (2.5 percent of annualized first-quarter sales comes to roughly $2.8 billion.)To save money, Amazon could offer free shipping on fewer goods, but that could undermine the company\u2019s efforts to bolster sales. And Amazon doesn\u2019t need to do that if it can increase its Prime fees, to help recoup the higher shipping costs. But the fee increase may not be enough. Charging 100 million Prime members an extra $20 per year, in theory, raises \u201conly\u201c $2 billion.- Peter EavisMore on her challenge, from the NYT:Few leaders seem less personally in sync with Mr. Trump than Ms. Merkel. Estranged by widely diverging temperaments and leadership styles, the two leaders have also clashed on substance \u2014 from climate change and military spending to Germany\u2019s chronic, yawning trade surplus with the United States, a particular bugbear of the president.Or as a former State Department official told the NYT, \u201cMerkel is going to Washington and it looks like the U.S. just doesn\u2019t care.\u201d But a foreign relations expert said, \u201cNever underestimate Merkel.\u201dA combination of the two companies would complete one of the telecommunications industry\u2019s most long-awaited transactions and would create the third-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 127 million customers. Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to negotiate a merger twice before.Analysts have argued, and Sprint and T-Mobile themselves have acknowledged, that the companies need greater scale and more resources to better compete against the industry\u2019s leaders, Verizon and AT&T.Should the deal be completed, only three companies would dominate the market in the United States for cellphone service. It is unclear whether the transaction would get regulatory approval. A previous round of merger talks ended in 2014, having drawn strong opposition from the Obama administration.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat Mr. Ubben had to say: \u201cThe management and board of FOX has done a superb job of steering the company through a time of transition for the entertainment industry.\u201dWhat Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had to say: \u201cJeff has been an important partner during a transformational period. Our board and, ultimately, our shareholders, have benefited enormously from his many contributions.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Nonresidential fixed investment \u2014 what businesses spend on equipment, software, buildings and intellectual property \u2014 increased at a solid 6.1 percent.\u2022 Business spending on equipment climbed 4.7 percent, down from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Bigger pictureEconomists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy\u2019s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two.Over the longer term, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.\u2022 Hubris: Unlike rivals, Deutsche Bank didn\u2019t raise capital after the financial crisis, ultimately leaving it significantly weaker. By the end of last year, its tangible equity capital ratio was still below JPMorgan Chase in 2011. (Perhaps Germany\u2019s banking regulator should have applied more pressure, as Switzerland\u2019s did.)\u2022 Fear: Did Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders worry about scaling back the investment bank because of its huge importance for revenue? (Last year, it provided 54 percent.) And about the cost of unwinding some trades?The news organization asserted that the complaints that led to Matt Lauer being ousted from the \u201cToday\u201d show were the first of their kind. Others disagree:What NBC News has done: Brought in a consultant for in-person sexual harassment prevention seminars and pledged to share the results of an internal review.The online video giant has largely avoided the political heat that has burned Facebook, but it has still lurched from crisis to crisis, particularly over upsetting videos.The idea is that someday humans will be able to train the machines, in a similar manner, to sniff out misinformation, smut, and abuse.Sure, there\u2019s logic to it, in the face of the threat from Netflix and Amazon. But as the two companies continue to bicker over price and executive chairs, is there another reason Shari Redstone is pushing the idea so hard, when other CBS shareholders seem uninterested?What seems to be driving Shari Redstone is familial score-settling, a quest for victory over her father, who never wanted her to have a role in either Viacom or CBS. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of a person who was mistreated by her father,\u201d said the source who recently noted Sumner\u2019s physical condition, and has known the father and daughter for an extensive period of time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sparing Consumers Tariff Burden, Trump Hit Manufacturing", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the escalating economic showdown between the United States and China, President Trump is trying to put American shoppers first. The administration did not place tariffs on necessities like shoes and clothes, and mostly spared smartphones from the 25 percent levy on Chinese goods announced this week.But by shielding consumers, Mr. Trump has put American manufacturers \u2014 a group he has championed \u2014 in the cross hairs of a potential global trade war. If the measures stand, along with China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs, they could snuff out a manufacturing recovery just beginning to gain steam.\u201cIf you want to spare the consumer so you don\u2019t get this massive backlash against your tariffs, then there goes manufacturing, because that\u2019s what\u2019s left,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThe irony is, you cannot spare manufacturing from anything because manufacturing is globally integrated. The sector sources its parts and components from all over the world.\u201dThat intricate supply chain often runs directly between the two countries, sometimes in both directions. Chinese factories make wing panels and doors for Boeing\u2019s Next Generation 737 planes, which are assembled by union workers in Renton, Wash. General Motors makes its Buick Envision, a sport-utility vehicle, in Shandong Province, and sells it to American consumers. Construction workers in Denver use building materials manufactured in China, made in part from ethane gas produced in Texas.A central aim of Mr. Trump\u2019s America First agenda is to bring back pieces of the supply chain lying outside the country. The tariffs announced this week are just a bargaining point in a broader negotiation between the United States and China over trade.\u201cThey are trying to force end-product manufacturers here to use more American content by making it more expensive for them to use Chinese content,\u201d said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has said that the administration carefully conceived the tariffs using an algorithm that would \u201cmaximize the impact on China and minimize the impact on U.S. consumers.\u201dThe result is a list of more than 1,300 targets, many of them obscure products that may not deliver a direct hit to consumers\u2019 wallets. The victims include industrial robots, chemicals, medical devices and heavy machinery used in everything from processing food to crushing rock.Such industries have been a vibrant piece of the economy, adding 224,000 jobs in the past year, the strongest growth since the recession ended nearly nine years ago. But underpinning that rebound has been a strong global appetite for American goods \u2014 demand that could now be weakened.\u201cThis is a pretty tenuous recovery, and employment is still at much lower levels than it was before the crisis,\u201d said Mark Muro, an economist at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThis is not a super dynamic, healthy industry.\u201dRecent job growth has been concentrated in industries that could be affected by American tariffs on China, Chinese tariffs on the United States, or both.President Trump\u2019s tariffs against steel and aluminum imports, designed to protect blue-collar workers, could instead undermine their livelihood.Some of the strongest gains in the past year have come from makers of metal products, industrial machinery and transportation equipment. All those industries rely heavily on steel and aluminum, goods that Mr. Trump hit with tariffs earlier this year in a move aimed indirectly at China\u2019s production.In the latest salvos, the United States took aim at a multitude of technical components \u2014 items like circuit breakers, consoles and touch screens. Those tariffs could raise costs for electronics manufacturers, who have been hiring more aggressively lately and whose supply chains run through China.Beijing, for its part, zeroed in on an array of American products, including plastics, a fast-growing export. Chinese companies imported $3.2 billion worth of plastic resins from the United States in 2017, according to the American Chemistry Council, a trade group. Chinese factories turn those resins into building materials, automobile instrument panels, eyeglasses and thousands of other products, many of which end up back in the United States.The plastics tariffs alone could send ripples deep into Trump country. In recent years, companies have announced billions of dollars of investments seeking to capitalize on the boom in American natural-gas production. Some of those investments were to go into new plants in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states to turn gas into chemicals and plastics, much of it bound for China.Companies aren\u2019t likely to abandon those plans overnight, said Calvin M. Dooley, president of the American Chemistry Council. But if the trade barriers persist, projects could be in jeopardy. \u201cThat is going to impede our ability to capitalize on that competitive advantage,\u201d Mr. Dooley said.Even with the flurry of measures and countermeasures between the United States and China, the moves so far have touched only a fraction of their $650 billion in annual trade. But they are beginning to signal how much damage could be caused, and who would suffer most.In some cases, the tariffs seem intended to deliver a message rather than a fatal blow. The United States said it would impose tariffs on aircraft parts \u2014 an important and high-profile American industry, but not one facing much competition from China. Beijing said it would impose tariffs on cars and S.U.V.s, the third-largest American export to the country. But the move may not hit American automakers as hard as it might seem.China already has a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, so General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford have all agreed to manufacture inside the country as joint ventures with domestic producers, to avoid the extra charge to consumers. Foreign carmakers operating in the United States \u2014 Daimler and BMW \u2014 do send vehicles to China from factories in the Southeast. A report by analysts at Evercore ISI suggests that those companies, rather than the Detroit automakers, would bear the brunt of the Chinese levies.Tesla might have the most to lose. The electric-car company had been lobbying hard for permission to produce cars in Shanghai, but hasn\u2019t reached a deal. It sends vehicles to the Chinese market from its plant in Fremont, Calif., and its chief executive, Elon Musk, has expressed frustration even at the existing duties.Aircraft and their parts are the largest single category of American exports to China, making Boeing a big target. For now, though, Beijing seems to be moving slowly. It said it would impose tariffs on planes between 15,000 and 45,000 kilograms, which includes some older models that Chinese buyers have ordered from Boeing. But it seemed to stop conspicuously short of whacking the company\u2019s newer 737 MAX 8, which weighs 45,070 kilograms empty.That near miss is meant to convey to Boeing, and Mr. Trump, what China is capable of, said Richard L. Aboulafia, a longtime aviation and aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.\u201cTheir attitude toward a trade war assumes that the other side will lie down and stay horizontal,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the easy and fun approach to trade wars holds up against return fire.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But his hysterical outburst had deep roots: At the state and local levels, the conservative obsession with tax cuts has forced the G.O.P. into what amounts to a war on education, and in particular a war on schoolteachers. That war is the reason we\u2019ve been seeing teacher strikes in multiple states. And people like Bevin are having a hard time coming to grips with the reality they\u2019ve created.To understand how they got to this point, you need to know what government in America does with your tax dollars.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]So what happens when hard-line conservatives take over a state, as they did in much of the country after the 2010 Tea Party wave? They almost invariably push through big tax cuts. Usually these tax cuts are sold with the promise that lower taxes will provide a huge boost to the state economy.This promise is, however, never \u2014 and I mean never \u2014 fulfilled; the right\u2019s continuing belief in the magical payoff from tax cuts represents the triumph of ideology over overwhelming negative evidence.And given the centrality of education to state and local budgets, that puts schoolteachers in the cross hairs.So what conservative state governments have mainly done is squeeze teachers themselves.So we\u2019re left with a nation in which teachers, the people we count on to prepare our children for the future, are starting to feel like members of the working poor, unable to make ends meet unless they take second jobs. And they can\u2019t take it anymore.Which brings us back to Bevin\u2019s unhinged outburst.One way to think about what\u2019s currently happening in a number of states is that the anti-Obama backlash, combined with the growing tribalism of American politics, delivered a number of state governments into the hands of extreme right-wing ideologues. These ideologues really believed that they could usher in a low-tax, small-government, libertarian utopia.Predictably, they couldn\u2019t. For a while they were able to evade some of the consequences of their failure by pushing the costs off onto public sector employees, especially schoolteachers. But that strategy has reached its limits. Now what?Well, some Republicans have actually proved willing to learn from experience, reverse tax cuts and restore education funding. But all too many are responding the way Bevin did: Instead of admitting, even implicitly, that they were wrong, they\u2019re lashing out, in increasingly unhinged ways, at the victims of their policies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Bill to Curtail Labor Rights on Tribal Land Falls Short", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOrganized labor managed an increasingly rare feat on Monday \u2014 a political victory \u2014 when its allies turned back a Senate measure aimed at rolling back labor rights on tribal lands.The legislation, called the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act, would have exempted enterprises owned and operated by Native American tribes from federal labor standards, even for employees who were not tribal citizens.The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said passage of the measure, the subject of several years of tribal lobbying, would have amounted to the most aggressive erosion of labor protections since 1940s.A package of bills containing the measure fell five votes short of the 60 needed to break a filibuster.The House passed the measure in January. It is unclear if the Senate will try again.Proponents of the bill argued that the National Labor Relations Board acted arbitrarily in 2004 when it ruled that employees of tribal enterprises could be covered by federal labor law even if the enterprise was on tribal trust land. For decades before that, the board typically applied federal labor law only to tribal enterprises outside tribal trust land.The congressional legislation would have denied employees of casinos and other enterprises on tribal trust land recourse to federal labor law if, for example, they were fired for trying to organize a union or collectively protesting work conditions.More than half a million people are employed by casinos and affiliated resorts on tribal trust land, and a vast majority are not citizens of tribes. Thousands employed in other tribal enterprises could have been affected as well.\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very troubling step at a moment when we should be doing everything we can to try to protect people\u2019s collective rights and when there are so many people who feel so disempowered in this economy,\u201d said Sharon Block, a former member of the National Labor Relations Board who is executive director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.Among those voting to move forward with the bill was Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat who faces a tough re-election campaign this year. Her vote angered groups with which she had frequently aligned herself in a state where the Republican governor, Scott Walker, led a fight to roll back collective-bargaining rights for public employees.\u201cThe fact that we have to work somebody from Wisconsin, where workers\u2019 rights were decimated by Walker \u2014 that she\u2019s even in play \u2014 says a lot,\u201d D. Taylor, president of Unite Here, which represents about 10,000 workers employed by tribal casinos, said in an interview before the vote.Ms. Baldwin\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. But Pete Kirkham, a lobbyist who represents several tribes, noted that Indian sovereignty issues tended to loom large in Wisconsin. Some Democratic House members from the state have also supported the measure.Supporters, including a coalition of business groups and Native American tribes, argued that the measure would simply restore the longstanding principle of tribal self-government, and that tribes shouldn\u2019t be treated differently from state and municipal workers, who aren\u2019t covered by federal labor law.The argument is that a tribal government operating a casino is akin to a municipality generating revenue from a golf course.\u201cIt merely seeks to treat tribal employers like any other public employer,\u201d Dan Mahoney, executive director of the Native American Enterprise Initiative at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an issue of parity. It is not an effort to deunionize but to clarify the paradigm under which unionizing could occur.\u201dAt other times, supporters of the legislation have been more overtly antagonistic to federal labor rights. In 2015, Jefferson Keel, the lieutenant governor of the Chickasaw Nation, said one reason he opposed applying the National Labor Relations Act to tribal enterprises was that it protected the right to strike, potentially damaging casino operations.\u201cI would liken it to what happened with the air traffic controllers\u2019 strike a number of years ago to this country,\u201d he said at a congressional hearing. \u201cWe obviously are not on as large a scale, but that is the type of activity that would interfere with what we are doing.\u201dThe Chickasaw Nation did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Kirkham, who counts the Chickasaw as a lobbying client, said that \u201ctribal leaders across the country would share that view.\u201dIn its bipartisan 2004 ruling, the National Labor Relations Board said that while the federal government often granted Native American tribes a special status, federal labor law did no harm to that status as long as it didn\u2019t interfere with tribal self-government or violate treaty rights.\u201cRunning a commercial business is not an expression of sovereignty in the same way that running a tribal court system is,\u201d the board concluded. \u201cThe tribe\u2019s operation of the casino is not an exercise of self-governance.\u201dAnother tribe, the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, later appealed to the Supreme Court after the labor board and a federal appeals court affirmed the logic of the ruling, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.The tribes have pressed Congress for over a decade to pass legislation that would restore their exemption from federal labor law, but the effort gained momentum when Republicans took control of the House in 2011. Since then, tribes have spent millions of dollars on lobbying, at least in part with the goal of advancing the legislation.For example, lobbyists working for the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, have reported receiving more than $1.6 million in payments from the tribe on federal disclosures that cite the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act as among their \u201cspecific lobbying issues\u201d during that time. Over the same period, the tribe has contributed at least $3 million to federal candidates and committees.In 2015, the House passed the legislation, which the Senate did not vote on during that session of Congress. Three-quarters of the 24 Democratic representatives who voted for the bill had received campaign contributions from the Chickasaw Nation.The Chickasaw Nation has also contributed at least $4,000 to Senator Baldwin since 2014.And the Chickasaw Nation is only one of more than half a dozen tribes that have employed lobbyists to work on the issue. Holly Cook Macarro, a lobbyist who has worked on the issue for the Pechanga Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians in California, raised over $400,000 for a committee supporting Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, according to The Washington Post.If the National Labor Relations Act were no longer to apply to employees of tribal enterprises on tribal lands, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily leave a vacuum. Many tribes have labor codes of their own that seek to govern relations between workers and management.But the rights under those codes are often narrower than under federal law, and labor officials say they are laxly enforced.Unite Here is trying to organize several hundred workers at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut, operated by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe. The labor group said the casino had unlawfully suspended three workers over their support for the union. It said one had since been reinstated.\u201cThe Mashantucket Pequot Labor Relations Law protects the rights of Foxwoods employees to be represented or not by any union, and we have always accepted the outcomes of union elections under tribal law,\u201d Foxwoods\u2019 vice president for human resources, Dale Merrill, said in a statement.An earlier version of this article misstated how many more votes were needed to end a filibuster blocking a package of bills that included the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act. The number was five, not six.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Budget Deficit Projected to Soar to Over $1 Trillion in 2020", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe national debt, which has exceeded $21 trillion, will soar to more than $33 trillion in 2028, according to the budget office. By then, debt held by the public will almost match the size of the nation\u2019s economy, reaching 96 percent of gross domestic product, a higher level than any point since just after World War II and well past the level that economists say could court a crisis.The fear among some economists is that rising deficits will drive up interest rates, raise borrowing costs for the private sector, tank stock prices and slow the economy, which would only drive the deficit higher.The budget office forecast is the first since President Trump signed a sweeping tax overhaul, then signed legislation to significantly increase military and domestic spending over the next two years. The figures are sobering, even in a political climate where deficit concerns appear to be receding.The tax overhaul, which includes permanent tax cuts for corporations and temporary ones for individuals, will increase the size of the economy by an average of 0.7 percent from 2018 to 2028, according to the budget office.But that added economic growth does not come close to paying for the tax overhaul, which the budget office said would add more than $1.8 trillion to deficits over that period, from lost tax revenue and higher interest payments.Many Republicans have said the tax overhaul would vault economic growth over 3 percent a year for a sustained period, generating more revenue than the tax cuts would cost. But the budget office expects the economy to grow at an annual average rate of 1.9 percent over the next decade. Growth would start strong, at 3.3 percent this year and 2.4 percent next year, but then slow considerably.And if the temporary tax cuts for individuals are extended past their scheduled expiration at the end of 2025, the price tag for the tax overhaul would be even greater.Democrats jumped on the projections to castigate Republicans over their economic record.\u201cFrom Day 1,\u201d the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said, \u201cthe Republican agenda has always been to balloon the deficit in order to dole out massive tax breaks to the largest corporations and wealthiest Americans, and then use the deficit as an excuse to cut Social Security and Medicare.\u201dRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, was equally harsh: \u201cThe C.B.O.\u2019s report exposes the staggering costs of the G.O.P. tax scam and Republicans\u2019 contempt for fiscal responsibility.\u201dFor their part, Republicans were remarkably quiet: \u201cWithout question, we have challenging work ahead,\u201d said Representative Steve Womack of Arkansas, the chairman of the House Budget Committee.This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the budget deficit is expected to total $804 billion, up from $665 billion last fiscal year, according to the projections. In a decade, the red ink is expected to reach $1.5 trillion.The $804 billion projected deficit for the current fiscal year is $242 billion larger than what the budget office had expected in June. In addition, the budget office now projects a cumulative deficit of $11.7 trillion over the next decade, an increase of $1.6 trillion from last June\u2019s projection for that time period.By 2023, according to the budget office, interest costs are projected to exceed what the government spends on the military. By 2028, interest payments will reach $915 billion, more than triple the interest costs last year.The government\u2019s mounting debt has seemed of little consequence on Capitol Hill in recent months as Republicans in Congress passed a sweeping package of tax cuts. But in a sign that Republicans are growing concerned about the political liability of soaring deficits, the House will vote Thursday on a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets.Since such constitutional amendments require two-thirds of the House and Senate to agree, it is unlikely to pass Congress, let alone be ratified by the states.But the flurry of recent legislation is making it difficult for Republicans to continue blaming President Barack Obama and Democrats for the government\u2019s fiscal condition.Before passing the tax overhaul and the spending legislation, lawmakers were already facing worrisome projections about growing deficits, driven by increased spending on Medicare and Social Security as well as growing interest costs.The budget office now projects that the deficit will top $1 trillion two years sooner than it had expected last June.The budget office analysis also projects that the law will result in interest rates that are a half percentage point higher than they would have been without it. In its early years, the budget office said, the law will boost the strength of the dollar, allowing Americans to buy more imports and sell fewer exports to the rest of the world \u2014 and thus, increase the national trade deficit, counter to Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to reduce it.Michael A. Peterson, the president and chief executive of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which advocates reining in budget deficits, said the report \u201cconfirms that major damage was done to our fiscal outlook in just the past few months.\u201dMr. Hall, the budget office director, said that beyond a decade, the debt would continue to rise compared with the size of the economy. He warned of the possible consequences if lawmakers put off addressing the trajectory of the government\u2019s finances.\u201cThe longer you wait,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more draconian the measures have to be to fix the problem.\u201dJim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Takeaways from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Senate Testimony: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s first Congressional hearing is here.\u2022 Sprint and T-Mobile have restarted merger talks.\u2022 Wall Street continues to wade into the gun control debate.\u2022 The raid on Michael Cohen\u2019s office and residence raises a number of issues.\u2022 The C.B.O. is still underestimating how bad the deficit is going to be.Congressional hearings focusing on corporate missteps often reveal little, in part because lawmakers lack the expertise and the executives taking questions are good at stone-walling.Still, Tuesday\u2019s hearing turned out to be a serious attempt to grapple with the growing influence of a powerful company that is entwined in the lives of millions of Americans.Lawmakers, it became clear, no longer see Facebook and other large tech companies as mostly benign forces for innovation. In his responses, Mr. Zuckerberg was competent but notably did not reveal much that was new about how Facebook will respond to its enormous challenges.On balance, the hearing probably leaves Facebook and its peers on the back foot in three important ways.A Senate with a Republican majority may be less likely to pass legislation, but if the Democrats gain control, top senators from that party might push for new laws ahead of a potential run in 2020. Some of the most penetrating questions on Tuesday came from Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey.The fact that Facebook\u2019s stock rose through the hearing should not be taken as a sign that the company is in the clear.\u2014 Peter EavisInvestors certainly liked Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday.Facebook\u2019s shares rose 4.5 percent on the day. It was the strongest single-day performance for the stock since April 2016.After being down as much as 24 percent this year, Facebook is steadily clawing back ground. Tuesday\u2019s gain left it down only 11.4 percent in 2018.\u2014 Matt PhillipsAmong the dominant themes of the hearing, and the past few weeks, has been whether Facebook needs to be regulated. In fact, Mr. Zuckerberg said he open to Facebook being regulated during his first interview after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.But some lawmakers expressed skepticism toward regulation during the hearing. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, raised an important point about the impact of regulation: That it often benefits the biggest companies, at the expense smaller firms and startups.Here\u2019s Senator Sullivan\u2019s question to Mr. Zuckerberg:\u201cRegulations can also cement the dominant power. Do you think that that\u2019s a risk, given your influence, that if we regulate we\u2019re actually going to regulate you into a position of cemented authority?\u201dIn other words, if the government decides to crack down on Facebook, could that end up holding back the next Facebook?That\u2019s the question that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina hit on and its a sensitive one for Facebook.On Tuesday, Mr.Graham asked Mr. Zuckerberg to name Facebook\u2019s biggest competitor. Mr. Zuckerberg responded that Facebook has a lot of competitors.Mr. Graham asked: \u201cIs there an alternative to Facebook?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg: \u201cWell, we provide a number of diff...\u201dMr. Graham: \u201cYou don\u2019t think that you have a monopoly?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg: \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to me.\u201dThe gap in knowledge about how Facebook\u2019s business works was on display at times during Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony.The company has faced questions about the possibility of creating a paid service that would allow users to opt-out of sharing their data or seeing advertisements.Mr. Zuckerberg insisted on Tuesday that there would always be a free version of Facebook, so that anyone in the world can afford to be part of its online community.At that point, Sentor Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, asked Mr. Zuckerberg how he could sustain a business without charging anything for it.\u201cSir, we run ads,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg explained.Mr. Hatch replied: \u201cI see.\u201d\u2014 Alan RappeportSenator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called Facebook and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining why Facebook is being singled out and why Mr. Zuckerberg was asked to appear alone.He said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how Facebook can be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201dIn an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201dSenator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the tech industry \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to protect its users and said \u201cthe status quo no longer works.\u201d\u2014 Cecilia KangMr. Zuckerberg is the only technology chief in the room, but it is clear that members of Congress are treating him as a stand-in for the entirety of Silicon Valley.Mr. Grassley called the entire tech industry to account, saying \u201cthe tech industry has an obligation to\u2026restore the public\u2019s trust.\u201d Mr. Nelson put it even more bluntly: \u201cIf you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy.\u201dIn his opening statement, Mr. Zuckerberg, who is 33, made a point to remind Congress that he was young when this all began.\u201cI started Facebook when I was in college,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. This is a recurring theme for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2014in many recent interviews, he has referred to starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room. And perhaps it\u2019s wise to keep bringing up the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg is much younger than most of the business executives who come before Congress.But the strategy could also backfire. After all, Mr. Zuckerberg is a long way from his dorm room\u2014on paper, he has been a billionaire for more than a decade\u2014and by reminding lawmakers of his youth, he could also lead them to question whether he\u2019s mature enough to handle such enormous responsibilities and whether Silicon Valley needs more adult supervision in the way of additional federal regulation.\u2014 Kevin Roose\u2022 Privacy, and whether 2 billion Facebook users can consider their data safe.\u2022 The F.T.C.\u2019s 2011 consent decree with the company, and whether it was violated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (Facebook says not.)More from the column:The problem is that Mr. Zuckerberg has been apologizing for years for all sorts of breaches of trust with his \u201ccommunity.\u201d And guess what? After each mea culpa, the Facebook community has grown.The bank works with \u201cjust a handful of manufacturers,\u201d with whom it has had \u201cintense conversations over the last few months,\u201d Ms. Finucane said. Their reactions to the new policy have been \u201cmixed,\u201d she said.\u2014 Tiffany HsuLet\u2019s recap the tortured history of the telecom merger that hasn\u2019t quite been able to cross the finish line (which I\u2019ve covered multiple times over the years):But there\u2019s little surprise that the companies wouldn\u2019t give up on a deal. Mr. Son pursued Sprint in the first place with the idea of merging it with T-Mobile, creating a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&T.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedOnce that determination is made, Mr. Cohen can argue that privileged materials should be returned because they are protected.Despite President Trump\u2019s tweet that \u201cthe attorney-client privilege is dead,\u201d the protection remains in place. But there is an important way around the privilege that the Justice Department may pursue. Under a doctrine called the crime-fraud exception, communications between a client and lawyer designed to assist the client to engage in a pending or future crime are not protected by the privilege.This is a slow process, likely to drag out for months. But don\u2019t be surprised to see the Justice Department claiming that communications with Mr. Cohen were made for a criminal or fraudulent purpose \u2013 whatever that might be.\u2014 Peter J. Henning(For non-lawyers: Mr. Conway\u2019s link points to the Justice Department\u2019s policies for conducting searches of lawyers.)Goldman Sachs economists point out that the C.B.O.\u2019s projections only extrapolate discretionary spending increases through 2019 fiscal year, whereas the bank\u2019s analysis points to more spending through 2021 fiscal year, raising the Goldman\u2019s deficit projections higher.Elsewhere, Jefferies economists noted that the analysis from the C.B.O. doesn\u2019t take into account the Federal Reserve\u2019s gradual reduction of the amount of government bonds it is holding, which means that the Treasury has to replace the Fed as a buyer.All else equal, the disappearance of a buyer like the Fed \u2014 which can create as much money as it needs \u2014 along with surging supply of Treasury borrowing needed to cover deepening deficits should add up one thing: Sharply higher interest rates.\u2014 Matt Phillips\u2022 \u201cSome of Novogratz\u2019s fellow hedge funders have questioned his grasp of the finer details of his trading strategies. \u2018He acts like a visionary, but at heart he\u2019s still a salesman,\u2019 one manager told me.\u201d\u2022 Novogratz is said to consider himself \u201chalfway between center-left and progressive,\u201d and \u201cDuring my lunch with him at the Mercer Kitchen, he told me, \u2018I\u2019ve always said I\u2019d run for office if I had a five-year period in my life where really I felt, like, Hey, my behavior is laudable.\u2019\u201dPublic negotiations between the corporate siblings have intensified. Viacom\u2019s counterproposal \u2014 0.68 of a CBS share for every Viacom share, or $14.7 billion; CBS had offered 0.55, or $11.9 billion \u2014 is likely to be rejected.Price may be less of a sticking point, however, than CBS\u2019s insistence on keeping its chief operating officer, Joe Ianniello, in the No. 2 spot after a merger. That\u2019s the job Viacom wants for its C.E.O., Bob Bakish. Michael has heard that this is a serious disagreement, with little movement toward a compromise as yet.\u2022 Canvas Ventures and Kirsten Green\u2019s Forerunner Ventures tied for first place on The Information\u2019s V.C. Diversity Index. Tied for last: Tiger Global Management and Slow Ventures.\u2022 The number of women in senior positions at U.S. venture firms rose to 14.2 percent last year, from 10.7 percent. The percentage of Hispanic decision makers rose to 2.3 percent from 1.9 percent, while that of black senior leaders stayed roughly flat at just over 1 percent.On April 14 at 5 p.m., hear from Chobani\u2019s founder and C.E.O., Hamdi Ulukaya, who has resurrected economies in two communities and made headlines for his leadership practices. He\u2019ll be interviewed by David Gelles for a live version of the Corner Office column.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Divides Over Trade Scramble Midterm Election Messaging", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s trade policies enjoy the strong backing of his supporters but are less popular among independents, moderate Republicans and others whose votes could decide control of Congress in the midterm election this fall. That could complicate Republicans\u2019 plans to make their economic record a central argument in their case for re-election.Jeffrey Campbell, a 49-year-old lawyer in Minneapolis, said he liked the tax bill that Republicans passed late last year, and he gave Mr. Trump credit for moving to reduce regulation. But he opposes Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, saying they will benefit a few favored industries while hurting the economy over all.\u201cA few people benefit from the protection,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cBut when prices rise as a result, the net effect, I think, is harmful to the economy.\u201dMinnesota is a key political battleground this year, with several competitive House seats and two Senate elections because of the resignation of Al Franken after a sexual-misconduct scandal last year. Mr. Campbell said that he was still likely to support Republican candidates, but that he was frustrated by the party\u2019s shift toward protectionism and support for increased government spending.\u201cI blame Republicans for that,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cA very significant portion of Republicans in Congress are not really conservative when it comes to spending.\u201dThe re-emergence of trade as a central political issue has scrambled traditional partisan alignments in ways that carry risks for both parties. Mr. Trump won the presidency partly by tapping into voters\u2019 concerns about the impact of globalization on jobs and wages, particularly in the industrial Midwest.Reflecting those tensions, congressional Republican leaders have criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs as potentially harmful to businesses and consumers while also praising the president\u2019s broader goals on trade.Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, opened a hearing on the effects of tariffs on the economy last week by saying the measures \u201ccurtail economic growth, discourage new investment, delay new hiring, and put American workers at a huge disadvantage to foreign competitors.\u201dBut he added, \u201cI remain committed to working with President Trump and the White House on strong, enforceable trade policies that will target bad actors and encourage economic growth here at home.\u201dDemocrats face their own challenges on the issue. As Republicans have shifted away from supporting free-trade agreements, Democrats have embraced them: In the Times poll, 73 percent of Democrats said they thought free-trade agreements helped the United States, compared with 51 percent of Republicans. But union members, long a key source of mobilization and support for Democrats, retain the party\u2019s longtime skepticism of free trade.\u201cIt\u2019s not an ideal issue for either party,\u201d said Robert J. Blendon, who directs the Harvard Opinion Research Program at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cIt makes the issue slightly more complex because their voters\u2019 views don\u2019t correspond to their interest groups.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re starting to certainly complicate the message,\u201d said Jon Cohen, chief research officer for SurveyMonkey.\u201cIt\u2019s possible the war of words over trade, tariffs and sanctions, and the financial market turmoil we had has led to some setback in consumer confidence,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.Ethan Brackenbury, a cost estimator for the federal Department of Energy in southeastern Washington State, said that he didn\u2019t like the idea of a trade war, and that he hadn\u2019t noticed any gain from the tax cut in his paycheck. But the economy seems strong in his area, he said, and he views any declines in the stock market as an opportunity to buy, not a signal to sell.\u201cI\u2019m certainly not worried, nor am I excited,\u201d Mr. Brackenbury said. \u201cI don\u2019t see long lines of unemployment or those kinds of things. Everyone seems to be gainfully employed.\u201dThe data in this article came from an online survey of 10,533 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from April 2 to April 8. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 10,533 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from April 2 to April 8.

{"Headline": "A Week Inside a Soccer Club When the Money Runs Out", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerKONGENS LYNGBY, Denmark \u2014 Mads Byder sent the text message to everyone he could think of, anyone who had the money \u2014 and maybe the madness \u2014 to help. In the end, he copied and pasted the message 15 times, changing the name of the recipient, but nothing else.All the texts started the same way: \u201cHey, long time no see.\u201d And they all cut quickly to the chase. \u201cYou have seen what is happening,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is not an investment \u2014 it is fun. And sometimes, you have to invest with the heart.\u201dByder did not have time to be creative. He had, by that stage, roughly a day, maybe a little more, to prevent the century-old Danish soccer club he had supported all his life, Lyngby B.K., from slipping into oblivion.Its current owner had run out of money. Its staff members had been told their jobs were gone. The team\u2019s insurance had run out. The players had not been paid. Several had already left. Many more would follow if new owners could not be found. Byder was sending messages because he was the last resort.He had been told as much the previous night when Birger Jorgensen, Lyngby\u2019s longtime sporting director, had called him at home close to midnight.Over the next 36 hours, the two led a last-gasp attempt to help Lyngby avert the thing that fans across the world fear more than anything: not that their club will lose a final, or miss out on a tournament, or even suffer the indignity of relegation, but that it will cease to exist entirely.Every year, through careless management or reckless ambition, a handful of teams come uncomfortably close to collapse. Those who do fall \u2014 Rangers or Leeds United or Parma \u2014 serve as cautionary tales about the dangers of living beyond your means. But they are not heeded. Still, every year, more clubs flirt with disaster.In the first week of February, Lyngby came closer than most to the edge. Mathias Tauber, the club captain, said that, at one point, the club was \u201c15 minutes\u201d from going under. The story of those few days offers an insight not just into what it takes to rescue a club, but also into how players cope when they stand on the brink.The hotel, Mathias Hebo said, was perfect. At the end of January, Hebo and the rest of Lyngby\u2019s players had flown to Faro, a resort town on the Algarve coast in Portugal, for a warm-weather training camp. \u201cVery good pitches, 20 degrees Celsius, all the stuff,\u201d he said.Hebo had joined the club the previous summer. He was 21, playing for Fredericia in Denmark\u2019s second tier, and Lyngby seemed the ideal step up: a club close to his family in Copenhagen, with a proud reputation for developing players \u2014 Lyngby has produced a scree of Danish internationals, including four members of Denmark\u2019s 1992 European championship team \u2014 and the promise, after a third-place finish in the league in 2017, of Europa League games this season.There had been interest in Hebo from Brondby, historically Denmark\u2019s biggest club, and from teams in Sweden, too, but \u201cLyngby\u2019s plan for me was the most impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as I got the call, I knew this is what I would do.\u201dThe luxurious trip to Faro seemed like another of the benefits Hebo would have to get used to; earlier in the season, Lyngby had flown by private jet to a Europa League match against Krasnodar in Russia. This was the life of a Superliga player. And then, five days into the winter training camp in Faro, Hebo and his teammates found out that life was about to end.\u201cOne day, Ekstra Bladet, a Danish newspaper, did a big story that Lyngby might close,\u201d Hebo said. The team\u2019s owner, Torben Jensen, could no longer fund the club, the newspaper reported, as his finance firm, Hellerup Finans, was on the verge of bankruptcy.\u201cThe staff had warned us,\u201d Hebo said. \u201cAnd then my phone just started ringing all the time.\u201dThe players approached their coach, Thomas Norgaard, seeking more information, and he passed on what Jensen had told him. \u201cWe were told everything was under control,\u201d Tauber said. \u201cHe said we were not floating in money, but everything would be fine.\u201dBy the time the squad returned to Denmark, though, it was clear that was overly optimistic.Though Jensen had assured the coaching staff he was doing his best to find a solution, to cover his obligations, it had all been to no avail. As sporting director, Jorgensen had been trying his best to drum up an angel investor, but had drawn a blank, too. The edge was approaching. On Jan. 31, the players were told that their monthly salaries \u2014 due that day \u2014 would not been paid.\u201cWe were nervous then,\u201d said Thomas Sorensen, one of the team\u2019s veterans. \u201cThat is when you realize it is really serious.\u201dFor them, and for the club. The players learned from their union that, under Danish law, they could file a claim against Lyngby for their unpaid wages. If the club did not produce the money within three working days, they could consider their contracts broken, and negotiate to join other teams.On Friday, the players submitted the claim. By the following Tuesday, Feb. 6, the money had not arrived. Lyngby\u2019s entire squad, about to return from winter break in the middle of a season that had begun in the Europa League, was free to leave.For a week, Jorgensen had been trying to stave off disaster. He had contacted everyone he could think of who might be able to step unto the breach. He had even been in touch with a handful of English clubs, including Aston Villa, in the hope that one might view Lyngby as a suitable farm team. None of it had borne fruit. Five players had already decided not to wait around to be rescued. Jorgensen was worried about a mass exodus.When he called Byder, on Wednesday, Feb. 7, Jorgensen said he \u201cwas throwing in the towel,\u201d Byder remembered.The two knew each other only cursorily: Byder\u2019s public relations company had once sponsored Lyngby, putting its name on the team\u2019s blue jerseys, and he was still a regular at games. When he called, Jorgensen told Byder that a mutual friend had passed him his phone number. Not a problem, Byder said, but why?\u201cI heard you have a big blue heart,\u201d Jorgensen responded.He did, but his wallet was not big enough to save the club alone. All Byder could offer was an idea. Lyngby sits 20 minutes north of Copenhagen, in one of the richest areas of Denmark, known as the country\u2019s equivalent to Silicon Valley.He suggested to Jorgensen that perhaps \u201cmany minor investors, local investors, could find a few million kroner each\u201d and come together to keep Lyngby B.K. from folding. Jorgensen, despite several days without sleep, agreed it was worth a shot.The next day, Byder sent out his flurry of texts. Not all of those he contacted shared his enthusiasm. \u201cPeople sent messages or called saying it was not for them, but they understood why I was doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a few said: \u2018Don\u2019t do it yourself.\u2019\u201dByder, though, had a feeling that he wanted to give something back to the club that had given him good, and bad, memories. \u201cI was ready to pay for that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was ready to lose money for it, too.\u201dFour or five of his entreaties worked, however. On Thursday night, together with a couple more names mustered by Jorgensen, 10 people met at a private house near Lyngby. \u201cThere was no time for presentations,\u201d Byder said. He, Jorgensen and Tommy Petersen, a financier, gave short speeches. They were not uniformly positive.\u201cTommy said that we did not have time to look through the budget,\u201d Byder said. \u201cHe did not know how big the black hole would be.\u201dAs captain, Tauber was busy that night, too. He had spent much of the previous year injured, nursing a torn knee ligament that \u2014 at 33 \u2014 threatened to end his career. He already had been considering what he would do if he was forced to retire. He could restart his law degree, on hiatus since he turned professional. He had even had an interview arranged with a digital marketing company.He did not feel ready to quit, he said, but he knew the club\u2019s liquidation would make the choice for him. \u201cI find it very hard to imagine that any club would want an injured 33-year-old,\u201d he said.As Lyngby\u2019s situation deteriorated during those frantic days, though, Tauber had found himself front and center, being a captain once more. The players had decided only he would speak to the news media. \u201cWe wanted to protect some of the younger players,\u201d he said. \u201cTo make sure that what was coming out from us made sense in some way.\u201dEvery morning before training, the players would hold a short meeting. Tauber would relay what he, Sorensen and another senior player, Jeppe Brandrup, had learned, and then field a few questions. The union\u2019s advice was consistent: Keep quiet, say nothing, file the claim, see what happens.That changed when the money did not arrive on Tuesday. Suddenly, Lyngby\u2019s players were free to go. \u201cFrom my perspective, I could not force players to stay,\u201d Tauber said. \u201cThe club had a problem, but the players needed to be able to choose whether to wait, or to go elsewhere and not be worried.\u201dTogether with Sorensen and Brandrup, he told the team that there would be no hard feelings for anyone who decided to go immediately. The rest, he said, would wait until Friday at 3 p.m. If no money arrived then, if no new owner had been found, they would have no choice but to leave.The mood was anxious. In private, the players would ask each other their intentions, but it was hard, Hebo said, to be sure everyone was being honest. \u201cMaybe one person told you one thing and said something different to others,\u201d he said. Surreptitious phone calls prompted suspicion: Was he talking to his agent, arranging a move?Tauber did what he could to canvass opinion. \u201cI talked to almost everybody,\u201d he said, about contracts, but also about wives, and children, and mortgages. Looking back, now, he knows that not everyone told him the truth.In the end, five players decided they could not take the risk, and left. One, Casper Nielsen, a fullback who had already agreed to sign for Aarhus at the end of the season, simply brought his move forward. Even then, Tauber said, \u201che refused to be the first: He would not be the one who took everyone with him.\u201dBy Thursday night, though, Tauber feared it was over. He had heard there might be a chance of salvation, but time was running out. The artificial deadline \u2014 3 p.m. the next day \u2014 was fast approaching. \u201cI knew it was close, but I also knew they were missing a few million kroner,\u201d he said of the new investors. And so he spent that night on the phone to his teammates one more time, to \u201chear their situations, hear their thoughts.\u201dAt 6 a.m. on Friday, Byder\u2019s phone beeped. \u201cThanks for last night,\u201d read the first email on the thread. Seven of the potential investors that had gathered the previous night had agreed to try to save the club. A local lawyer, Lars Borring, registered a company: The Friends of Lyngby had been born. That morning, the members started transferring money \u2014 some $50,000, some closer to $1 million \u2014 to replenish the club\u2019s accounts.After training, the squad gathered in the canteen at Lyngby\u2019s stadium. The last of the money had landed in the new company\u2019s accounts with 15 minutes to spare. Petersen and Jorgensen told the players the money was in place. They would be paid.\u201cBoom, like that, everyone stays,\u201d Hebo said. In his car on the way home, Tauber cried with relief. Byder, though, had another problem. The bank account was empty again.There were, at the start, seven Friends of Lyngby. There are now more than 20: lawyers and chief executives and restaurateurs, as well as several players who started their careers at the club\u2019s academy. Andreas Bjelland, a Danish international now with Brentford in England, was the first; three others have followed.They are, as Byder said, a \u201cteam behind the team,\u201d their experience in a whole swath of industries, all of which he believes can help develop the club in some way. \u201cWe reflect different resources,\u201d he said. Sponsors are returning, too, eager to be involved.The club\u2019s accounts, quickly emptied to pay the players\u2019 overdue wages and the team\u2019s outstanding bills, have been filled again. The new owners remain open to further investment; the only requirement is that any further Friends should not have \u201cterms and conditions\u201d to their input. This is with the heart, as Byder told the first few to sign up; it is investing in fun.They are aware, though, that there is a limit to how far they can take the club. Byder has held more meetings with Aston Villa about a potential partnership, but other clubs are hovering, too: one or two from England, and Club Brugge from Belgium.Networks of clubs, economies of scale, are all the rage in global soccer these days. Manchester City, which already owns teams in New York, Melbourne and Montevideo, has been alerted to Lyngby\u2019s willingness to talk. Byder does not rule anything out: He noted, with a smile, that David Beckham\u2019s Miami franchise might be an interesting prospect.More immediately, though, there is another battle looming. Lyngby finds itself in a protracted relegation battle, thanks to Denmark\u2019s complex system of playoffs. It has struggled on the field since that nightmarish week in February, not simply because of the players who left \u2014 though that hardly helped \u2014 but because of the psychological damage it did.When players talk about Lyngby, they almost always mention family. \u201cWe care about each other, we understand each other,\u201d Tauber said. That had always been the club\u2019s strength: its familiarity, its warmth. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a Danish guy to explain the word hygge,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cIt is hard to put it into words, but it is where you feel you belong.\u201dDuring that perilous week, though, that bond was sorely tested. Players were forced to think not about the collective, but about themselves: their futures, their fears, their needs. Training sessions lacked intensity because players feared injury more than usual: A bad tackle at the wrong time might have meant months without pay, without a new club.\u201cI was worried that spirit might break,\u201d Tauber said. \u201cIt did not, but we are challenged right now.\u201dIt has taken time to restore that spirit. It may take more yet. Relegation would be the unhappiest of codas to what should be a heartwarming story, but perhaps even that has had its sting drawn by what Lyngby went through. Clubs go up and down, but they always remain, as long as there are people ready to rescue them, people with big blue hearts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putin, or the World? Sanctions May Force Oligarchs to Choose", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Compared to the sunny, palm-lined offshore tax havens where Russians typically stash their fortunes \u2014 think the British Virgin Islands or Cyprus \u2014 two chilly, windswept Russian islands would seem to offer little.Yet October Island, a glorified swamp in Russia\u2019s European exclave of Kaliningrad, and Russian Island, a former cow pasture facing the far eastern port of Vladivostok, were highlighted by Moscow this week as potential alternatives.\u201cRussia has no strategy on how to react to this situation, to these new economic circumstances,\u201d Evgeny Gontmakher, a prominent opposition economist, said.The most immediate effect is being felt by Oleg V. Deripaska and his aluminum giant, Rusal, which has lost about one-third of its value on the Moscow stock exchange. \u201cThis is a new stage,\u201d Mr. Gontmakher said. \u201cThis is targeting for isolation a very big, export-oriented company. That is very painful.\u201dParadoxically, the sanctions could help President Vladimir V. Putin to accomplish a long-held goal of putting more of the economy under state control and pressuring billionaires to bring their money home.Yet the sanctions might also work against Mr. Putin\u2019s interests, forcing some of the wealthiest Russians to decide just how closely they want to be identified with the Kremlin by financing militias, political organizations or other adventures abroad. \u201cAnyone who wants to help the Kremlin outside will think twice,\u201d said Konstantin Gaaze, an analyst and frequent contributor to the Moscow Carnegie Center website.In a larger sense, the sanctions are expected to have a limited overall effect after the initial shock wears off, because they ultimately targeted just a handful of companies. But the virtual sequestering of a critical Russian commodity producer has introduced a strong element of uncertainty into dealings with all Russian raw materials, the taproot of the country\u2019s income, which is likely to further isolate Russia from the world.The initial government response was muted, with Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for Mr. Putin, telling reporters that \u201cit would be wrong to make hasty decisions\u201d and predicting that the value of the ruble and the Russian stock market would bounce back once emotions settled down.Given the tiny size of the Russian economy \u2014 around 2 percent of global G.D.P. \u2014 and its limited trade with the United States, there was little expectation of economic retaliation. Any Russian response was likely to come in places like Syria or Ukraine, analysts said, where the Kremlin might ratchet up tensions in order to leverage any solution on ending the sanctions.With an American strike in Syria possible at any moment, in response to what was suspected to be a chemical weapons attack by the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, an occasion for that scenario might materialize quickly.\u201cPeople thought this was a joke, but now it is clear that the situation is serious,\u201d said Vladislav S. Zhukovsky, an economist and investment consultant. \u201cThis is more serious than the previous sanctions.\u201dThe two most prominent industrialists targeted were Mr. Deripaska, whose Rusal company employs an estimated 60,000 in Russia, and Viktor F. Vekselberg, one of the richest men in Russia, whose projects include trying to develop the country\u2019s tech sector.\u201cIt is not clear what are the key sins that got people transferred from the big list to the small list,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, an independent political and economic analyst. \u201cThe logic is not clear, which increases the risk for all others.\u201dIn the end, the most important ramifications of this round of sanctions is the uncertainty they introduce to all of Russia\u2019s dealings with the West. \u201cThere is a big possibility that this is only the beginning of the campaign,\u201d Mr. Gontmakher said.The government said it would address that uncertainty by providing whatever support was needed to keep the targeted companies functioning and their employees in jobs. \u201cThe main thing now is to minimize uncertainty while securing the stable functioning of the companies, where hundreds of thousands of people work,\u201d Arkady V. Dvorkovich, a Russian deputy prime minister, told an economic conference on Tuesday.Most analysts suggested that the Kremlin was likely to buy Rusal, for example, and try to rebrand it to avoid it being stigmatized on the world market and to sell the aluminum at rock-bottom prices just to keep Russians employed. This might well provide a multibillion-dollar payday for Mr. Deripaska.To the dismay of liberal economists, Mr. Putin has pushed state ownership of the economy from about 35 percent to between 50 and 70 percent, and taking over Rusal would further expand government control.Russia weathered a round of sanctions over the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which limited its access to Western capital markets, cut off arms sales and limited technology transfer. The latest are narrower, but more intense, analysts said, since they effectively shut out a giant commodity producer from Western markets.The Kremlin has been trying to force rich Russians to bring their money home and the sanctions might help. \u201cAs one of our clients said, when sanctions were introduced it was the wrong way to destroy Russia,\u201d said Oleg Kouzmin, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank. To really wreak economic havoc in Russia, he joked, the West should roll out the red carpet for assets from the oligarchs, effectively stalling the Russian economy.Habitually, tycoons have feared falling afoul of the Kremlin and having their assets in Russia seized, but any oligarch cut off completely from international financial markets might be more amenable to shifting funds home. Still, it would be only a short-term fix, noted several analysts, because Russia is not a big enough or attractive enough market for significant, sustained investment.\u201cWe have to understand that we are entering a new reality \u2014 Russia is being turned into a toxic asset,\u201d said Mr. Zhukovsky, the economist.Ivan Nechepurenko and Andrew Kramer contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Trump Officials Reach Truce in Fight Over Tax Law\u2019s Implementation", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Treasury Department has relinquished some of its authority over implementation of the Trump tax cuts, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ceding the ability to review regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which is headed by Mick Mulvaney.The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul was rushed through Congress late last year and has left many lingering questions that the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, which is part of the department, have been scrambling to answer. Key among those are what kinds of businesses qualify as \u201cpass-through\u201d companies that are eligible for a new 20 percent deduction and how broadly to apply the international tax provisions aimed at preventing large companies from shifting profits overseas.Last year Mr. Trump called for a review of the Treasury\u2019s exemption from the usual practice of the budget office doing cost-benefit analyses of regulations issued by government agencies, sparking a turf war between Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Mnuchin.Under the new agreement, the White House budget office will review Treasury regulations that could create interference or inconsistencies with regulations from other agencies. It would also assess regulations that raise \u201cnovel\u201d legal or policy issues, such as penalizing conduct through the tax code. And regulations that have a revenue effect on the economy of more than $100 million will receive additional scrutiny.In its effort to maintain control over tax guidance, Treasury officials argued that giving the budget office final say would create additional layers of red tape that could slow implementation of a law the administration is hoping will provide an economic boost. They also argued that the budget office did not have sufficient tax policy expertise to properly scrutinize complex regulations.To alleviate the concerns of business groups, the agreement creates an expedited process for the budget office to review regulations related to the 2017 tax law, completing such assessments in 10 days.Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney both claimed victory on Thursday.\u201cThis updated review framework will increase scrutiny of regulations most likely to impose new costs, while preserving Treasury\u2019s ability to ensure taxpayers receive timely, clear rules and guidance on how to comply with our tax code,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cUnder today\u2019s agreement, Treasury will continue to swiftly and successfully implement historic tax reform while still avoiding needless regulatory costs and delays.\u201dMr. Mulvaney called the deal \u201ca reflection of tremendous coordination\u201d between the Treasury and the budget office and said it would \u201cpromote economic growth and prosperity.\u201dA spokeswoman for the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, praised the deal on Thursday. \u201cWith this agreement, O.M.B. and Treasury have struck the right balance to ensure a transparent, careful and expeditious regulatory process,\u201d the spokeswoman, Julia Lawless, said in an email. \u201cMoving forward, Chairman Hatch will continue to work with the administration as they develop I.R.S. rules on the new tax law.\u201dBut Democrats and some outside experts continued to raise concerns that the additional layer of review would bog down the law\u2019s implementation and potentially open new avenues of confusion for businesses attempting to comply with the law.\u201cSmall businesses are increasingly stuck in a bureaucratic twilight zone,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a committee hearing on Thursday morning. \u201cThere is rampant confusion about how the new tax law works \u2014 untested policies, sloppy legislative drafting and outright mistakes in the law. On top of that, a Trump cabinet turf battle has been adding to the uncertainty and lengthening the time that small businesses are going to be in the dark about how the tax rules apply to them.\u201dJennifer Abelaj, a senior counsel and tax expert at the New York law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said Thursday that \u201cI am concerned that an additional level of review could result in unnecessary delays that make compliance more difficult, not to mention more expensive for taxpayers.\u201d\u201cAlready, there are many tax questions that need answers,\u201d she said. \u201cThis policy change could throw a wrench \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 in the carefully laid plans of taxpayers and their tax advisers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan Calls Early Turkish Elections in Bid to Solidify Power", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on Wednesday called elections for June 24, almost a year and a half earlier than scheduled, saying the situation in Syria and Iraq, as well as economic stability, demanded it.Mr. Erdogan has long made it clear that he intended to run for re-election \u2014 he has led the country for 15 years, first as prime minister, then as president \u2014 and speculation had been rife for months that he would call elections early.He nonetheless surprised many observers by calling the elections so soon, as well as while Turkey remains under a state of emergency. The state of emergency, in place since a failed coup in July 2016, gives the police added powers, restricts the right of assembly and is likely to constrain campaigning.But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s abrupt move seemed intended to seize a ripe moment \u2014 he remains the country\u2019s most popular politician, with some 40 percent support \u2014 to consolidate his powers at a time when domestic politics in Turkey and international trends seem to favor leaders in his autocratic style.The elections, both presidential and parliamentary, will bring forward Turkey\u2019s transition to a presidential system under which the president will gain still more authority, the prime minister\u2019s office will be abolished and the powers of Parliament reduced.Those changes were all approved in a referendum last year that Mr. Erdogan had campaigned for strenuously, with the obvious intention that he would be the first president to hold the enhanced office.Mr. Erdogan has since been urging members of his Justice and Development Party to work to build enough support for him to secure the election in the first round.\u201cAlthough its seems there are no serious issues arising as the president and the government are working in harmony, the diseases of the old system can confront us at every step,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said in a speech broadcast live on television. \u201cFor our country to make decisions about the future more strongly and apply them, passing to the new governmental system becomes urgent.\u201dMinutes later, the Turkish Parliament approved a request from Prime Minister Binali Yildirim to extend the state of emergency \u2014 which has been in force since the failed coup \u2014 for another three months, the Turkish news agency Anadolu reported.While the coup attempt was violent \u2014 nearly 250 people died, including Mr. Erdogan\u2019s election campaign manager and close friend \u2014 critics have since accused him of using the extended powers under emergency rule to crack down on political opponents and dissent.Tens of thousands have been jailed, accused of links to Fethullah Gulen, the Islamist cleric accused of masterminding the coup, or to other designated terrorist organizations. And over 100,000 people have been suspended from public-sector jobs. Mr. Gulen has denied involvement in the coup.Defense Minister Nurettin Canikli said Wednesday that the government had identified three thousand top-level officers belonging to the Gulen movement inside the military, and was preparing to purge them soon with a government decree, the Anadolu news agency reported.Mr. Erdogan said that events in Syria and Iraq, both countries in which Turkey has deployed troops, had made a transition to the presidential system more urgent. He also said the economic situation demanded certainty.\u201cWith the cross-border operations we maintain in Syria, and also historical events happening in the area centered around Syria and Iraq, it became a must for Turkey to climb over the uncertainty as soon as possible,\u201d the president said.\u201cIn a period where developments about Syria accelerate, and we have to make very important decisions on issues from macroeconomic equilibrium to big investments, it is a must to drop the election issue from the agenda as soon as possible,\u201d he added.Yet political opponents and commentators have been predicting for months that Mr. Erdogan would call early elections as soon as he could be sure of winning. He is known to closely watch opinion polls and has enjoyed a bounce in his personal rating since ordering military operations against Kurdish militias in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin in January.The country also enjoyed over 7 percent growth in the last quarter of 2017. Yet there are signs that the economy is faltering. Inflation remains persistently high, which hurts many of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s own supporters.The snap election was also seen as a move to undercut political opponents.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s announcement came after discussions with Devlet Bahceli, the leader of Turkey\u2019s main nationalist party, the Nationalist Movement Party, which has entered a formal alliance with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., for the elections.Mr. Bahceli said that he supported early elections for the stability of the country and the economy. But he also seems to be concerned with fending off a rival for the nationalist vote, Meral Aksener, who split from his party and formed her own party, the Good Party, last year, according to Turkish media reports.The early timing of the election now could prevent Ms. Aksener from running, since her new party may not be considered to have passed the required six months from its first party congress.Ms. Aksener, a former interior minister, has nevertheless declared her intention to challenge Mr. Erdogan for president and field candidates for Parliament.Turkey\u2019s largest opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, or C.H.P., was caught flat-footed by the announcement, and has not yet selected a candidate for president. Its leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, ruled out running for the presidency last year.Engin Altay, the deputy head of C.H.P.\u2019s parliamentary group, told a Turkish television station that a candidate would be chosen within 15 days.The pro-Kurdish party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party, or H.D.P., has particularly suffered under the state of emergency, with nine members of Parliament in jail, including their popular former leader Selahattin Demirtas and many mayors removed from their posts. The party nevertheless has appointed new leaders and declared itself ready for elections.Sezai Temelli, the co-chairman of the party, said in a tweet: \u201cJune 24 is not early, but a panic election. The government is impotent.\u201dTo win outright in the first round of the election, Mr. Erdogan will need to secure 51 percent of the vote. His personal ratings have been closer to 40 percent in recent opinion polls.The constitutional changes to create a new presidential system were agreed in a controversial referendum in April last year, which Mr. Erdogan only barely won with a 51 percent yes vote, versus 49 percent who voted no.Ms. Aksener was a prominent leader of the no campaign and has vowed to assemble similar broad support for the coming elections.The referendum was criticized as unfair by opposition parties and independent election monitors. Since then, Mr. Erdogan has moved to exercise greater control over the High Election Board and the electoral law, the parties warned.\u201cThe alliance cannot secure 50 percent,\u201d Yalcin Dogan wrote in the online news outlet T24. \u201cSo they are changing the structure of the High Election Board and the electoral law in a manner that is against the universal democratic rules. However, the Good Party remains a complete nightmare.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Have Many Differences, but on Syria, Trump Seems Much Like Obama", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Whether it is the Paris climate accord or the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has moved methodically to dismantle the foreign policy legacy of his predecessor Barack Obama. Except for Syria, on which Mr. Trump has faithfully echoed Mr. Obama\u2019s hands-off policy.Mr. Trump\u2019s statement on Tuesday \u2014 that \u201cI want to bring our troops back home; I want to start rebuilding our nation\u201d \u2014 underscored again how similarly he and Mr. Obama view the United States\u2019 role in the overlapping conflicts in Syria.Both men have doubted the wisdom of a long-term American military commitment in the country. Both have complained that Saudi Arabia expects the United States to bear the burden of a costly war against President Bashar al-Assad. Both have viewed Syria primarily through the prism of combating the Islamic State.Mr. Trump, a former senior adviser said, does not believe that Syria\u2019s civil war is a vital national security interest of the United States. Neither did Mr. Obama, which is why he initially rebuffed proposals to funnel weapons to the rebels in Syria or to impose a no-fly zone over parts of the country.\u201cBoth men retreat from the idea of getting deeply involved in other countries\u2019 civil wars,\u201d said Robert S. Ford, the last American ambassador to Syria. \u201cBoth of them are instinctively more concerned about the American economy and things at home, even if they have very different visions of America.\u201dMr. Ford, who now teaches at Yale and is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said Mr. Trump, like Mr. Obama, was right to worry about \u201cmission creep\u201d in the military\u2019s operations in Syria.The American-led coalition, Mr. Ford noted, has recently bombed Syrian forces, backed by Iranian militias and Russian mercenaries, who were advancing on oil fields held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a mostly Arab faction that is fighting with the United States against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t about ISIS,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cThis was about keeping the Syrians out of the oil fields held by our buddies.\u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s debates over Syria carry a distinct echo of those during the Obama administration. Both presidents confronted aides pushing more aggressive options. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, the Pentagon is pleading for more time to mop up in Syria, warning that a hasty exit will jeopardize the gains made in the campaign against the Islamic State. In Mr. Obama\u2019s case, the C.I.A. and the State Department both advocated arming the rebels.At a National Security Council meeting on Tuesday, a frustrated Mr. Trump pressed his top military advisers for how long it would take to root out the remaining Islamic State fighters and to train local forces to stabilize Syrian territory freed from the militant group.In 2012, Mr. Ford recalled, a skeptical Mr. Obama quizzed his aides about how arming a ragtag band of Syrian rebels could lead to a negotiated end to the war.Both leaders also share the same skepticism of the motives of allies. Mr. Obama railed against Saudi Arabia, which had lobbied Washington to arm the rebels, as a free rider. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that if Saudis were so eager for the United States to stay engaged in Syria, they should help finance the campaign.\u201cI said, \u2018Well, you want us to stay, maybe you\u2019ll have to pay,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said during a news conference, apparently referring to a call he had with King Salman of Saudi Arabia. \u201cIt is very costly for our country. And it helps other countries a hell of a lot more than it helps us.\u201dMr. Trump is more transactional in his approach than was Mr. Obama. The former president, his aides said, tended to focus on whether a strategy was financially sustainable over time, while the current president views foreign affairs as a strict balance sheet.Trump administration officials insist there are other differences. Mr. Trump, they said, agreed to arm the Syrian Kurds \u2014 a crucial step that enabled these battle-hardened soldiers to fight alongside American troops in retaking the Syrian city of Raqqa.Mr. Obama did not arm the Kurds, mainly because his aides were caught up in a debate over whether it would antagonize Turkey. The Turks view the Kurdish militia as closely linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a separatist group known as the P.K.K., which threatens Turkey. Mr. Obama did come around to supporting the idea of arming the Kurds, but only at the end of his presidency.Mr. Trump, officials said, has given his military commanders more flexibility to deploy troops, which they said had accelerated the defeat of the Islamic State. But analysts said Mr. Obama planted the seeds for the victory by orchestrating the multinational military campaign to begin with.\u201cWhile Obama and Trump may share an aversion to escalating the conflict, their instincts led in different directions,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cObama was more focused on diplomacy with the key players, while Trump has shown little inclination to focus on the diplomatic track.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s diplomatic ambitions, some argue, are the key to understanding why he shunned deeper involvement in Syria.\u201cFor Obama, it was fear of alienating Iran from a nuclear deal, the jewel in the crown of his foreign policy,\u201d said Frederic C. Hof, a former special envoy to Syria in the Obama administration. \u201cFor Trump, it is an instinctive belief that anything the U.S. is doing in the Middle East is a waste of time and money.\u201dYet Mr. Obama, too, lamented that American military adventures in the region usually ended in ashes. He often drew an analogy to Libya, where he had authorized a military intervention in 2011 that left the country in shambles.With their reluctance to get involved, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump may find themselves united in another way. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump regularly castigated Mr. Obama for withdrawing American troops from Iraq too abruptly in 2011 \u2014 a decision that he said allowed the Islamic State to take root and flourish.Now, as Mr. Trump pushes his commanders for a speedy exit from Syria, he faces the same danger.\u201cWhat the Department of Defense is worried about is a three-plus-year military campaign against ISIS going down the drain,\u201d Mr. Hof said. \u201cIf you wanted to write a script for the resurgence of an Islamist regime, this is it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur Back PagesRobert Coover writes his first novel as if he doesn\u2019t expect to make it to a second. Everything goes into it, including plots for several grim short stories and more social novels, and notes for a juicy essay on how West Condon ministers and their wives celebrate the Feast of the Resurrection. It begins as an account of the founding of a crackpot religious sect named for an Italian-American coal miner who miraculously survives a mine disaster that kills 98 others. En route to the final formalization of the Brunists \u2014 election of bishops and cutting up the territory \u2014 Mr. Coover takes apart the economy, power structure, social order and sexual codes of a small town berserk with holiness. Burning with ambition, \u201cThe Origin of the Brunists\u201d achieves much that this young teacher at Bard College hopes for. It is a novel of intensity and conviction \u2014 even though he forgets which of his many stories he most wants to tell and cries uncle in the clutch. If he can somehow control his Hollywood giganticism and focus his vision of life, he may become heir to Dreiser or Lewis.The strength of this novel derives from the old tradition. It brings us the news about mining, petty journalism, small-town nonculture and the weird fusion of truth and wish that sometimes underpins religious belief. It\u2019s impregnated with stories. It creates characters. But it offers no new or terrifying revelations. The reason: Mr. Coover himself is unable to decide whether the Brunists are tragic or comic figures, whether West Condon is a joke or a condition.It\u2019s a pity Mr. Coover ran out of ideas before words. He has a splendid talent. There\u2019s no joy in seeing it too lie spent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could the U.K. Vote Again on Brexit? The Prospects Are Rising", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySALFORD, England \u2014 Like the majority of voters in this gritty part of northern England, Alan Wood voted for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union largely, he says, because of immigration.But lately, as he watches his government\u2019s stumbling efforts to negotiate departure, Mr. Wood has begun to suspect that Britain\u2019s economy will suffer, questioned how he will be affected and wondered whether he made a mistake.\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know whether it is right or not,\u201d he said, munching a meat pie and fries at Yum Yum\u2019s cafe.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how big it was going to be,\u201d added Mr. Wood, 54, a dog trainer, conceding that \u201cif there were another vote, a lot of people would change their minds and vote to stay this time.\u201dAt this no-frills diner on a drab suburban highway, Mr. Wood was sharing a table with a member of Britain\u2019s House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, who was here to reach out to voters in areas that had voted for the country\u2019s withdrawal, or Brexit, and to persuade them to think again.Not every conversation was going so smoothly for Mr. Adonis. At the counter, next to the freshly battered fish, was Darren Fildes, 46, a cafe worker and a Brexit supporter who sees the European Union as \u201ccommunism with a new pair of knickers,\u201d a British word for underwear.Yet, with Britain mired in tortuous exit negotiations and its economy slowing, pro-Europeans like Mr. Adonis have begun to sense a change in the prevailing winds and are actively trying to drum up support for another say over the country\u2019s future. Several groups have come together recently and events are being organized across the country to make the case for a new vote.They argue that, rather than a rerun of the 2016 plebiscite, this new \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d would decide whether whatever Brexit deal the government finally produces matches up to the extravagant promises made in the raucous referendum campaign.Mr. Adonis, who sees a looming political crisis over the terms of withdrawal, estimates the prospects of stopping Brexit at 30 to 40 percent.That may not be as fanciful as it sounds. Any withdrawal deal struck by Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, will need approval from Parliament, where she has no reliable majority.Were lawmakers to reject her agreement, Mrs. May would then face three choices, says Dominic Grieve, a pro-European rebel lawmaker in her own Conservative Party. She could try to renegotiate it \u2014 unlikely, in view of domestic political pressures and resistance from the European Union \u2014 call a general election or put her Brexit plan directly to the people.A reversal of Brexit, nevertheless, remains a long shot. Neither the government nor Labour, the main opposition party, wants a new referendum, and pro-Europeans face many obstacles, not least drumming up interest among a weary or indifferent populace.While Britain\u2019s economy is one of the laggards of the Western world, the out-and-out recession predicted by Brexit\u2019s opponents never did materialize. Negotiations on the withdrawal are generally acknowledged to be going poorly for London, steeped in confusion and retreat. But they are so technical that many voters have tuned out and the largely pro-Brexit newspapers pay little heed to British setbacks.But none of that is discouraging a growing cohort convinced they can right what they regard as a terrible mistake. On the first floor of Milbank Tower, near Parliament in London, no fewer than nine pro-European groups have tried to overcome differences, and competing egos, by joining a Grassroots Coordinating Group.This was nicknamed GCHQ, a lighthearted reference to Britain\u2019s secret intelligence monitoring center, though with posters on the walls, leaflets stacked in boxes and an open carton of breakfast cereal on a table top recently, the room hardly resembles a high-tech spy center.Partly financed by George Soros, the financier and philanthropist, Best for Britain was featured in a controversial article in The Daily Telegraph, co-written by Nick Timothy, a \u201cleave\u201d enthusiast and former aide to Mrs. May. The headline accused organizers of a \u201csecret plot to thwart Brexit.\u201dIn truth, its activities are more humdrum, like the staging of \u201cbarnstormer\u201d events, sometimes in leave-voting areas, where pro-European campaigners learn messages and debating techniques.Though opponents of Brexit are routinely portrayed by critics as members of a discredited, remote elite, Mr. Adonis, a former minister who studied at Oxford University, is unperturbed.\u201cI am too metropolitan, I am too cosmopolitan,\u201d he said disarmingly, \u201cbut I do get out and about.\u201dHis reception seems generally friendly on a tour of 100 areas of the country that voted for Brexit. Face to face, \u201cvery, very few people aren\u2019t nice\u201d he said, before adding that \u201cthe people who want me hanged or shot say so under a pseudonym on Twitter.\u201dCerebral and intense, Mr. Adonis spoke quickly as he analyzed how Britons came to vote against European Union membership, a decision as damaging to their country, he says, as the Suez crisis of the 1950s.Far from helping those left behind by globalization, he argued, the true agenda of leading Brexit supporters is to shrink the state and extend the laissez-faire policies of Margaret Thatcher. He sees the Brexit vote as a protest from areas with legitimate grievances, and says he thinks that concerns about immigration must be addressed.There are compelling practical arguments for another referendum, because the 2016 vote was silent on what should replace European Union membership, and those options vary enormously. Since none have a specific democratic mandate, any outcome is likely to be contested for years.But it is hard to detect a burning public desire for another vote. Outside a shopping mall here in Salford, the main complaint is not about Europe, but about municipal cost-cutting and reduced garbage collection. (\u201cIf we can get weekly bin collections, we can stay in the European Union,\u201d jokes Mr. Adonis.)If it happens, a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d will result less from popular demand than from a political impasse. Mrs. May has been embarrassed by defeats on amendments to legislation to quit the bloc in the House of Lords, the unelected second chamber of Parliament, and faces crunch votes to overturn them in the House of Commons soon.Then, when lawmakers vote on any Brexit deal in the fall, the Labour Party will be crucial. Though its left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a lifelong Euroskeptic, most of his lawmakers and party members are not, and analysts say they believe he will oppose any deal that Mrs. May strikes, on the pretext that Labour could do better.So one strand of the pro-European campaign aims to galvanize Labour Party members \u2014 including young people \u2014 to pressure Mr. Corbyn to resist Brexit. But another is to start engaging with supporters of Brexit in case there is another campaign.At an open meeting in Oldham, one of Britain\u2019s most deprived towns, about two dozen people answered a recent invitation from Mr. Adonis to debate Brexit.Ros Birch, 46, an apprenticeship officer who voted to remain, said it had become clear that the nearly $500 million a week bonanza that Brexit supporters had promised to divert to health spending would never materialize, and pointed to Mrs. May\u2019s problems putting together a deal and getting it through Parliament.\u201cWhether I am living in cloud cuckoo land or not, I don\u2019t know, but I still don\u2019t feel it will happen,\u201d she said.But many in Oldham hope it does, including Richard Lowe-Jackson, 58, a self-employed businessman and leave voter, who said he would resent having a second referendum, which he called \u201ca second bite at the cherry.\u201dDuring most of the 90-minute discussion, Mr. Adonis stayed quiet and encouraged audience members to speak.\u201cPeople like me,\u201d he said, \u201chaven\u2019t been listening enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, they\u2019re on the brink of having one of their top demands granted: an end to the regulator\u2019s public database of complaints about their products and services.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything in here that says I have to run a Yelp for financial services sponsored by the federal government,\u201d he said at a banking industry conference in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in here that says that I have to make all of those public.\u201d\u201cMaking complaints public gives companies a stronger incentive to treat people right,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cIt also helps people stay away from companies with bad track records. It lets the free market help steer us in the direction of consumer protection.\u201dMore than 185,000 complaints to the bureau have been resolved with some form of compensation or relief, often with financial institutions changing their practices or making customers whole.David M. Perry was one of the beneficiaries.Last year, he filed a complaint against Midland Credit Management, a collection firm, over an inaccurate entry on his credit reports. Years earlier, a thief had fraudulently opened credit card accounts in his and his wife\u2019s names, Mr. Perry said. Most of the accounts were shut down, but one slipped through and was referred to Midland. Mr. Perry learned of it only last June when he applied for a mortgage and discovered that his credit score was hundreds of points lower than he expected.When he contacted Midland, a representative suggested that he simply pay off the balance owed, Mr. Perry said. So he filed a complaint with the consumer bureau.Thirteen days later, Midland sent Mr. Perry a letter: \u201cMidland Credit apologizes for the inconvenience caused to you.\u201d The collection firm agreed to close the disputed account, end collection efforts on it and instruct the credit bureaus to delete the record from their files.\u201cI don\u2019t spend a lot of time feeling grateful to the federal government, but I was really grateful to the C.F.P.B. at that moment,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cWe need more accountability and transparency from our financial institutions, not less.\u201dFinancial institutions, however, say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.\u201cPublishing unverified complaints \u2014 or, worse, using those complaints to paint a picture of guilt in the public domain \u2014 is irresponsible,\u201d said Richard Hunt, the chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association.Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s disdain for the complaints database has already lessened its use. The New Economy Project, a community organization, has shifted its focus to reporting disputes to other regulators, including New York\u2019s attorney general and the state\u2019s Department of Financial Services.\u201cWhen Mulvaney stepped in, we saw the writing the wall and stopped advising our clients to file C.F.P.B. complaints, which anyone paying attention to what\u2019s going on at the agency can see would be an exercise in futility,\u201d said Sarah Ludwig, the New Economy Project\u2019s founder and co-director.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A South Korean President Is Jailed for Graft, but Few Expect Major Change", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For decades, South Korea has been plagued by corrupt ties between government and big business, a state of affairs that dates to the country\u2019s dictatorial past and persists as it became a global economic powerhouse.But few expect Ms. Park\u2019s punishment alone to bring about a fundamental change.Analysts say the old ways of doing business won\u2019t change until the chaebol are held to account for them.\u201cYou cannot end collusive ties between politics and business in South Korea by sentencing a couple former presidents to long prison terms,\u201d said Jun Sung-in, an economist at Hongik University in Seoul, the capital. \u201cChaebol chiefs have never been properly punished for their corruption.\u201d\u201cChaebol are accomplices!\u201d protesters chanted.Many South Koreans still speak proudly of Samsung, Hyundai and other chaebol, whose export-driven growth helped lift the country out of the poverty that followed the Korean War. But over the years, frustration has grown with the chaebol, which are widely accused of stifling smaller businesses as well as doing corrupt deals with government officials.Ahn Jin-geol, a leader of People\u2019s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, an anticorruption watchdog, said Ms. Park\u2019s downfall spoke well for South Korea\u2019s still-young democracy.But if Ms. Park\u2019s dramatic ouster reflected a vibrant democracy at work, the scandal also unveiled a deeply flawed political system.For decades, the government has nurtured the chaebol with favors like tax benefits and a buy-Korea policy. In return, past presidents often treated them like personal ATMs, critics say. If they did not oblige, they say, the businesses feared that the government would retaliate through the tax authorities, government regulators and prosecutors.The donations to Ms. Choi\u2019s foundations, nominally set up to promote sports and culture, seemed yet another example of this phenomenon. The Seoul district court that convicted Ms. Park ruled that she had coerced chaebol into donating to the foundations. The sums were determined according to the companies\u2019 size, according to the ruling, with Samsung contributing the most: $19 million.Ms. Park also solicited $6.5 million in bribes from the hotel chain and shopping mall giant Lotte, the court found. In return, Lotte\u2019s chairman, Shin Dong-bin, wanted government help in regaining a license to run lucrative duty-free shops, the court said. In February, Mr. Shin was sentenced to two and a half years in prison on bribery charges.Another pattern also held true: As in past corruption scandals, few corporate chiefs implicated in Ms. Park\u2019s and Ms. Choi\u2019s dealings seem likely to spend much time behind bars.Samsung\u2019s de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, the third-generation scion of the conglomerate\u2019s founding family, is the latest case in point, critics say.In August, Mr. Lee was sentenced to five years in prison for giving $6.7 million in bribes to Ms. Choi and Ms. Park, with a court finding that he had embezzled the sum from Samsung\u2019s coffers. Under South Korean law, a businessman convicted of embezzling more than $4.7 million must be sentenced to at least five years in prison. What is more, that term \u2014 like any prison term of more than three years \u2014 cannot be suspended by a judge.(The district court that sentenced Ms. Park disagreed with the appeals court, ruling that Mr. Lee had, indeed, offered $6.7 million in bribes \u2014 a finding that could put him in new jeopardy as the Supreme Court considers his case. Mr. Lee denies having committed bribery, maintaining that he never sought favors from Ms. Park in return for the money he said Samsung was forced to donate.)Kim Jin-baek, a professor at Chung-Ang University, a business school in Seoul, said the power of Samsung and other chaebol is so pervasive that some government officials will do them favors without a direct quid pro quo arrangement, believing that \u201cSamsung won\u2019t forget and one day will reward them.\u201dProfessor Kim said the corruption between chaebol and the government would not end as long as chaebol\u2019s founding families continued to exert far more influence over their empires than their shares warrant.A typical chaebol family owns just a small percentage of the conglomerate\u2019s shares but rules it like a fief through a maze of cross-share holdings, installing executives who Professor Kim said work for the family, \u201cnot for the interest of shareholders in general.\u201dSuch shady practices make the chaebol easy prey for officials seeking bribes, analysts said.Time and again, judges overseeing corruption trials have treated chaebol more as victims than as willing accomplices.With the economy heavily dependent on chaebol \u2014 Samsung alone generates revenues equivalent to one-fifth of South Korea\u2019s gross national product \u2014 some South Koreans are wary of disrupting them too much. They credit the controlling families with making daring investment decisions that were possible only because of their unchallenged management control. That strategy has helped Samsung edge out rivals, analysts say.President Moon Jae-in, who succeeded Ms. Park in May, is pushing for bills that would strengthen the rights of minority shareholders at chaebol and make it harder for their chairmen to enrich their children through dubious business deals. But his party lacks a majority in Parliament, where a pro-business lobby is strong, and the diplomacy surrounding North Korea has been a higher priority for the president.\u201cThe real, hidden power in our country remains chaebol,\u201d said Mr. Ahn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Virtual Currency Plans", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe offering was part of a broader, but still very private push that the firm was making into the nascent world of cryptocurrencies over the last year.The goal of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s own coin offering? Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, said in an interview. The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.\u201cWho knows more about the usage of personal data than Cambridge Analytica?\u201d Ms. Kaiser said. \u201cSo why not build a platform that reconstructs the way that works?\u201dThe effort was overseen by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s British chief executive, Alexander Nix, who was forced out of the company in March after he was caught on tape bragging about his company\u2019s approach to political work in other countries, including the use of shell companies and strategies designed to entrap opponents. The Facebook data revelations and Mr. Nix\u2019s comments appear to have put the virtual currency work, which was still in the early stages, on hold.\u201cThere are only a handful of more controversial areas it could have expanded its business into,\u201d said Tim Swanson, a consultant to companies in the industry, who was briefed on the Cambridge Analytica coin offering.A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Cambridge Analytica boasts that its \u201cpsychographic profiles\u201d of voters and consumers allow for more persuasive and precisely targeted advertising. In marketing material sent to investors, the firm said Ms. Kaiser was \u201chelping blockchain companies in using predictive modeling to target investors for token sales.\u201dJill Carlson, a consultant who has worked with several blockchain companies, attended meetings where Cambridge Analytica pitched its services to virtual currency companies, including one that Mr. Nix attended.Ms. Carlson said the Cambridge Analytica employees had bragged about their success in helping get President Trump elected and their ability to carefully target advertising campaigns using data from social networks like Facebook.She also remembers they spoke about an array of potential campaigns. The most unusual idea involved sending virtual currencies to people in far-flung regions of Mexico. The payments would give people incentive to fill out surveys and get data that could then be used to help design campaigns for Mexican political candidates.Ms. Carlson said the pitch was contrary to the ideas of openness and transparency that drew her to virtual currency projects like Bitcoin.\u201cThe way that Cambridge Analytica was talking about it, they were viewing it as a means of being able to basically inflict government control and private corporate control over individuals, which just takes the whole initial premise of this technology and turns it on its head in this very dystopian way,\u201d she said.Cambridge Analytica did win over some clients. Last summer, Ms. Kaiser\u2019s team began working with Dragon Coin, a new virtual currency that was designed to be used by gamblers. The coin was supposed to make it easier for people to get their money to casinos in Macau, an island that is technically a part of China with some independent political structures.But documents sent in September to potential investors by Dragon Coin\u2019s co-founder Paul Moynan listed Mr. Wan as the sponsor of the initial coin offering and included his picture. Ms. Kaiser was included in the email. A separate Dragon Coin document that Mr. Moynan sent out at the same time listed Mr. Wan as one of a few high-profile supporters of the project.When reached recently, Mr. Moynan initially said that his email address had been hacked and that he did not recognize the documents. He later said the documents were a \u201chypothetical wish list\u201d of a \u201cjunior staff\u201d member.\u201cWe will be conducting an internal investigation, as unfinished draft documents would never have been indicative of actual agreed partnerships,\u201d he said.Ms. Kaiser said that her work on the Dragon Coin event in Macau had been done in a personal capacity, and that the Dragon Coin team had told her that Mr. Wan was not involved with the project.Dragon Coin claimed it raised more than $300 million from investors last fall. That total has been hard to verify. Like many coin offerings, Dragon Coin has failed to live up to its promises.The document sent to investors in September said Dragon Coin had secured a partnership with Visa to release a debit card that would work on the Visa network. A spokeswoman for Visa said that there was no partnership and that no Dragon card had been approved, as is necessary for a card to be issued.The setbacks did not stop Cambridge Analytica from plunging further into the virtual currency realm. The company\u2019s New York office continued reaching out to potential investors and partners, emails show. And in January, Ms. Kaiser hosted a side conference dedicated to blockchain projects, known as CryptoHQ, at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Nix spoke on a panel at the event.He said that the technology would be helpful in solving the very problems that Cambridge Analytica has since become the emblem of \u2014 the abuse of online personal data.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a new type of economy emerging where people can start to take ownership of their data and monetize on their data,\u201d Mr. Nix said, according to a tweet from the CryptoHQ account. \u201cAnd that is only possible through the blockchain.\u201dThe virtual currency that Cambridge Analytica was designing was aimed at exactly this problem, and would have also helped the company raise money from investors.Nathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco, and Nicholas Confessore from New York.Advertisement"}

The figures are sobering, even in a political climate where deficit concerns appear to be receding.This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the budget deficit is expected to total $804 billion, up from $665 billion last fiscal year, according to the C.B.O. projections.

The company, he says, will block app developers from gaining access to the data of users who have been inactive for three months; restrict the ability of users to inadvertently share information about others in their networks; and adopt stricter permissions guidelines and search features.Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall\u2019s midterm elections.

But automakers in the United States have some flexibility in meeting these standards. They can, for instance, get credit for using refrigerants in vehicle air-conditioning units that contribute less to global warming, or get credit for selling more electric vehicles.The Obama-era rules were also footprint-based, which means that larger S.U.V.s and light trucks face less stringent standards than smaller passenger cars do \u2014 as is true in most countries.Normalized to U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy test cyclesIn recent years, as gasoline prices have fallen, more Americans have been opting to buy bigger cars and S.U.V.s. That trend has blunted the fuel savings originally projected under the Obama-era rules.

{"Headline": "British Book Publishers Fear Brexit Will Bring a U.S. Invasion", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsThe Olympia exhibition center in West Kensington teemed with British publishers and editors, a cohort badly in need of stress relief these days. Britain\u2019s looming departure from the European Union has set many people here on edge.\u201cBecause the details haven\u2019t been worked out yet, it\u2019s hard to know what is coming next,\u201d said Francis Bickmore, a director at Canongate, a Scottish publisher. \u201cI think we\u2019re sort of in denial.\u201dNearby, Nick Barley, who runs the Edinburgh International Book Festival, was more blunt. \u201cHalf the time\u201d he said, \u201cpeople are scared out of their minds.\u201dMuch of the worry stems from a looming fight with American publishers over sales in Continental Europe. For decades, the British have had this market to themselves, selling English-language editions of books in France, Italy and every other country in the European Union.Access to this market, without tariffs or the serious competition that comes with being part of European Union, has been a financial boon. Were British publishers to lose a substantial chunk of sales or face added costs on the Continent, the fallout could be dire.\u201cOur domestic market is tiny compared to the U.S.,\u201d said Clare Alexander, a literary agent with Aitken Alexander Associates. \u201cSo given our reliance on exports, what we\u2019re talking about with Europe is a fight for the survival of British publishing.\u201dThat\u2019s about as close to a public declaration of hostilities as you can expect. The battle for Europe\u2019s book market is already being fought quietly wherever author contracts are drafted. These contracts always include a list of territories where publishers want exclusive rights of distribution. More and more often, the list now drafted by American publishers includes the European continent.Patrick Walsh, a literary agent based in London, has seen Europe included in early drafts of two deals with United States publishers. In both cases, the publishers argued that by the time the book was in stores, Britain and the European Union will have parted company. In both cases, Mr. Walsh pushed back, suggesting that it was too early to know how Brexit would play out, and the codicil was removed.\u201cIt was a relatively friendly opening gambit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m absolutely certain we\u2019re going to see more of this.\u201dMuch of the talk here about the terms of Britain\u2019s divorce from Europe has centered on banks, real estate and blue-collar industries like fishing and mining. But the creative sector is also bracing for change and fretting about life after Brexit. Few are as worried as the roughly 30,000 people employed by the British book business.Part of it is a concern that Britain will cease to serve as one of the world\u2019s great cultural hubs. London in particular has been a huge attraction for foreign artists in fields like contemporary dance and theater.\u201cThose people are based here because they can come and go,\u201d said Andrew Franklin, co-founder of Profile Books, a London publishing house. \u201cThe same is true of literary culture. It\u2019s hugely dependent on new voices coming in from other places, and I worry that as this place puts up walls, the literary culture will become more isolated, with a consequent effect on publishing.\u201dMr. Franklin thinks the biggest threat posed by Brexit is the harm it may cause to the British economy, which could reduce disposable income, hurt book sales and result in the closing of both libraries and book shops. There are smaller and more practical worries, too, like the impact on British writers who lose access to Europe\u2019s grants and literary prizes. Plus, the United Kingdom has a robust intellectual property regime that publishers are eager to sustain.Get the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.Lobbyists for British publishers have conferred with key political players in Europe as well, but the future of the English-language book market there is unknown. British domination has been rooted in a combination of informal agreement (American and British publishers long ago divvied up countries, based largely on proximity and history) and trade law (as a European Union member, publishers in the United Kingdom have frictionless access to any country in what is known as the Single Market).Many British publishers and agents believe they will continue to outperform on the Continent simply because they are physically closer to it than their rivals.\u201cWhy would a British author want their books supplied from America to Europe, which is Britain\u2019s nearest market, Brexit or no Brexit?\u201d said Gordon Wise, former president of the Association of Authors\u2019 Agents, in an email. \u201cAnd why would even a U.S. author want to wait for stock to ship trans-Atlantically when it could be swiftly supplied from within the European geographical continent by their British publisher?\u201dIn addition to speed and ease of distribution, publishers in Britain have offered a higher royalty rate to authors they sell in Europe. In return for exclusive sales rights, British houses have paid what are known as \u201chome royalty rates\u201d \u2014 essentially, the amount of money they pay authors distributed within Britain \u2014 as opposed to \u201cexport royalty rates.\u201dThe difference is huge. Lorella Belli, a literary agent, said that the figures vary from publisher to publisher, but that roughly speaking authors earn one British pound (about $1.40) per hardback, when paid a home royalty. The export rate, by contrast, will yield the equivalent of about 7 cents per book.Executives in United States publishing say they are ready to pay home royalty rates for exclusivity in Europe, too. And they doubt that Britain\u2019s proximity argument for ascendancy in Europe has much force these days, given how swiftly products now move around the world.\u201cThat big body of water between America and Europe is not an issue, thanks to much improved supply chain logistics,\u201d said Carolyn Savarese of Kneerim & Williams, a literary agency with offices in Boston and New York. \u201cThe world has indeed gotten smaller. Or rather, the markets have gotten more accessible.\u201dIf Europe becomes a place where American and British publishers compete, the losers might be authors, Ms. Alexander said. While best-selling authors \u2014 the Grishams and Rowlings \u2014 may well command even larger advances in possible bidding wars, new writers and ones with middling sales records might wind up earning less.\u201cThe book industry in Europe is going to look more like Hollywood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to push further the idea that a book needs to be a blockbuster. That will mean smaller advances for excellent books that are more niche.\u201dStill up in the air is whether Britain will ultimately face new hurdles in Europe, like tariffs. The full implications of Brexit will come into focus in the coming months, as the basic terms of the departure are negotiated. But among publishers, the jostling for Europe has already begun.\u201cEveryone wants an advantage,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cIf they can grab it, they will.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And part of that is recognizing Israel\u2019s right to exist, preferably in the context of a peace deal with the Palestinians.\u201cI believe that each people, anywhere, has a right to live in their peaceful nation,\u201d Prince Mohammed told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic. \u201cI believe the Palestinians and the Israelis have the right to have their own land. But we have to have a peace agreement to assure the stability for everyone and to have normal relations.\u201dThe establishment of formal relations, he said, would benefit both nations, and their neighbors.\u201cIsrael is a big economy compared to their size and it\u2019s a growing economy, and of course there are a lot of interests we share with Israel \u2014 and if there is peace, there would be a lot of interest between Israel and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and countries like Egypt and Jordan,\u201d he said.Prince Mohammed has a close relationship with the Trump administration, and especially with the president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, whom the president has deputized to try to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The details of Mr. Kushner\u2019s peace plan have yet to be released, but it is widely believed that they are being coordinated with Prince Mohammed to try to get buy-in from the wider Arab world.Small signs of a thaw between Israel and the kingdom have emerged recently. Saudi Arabia allowed a commercial airline flight to Israel to pass through its airspace last month, and many in the region suspect that covert contacts between the two countries have grown, although the kingdom denies this.Reflecting a divide in the Saudi leadership over how to approach Israel, Prince Mohammed\u2019s father, King Salman, emphasized Palestinian rights in a phone call with Mr. Trump, the Saudi state news service said on Tuesday.The king restated \u201cthe kingdom\u2019s steadfast position towards the Palestinian issue and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital,\u201d the king said. He made no mention of Israel.In the interview, Prince Mohammed also played down the extent of anti-Semitism in Saudi society, which has historically been reinforced by government clerics and textbooks.\u201cOur country doesn\u2019t have a problem with Jews,\u201d Prince Mohammed said, adding that the Prophet Muhammad married a Jewish woman and that many Jews work in the kingdom.But like Christians and followers of other non-Islamic faiths, they have not been allowed to build houses of worship or to practice their religion openly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Gains in Trading Raise a Familiar Dilemma: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 A \u2018Geneva Convention\u2019 for cyberwar?\u2022 Did Goldman\u2019s trading business perform too well?\u2022 The U.S.-China fight has pushed deeper into tech.Goldman Sachs\u2019s strong first-quarter earnings raise a familiar dilemma for the bank.The results got a significant fillip from trading, a business Goldman must do well in, but not so well that investors think the bank is too dependent on it. And a breakdown of first-quarter revenue shows the dominance of trading. Revenue from trading in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives totaled $4.39 billion during the first three months of the year. That works out at 44 percent of total revenue, well above the 37 percent share that trading had in 2017.Stock and bond markets are unpredictable, even in relatively good times, so the helpful trading conditions this quarter may not last. What can Goldman\u2019s senior executives do to persuade investors that the bank is a lot more than a trading shop? They can point to the fact that David M. Solomon is in line to succeed Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s current C.E.O. Mr. Solomon ascent took place in the bank\u2019s powerful investment banking division, not its trading operations.Goldman\u2019s leaders can continue to talk about the steps the bank is taking to widen its client base and diversify into other businesses that might have more stable revenue, like its relatively new consumer lending operations. But such businesses are going to take time to make a meaningful contribution.And it\u2019s important to remember that other major businesses at Goldman are also volatile. Investing and lending, which mostly involves making longer-term investments in companies, and whose revenue can be unpredictable, made up 21 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, the second largest contribution.Despite the bumper results in trading along with investing and lending, Goldman\u2019s shares slid slightly on Tuesday, suggesting investors are waiting on longer-term trends than one quarter\u2019s results.But the volatility of revenue is not the only reason investors are often skeptical about Wall Street firms. The huge amounts that they pay out in compensation is also a concern. When revenue rises, so does pay. As a result, money that could have fallen to the bottom line at other types of companies instead gets paid out to traders and bankers. Compensation at Goldman Sachs made up 45 percent of non-interest revenue in the first quarter, up from 44 percent the first quarter of 2017.\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the numbers:The move comes amid an outcry prompted by the arrests of two African-American men at a Starbucks location in Philadelphia last week.The two men were arrested after asking to use the restroom in the shop. An employee refused their request, because the men had not bought anything, according to officials. The men sat down and were asked to leave, and an employee eventually called the police. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Philadelphia reviewed the case and declined to pursue charges against the men because of \u201ca lack of evidence that a crime was committed,\u201d according to a spokesman.Some may be optimistic that the $1.5 trillion tax cut will extend the business cycle.The strategists at Morgan Stanley are not among them.\u201cWhile there\u2019s a fair amount of debate about how much this fiscal expansion extended the economic cycle, for markets our analysis suggests we\u2019re closer to the end of the day than the beginning. Hence, there\u2019s less reason to behave like it\u2019s \u2018morning in America\u2019 than \u2018happy hour in America.\u2019\u201dKey points\u2022 Morgan Stanley argues that while the tax cuts will help lift growth in the near term, its benefits are already priced into the markets.\u2022 The new tax law creates economic cliffs, as many key provisions in the law are not permanent and end in just a few years.\u2022 The tax cuts may make it more difficult for the government to turn to fiscal stimulus to fight the next downturn.In conclusion\u201cWhile this policy supports growth in the near term, it may worsen the next downturn while limiting the fiscal reaction to it. Even if those concerns are unfounded, we think much of fiscal stimulus\u2019 \u2018good news\u2019 is already in the price of key markets.\u201dThe streaming video company added 7.41 million subscribers during the first quarter. Its profit jumped 62 percent, and sales grew 40 percent.Netflix also said it plans to spend $10 billion on content and marketing this year.Shares are up 8.6 percent Tuesday and 75 percent this year. That easily beats the S.&P. 500, which has gained just 0.2 percent this year. It also tops the performance of its fellow FANG stocks. Facebook is off 4.5 percent this year, Google-parent Alphabet is up about 3 percent, and Amazon has risen 28 percent.Stephen Ju, an analyst over at Credit Suisse, writes in a note titled \u201cGetting Closer and Closer to Achieving Escape Velocity\u201d:\u201cNetflix continues to reap the benefits of its programming win streak, as it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors (especially as Disney prepares to exit the platform). And we find it hard to argue with the accelerated pace of subscriber additions as the conceptual proof of its capital allocation decision, and we also expect the Street to continue to underwrite the investments.\u201dTwitter is having an even better day.The stock is up 87 percent over that period.The NYT\u2019s David Sanger says the impetus came largely from Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, \u201cwho has been arguing for several years that the world needs a \u2018digital Geneva Convention\u2019 that sets norms of behavior for cyberspace just as the Geneva Conventions set rules for the conduct of war in the physical world.\u201dAlso striking: Who hasn\u2019t yet signed, including Google, Apple and Amazon.More from Michael:Ms. Massenet and Mr. Brown are counting on Ms. Massenet\u2019s Net-a-Porter experience and contacts to help Imaginary Ventures stand out. The firm has already invested in companies like Glossier and Everlane, an upstart clothing brand.Mr. Ballmer said of the latest report, \u201cPublic companies owe this level of transparency to shareholders; I think citizens, as America\u2019s shareholders, deserve the same.\u201dAs more financial firms move to pressure gun makers and sellers into self-regulation, the advocacy group (backed by Mike Bloomberg) plans to ask them to press for more policy positions and operational changes.Among them: Requiring background checks for all gun sales; more funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; having gun makers require sellers to adopt a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech.Advertisement"}

But Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House committee responsible for internet regulation, warned voters not to expect much.\u201cI hate to be such a pessimist, but I don\u2019t believe the Republicans will end up doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t have any faith in their willingness to regulate to protect privacy in the context of Facebook.\u201dBeyond the typical political gridlock that has stymied action in Congress, technology and the companies that sell access to it are particularly protected.Inaction does not reflect a lack of will so much as a failure of expertise.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen an issue where everybody seemed to be on the same sheet of music,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said Thursday.If Congress does not follow through with new rules for internet companies, \u201cwe\u2019ll look like a bunch of idiots,\u201d Mr. Graham added.Avoiding that dunce cap will be difficult. Lawmakers will confront Silicon Valley\u2019s powerful new lobbying establishment. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple now hold the biggest corporate lobbying budgets in Washington and spent a combined $49.7 million in 2017 on direct lobbying, which does not include their outside lobbying trade groups, up 24 percent from the previous year. They have hired top privacy experts into their lobbying troops to defeat privacy and other internet laws.Facebook has said it would embrace some regulation, with Mr. Zuckerberg saying this week that rules for internet companies were \u201cinevitable.\u201d But he also indicated that it would have to be the \u201cright\u201d regulations, and he was not willing to commit on the spot to several ideas posed by lawmakers.The hearings spurred new momentum for the introduction of privacy laws. On Thursday, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, introduced legislation that would allow consumers to opt out of getting tracked on a site. The bill would also mandate simpler privacy policies.One new bill would restrict data collection of students using classroom technology, and another would require companies to get permission before collecting and sharing user data. That would move the United States closer to rules about to take effect next month in Europe. An earlier bill would mandate more disclosure on Facebook advertising purchases.Nevertheless, the creation of any regulations in coming months is doubtful. Most lawmakers said in the hearings that they were concerned about privacy and foreign interference on social media during the 2016 election. But several Republicans also expressed anxiety over regulations that could slow the growth of Silicon Valley, a beacon for the American economy.\u201cThese are tough ones. Privacy versus innovation versus security versus freedom \u2014 these are always tough questions,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. He said he would most likely support the political ad disclosures bill but added, \u201cWhen we step in, are we always late?\u201dThis week, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced the Consent Act, which would require companies to get permission before tracking and sharing data. But even he pointed to Washington\u2019s short attention span. Companies like Facebook, he said, would try to stand in Congress\u2019s way.\u201cThey will try to make it more complex than it is,\u201d he said.\u201cThe question is timing,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, pointing to the difficult midterm elections in November and the desire by many legislators to do as little as possible until then. \u201cThis session, everybody says, is over as far as serious legislating is concerned.\u201dMr. Graham, who said regulations were necessary, also acknowledged the pitfalls of moving too fast.\u201cI\u2019d hate to be the senator that killed an effort to have reasonable regulation,\u201d Mr. Graham said. But, he conceded, \u201cYou really need to know what you are signing up for.\u201dBeyond the short term, the hearings may have laid the foundation for broader privacy regulations in coming years, analysts said. The most likely action to follow Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling is the passage of a bill that requires financial disclosures of political advertising on social media, a law similar to broadcast television and radio political ad disclosures.Narrow regulatory ideas could gain momentum that prevent online location tracking, strengthen privacy protections for children and teens and require stronger disclosures for data breaches. But the government\u2019s light hand on Silicon Valley will continue for some time even as the European Union prepares to enact comprehensive privacy rules that limit data collection and push companies to ask permission before sharing information about users.Even if seats in the House and Senate shift after the midterm elections, any privacy laws would be at least a couple of years away, said Paul Gallant, a technology policy analyst at the Cowen Group.\u201cIf Democrats win the House in November, the chances of legislation would rise, although a likely Republican Senate would still make passage an uphill battle,\u201d Mr. Gallant said.A big problem is the lack of technological expertise in Congress, and the informational imbalance with the tech companies\u2019 lobbyists.In 2011, tech lobbyists blanketed the Senate Judiciary Committee after former Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced a geolocation privacy bill.Internet firms brought in engineers and deployed their outside lobbying groups to warn lawmakers that Mr. Franken\u2019s bill was dangerous and technically flawed, said Alvaro Bedoya, a former staff member for Mr. Franken who is now the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology.Another obstacle to action is a disagreement on regulatory priorities.Indeed, Mr. Graham identified a grab bag of problems that he wanted addressed with Facebook, most of which are not being addressed by any current legislative proposals.He mentioned terrorism content, Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly\u201d and political bias as regulatory targets. At Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday, other lawmakers brought up data breaches, foreign interference and censorship, particularly of the pro-Trump internet personalities Diamond and Silk.\u201cI want somebody to look at how they set these machines up, not just for Facebook, but other people, to make sure that the algorithms are not being politically motivated,\u201d Mr. Graham said.The lack of technological knowledge was glaring. Members mostly comprised lawyers or former business people, and many are just getting acquainted with social media, artificial intelligence, autonomous self-driving cars, drones and other technologies that they are charged to oversee.Diversity in government has become a platform issue for Brianna Wu, a former software designer who is running for the 8th House district in Massachusetts.Ms. Wu watched Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s hearings and was struck by the basic lack of knowledge members had in how the site works, such as the business model of ad-supported websites and how messaging apps like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp works. Before the hearings, many of the members brought in technology experts from academic institutions to prepare them for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance.\u201cMost people can understand why guns are a threat,\u201d she said. \u201cWith technology, people don\u2019t understand fundamentally what the threat is. That is a threat to democracy.\u201dA photo caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified a member of the Senate attending the hearing.

{"Headline": "U.S. and China Play Chicken on Trade, and Neither Swerves", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 At the heart of the intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China is a fundamental question: Which country is more willing to endure short-term pain for the long-term gain of playing a leading role in high-tech industries.China has embarked on an aggressive and expensive plan to retool its economy for the future as it moves to dominate in robotics, aerospace, artificial intelligence and more. President Trump has said China\u2019s approach relies on unfair and predatory practices, and on stolen American technology. And even as Chinese leaders say they want to avoid a trade war, they are staunchly defending their plans and showing little sign of backing down.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to sharply escalate the administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports \u2014 a threat he reiterated on Friday \u2014 shows that neither side has yet gone far enough to persuade the other to compromise. Bigger and broader tariffs may be necessary to get China\u2019s attention.\u201cThe administration, if it\u2019s serious, better be prepared for much more,\u201d said Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.It is an agenda that China would probably go to great lengths to protect. \u201cWe will not start a war \u2014 however, if someone starts a war, we will definitely fight back,\u201d Gao Feng, the commerce ministry spokesman, said at a news conference in Beijing on Friday. \u201cNo options will be ruled out.\u201dFor the United States, victory in such a war would be difficult to verify, much less achieve.China could say it plans to ease back on government support. But that could be difficult to quantify because of the country\u2019s opaque political system and the state\u2019s control of information.China could back off from rules that favor local competitors and require American companies to share technology if they want access to the Chinese market. For example, foreign automakers face pressure to transfer electric-car technology to their local partners, and foreign technology companies are increasingly required to submit to security reviews. Foreign businesses have long complained that many of the rules they must follow are unwritten.Proving that the Chinese government unfairly supports the effort could be difficult, however.The United States could press its argument with the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trading rules and prohibits big loans from government-controlled banks at artificially low interest rates. But the W.T.O. requires many contracts and government documents to prove cases, evidence that can be hard to get in a tightly controlled country like China.Even when the W.T.O. rules against China, persuading the country to comply can be challenging. One such ruling, involving China\u2019s restrictions on foreign electronic payment systems, was issued nearly six years ago. China is still mulling how it will comply \u2014 despite numerous complaints from the Obama administration and more recent nudges from the Trump administration.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.So the United States has turned to tariffs. That means it is using a 1980s tool to address an industrial policy issue that is already shaping the 21st century.Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, was a deputy United States trade representative under President Ronald Reagan. The tariffs that Mr. Lighthizer threatened against Japan in those days are among the same ones he is wielding now. But the two periods differ in two big ways.One is that Japan depended on the United States in the \u201980s for military protection from the Soviet Union. China, by contrast, is an increasingly assertive global rival, sending naval vessels to the Baltic Sea and building a naval base in East Africa.The second major difference between then and now is that the European Union deeply resented the tariffs of the 1980s, and Mr. Trump\u2019s use of them could make it difficult to persuade European officials to present a united front. In response to American tariffs, Beijing could simply shift business from American companies like Boeing and Ford to European rivals like Airbus and Daimler.Chinese officials dispute the American accusations about their unfair trade practices. They say Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs violate W.T.O. rules, and they dispute claims that China forces American companies to hand over technology. As for Made in China 2025, Chinese officials say the plan is only guidance, not a government directive \u2014 and that foreign companies are free to participate, too.In China\u2019s current industrial policy, the Trump administration sees an extension of how the country has already come to dominate one major industry of the future: solar power.Mr. Trump himself is no fan of solar panels. He has spoken enthusiastically about coal, not renewable energy, throughout his campaign and his presidency. But the solar power industry is one of the biggest success stories so far in China\u2019s efforts involving advanced industries.The United States played a central role in developing solar panels and manufacturing them until a decade ago. Around then, the Chinese government decided to finance a lavish expansion of the sector. State-controlled banks lent tens of billions of dollars at low interest rates despite the high-profile bankruptcies of solar manufacturers.Chinese firms now produce three-quarters of the world\u2019s solar panels. Most American and European companies have closed factories, and many have become insolvent. China\u2019s success in producing solar panels has given Beijing a blueprint for seizing the lead in a long list of other high-tech industries.Many foreign companies are caught between China\u2019s industrial ambitions and Washington\u2019s efforts to stop them, including major aerospace companies and carmakers. The conflict may spread: Made in China 2025 could create major competitors to General Electric and Intel, and to companies outside the United States like Siemens and Samsung.Tariffs could hurt such companies if the United States and China follow through on their plans. They also risk losing their competitiveness if Beijing succeeds in subsidizing the creation of large Chinese rivals in their industries.Boeing, for example, could be hit by American tariffs on civilian aircraft parts it buys from Avic, a state-controlled Chinese military and aviation company \u2014 required purchases if the company, which is based in Chicago, wants to sell planes in China. China, in turn, is pushing a consortium that includes Avic to become a Boeing rival. Boeing, like other multinational companies, has refrained from endorsing or criticizing the tariffs.\u201cAlthough our members are unhappy with retaliatory tariffs being used,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, \u201cthere is a belief that greater pressure has to be brought to bear on China.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Liberal Dissident Became a Far-Right Hero, in Hungary and Beyond", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUDAPEST \u2014 During the final days of communism in Hungary, a young, liberal dissident wrote to a foundation run by the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, asking for a grant to finance his research into grass-roots democracy.Hungary would soon \u201ctransition from dictatorship to democracy,\u201d the student wrote in 1988. \u201cOne of the main elements of this transition can be the rebirth of civil society.\u201dEach country has its own story. But societies across Central and Eastern Europe are dominated by similar figures \u2014 some by politicians who, like Mr. Orban, have lost interest in the liberal democratic project that followed the crumbling of communism in 1989, and others by those with different motivations who have exploited voters\u2019 growing disaffection with liberalism.Personal freedoms and wealth did increase, but the chaotic nature of the process, compounded by the global financial crisis in 2008, meant that expectations often outpaced progress. In some countries, the privatization of state assets was perceived as benefiting foreign investors and corrupt politicians more often than it did ordinary citizens.\u201cKaczynski is a master of playing on bad emotions,\u201d said Radoslaw Sikorski, who was foreign minister and speaker of the Polish Parliament during the government that preceded Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s.But no one exemplifies the angry direction of post-communist Eastern Europe more than Viktor Orban, whose journey from liberal academic to illiberal populist is starker than any of his regional contemporaries. He used the Soros grant to study the history of civil society at Oxford University, fought communism as a dissident from behind the Iron Curtain and then, as a center-right politician, helped to steer Hungary into the European Union and NATO.\u201cThe worst nightmare, in terms of Orban-ism spreading, has come true,\u201d said Gerald Knaus, the director of the European Stability Initiative, a Berlin-based research group.The young Mr. Orban was a passionate dissident, famous for a 1988 speech in which he demanded that Soviet troops leave Hungarian soil. At another rally, Mr. Orban risked his life to protect another opposition leader, Gaspar Miklos Tamas, taking several blows to his head as he thrust himself between the police and Mr. Tamas.He gave little hint of his future trajectory \u2014 save a cameo role in a student production of the German Absurdist drama \u201cHow Mr. Mockinpott Was Cured of His Sufferings\u201d, in which he played a demagogue.\u201cIt was not his aim to be a politician,\u201d said Gabor Fodor, Mr. Orban\u2019s former roommate and best friend. \u201cHe wanted to be an intellectual and to be a member of Hungarian intellectual circles.\u201dThat all began to shift in 1990, with the approach of Hungary\u2019s first democratic elections in half a century. Mr. Orban had co-founded a liberal youth group, Fidesz, that was reconstituted as a political party and won 22 seats in the new Parliament.Appointed as the party\u2019s leader, Mr. Orban spoke out against nationalism, defended civil society and opposed clerical influence in politics. But behind the scenes, his political ideology was beginning to morph \u2014 and he was beginning to exert greater control on the management of Fidesz.By 1993, Mr. Orban had assumed overall leadership of Fidesz, redefined it as a more nationalist and centrist party and ruthlessly sidelined its liberal faction, headed by his now former friend, Gabor Fodor.Quite why Mr. Orban changed is a matter of debate. Some contemporaries believe it was the genuine ideological shift of a young man whose politics were a work in progress. Others argue he grew resentful of cosmopolitan liberals.But most feel that Mr. Orban\u2019s transition was a pragmatic response to the landscape of Hungarian politics. Overshadowed by other left-of-center parties, Fidesz lacked a clear brand. By tacking toward the political center, Mr. Orban reckoned that his party could stand out.Unlike most other Hungarian politicians of the time, Mr. Orban \u201cthought about politics in a more professional way,\u201d said Zsuzsanna Szelenyi, one of the Fidesz lawmakers sidelined by Mr. Orban in 1993. \u201cHe realized it was about power.\u201dDespite Mr. Orban\u2019s machinations, Fidesz did poorly in the 1994 elections. He responded by shifting further to the right, turning Fidesz into a center-right Christian democratic party \u2014 one still open to Western and American ideals.\u201cThe 1990s were wonderful for American diplomats,\u201d said Donald Blinken, who, as the American ambassador to Hungary from 1994 to 1997, lunched annually with Mr. Orban. \u201cEveryone loved us, the Cold War was won, and we thought it was this great period of peace and prosperity.\u201dBut Mr. Orban kept growing more nationalistic \u2014 and, apparently, more religious.Married in a civil wedding a decade earlier, Mr. Orban and his wife, Aniko Levai, renewed their vows in a religious ceremony in 1996. Gabor Ivanyi, the pastor who performed that second ceremony, has since become skeptical of Mr. Orban\u2019s motivations. \u201cHe had to convince people, to win over the conservative right,\u201d Mr. Ivanyi said. \u201cHe is an unscrupulous person.\u201dMr. Orban finally assumed power in 1998, becoming prime minister for the first time at the head of a conservative coalition. (Voters were angered by the Socialist-led government\u2019s handling of the struggling economy.)For the next four years, Mr. Orban operated as a relatively orthodox center-right politician. His administration was tainted by minor corruption scandals, but his performance was mostly praised.He brought Hungary to the brink of European Union membership and shepherded the country into NATO, an event he celebrated with a private dinner in Brussels attended by several of his mentors, including Zbigniew Pelczynski, his politics professor at Oxford.It was his defeat in the 2002 elections that accelerated his pivot to the far right.\u201cThey say that power spoils good politicians,\u201d said Jozsef Debreczeni, an adviser to Mr. Orban after his first rightward turn \u2014 and later his biographer. \u201cWith Orban that wasn\u2019t the case. It was the loss of power that did that.\u201dDuring an intense one-and-a-half days after the election, Mr. Debreczeni listened as Mr. Orban blamed his political demise on a partisan news media that needed to be reined in.Mr. Debreczeni said that Mr. Orban had drawn one conclusion: \u201cThis democracy thing, where power can slip so quickly from you, was no good.\u201d\u201cAnd from that point on,\u201d Mr. Debreczeni added, \u201che spent his time preparing so that if he ever won power again, he wouldn\u2019t lose it.\u201dThe global financial crisis of 2008, coupled with increasing resentment of the Socialist-led government, eventually gave Mr. Orban that chance. The Socialists, who were also in power during the economic turmoil of the 1990s, were accused of squandering the political and economic potential of the transition from communism.Mr. Orban reinvented himself as an outsider who promised to restore Hungarian control to an economy buffeted by external forces \u2014 a popular policy among Hungarians rankled by how privatization efforts after 1989 had allowed foreigners to take over parts of Hungarian industry.\u201cTo understand the Orban phenomenon, you have to go back to 1989,\u201d said Laszlo Andor, who was once Hungary\u2019s most senior representative at the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm. \u201cPeople\u2019s ambitions were not fulfilled.\u201dMr. Orban sees all this as nothing less than the march of history.Benjamin Novak contributed reporting from Budapest, and Palko Karasz from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Banks Will Have to Cut Ties to Sanctioned Oligarchs, U.S. Says", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The United States on Tuesday ratcheted up its efforts to block Kremlin-linked industrialists from doing business in the West, warning that British banks will have to sever their relationships with the tycoons if they want continued access to American financial institutions.\u201cThese are blocking sanctions,\u201d Ms. Mandelker, under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said at a briefing with reporters. \u201cThere of course would be consequences for U.K. financial institutions\u201d that continued to do business with the Russians.The warning has resonated in London, which for decades has served as a haven for Russia\u2019s wealthiest families. Russian investors own iconic British assets like the Chelsea Football Club and swaths of high-end London real estate, and they support thriving networks of lawyers, financial advisers and estate agents.The United States has long prodded its European partners to match its economic sanctions against high-ranking Russians, but it has encountered resistance because Russia\u2019s business ties to Europe are so much deeper than to the United States.Ms. Mandelker said there has been great unity on Russia among European nations since March 4, when Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian double agent, was found poisoned in southwestern England. She said the United States was consulting intensively with British financial institutions and oversight agencies as it prepared to impose the latest round of sanctions.\u201cWe have very strong and close allies and partners in the U.K.\u201d she said. \u201cThey understand clearly what the risks are. We continue to communicate those risks to them.\u201dThe ruble slid sharply in value for a second day on Tuesday. The mining giant, Glencore, which is based in Switzerland, began loosening its ties with Mr. Deripaska\u2019s company, Rusal, which is one or the world\u2019s largest aluminum producers. Glencore announced it had canceled a planned swap of its stake in Rusal for shares in another Deripaska company, and Glencore\u2019s chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, who has served on Rusal\u2019s board since 2007, said that he would step down.The new American sanctions expose financial institutions outside the United States to penalties if they \u201cknowingly facilitate significant financial transactions\u201d on behalf of the listed Russian oligarchs.The wording is similar to secondary sanctions imposed against Iran. These \u201cessentially prohibit the individuals involved from taking part in the dollar economy,\u201d said Daragh McDowell, an analyst for Europe and Central Asia at Verisk Maplecroft, a consulting firm based in Bath.It is likely to compel risk-averse British banks to cancel the Russians\u2019 accounts altogether, said Brian O\u2019Toole, a former senior official at the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers and enforces American sanctions.London\u2019s real estate market might also be affected, having benefited from waves of investment from Russians with ties to the Kremlin, some of it routed through shell companies registered in overseas territories like the British Virgin Islands. Banks and estate agents might take steps to increase financial transparency, including trying harder to identify the source of funds used by foreign buyers of real estate.\u201cThe amount of Russian real estate in Mayfair is well known, it\u2019s kind of a running gag in the financial industry,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Toole, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \u201cThis is something London should have a done a while ago, to clean this up. I think London knows that, and 10 Downing Street knows it as well. I think that\u2019s the next thing to come.\u201dHe added that the United States has similar vulnerabilities, having allowed many foreigners to purchase valuable properties without having to identify themselves as the owners.British officials have not always been enthusiastic about the American sanctions, but British businesses have tended to comply, largely out of fear of being penalized by the United States, said Ian Bond, director of foreign policy at the Center for European Reform.\u201cThe reality is that, for most companies dealing with the United States, the U.S. is much more important than dealing with Russia or Cuba or Iran or Libya,\u201d he said.Bill Browder, an investor based in the United Kingdom who has led international campaigns to impose sanctions on Mr. Putin and his associates, described the sanctions imposed by Washington last week as the most forceful \u201cby orders of magnitude\u201d to hit Russia in years.If Mr. Deripaska, for example, wanted to buy a house in Europe now, he would be hard-pressed to find a seller willing to accept money from him, Mr. Browder said.\u201cThere is no safe haven when this type of stuff happens,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can buy houses in China if they want. They can buy houses in Dubai, if they want to transfer rubles and convert it into local currency. What this does is end their ability to operate anywhere in the West.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: When Skyscraper Was a Dirty Word", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.On some days in downtown San Francisco the yellow and orange hard hats of construction workers bobbing along the sidewalk seem to outnumber the laptop-toting tech workers.But \u201cskyscraper\u201d was once a dirty word in San Francisco. High rises were demonized in the 1970s by a generation of activists who battled against the \u201cManhattanization\u201d of the city. The man who spearheaded the anti-skyscraper campaign, Alvin E. Duskin, now lives in a charming wooden house in the rolling hills of northwestern Marin County.He recently spoke to us about the two ballot initiatives he organized in the 1970s that would have outlawed buildings taller than six stories.In 1971, Mr. Duskin, who was born in San Francisco and owned a garment business, compared high rises to \u201ctombstones.\u201d\u201cThe whole idea was that the city was being controlled by developers,\u201d Mr. Duskin said. \u201cWe said, \u2018Is this the future you want? Is this where you want to raise your kids?\u2019\u201dBoth initiatives failed, but Mr. Duskin says the threat of further votes against skyscrapers led city officials to impose height limits in residential areas.Mr. Duskin continued his career as an activist, campaigning against nuclear power and promoting wind energy.Today he speaks longingly of the days when rents were cheap and people came from all over the country to pursue careers as poets, authors and artists in San Francisco. He reminisces about ample parking and whiling away afternoons at cafes where friends like Lenny Bruce or Dick Gregory would stop by to chat.He rarely travels into San Francisco any more.\u201cIt\u2019s lost its livability for people who aren\u2019t devoted just to making money, its livability for people who want to do creative things in the arts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s over for me. It\u2019s a different city.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Ah, springtime in Northern California, when the fruit trees are in full bloom \u2014 and a hailstorm shreds all their leaves. It\u2019s been an odd few months of weather in the San Francisco Bay Area, with a January that felt like May and a waterlogged March of relentless storms.The hail on Monday, which fell in parts of the East Bay, brought delight to kids who scooped up handfuls of marble-size ice balls. And dread to their parents driving them to school and commuting to work.The storm was good news for skiers, bringing around nine more inches of snow to the peaks around Lake Tahoe and allowing some resorts to extend their season.The rest of the week will remain unseasonably cold, forecasters say.

{"Headline": "Macron Had a Big Plan for Europe. It\u2019s Now Falling Apart.", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd for fans of Europe, that\u2019s too bad.The window for meaningful changes is rapidly closing before next year\u2019s elections for a new European Parliament, and the choices of a new European Commission, European Commission president and head of the European Central Bank. Projects and legislation not approved by June or by latest October will fall by the wayside until 2020.It would be a shame to miss this chance, said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cIt is urgent, a window of opportunity between now and European elections is real but narrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe constellation of the most centrist German chancellor in a long time in her last term looking for her legacy and a French president, newly elected on a European platform and highly ambitious, is very rare.\u201d\u201cIf you think European reform can happen outside a crisis, you\u2019ll never get a better constellation than now,\u201d he added.If populism and nationalism surged with the impact of the financial crisis, Mr. Macron argues, the best answer is a more integrated European Union that protects and benefits its citizens and a more sustainable eurozone, with its own budget, banking protections and financial management.\u201cIt\u2019s getting hard politically, it\u2019s getting hard timewise, and it\u2019s getting hard in terms of momentum,\u201d said Jean Pisani-Ferry, a French economist and former adviser to Mr. Macron. \u201cNot only for the countries with no appetite for it, but for Germany, too.\u201dIn Germany, new ministers are still figuring out their jobs, Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing Christian Democrats are running to the right and the Social Democrats, the center-left party in the coalition, have silenced their most prominent pro-European voices.Christian Democratic lawmakers have been pushing to anchor any financial overhaul to a treaty change, which in turn would require approval from individual parliaments, creating considerably more uncertainty and delay.In a joint news conference on Thursday in Berlin, Ms. Merkel promised Mr. Macron some form of compromise over how to reinforce the euro and the eurozone\u2019s banks.\u201cThere are of course always different starting points when it comes to the opinions of Germany and France,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need open debates and in the end we need the ability to compromise.\u201dBut compromise will mean minor changes, and almost surely on German terms.Nouriel Roubini, a globe-trotting economist who predicted the crash of a decade ago, said that the fundamental problems of the euro \u201cwon\u2019t be solved until you have real fiscal and then political union. But for now, it\u2019s stalled, and the Germans will see the Italian risks as another reason not to move forward.\u201dThe Germans are \u201cworried as ever that risk sharing becomes risk shifting, that a fiscal union becomes a transfer union,\u201d he said.Until eurozone countries like France, Greece, Italy and Portugal \u201chave done enough fiscal austerity so that public debt is sustainable, and do enough reform so that their potential growth approaches that of Germany,\u201d Berlin will hesitate, he added.At the same time, Mr. Roubini said, Mr. Macron has made some important fixes in France, increasing market flexibility, taxing some pensions and cutting the budget deficit.\u201cSo he can tell the Germans that \u2018it\u2019s not only cheap talk I\u2019m delivering, and while you may not be able to accept full range of reforms, we can meet somewhere in the middle,\u2019\u201d Mr. Roubini said.Macron proposals like a eurozone finance minister and a budget, to help countries deal with high unemployment or economic shocks, have been put aside while the bloc tries to make a few less spectacular and more technocratic fixes.Given timing, the European Commission has narrowed its focus, said Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner in charge of the euro and financial stability. \u201cWe need to strengthen the resilience of the eurozone economy and its shock-absorption tools,\u201d he said in an interview.That means, he said, concentrating on promoting structural reforms in member states, completing a banking union and turning the European Stability Mechanism, created during the Greek debt crisis, into a more competent European Monetary Fund.The idea is to protect eurozone countries and their banks from another crisis. But there are concerns about the governance of the new fund, about how much money would be involved and about how non-eurozone members would contribute.There are also worries about the amount of nonperforming loans still held by banks in countries like Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Portugal, as well as the amount of sovereign debt they hold, given the lesson of the euro crisis that sovereign bonds are hardly risk-free.So Germany and northern countries in particular are pressing for more \u201crisk reduction\u201d before \u201crisk sharing,\u201d Mr. Dombrovskis said.That means that another key change intended to reassure citizens \u2014 a European banking deposit insurance scheme, like one in the United States \u2014 is unlikely to happen soon.Instead, Mr. Dombrovskis said he hoped for gradual progress, increasing bank liquidity first before moving toward mutualization of debts, which remains a red line for Berlin.\u201cBut we need to move during this mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must agree not to lose another year.\u201d Given the populist surge, \u201cWe need Europeans to feel these positive economic figures in their pocketbooks, to show people that they are better off with Europe than without.\u201dBut risks increase over time, with growth due to slow in the medium term, Brexit unresolved, Italy confusing and a possible trade war in the offing, noted Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the Eurasia Group. \u201cMarkets remain complacent for now, but it will not last forever,\u201d he said.Jyrki Katainen, the European commissioner for jobs and growth, said in an interview that \u201cthe main issue is trust among member states, which is not as good as it should be.\u201dRather than a Macronian revolution, he urged evolution, and a road map for the next five or 10 years. \u201cA longer perspective would help trust, with steps made conditional, so it\u2019s not unbalanced,\u201d he said.Heidi Crebo-Rediker, who was the State Department\u2019s first chief economist, said she foresaw a slow process. \u201cUntil you have confidence in all the banking systems, including Italy, and an agreement that risks can now be managed centrally, only then you take that final step forward,\u201d she said.\u201cBut just when you have the potential to move forward in France and Germany, there\u2019s the potential for a real scare from the south, from Italy,\u201d she added. \u201cSo even slow progress is now under threat.\u201dMr. Katainen, a Finnish former prime minister, still sees progress coming from Paris and Berlin.\u201cMacron and Merkel get along well, respect one another, are both pro-European and ambitious,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth want to leave a mark on Europe. I see Macron as pragmatic, setting his priorities for the future, but it doesn\u2019t mean every detail must be done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Criticizes OPEC, Calling Oil Prices \u2018Artificially\u2019 High", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries makes an easy scapegoat for American politicians. It has been a target of derision by American leaders since the Arab oil embargo of 1973 caused long lines at the pump and badly damaged the economy.But OPEC doesn\u2019t have the same influence it once did, given soaring production in the United States, Canada and a few other countries. Now it is just one factor in lifting prices, which are being affected by everything from geopolitics to the growing demand for gasoline and diesel fuel.Mr. Trump could have been referring to OPEC\u2019s cutback in exports to increase prices. Saudi Arabia and other oil producers in the region have also made an alliance of convenience with Russia, a non-OPEC member heavily dependent on oil revenues to finance its government. Together they have restrained production since 2016, reducing global stockpiles.\u201cPrices are high,\u201d said Rob West, an analyst at Redburn, a London research firm. Noting that Mr. Trump may have a point, he added, \u201cI do see some artificiality in the prices we see today.\u201dOPEC and non-OPEC producers gathered Friday in the Saudi city of Jidda in an effort to continue the policy even as the price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, has climbed above $70.Not long ago, as prices plummeted from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in early 2016, inventories were so high that tankers were needed to hold excess supplies. Now, even as United States oil production continues to grow, worldwide inventories are declining, increasing the pressure on prices. The International Energy Agency reported that global oil supply eased by 120,000 barrels a day in March.The price of crude is the major reason American drivers are paying more at the pump as the summer driving season approaches. The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $2.75 a gallon, according to AAA, up 19 cents over the last month and 33 cents from a year ago. It is the highest level since the summer of 2015.The increase has been particularly noticeable over the last week, with prices in some states rising more than a penny a gallon every day.Americans consume roughly 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so the 33-cent increase over the last year means roughly $132 million less every day in consumer pockets. Working-class Americans, who usually drive older, less fuel-efficient cars and spend a higher percentage of their income on fuel, are disproportionately affected.\u201cThis hurts the pocketbooks of typical Trump voters in swing states who live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. He predicted gas prices would continue to increase modestly, probably rising above $2.80 a gallon in the coming weeks.Deutsche Bank analysts warned this week that the rise in gas prices was beginning to cut into the disposable-income gains from the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law late last year.Much of the recent price increase is a result of world tensions \u2014 some related to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 that have bolstered investor expectations that oil prices could rise even higher.Oil production is plummeting in Venezuela, the country with the largest reserves, and the expectation of stepped-up American sanctions in the coming months could reduce its exports further. The threat that the United States could pull out of the nuclear deal with Iran has put the size of future Iranian exports in doubt.A doubling of American oil production in recent years, producing growing exports and a decline in imports, has helped stabilize the oil market and kept big price rises in check. But United States output represents only a bit more than 10 percent of the 98 million barrels a day produced worldwide, and there are limits to its growth.A shortage of oil and natural-gas pipelines in Texas could slow output over the next two years. In addition, American refineries, generally designed for heavier crudes, are reaching a saturation point for lighter shale oil produced around Texas and North Dakota.Still, there is no doubt that the orchestrated output curbs led by major producers have had an effect. It is not clear whether the agreement will be extended beyond the end of the year, but the Saudis appear to favor doing so.An earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, a recent increase in gasoline prices. They have risen 33 cents in the last year, not the last month.Stanley Reed and Prashant S. Rao contributed reporting from London, and Jim Tankersley from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arizona Teachers Vote in Favor of Statewide Walkout", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe spread of the protests to Arizona from West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky, all Republican-dominated states with weak public sector unions, signaled the depth of frustration from teachers and parents over years of education budget cuts.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that our educators are inspired by what they\u2019ve seen in West Virginia and Oklahoma and Kentucky,\u201d said Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union. \u201cThey see educators rising up and lifting their voices for their students, and doing so in a way that can\u2019t be ignored.\u201dThe vote in Arizona followed weeks of protest across the state and promises from the governor to raise salaries. The Arizona Education Association and Arizona Educators United, a group of teachers who organized independently on Facebook, said that 78 percent of the teachers and school workers who cast ballots supported a walkout.The groups said the walkout would take place on April 26 if legislators and the governor did not meet their demands, not only for a raise for teachers but also one for school support staff. They also called for an end to tax cuts until Arizona\u2019s per-pupil spending reaches the national average.Unlike West Virginia and Oklahoma, Arizona has never before had a statewide teacher walkout, and has experienced only a handful of districtwide strikes over the past four decades.As in the other states where teachers have picketed, many districts in Arizona are facing teacher shortages in subjects like math, science and special education, with principals reporting that staff members are moving to deeper-pocketed states to earn up to $20,000 more per year, or to work in better-funded classrooms.Noah Karvelis, an elementary school music teacher and the founder of Arizona Educators United, said he was sympathetic to the disruption that widespread school closings would cause students and parents. But, he said, that should not forestall a walkout.\u201cIf we maintain the status quo, that is way worse than missing a couple of days of school,\u201d Mr. Karvelis said at a news conference outside the union headquarters in Phoenix. \u201cThe biggest disservice any of us could do for our students right now is to not act in this moment.\u201dBut many teachers rejected that plan, or said they distrusted Mr. Ducey, a first-term Republican.\u201cYou don\u2019t rob Peter to feed Paul,\u201d said Kassandra Dominguez, who teaches kindergarten and first grade in the Pendergast school district, near Phoenix. \u201cThat\u2019s so wrong, and I wouldn\u2019t want that money.\u201dAlternate proposals for raising school budgets include increasing an education sales tax from six-tenths of a cent to one cent, or closing corporate tax loopholes.Ms. Dominguez, 27, earns $38,250 per year, and says that because of low education budgets, she has had to pay out of pocket, or raise money from private donors, to buy her students science supplies, chairs and snacks. She voted in favor of a walkout. Her district had lost a total of $1.6 million over the past five years because of budget cuts, according to administrators, and the school board had come out in favor of the #RedForEd movement.In San Tan Valley, an exurban area an hour southeast of Phoenix, Mary Stavely, an elementary schoolteacher, said she had also voted in favor of a walkout. Ms. Stavely, 34, earns $36,800. Thirteen of 38 teachers at her school, Circle Cross Ranch K-8, are planning to resign at the end of this academic year, she said, because of factors like low pay and a lack of rental housing in the area.\u201cIt directly affects students\u201d when teacher turnover is high, Ms. Stavely said, because children \u201close morale and the connections that were made\u201d with caring adults. Ms. Stavely, a single mother, is currently living with her parents, and said she has considered looking for a higher-paying job. Still, she said she had spent her spring break going door to door to recruit parents to enroll their children at her public school. Arizona has aggressively expanded charter schools and private school vouchers in recent years, leading to enrollment declines \u2014 and potential budget cuts \u2014 for some traditional schools.More than 57,000 educators filled out a ballot in the Arizona walkout vote. There are approximately 90,000 certified teachers in the state, but only 20,000 members of the Arizona Education Association, the union. As in the other red states that have had recent teacher protests, union membership is optional for Arizona educators, and labor organizing is new for many of them.Among those who oppose a walkout is Jim Segar, 64, a colleague of Ms. Stavely\u2019s at Circle Cross Ranch K-8 and a physical education teacher.Mr. Segar said the proposal from Mr. Ducey was the best teachers could realistically hope for. \u201cYou can\u2019t get everything at once after years of neglect,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people would be crazy to walk or strike now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But, he added, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that these things go without litigation.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedTax cuts, bank deregulation and a recovering global economy were expected to unleash a surge of bank lending that could stoke an even stronger expansion. But lending in the first quarter is set to disappoint, at least going by the results of the four big banks that reported Friday.JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial had a combined $2.78 trillion of loans at the end of the first quarter, up 3 percent from $2.7 billion at the end of the same period a year ago. How does that growth rate stack up? It\u2019s more or less in line with the 2.9 percent increase in loans the banks notched up last year, but it is well below the 4.6 percent and the 4.4 percent rates that they together achieved in 2016 and 2015.Each quarter, much attention is paid to the performance of the big banks\u2019 Wall Street operations. But activities like trading are only remotely related to the real economy. As a result, to assess whether banks are assisting the wider economy, it makes more sense to look at trends in their lending, which directly finances consumer spending, home purchases and corporate investments.Investors may have been disappointed at the first-quarter lending numbers. Despite the four banks\u2019 strong profits, their stock prices on Friday slid.The unexceptional first-quarter loan growth may, of course, give way to bigger increases later this year as confidence builds. And beneath the aggregated loan totals are some numbers that suggest things could improve. Citigroup\u2019s loans grew 7.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago period. The increase was driven by a 13 percent surge in corporate lending, much of which took place in Europe and Asia. And the first-quarter total for the four banks was held back by a 1.1 percent decline at Wells Fargo, which is operating under a strict regulatory edict.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal\u201d already, said Steven Ciobo, Australia\u2019s trade minister, who added, \u201cI can\u2019t see that all being thrown open to appease the United States.\u201dShares of the biggest banks are faring worse than the broader stock indexes.The KBW Bank Index, made up of 24 of the largest banks, is off nearly 1 percent while the S.&P. 500 is essentially flat in early trading.JPMorgan was down 1.1 percent, Citigroup was off 1.5 percent, and Wells Fargo fell 2.3 percent.The declines come despite JPMorgan announcing record profits and Citi reporting its highest earnings since 2015.Following widespread missteps at the bank, the Fed in February told Wells Fargo that, until sufficient improvements were made, it could not increase the amount of assets it holds. Some analysts said the cap need not stop the bank from making more loans, because it could sell securities and then use that money to do more lending. But loans did not grow in the first quarter. At the end of March, Wells Fargo had $947 billion of loans, down from $958 billion a year earlier, and also down from $957 billion at the end of 2017.But the decline is not large, and it\u2019s not clear how much the Fed\u2019s cap is to blame. Wells Fargo\u2019s loans had not been growing strongly in recent quarters.And here are Wells Fargo\u2019s numbers:\u2022 Wells Fargo\u2019s profit rose to $5.94 billion.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.12 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.06 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenues fell to $21.9 billion from $22.3 billion in the first-quarter 2017.\u2022 Costs rose 3% to $14.24 billion from $13.79 billion a year ago.\u2014 Peter EavisJPMorgan reported record revenue and profit for the first three months of this year.Here are the numbers:\u2022 The bank reported earnings of $8.71 billion, up 35 percent from a year ago.\u2022 That comes to $2.37 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $28.5 billion, up 10 percent.\u2022 Return on equity, a measure of profitability, hit 15 percent, up from 11 percent a year ago.\u2022 Trading revenues rose to $6.57 billion, up 13 percent from the first quarter of 2017.\u2022 Equities trading revenue rose 26 percent to $2.02 billion.\u2022 Bond-trading revenue rose 8 percent to $4.55 billion.\u2022 Earnings rose to $4.6 billion, up from $4.1 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.68. Analysts expected $1.61 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue increased to $18.9 billion for the quarter, up 3% from a year earlier.\u2022 Revenue from fixed-income trading fell 7 percent to $3.4 billion.\u2022 Equity trading revenue jumped 38% to $1.1 billion.\u2022 Fees from investment banking fell 10 percent to $1.1 billion.One way to gauge the crosswinds blowing through financial markets and the global economy is by examining the results of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which report their first-quarter earnings today.\u2022 Are trade tensions reducing demand for credit?\u2022 How concerned should we be with the volatility in the stock and bond markets?\u2022 Are regular Americans borrowing more, potentially boosting the U.S. economy?\u2022 How much will deregulation help the banks?\u201cI, maybe a bit na\u00efvely, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlas, his company agreed to buy most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion, and that was that.One intriguing possibility: Elliott pushing to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.The deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the French Are Growing Angry With Emmanuel Macron", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe total lack of deference and a barrage of hostile questions in the interview on Sunday evening have reverberated for days in France and come on top of a coolly savage portrayal of Mr. Macron in a new book of memoirs by his predecessor Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.What both Mr. Hollande\u2019s book and the television interview had in common was not only the substance of their attacks \u2014 that Mr. Macron is a self-seeking servant of society\u2019s fortunate \u2014 but also their underlying message: It is open season on the French president.The undisguised hostility has made clear that, less than a year into this new presidency, anti-Macron sentiment is emerging as a potent force. It is being fueled by a pervasive sense that Mr. Macron is pushing too far, too fast in too many areas \u2014 nicking at the benefits of pensioners and low earners, giving dollops to the well-off and slashing sacred worker privileges.The souring of the public mood is reflected in Mr. Macron\u2019s drooping poll numbers among workers and the middle class. (His popularity remains high among those that the French call \u201cexecutives.\u201d) It is also seen in the streets, where a wave of strikes and demonstrations is testing Mr. Macron\u2019s resolve as never before.\u201cIn every area, there is discontent,\u201d admonished one of Mr. Macron\u2019s interviewers on Sunday, Edwy Plenel, a political journalist with the investigative news website Mediapart. The president could barely conceal his anger.\u201cYour question is biased!\u201d Mr. Macron retorted. \u201cThe discontent of the railway workers has nothing to do with the discontent in the hospitals!\u201dThe television interview was less a conversation than a controlled ambush. For more than two hours, Mr. Macron was admonished, lectured at, cut off and shouted over. And he gave nearly as good as he got. Still, never before has a French president been so rudely manhandled.\u201cFrance has passed a threshold with this debate,\u201d the political consultant Philippe Moreau-Chevrolet said on television afterward.\u201cSo, you are searching for cash in the wallets of the retirees! Excuse me, Emmanuel Macron!\u201d the other television interviewer, Jean-Jacques Bourdin, nearly shouted at the president.In the interview, it was plain \u201cEmmanuel Macron\u201d \u2014 as in Citizen Macron in the style of the French Revolution \u2014 from start to finish.\u201cI have got to put the country back to work,\u201d Mr. Macron was left blustering. \u201cThere are too many who work hard, and don\u2019t earn enough from their work.\u201d\u201cYou are not the teacher and we are not the students!\u201d Mr. Plenel said in reprimand to Mr. Macron, using a phrase that has a long pedigree in French political debates.\u201cI\u2019m not aggravated, but I don\u2019t like intellectual dishonesty!\u201d Mr. Macron insisted through gritted teeth.The far-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who makes no secret of his disdain for Mr. Macron, seized upon Sunday\u2019s televised \u201cwrestling match,\u201d as one commentator called it.If he has not quite fallen, at the very least there is a growing sense that Mr. Macron and the French presidency are no longer \u201csacred,\u201d as a headline on Mr. Plenel\u2019s news website Mediapart put it.To be sure, Mr. Macron, once he had rebalanced himself, periodically launched his habitual command performance, speaking fluently and without notes on Syria, labor, taxes and other subjects for more than two hours.Yet the image remaining is that of an aggravated French president, his voice fairly choking, having to remind his interlocutors, \u201cYou are the interviewers, and I am the president of the Republic!\u201d\u201cI am not about sanctifying the function of the presidency,\u201d Mr. Plenel said on television afterward.\u201cThere is a monarchical culture in France,\u201d Mr. Plenel, who was once editor in chief of Le Monde, said in an interview on Tuesday, explaining his strategy Sunday. \u201cIt was necessary to break the code of this monarchical culture.\u201dLikewise, in his book \u201cThe Lessons of Power,\u201d Mr. Hollande draws a portrait in acid of his ambitious successor. While Mr. Hollande was considered by many the \u201cnormal\u201d chief executive, Mr. Macron set out to be his opposite.This was not the stuff of Olympian maneuvering but rather of base human machinations, in Mr. Hollande\u2019s view.Did the young Minister of the Economy who had been Mr. Hollande\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 stab the older man in the back, then leap over his carcass to gain the presidency? Did he betray the seasoned politician to whom he owed so much? Those central questions have been a subtext in French politics since Mr. Macron was elected a year ago. Mr. Hollande all but answers yes.\u201cAlways, that style of denying the plain evidence with a smile,\u201d Mr. Hollande comments with barely disguised bitterness after Mr. Macron has denied he will be a candidate. That denial followed the triumphalist kickoff rally in July 2016 at which his supporters shouted \u201cMacron, President!\u201d almost for the first time.\u201cIn front of me, Emmanuel Macron protested his good faith, and his faithfulness,\u201d Mr. Hollande writes, describing a moment when he was forced to upbraid his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for having displayed his ambition. \u201cWas he sincere when he thought that his adventure was limited in time, and that it would eventually end, to serve, finally, my own candidacy?\u201dThe ex-president doesn\u2019t answer the question, but he hardly needs to.\u201cDid he feel guilty about something?\u201d Mr. Hollande asks about the moment he handed over power to Mr. Macron a year ago at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. \u201cAs though the order of things, and of human relations, had been unduly reversed.\u201dAnd Mr. Hollande wickedly sums up both the limits and potential of Mr. Macron\u2019s outlook, gleaned when the younger man was his counselor at the presidency.\u201cHe is certain that reality graciously bends to his will as soon as he expresses it.\u201dThe ex-president adopts the critique of Mr. Macron\u2019s detractors on the left when he writes in his book that \u201cmy government reduced inequality, while this one is deepening it.\u201dIf the numbers show Mr. Hollande giving himself too easy a pass on his own record in that regard, the jury is still out on Mr. Macron\u2019s.Certainly he appeared to do himself few favors on Sunday when he repeatedly refused to condemn the well-established practice by the very wealthy in France of seeking tax havens.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem with fiscal optimization,\u201d Mr. Macron conceded.That provoked the outrage of Mr. Bourdin: \u201cTax evasion!\u201d he shouted at the president, using a term more recognizable to the average citizen. Mr. Macron refused to give ground.\u201cAnd what about your friend Arnault?\u201d \u2014 the question referred to the C.E.O. of LVMH, France\u2019s wealthiest man, Bernard Arnault.\u201cI don\u2019t have friends,\u201d Mr. Macron said coldly.Elian Peltier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018We No Longer Need\u2019 Nuclear or Missile Tests, North Korean Leader Says", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, announced early Saturday that his country no longer needed to test nuclear weapons or long-range missiles and would close a nuclear test site.\u201cThe nuclear test site has done its job,\u201d Mr. Kim said in a statement carried by North Korea\u2019s state media.Mr. Kim\u2019s announcement came just days before a scheduled summit meeting with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea; Mr. Kim is also planning to meet with President Trump soon. It was the second time in two days that he made what appeared to be a significant concession to the United States but in reality cemented the status quo. North Korea already had stopped testing its weapons.Mr. Kim made no mention in his latest remarks of dismantling the nuclear weapons and long-range missiles North Korea has already built. On the contrary, he suggested he was going to keep them.Mr. Moon\u2019s office also praised the announcement. \u201cWe view the North\u2019s decision as a significant step toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the world has wished for,\u201d said Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for Mr. Moon.Despite the enthusiasm, American officials have watched Mr. Kim with a mix of satisfaction and wariness.The North Korean leader\u2019s move could be tactical \u2014 putting the United States on the defensive in advance of talks on its nuclear arsenal. By extending an olive branch, American officials said, North Korea is putting pressure on the United States to accept a deal before Mr. Kim agrees to give up North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons.Mr. Kim could also be trying to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea, since President Moon has put great emphasis on ending more than six decades of conflict on the Korean Peninsula.On Thursday, Mr. Moon said Mr. Kim had made a similar gesture, saying the North no longer insisted on the withdrawal of American troops from the Korean Peninsula. But White House officials privately dismissed the remarks, saying removal of the troops was never on the table.Caution toward Mr. Kim\u2019s peace overtures also punctuated the reaction of officials from Japan, which North Korea has long threatened with missile strikes. The defense minister, Itsunori Onodera, who was visiting Washington when Mr. Kim announced the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, said the move was \u201cnot sufficient\u201d because it did not clearly state whether the suspension included the short and midrange missiles that could hit Japan.Mr. Onodera also emphasized that a suspension was far short of denuclearization. \u201cWhat the international community expects is that North Korea abandon all weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles in a complete verifiable and irreversible manner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a time to relax pressure by the international community, but we must keep applying pressure with an aim that they abandon their nuclear weapons and missiles.\u201dIn a statement after a meeting of the Central Committee of his ruling Workers\u2019 Party, Mr. Kim said his country required no further nuclear and long-range missile tests because it had already achieved a nuclear deterrent. It was now time to focus on rebuilding the economy, he said.\u201cFrom April 21, North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles,\u201d the Korean Central News Agency said, quoting Mr. Kim.It also said the North would \u201cshut down a nuclear test site in the country\u2019s northern side to guarantee transparency in suspending nuclear tests.\u201dTo officials and analysts in South Korea, Mr. Kim\u2019s decision to shut down his country\u2019s only known nuclear test site, in Punggye-ri in northeastern North Korea, and his moratorium on long-range missile tests, are some of the \u201ctrust-building steps\u201d that they have hoped Mr. Kim would take to help improve the mood for dialogue in Washington.Mr. Kim spent last year conducting a series of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, raising tensions and a risk of war with the United States. But he has initiated a dramatic about-face since January with a sequence of diplomatic maneuvers, including a summit meeting with President Xi Jinping of China in Beijing last month in his first trip abroad as leader, and his invitations to Mr. Moon and Mr. Trump for summit talks.Analysts in the region are deeply divided over Mr. Kim\u2019s motives. Some argue that Mr. Kim just wanted to use negotiations to buy time and ease international sanctions, never intending to abandon his nuclear weapons. But others say that Mr. Kim would eventually give up his nuclear arsenal if he were provided with the right incentives, such as security guarantees, like a peace treaty and normalized ties with Washington, and the economic aid he needs to rebuild his economy.His latest announcement came one day after North and South Korea installed what officials said was the first-ever hotline between their top leaders, another sign of improving relations on the divided Korean Peninsula.But the two countries have never run a direct hotline linking their top leaders\u2019 offices, officials said.The hotline telephones were installed on Mr. Moon\u2019s desk in Seoul, the South\u2019s capital, and in the State Affairs Commission in Pyongyang, the North\u2019s capital.South Korean officials hope the hotline will improve communications between the top leaders and pave the way for improved ties between the two Koreas. The hotline could also be used to avert unintended armed clashes between the sides, they said.\u201cNow, if working-level talks are deadlocked and if our officials act like arrogant blockheads, President Moon can just call me directly and the problem will be promptly solved,\u201d Mr. Kim was quoted as telling the visiting South Korean envoys last month.On Friday, aides to Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim officially opened the line and checked the connection for about four minutes, said Youn Kun-young, director for the government situation room at Mr. Moon\u2019s presidential Blue House.During the line check, a South Korean and a North Korean caller briefly discussed the weather, according to Mr. Moon\u2019s office.\u201cThe connection was very good,\u201d Mr. Youn said. \u201cIt was as if talking to a neighbor right next door.\u201dMark Landler contributed reporting from Washington, Motoko Rich from Tokyo and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ra\u00fal Castro Prepares to Resign as Cuba\u2019s President, Closing a Dynasty", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAVANA \u2014 Ra\u00fal Castro, who took over from his brother Fidel 12 years ago and led Cuba through some of its biggest changes in decades, is expected to step down on Thursday and hand power to someone outside the Castro dynasty for the first time since the Cuban revolution more than half a century ago.Officials started gathering here in Havana on Wednesday morning and put forward Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel as the sole candidate to replace Mr. Castro, all but assuring his selection by the Communist Party.Though Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s path to the top office has been forecast for years, many an heir apparent before him has fallen by the wayside in the search for a successor to lead the country, whether because of party disloyalty, snide remarks or projecting too much power for the Castros\u2019 liking.In that delicate balancing act, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel, a former provincial leader who became the most important of Cuba\u2019s vice presidents, has shown the sort of restraint prized by the Castros. But that same caution has left him an enigma both inside and outside the country.Few American officials \u2014 even those in the United States Embassy in Havana \u2014 have spent time with him or can claim to have shared more than a few passing words. Even the most seasoned Cuba experts have only faint clues as to what he will do, how he will lead and how much latitude he will have to chart his own course.Cuba\u2019s next president could be hemmed in from multiple sides. For one, Ra\u00fal Castro is expected to remain the head of the Communist Party and wield great influence. Even Fidel, who ruled Cuba since the revolution, did not officially become president until years later, allowing others to occupy the post while he ran the country.Beyond that, the diplomatic opening with the United States has closed abruptly under President Trump, limiting Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s ability to maneuver economically.\u201cThere is nothing in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to suggest he is going to take risks,\u201d Theodore Piccone, a Cuba scholar at the Brookings Institution, said of Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel. \u201cBut that is the way the system works \u2014 anyone willing to take the risk before now would not be in line to be the president.\u201dMr. Castro is leaving office at a time of tremendous change on the island, both real and promised.But change is often a managed affair in Cuba, orchestrated to maintain order while leaving little to chance or, especially, political uncertainty. While historic, the economic changes in Cuba have been halting, to the frustration of many Cubans hoping for better pay and more opportunity. So, too, has foreign investment, with leaders leery that it could grow to the point that they can no longer control it.How the sudden slide in relations with the United States will affect Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s ability to sustain the economy and stave off domestic pressure remains unclear.Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel, though a prominent advocate of bringing internet service to the island and considered a relatively modern thinker within the context of Cuba, is not expected to deviate from the party line or the prescribed, deliberate path toward economic reform outlined by his predecessor.In all likelihood, he will govern with less flexibility than Mr. Castro, who enjoyed a special status on the island because of his family name and revolutionary credentials. And Mr. Castro is not vanishing from the scene. As president of the Communist Party, he will preside over an important bastion of power.\u201cD\u00edaz-Canel is one of those people who has risen through the ranks because he represents the prevailing view within the party, not because he himself has taken any particular initiative,\u201d said Benjamin Rhodes, who was a top aide to Mr. Obama and one of the main brokers of renewed relations with Cuba. \u201cI think he is going to be significantly more constrained than either Fidel or Ra\u00fal.\u201dStill, as the public face of this long-awaited transition, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel has been thrust between the crosscurrents of change and tradition. It will certainly not be an easy task: preserving the achievements of the revolution \u2014 socialized medicine and education, among them \u2014 amid economic turbulence that threatens the nation\u2019s future.Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel\u2019s leadership will be defined in some respects by how he manages the competing forces within the country and his own government. Today, the streets of Cuba brim with young people anxious for a new dynamic, one in which the future is valued more than the past and individual prosperity is not considered a threat to historic ideals.But the ranks of government remain filled by an older, powerful generation of leaders clinging to the past, a group venerated for its connection to the revolution. Their resistance made reform difficult for even Ra\u00fal Castro to push through.Without the same legacy to rely on, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel will be forced into a minefield of tasks that even his predecessor failed to complete. Chief among them are economic reforms central to the nation\u2019s survival.He will have to foster the growing private sector, the future engine of the economy and the fulcrum on which employment will hinge, while guarding against the income inequality it often brings.After years of visible growth, with restaurants and bars popping up across Havana and elsewhere, the government decided last year to stop issuing licenses for private businesses, fearful that the pace was getting out of control.Some establishments were practically minting money, with hourslong waits for meals that cost as much as a night out in New York. In a nation where government salaries hover around $30 a month, this raised concerns not only about inequality, but also the potential for a class of businesspeople with the resources to be politically powerful.Foreign investment to update Cuba\u2019s crumbling infrastructure is another priority. Business zones launched with much fanfare by the government carry few prospects. The government\u2019s conditions for foreign investment remain unattractive, experts say.Even the very basics \u2014 food and energy \u2014 need attention. Cuba imports the majority of its agricultural products, as well as its oil. Inefficiencies and failing infrastructure have left a poor farming legacy that keeps food off the tables of many regular Cubans.Perhaps most immediately, Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel will have to unify two separate currencies in widespread use on the island, a gambit that will produce big winners and losers in a country that prides itself on equality.\u201cIt\u2019s a high-wire act,\u201d said Julia Sweig, a Cuba expert at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThe expectation dynamic among the Cubans is that they still want a functioning state that delivers services. And yet they also want the state to get out of the way.\u201dTo say that Cuba has remained in stasis would be unfair. Beginning with a slate of economic reforms pushed forward by Ra\u00fal Castro, all the way through to the decision to restore diplomatic relations with the United States, the nation has been opening.Many have criticized the pace at which economic reforms are rolled out, but the delay is due in part to the magnitude of the experiment the nation is conducting: an effort to define its own brand of socialism in a modern world.The Cubans have sought counsel from the Chinese and, most recently, the Vietnamese, whose leadership was in Havana last month for high-level talks. But the Cuban government is also deeply worried about liberalizing too quickly and converting its fragile gains into a sideshow for tourists plowing into the next big Caribbean destination.Move too slowly and it risks economic collapse and widespread discontent, especially from a young population that has known only hard times. Move too fast, and it risks unstitching the unique tapestry of Cuba\u2019s social project.To drive home this point, Ra\u00fal Castro for years has shown young officials a documentary about the oligarch class in Russia after the demise of the Soviet Union. In Cuba, the screenings offer a cautionary tale of how a nation and its values can unravel if economic transition is not managed carefully.\u201cRa\u00fal Castro is a conservative if the regime\u2019s future and the future of the achievements of the revolution are in danger,\u201d said Hal Klepak, a military analyst and biographer of Ra\u00fal Castro. \u201cHe\u2019s a reformist in every other occasion.\u201dThat is the sort of continuity that many are expecting from Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel \u2014 especially with Ra\u00fal Castro still in the picture as party president.\u201cI think he is very smart, very cautious, as I think he better be for a while, until he delivers some goods,\u201d Mr. Klepak added about Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel. \u201cI view him as a reformist with Ra\u00falista credentials: He\u2019s reformist while reform reinforces the achievements of the revolution.\u201d\u201cThe moment that reformism threatens the achievements of the revolution, he flips,\u201d he added.Ed Augustin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It Was Like to Finally Write My Will", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll that money, and one of the greatest performers I ever saw onstage didn\u2019t spend a little of it on sorting out his estate? It amazes me.Death is inevitable, but we continue to make long-term bets: My wife, Jeanne, and I might have enough economy-size jugs of Tide and gigantic packages of toilet paper rolls, bought on regular trips to Costco, to survive into the next century.Still, preparing for an eventual demise \u2014 at least by drawing up a will \u2014 is a good idea. A will smooths the way for your heirs to inherit whatever you\u2019re going to give them, saving time and money. Wills can also help you avoid tax pitfalls and feuding heirs. (Remember: The conflict at the heart of Dickens\u2019s \u201cBleak House\u201d is a generations-long lawsuit over an inheritance. No spoilers, but the case did not end well for anyone involved, over several generations, except the lawyers.)Wills provide control over more than money. For people whose children are still minors, the will names guardians. If you haven\u2019t written these decisions down, the government will make money and custodial decisions itself. You\u2019ll be beyond caring by then, but why not do what you can ahead of time to see that the assets get distributed as you\u2019d like?Despite all these very good reasons, I didn\u2019t have a will until just a year and a half ago, when I dedicated myself to taking care of all of the financial matters I\u2019d let slip for, well, decades. We don\u2019t have a Warren Buffett\u2014sized fortune to bestow on the kids, but a house and 401(k) accounts add up to something. Still, we had put it off, like everything else that involved thinking about money and death.So! Let\u2019s talk about writing a will.If your financial life is more complicated \u2014 owning a business, say, or having a child who might need a trust \u2014 hiring a lawyer is the way to go. A lawyer can help explain the benefits of having things like a \u201cdynasty trust,\u201d which sounds like it would only be for rich people but which can help protect an inheritance from being lost in a divorce.Jeanne and I decided to hire an attorney, and after consulting with friends and my chief legal adviser (i.e., Google), we eventually landed on a guy in town called Nathan Arnell. A friend had told me in an email, \u201cI have zero standard of comparison and have no idea if his fee was high, low or average, but he\u2019s a nice guy and seemed fine.\u201dI\u2019m not big on extreme vetting. He\u2019s the one I called.\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d he asked.I told him we needed a will. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what I do.\u201dWe got an appointment and Mr. Arnell said he would provide the will and our advance directives (our medical wishes if we\u2019re incapacitated) as part of a package. The process, he said, could cost as much as $3,000 if we had a lot of changes or complications, but would be much less if things were straightforward. He could make the document flexible enough to serve for some time but easy to change if need be \u2014 which would increase costs.\u201cYou can make a new one every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cGood for me, not so good for you.\u201dFor most people, that\u2019s overkill; experts say it\u2019s good to revisit the will every five years to adapt it to changing circumstances, but most people shouldn\u2019t have to change it more often than that.We talked for a bit about the tax implications of our deaths \u2014 that the federal estate tax affects only people with millions of dollars\u2019 worth of assets. We\u2019d have to have combined assets worth millions of dollars to be affected, he said. (Currently, it\u2019s about $22 million for couples.) This affects less than 0.2 percent of people in the United States.Mr. Arnell also laid out the scenarios that cause wills to become complex and fractious, like multiple marriages, blended families with stepchildren from those various marriages, families in conflict, and more.\u201cWe\u2019ve only been married to each other,\u201d Jeanne told him. \u201cAll of our children are our children. And we all get along.\u201dYou could see his shoulders relax. He then asked what our assets might be: house, 401(k), life insurance. He would include clauses giving the surviving spouse lots of flexibility in planning how to get the money and to do tax planning around the inheritance. We told him about setting up a trust for our younger son, who deals with depression. It would be administered by his big sister.\u201cThat\u2019s why I was asking whether they get along,\u201d he said and discussed setting up a system that would allow our son to get 5 percent of his share every year. He told us to make sure to talk to our daughter to ensure she was willing to take on the responsibility. (She was.)For many people, especially dual-income couples with no kids who might have substantial assets to spread around, this is the moment to discuss charitable bequests. Whether it\u2019s gifts to charities, hospitals, political parties, religious organizations, your alma mater or other organizations, the choices you make with a portion of your assets now can make a difference in the world when the time comes.We then moved on to the advance directive and power of attorney, which is the ability of a person designated by us to make decisions for us if we become incapacitated. Our attorney advised us to think hard about giving medical power of attorney to one of the kids. (We also got a living will.)\u201cIf you don\u2019t think she could pull the plug, then she\u2019s not the right person,\u201d he said.He then gave us homework: tracking down our pensions, insurance policies, retirement accounts and anything else that will pass to heirs when we die. We would need to make sure that the beneficiaries named in all those documents lined up with what we were putting into the will. In most cases, the contract terms of the beneficiary statements will control what happens.We left. Jeanne and I walked over to a nearby Starbucks for a break.\u201cThat was really depressing,\u201d she said.\u201cContemplating mortality?\u201d I asked.She looked at me. \u201cDeath! Death! Death!\u201dA few weeks later, Mr. Arnell sent a stack of digital documents: a will for me and for Jeanne; a durable power of attorney for each of us; and a living will/health care directives. The wills were 41 pages apiece; the other documents came to a dozen pages more for each of us. Dry stuff, though he included a readable summary.We went back to his office, briefly discussed the provisions of the wills and signed them. A short time after that, we got the final bill: a little less than $2,000. We left a copy of the documents at his office, so it would be easy to find in case we both died suddenly. The point is to keep the paperwork somewhere the family will be able to find it, such as a safe deposit box or a good fireproof safe, or with a trusted relative \u2014 and make sure that people know where to find it.Now we have wills. One more worry is gone, or maybe it was a source of guilt. Or maybe it was just a nagging thought. I won\u2019t be happy to die, but I won\u2019t be tormented over leaving that particular loose end undone.There\u2019s something to be said for that.An earlier version of this article misstated the asset value of the federal estate tax exemption for couples. It is about $22 million, not $11 million. (Under the new tax law, it doubled.) The article also misstated what percentage of Americans are subject to the federal estate tax. It is less than 0.2 percent, not 4 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $76,000 Monthly Pension: Why States and Cities Are Short on Cash", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "Governments are struggling as mounting pension obligations crowd out the rest of their budgets. Oregon faces a severe, self-inflicted crisis.Supported byA public university president in Oregon gives new meaning to the idea of a pensioner.Joseph Robertson, an eye surgeon who retired as head of the Oregon Health & Science University last fall, receives the state\u2019s largest government pension.It is $76,111.Per month.That is considerably more than the average Oregon family earns in a year.Oregon \u2014 like many other states and cities, including New Jersey, Kentucky and Connecticut \u2014 is caught in a fiscal squeeze of its own making. Its economy is growing, but the cost of its state-run pension system is growing faster. More government workers are retiring, including more than 2,000, like Dr. Robertson, who get pensions exceeding $100,000 a year.The state is not the most profligate pension payer in America, but its spiraling costs are notable in part because Oregon enjoys a reputation for fiscal discipline. Its experience shows how faulty financial decisions by states can eventually swamp local communities.Oregon\u2019s costs are inflated by the way in which it calculates pension benefits for public employees. Some of the pensions include income that employees earned on the side. Other retirees benefit from long-ago stock market rallies that inflated the current value of their payouts.For example, the pension for Mike Bellotti, the University of Oregon\u2019s head football coach from 1995 to 2008, includes not just his salary but also money from licensing deals and endorsements that the Ducks\u2019 athletic program generated. Mr. Bellotti\u2019s pension is more than $46,000 a month.The bill is borne by taxpayers. Oregon\u2019s Public Employees Retirement System has told cities, counties, school districts and other local entities to contribute more to keep the system afloat. They can neither negotiate nor raise local taxes fast enough to keep up. As a result, pensions are crowding out other spending. Essential services are slashed.\u201cYou get to the point where you can no longer do more with less \u2014 you just have to do less with less,\u201d said Nathan Cherpeski, the manager of Klamath Falls, a city of about 21,000 in south-central Oregon.Klamath Falls\u2019s most recent biennial bill from the pension system, known as PERS, was $600,000 more than the one before. PERS has warned that the bills will keep rising. Mr. Cherpeski has had to cut back on repairing streets and bridges.Even as the American economy is humming, many states and cities are still hurting from the 2008 financial meltdown. The crash hammered their pension funds and tax revenues, but didn\u2019t reduce the amounts they owe retirees.It wasn\u2019t until 2016 that average state tax collections returned to pre-2008 levels. In the meantime, states and cities have had to rebuild pension funds to cover the rising numbers of retirees drawing benefits. That has left less money for the police, school sports programs and everything else. Local residents might not know why, but they are paying more taxes and getting scantier services in return.Costs are rising even in places that previously acted to defuse the problem. Colorado trimmed pensions in 2010, but a new $32 billion shortfall means more pension cuts and tax increases are likely. Detroit sliced its pension obligations in bankruptcy and persuaded philanthropists to chip in, but it is not clear that the city has an affordable plan.In San Francisco, the school board wants voters to approve a $298 \u201cparcel tax\u201d on real estate, ostensibly to raise $50 million to pay teachers a living wage.\u201cThat\u2019s a worthy objective, but it\u2019s not the real reason,\u201d said David Crane, a former trustee of the California teachers\u2019 pension system. He said the school district\u2019s retirement costs had grown by $50 million over the last five years, devouring resources that would have gone to teachers.Oregon is a blue state, but in its restive red hinterlands, tax increases are politically off limits and financial distress has been severe since 1994, when logging was curtailed to save an endangered owl. Lately, things have been getting even worse.When a man was reported yelling and firing his gun on the property of a school in rural Josephine County, it took two hours for a sheriff\u2019s deputy to arrive, said Kate Dwyer, chairwoman of the board for the Three Rivers School District.The county has cut sheriff patrols, closed its mental health department and kept its jail at less than half capacity because of a lack of guards.Dave Valenzuela, the Three Rivers school superintendent, traces the latest woes directly to PERS. The system is run at the state level, but it is bankrolled in large part by obligatory contributions from local governments.This year, Three Rivers was poised to receive its first increase in state education funding in years, a reflection of growing enrollment. But Oregon raised by more than 50 percent the amount that Three Rivers had to contribute to PERS. So Mr. Valenzuela had to lop five days off the school year, ask each school to cut its budget by 10 percent and lay off the district librarian and English specialist.That includes the state, by far the system\u2019s biggest contributor.Even prosperous communities are being pinched. The Beaverton School District, outside Portland, had to get rid of 75 teachers last year when its mandatory pension contribution rose by $14 million. That was after shedding 340 teachers in 2012.\u201cI have town hall meetings, and the parents are just confounded by this,\u201d said Mark Hass, a Democratic state senator from Beaverton.Oregon\u2019s unusual method for calculating pensions tends to generate lavish payouts.For decades, PERS calculated pensions two different ways, and retirees could choose whichever produced the bigger numbers.The first way was similar to what most states do, basing pensions on each worker\u2019s final salary and years of service. But Oregon\u2019s lawmakers included a golden touch, redefining \u201csalary\u201d to include remuneration from any source.That was how Mr. Bellotti, the former football coach, came to be the state\u2019s third-highest-paid pensioner, at roughly $559,000 a year.Mr. Bellotti said he never asked for a supersize pension. In 1995, he said, the university started to include a percentage of all endorsement and licensing fees in coaches\u2019 salaries.\u201cIt was basically to augment the university\u2019s ability to pay a competitive salary to its coaching staff,\u201d he said.When Mr. Bellotti retired, he was partway through a five-year, $1.9 million-a-year contract, which he said was still below the league average of about $3 million.PERS made up for it with a big pension. \u201cIt was pay later as opposed to paying now,\u201d he said.Dr. Robertson, the former Oregon Health & Science University president, said he had retired and started drawing his pension last fall, after learning he had multiple sclerosis. He said he agreed to stay on through the end of the academic year, without pay, \u201cfor the sake of continuity.\u201dA spokeswoman for the medical center said Dr. Robertson\u2019s pension was based on his salary, incentive payments, clinical pay and unused sick or vacation time.Oregon\u2019s second way of calculating pensions dates back to 1946: For decades, every public worker got a simulated tracking account. It was credited with 6 percent of each paycheck, then left to compound at a predetermined rate.In the early years, a low rate was used because the pension system invested in bonds that didn\u2019t yield much.But in the 1970s, lawmakers started nudging the rate up, eventually to 8 percent. Then, the system\u2019s trustees decided 8 percent should be a guaranteed minimum. In years when markets produced higher returns, the accounts compounded at those rates, after money-management fees. During the 1990s bull market, accounts compounded by up to 21 percent a year.When workers retired, their employers were required to \u201cmatch\u201d the account balances, doubling them. Then PERS would base the pensions on the total.Randall Pozdena, an economist who supervised the pension system\u2019s investments in the 1990s, gave speeches warning that the situation was unsustainable.\u201cThe only way you\u2019re going to get out of this is if the state is hit by a golden asteroid from Planet Tiffany,\u201d he recalled saying.But efforts to change the system, including a 1994 ballot initiative, were blocked by the State Supreme Court, which ruled that accruals could not be reduced during any public worker\u2019s career.So, when lawmakers required government retirees to pay Oregon\u2019s 9 percent income tax, as everybody else did, they also increased pensions by 9.89 percent, giving retirees extra money to pay the tax with.\u201cIt\u2019s an affront to everybody who pays taxes,\u201d said Bruce Dennis, a retired carpenter from outside Portland who earned a $54,000-a-year pension by swinging a hammer for 45 years. No one gives him extra money to cover his taxes.\u201cAt every step of the way, they\u2019ve made decisions that went against the interests of the public,\u201d he said.Starting in 2003, the tracking accounts were phased out. But workers who already had the accounts were allowed to keep them. New hires got a more modest retirement plan.\u201cThe cost of this pension system is not caused by the people we are hiring today,\u201d said Steven Rodeman, executive director of the Public Employees Retirement System. \u201cThis is a legacy problem from the 1980s and 1990s.\u201dFor workers with the tracking accounts, PERS dialed back the annual returns to 8 percent, then to 7.5 percent in 2016. That is still more than what PERS\u2019s investments have generated over the last decade. And so the pension fund\u2019s financial hole continues to deepen.Across Oregon, local officials have been told to brace for 15 to 20 more years of rising pension bills. That\u2019s when the current generation of retirees will start dying out.\u201cAll we can do is wait,\u201d said Jay Meredith, finance director of Grants Pass, the seat of Josephine County.In the meantime, mounting pension costs mean that a generation of schoolchildren is growing up in the area with no theater program, no orchestra, no wood shop and minimal sports, chorus and art.That\u2019s if they can get to school.A county road recently washed out, stranding 300 people. Ms. Dwyer, of the Three Rivers School District, reported the problem to a public-works official.She recalled his response: \u201cI have trucks, but I can\u2019t put gas in them to come to you and dig it out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Airline Credit Cards Have an Enduring Appeal", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyIt\u2019s been more than 30 years since the first credit card offering frequent-flier miles made its debut, so you\u2019d think that the market for plastic passports bearing the promise of free trips would be mature by now.But consider the numbers that Delta Air Lines has been throwing around recently in investor presentations. It generated $3 billion from its relationship with American Express in 2017 and expects to hit $4 billion by 2021. Even as competition intensifies for big-spending cardholders with rewards lust in their hearts, spending on the Delta Amex cards rose at a compound annual growth rate of 12 percent from 2013 through 2017.This surprised me. Then I looked in my wallet. After years of fealty to my trusty Starwood Preferred Guest credit card, I, too, gave in last year and picked up cards from American Airlines and Delta.This week, Citi, clearly feeling the competitive heat, announced plans to add goodies to one of its American Airlines cards, including double miles on all restaurant and gas station purchases. While Citi did not offer up hard numbers like Delta and Amex, the company did tell me that the growth of its American Airlines card portfolio was outpacing the predictions of overall economic metrics.A few years ago, Barclays made an aggressive bid for the JetBlue credit card business and won it. The bank now reports that it has doubled the overall size of the business in two years.So what accounts for the continued appeal of the airline credit card, and who ought to have one?Some things that have always been true about these cards remain so: If you travel a lot on the same airline and spend a lot of money in your everyday life, earning the same reward currency when you travel and when you\u2019re using your card can help you quickly earn more and better free trips.But things have also changed. In addition to the miles, many of the mileage cards now come with privileges. You might get a free checked bag. Or you can board your flight in the fifth group instead of the seventh, thereby getting space for your carry-on in the overhead bin.This is clever and ought to inspire some healthy cynicism. After all, the airlines created the problem that the cards are now solving by charging for checked baggage. Now, for an annual fee of $95 or $150 or $450, you can avoid multiple $25 or $35 nicks for checking bags. And even if you can\u2019t be sure what a free flight will cost in miles, at least the baggage giveaway is something tangible.The card offerings are now complicated enough that it\u2019s nearly impossible to offer generic advice about who ought to have one. For me, the sign-up bonuses for the Delta and American cards plus the baggage fee waivers on Delta were enough to persuade me. The top-tier American card also comes with airline lounge access, which I finally treated myself to (and deducted on my taxes) after too many years of hacking together standing desks at abandoned airport gates so I could work comfortably on my laptop.One bit of math should be obvious: If you\u2019re carrying a balance and paying 18 percent annual interest, the rewards don\u2019t come close to making that up. According to American Express, 21 percent of its outstanding credit card loans belonged to people with a Delta credit card as of the end of 2017.But some consumers simply do not care about the math \u2014 or perhaps are hypnotized by years of gauzy marketing and the daydreaming it inspires. \u201cWhile you may be right that the value per mile has decreased, that\u2019s a function of a lot of things,\u201d said Denny Nealon, who runs Barclays\u2019 United States partnerships business. \u201cAirline miles are an incredibly aspirational and valuable currency.\u201dAnd those aspirations cement the emotional hook of credit-card airline miles: They offer the distinct possibility that you could use everyday spending to get yourself as far as possible from your everyday life.\u201cWhat we are in the business of doing is travel,\u201d said Bridget Blaise-Shamai, vice president for loyalty and customer insights at American Airlines. \u201cWe could have this conversation 100 years from now, and it would remain relevant.\u201dTwitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yacht Race Helps St. Barts Heal From Irma", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUSTAVIA, St. Barts \u2014 Francois Tolede, the director of the Les Voiles de Saint Barth regatta, was standing outside his house and drawing an arc in the air with his index finger.He was showing the flight path of his neighbor\u2019s roof during Hurricane Irma: a roof that, like so many on this small and upscale Caribbean island, was ripped free of its moorings by the force of the storm in September. The roof sailed across a street and landed directly on Tolede\u2019s home, which, with its concrete construction, fared better than most.\u201cI often say that Irma was like an atomic bomb without the radiation,\u201d Tolede said. \u201cIt really devastated us and of course the first thing you are thinking about after something like this has nothing to do with organizing your sailing regatta.\u201dBut Les Voiles will take place here as scheduled this week, just as the other significant regattas in the leeward islands of the Caribbean have managed to maintain their slots on the calendar in the aftermath of one of the most destructive hurricane seasons on record.\u201cThere was a small regatta in St. Croix in November that was canceled, because it was just too soon and nobody was ready,\u201d said Paul Miller, race director of the St. Maarten Regatta. \u201cBut all the internationals have gone ahead, and they needed to go ahead. And I say this not just as a regatta organizer. They are essential for the economy of the islands, a big tourism driver and also a symbolic gesture. In our case, it\u2019s part of the national identity to have this festival.\u201dThe 38th edition of the St. Maarten Regatta was staged in early March on the Dutch side of the island of Saint Martin with a smaller than customary fleet of 100 yachts. The northern side of the island is French and was hit particularly hard by Irma with four deaths and extensive damage to infrastructure, including its main airport, which also has had a major impact on travel to St. Barts, which lies about 20 miles to the southeast and has an airport that can only handle small planes.\u201cFor me, St. Martin is going to need a good 10 years to reconstruct everything,\u201d said Raymond Laplace, the owner of one of the few beach hotels open after the storm in St. Barts. \u201cFor St. Barts to be like it was, I think we need about two years.\u201dThat is a reflection of population density: with about 80,000 residents on the entire island, St. Martin is about eight times more populous than St. Barts. It is also a reflection of economic means and of disparities in construction quality.\u201cThere haven\u2019t been strong building codes applied on St. Martin for many years, and there were certainly areas on the North Side where damage was extensive,\u201d Miller said.The cleanup also has been slower than on St. Barts, where the local government and its many affluent private property owners had the wherewithal to respond with alacrity, even before insurance payouts.In many sections of the island, you need to look carefully to spot storm damage but the closer you get to some of the main beaches, it sadly gets easier. Many of the larger seafront hotels were hit hard by the storm surge and the high winds and have yet to reopen, although villa rental agencies and some smaller hotels are operating.\u201cPeople coming for Les Voiles are having to be clever to find housing,\u201d Tolede said. \u201cWe have the advantage that some nearby islands, like Antigua, were not that impacted by the hurricane, so people are going to be able to rent catamarans or boats to be able to house themselves. But above all, what we\u2019ve seen is a desire to come to Les Voiles to show solidarity after Irma.\u201dTolede and the race director Luc Poupon, the two longtime friends who created Les Voiles in 2010, expect about 55 yachts to take part instead of the customary 70. One of the newcomers is David Welch, an American optical engineer, who will be competing in his recently purchased HH66, a high-performance catamaran of all-carbon construction.\u201cMy ambitions are threefold,\u201d Welch said two weeks ago in a telephone interview from California. \u201cFirst, I want to enjoy myself. Second, I want to make sure the boat works the way we want it to work, and third is to do what we can to support the community. Those islands do a tremendous amount for the sailing world in general, so if there\u2019s a way to drive some business their way that\u2019s important.\u201dLloyd Thornburg, an American investor and veteran racer, was once called a \u201cthrillionaire\u201d by the Irish Independent because of his expensive taste for chasing offshore speed records. But Thornburg has owned a house on St. Barts for 10 years and is a regular participant in Les Voiles, which is lower-adrenaline fare than many of his salt-sprayed adventures.\u201cThe main appeal is it\u2019s a home regatta for me, but it\u2019s also one of the best because it\u2019s just so beautiful,\u201d he said over coffee at Le Bar de L\u2019Oubli in St. Barts last week. \u201cWhat makes it frustrating or interesting is that unlike traditional sort of buoy races or offshore races, they use a lot of these outlying rocks and islands as marks, and when you are coming around the island, there are a lot of wind shifts coming off of the rocks so local knowledge really helps.\u201dAt not quite 10 square miles, St. Barts is too small to host nearly any major sports event. But sailing presents an opportunity. It is after all how people first came to the island and how many still come to the island.Beyond Les Voiles, there is the Cata-Cup for multihulls in November; the Bucket Regatta for superyachts in March and the biennial Transat AG2R, which finishes in St. Barts and is the only two-handed trans-Atlantic race on identical boats.\u201cSailing is a big part of the life here,\u201d said Philip Trangmar, parish administrator for St. Bartholomew\u2019s Anglican Church. \u201cThe Bucket is a big party. Les Voiles is a much more egalitarian and bring-your-boat-and-fit-into-whatever-class sort of thing. The Transat, no matter what time that first boat arrives, whether it\u2019s the middle of the night, all the fishermen and all the boats gather to meet them. There\u2019s a real connection.\u201dThe Anglican Church, completed in 1855, is one of the few spots in central Gustavia where Irma\u2019s impact is still tangible. One side of the stone wall near the church\u2019s entrance was dislodged and knocked flat by the storm surge and still lies in fragments on the grass next to fund-raising signs.Trangmar, like many on the island, still looks shaken when he discusses Irma\u2019s arrival on the night of Sept. 6.\u201cLike everybody, we don\u2019t talk about it that often,\u201d he said.He said the tin roof was ripped off the house he and his wife were renting, leaving rain pouring \u201clike a waterfall\u201d through the wood left in place.\u201cI\u2019ve been around for other hurricanes; been here for 20 years, but not a direct hit like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was quite small when you think about it. Saba, only 20 miles away, didn\u2019t have hurricane-force winds and yet we had the strongest winds in several decades here.\u201dHe said he knew several people who have left because the opportunities for work have diminished and because they don\u2019t want to live through another hurricane season.Asked why he had decided to stay, he started to speak of the generosity of fellow islanders after the loss of their home.

Mr. Lovejoy has worked in the Amazon (the largest tropical forest) since 1965.Sit on a log by the Madidi River in Bolivia at dusk and you can hear what an Amazon forest should sound like. The music includes red howler monkeys, breathy thumps from the mutum jungle fowl, droning cicadas, eerie calls locals attribute to deadly bushmaster vipers and the unhinged excitement of elusive titi monkeys. Around your feet, the beach is crisscrossed by jaguar tracks and those of the pony-size tapir, a shy beast that, if you keep quiet, will saunter out of the forest and swim across the river.Carbon has been fashioned by evolution into a staggering array of plants and animals, many of which are threatened by the current spasm of extinctions. The great intact forests host the most diverse ecosystems and robust populations of top predators, wide-ranging migrants and undiscovered species. They are evolutionary workshops still going full tilt. In places like the western Amazon, intact forests climb mountainsides, giving species altitudinal ladders to survive climate change.Third, the adage that you can\u2019t manage what you don\u2019t measure applies here. A continuous, near-real-time system of monitoring must be put in place to track where intact forests are being cut so that governments, forest communities and private organizations can react early.But for funds to flow, climate policies need to adapt. They now provide little incentive to conserve large, often remote forest areas. That\u2019s because the forests are beyond the immediate frontier of expanding agriculture and therefore not recognized by climate protection regimes as targets for campaigns to avoid deforestation. It\u2019s difficult to project the baselines of intact forest loss and degradation far into the future, and those predictions are needed to calculate the climate benefits of protecting them. But the United Nations Green Climate Fund and forested countries and donors should embrace that challenge and fill the funding gap.It takes four days and a balsa wood raft to get to that beach in the Bolivian Amazon, which is a big part of the reason its big trees are still standing. Similarly epic journeys will get you to forest gems around the world, where, if you listen, you\u2019ll understand a little more about where we came from and where we need to go from here.Thomas E. Lovejoy is a professor of environmental science and policy at George Mason University.

{"Headline": "Can Europe Lead on Privacy?", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Wheeler is a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.\u201cWe have a responsibility to protect your information,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, declared recently in a full-page newspaper advertisement. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we don\u2019t deserve it.\u201dIt is nice to see Facebook taking some responsibility for the exploitation of the personal information of 50 million of its users in the service of a political campaign. But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments suggest he still doesn\u2019t get it: What matters is not whether internet companies \u201cdeserve\u201d our private information but why we as consumers do not have meaningful ways to protect that data from being siphoned for sale in the first place.The American government has done little to help us in this regard. The Federal Trade Commission merely requires internet companies to have a privacy policy available for consumers to see. A company can change that policy whenever it wants as long as it says it is doing so. As a result, internet companies have been taking our personal property \u2014 our private information \u2014 while hiding this fact behind lengthy and coercive legalese and cumbersome \u201copt out\u201d processes.The European Union, however, is handling the problem differently. Starting in May, its General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect in its 28 member nations. The regulation is powerful in its simplicity: It ensures that consumers own their private information and thus have the right to control its usage and that internet companies have an obligation to give consumers the tools to exercise that control.The European rules, for instance, require companies to provide a plain-language description of their information-gathering practices, including how the data is used, as well as have users explicitly \u201copt in\u201d to having their information collected. The rules also give consumers the right to see what information about them is being held, and the ability to have that information erased.Why don\u2019t we have similar protections in the United States? We almost did. In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission imposed similar requirements on the companies that provide internet service, forcing them to offer an explicit \u201copt in\u201d for having personal data collected, and to protect the information that was collected.This didn\u2019t last. Internet service providers like Comcast and AT&T and companies that use their connections, like Facebook and Google, lobbied members of Congress. Congress passed a law this year, signed by President Trump, that not only repealed the protections but also prohibited the F.C.C. from ever again imposing such safeguards. The same coalition of corporate interests succeeded in discouraging California from passing a state privacy law similar to the 2016 F.C.C. requirements.Fortunately, the European Union\u2019s law should indirectly help Americans somewhat. In only a few weeks, Facebook, Google and all the other internet companies that collect our private information will have to allow European customers the protections these companies have fought to deny Americans. In an interconnected world where digital code doesn\u2019t respect the geographical or national borders, this will surely have a positive global impact.Internet companies are preparing for a future in which regardless of where a website is based, if it is visited by even a single European Union citizen and if it seeks to collect that person\u2019s data, it must provide that person the protections of the General Data Protection Regulation. Hopefully, this experience will show these companies that protecting privacy is simply the responsible thing to do, not the end of their business.The United States government has a lot of explaining to do. Why is it that American internet companies such as Facebook and Google are required to provide privacy protections when doing business with European consumers but are free to not provide such protections for Americans? Why is it that Americans\u2019 best privacy hope is the secondary effect of interconnected networks rather than privacy protections designed for Americans? Why shouldn\u2019t Americans also be given meaningful tools to protect their privacy?Congress is now considering bipartisan legislation that responds to the problem of Russian targeted political advertising on social media by adding the requirement, long applied to broadcast advertising, that those websites disclose who is paying for their advertisements. But as well intentioned as that step may be, it addresses only a symptom of the problem of the extensive surveillance of Americans, not the root of the problem.The New World must learn from the Old World. The internet economy has made our personal data a corporate commodity. The United States government must return control of that information to its owners.Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017, is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.Advertisement"}

State Senators to Retire, Raising Democrats\u2019 Hopes", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the Republicans are to maintain their razor-thin edge in the New York State Senate in the November elections, they will now have to do so without the benefit of three incumbents \u2014 including two of their more venerable members.Senators John A. DeFrancisco and John J. Bonacic announced on Friday that they would not seek re-election. Together, Mr. DeFrancisco, 71, and Mr. Bonacic, 75, have served in the Senate for nearly 45 years.Their announcement came one day after another Senate Republican, Kathleen A. Marchione, a three-term incumbent from Saratoga, announced that she would retire.In recent years, the State Senate has been at the center of an epic \u2014 and often convoluted \u2014 struggle between Democrats and Republicans.With the Assembly and governor\u2019s office in Democratic hands, the Senate has been under Republican control, as a result of a power-sharing arrangement between eight breakaway Democrats, known as the Independent Democratic Conference, and the Republicans. A ninth Democratic senator, Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, also caucused with Republicans.That was immediately followed by renewed pledges from state Democratic officials to liberal activists to flip Republican seats in the Senate in November to create a less tenuous majority there.But the state Republicans have voiced their own determination to hold onto their control. Indeed, Republican senators this week gave Mr. Felder, who represents a predominantly Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, a standing ovation after his pledge of political allegiance.In a statement, Senator John J. Flanagan, the Senate Republican leader, said he was \u201cconfident that our Republican majority will field excellent candidates in each of these districts,\u201d adding that all had been represented by Republicans for many years.\u201cNew Yorkers know that our majority is the only thing standing in the way of the New York City politicians implementing an agenda that will hurt our economy and make life more difficult for hard-working middle-class taxpayers,\u201d he said, predicting Republican victory in November.Geoff Berman, executive director of the state\u2019s Democratic Party, had his own prediction.\u201cIt seems these G.O.P. incumbents are seeing just what I see after Tuesday\u2019s results,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a blue wave building that in November would likely sweep them out of office.\u201dTwo of the three vacant Senate seats are in districts where the number of registered Democrats either surpasses or equals that of Republicans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democrats\u2019 Gentrification Problem", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The nation\u2019s largest cities and metropolitan areas \u2014 home to a majority of Democratic voters \u2014 are at the forefront of the party\u2019s most vexing racial, ethnic and class conflicts.The rise in housing inequality brings us face to face with a central paradox of today\u2019s increasingly urbanized form of capitalism. The clustering of talent, industry, investment, and other economic assets in small parts of cities and metropolitan areas is at once the main engine of economic growth and the biggest driver of inequality. The ability to buy and own housing, much more than income or any other source of wealth, is a significant factor in the growing divides between the economy\u2019s winners and losers.Allies on Election Day, the two wings of the Democratic Party are growing further estranged in other aspects of their lives, driven apart by the movement of advantaged and disadvantaged populations within and between cities. These demographic patterns exacerbate intraparty tensions.While the advantaged members of the knowledge, professional, and creative class have enough money left over even after paying the cost of housing in these cities, it\u2019s the less-well-paid members of the service and working classes who get the short end of the stick, with not nearly enough left over to afford the basic necessities of life. They are either pushed to the periphery of these places or pushed out altogether.The competition for housing between rich and poor has become a critically important and divisive issue in urban America.\u201cThe state of housing affordability in the expensive coastal metros is driving a wedge between two factions of the American left,\u201d Issi Romem, a fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an email to me.Domestic migration across U.S. metropolitan areas is selective: in-migrants to expensive metros tend to have higher incomes and educational attainment than out-migrants, while the opposite is true in the least expensive metros. This pattern contributes to the process of polarization across U.S. metros.Research that focuses on the way city neighborhoods are changing by income, race and ethnicity, while not specifically addressed to political consequences, helps us see the potential for conflict within the Democratic coalition.For example, as Sampson explained by email,fully 80 percent of all U.S. neighborhoods in the top income quintile remained in place between 2000 and 2012. In Los Angeles, the persistence rate reached 87 percent among the highest income quintile neighborhoods. In Chicago 82 percent of the affluent neighborhoods in 2000 remained in place over the decade.Chicago, Sampson wrote, is \u201cexperiencing a concentrated affluence shift,\u201d in whichthe black population has declined and Hispanics are now second largest after whites in population. The race/ethnic shift is something of a milestone given the history of the city.Despite this shift, Chicago remains reliably Democratic. In 2016, Clinton beat Trump there 83.7 percent to 12.5 percent.In firmly Democratic neighborhoods across the country, the economic status of those moving in and out began to shift radically starting at the beginning of this century.Central neighborhoods of most U.S. metropolitan areas experienced population decline 1980-2000 and population growth 2000-2010. 1980-2000 departures of residents without a college degree accounted for most of the decline while the return of college educated whites and the stabilization of neighborhood choices by less educated whites drove most of the post-2000 rebound.Baum-Snow and Hartley cite what they call \u201ca shifting balance between departures of low SES (socioeconomic status) minorities and inflows of high SES whites\u201d and point out that neighborhoods surrounding cities\u2019 central business districts have experienced a turnarounddriven by the return of college-graduate and high-income whites to these neighborhoods, coupled with a halt in the outflows of other white demographic groups. At the same time, the departures of minorities without college degrees continued unabated.In Chicago, Baum-Snow and Hartley point out, the largely minority census tracts that gained whites the fastest from 1980 to 2010 were \u201calmost exclusively within 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) of the central business district.\u201dA similar pattern has emerged in the urban West. \u201cGentrification in the Bay Area, Portland and Seattle,\u201d Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, told me in an email, \u201cis definitely pushing disadvantaged populations out of old neighborhoods and into far-flung exurbs.\u201dWithin major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Cain continued,the sorting is also between neighborhoods, with large nonwhite populations surrounded by white/Asian suburbs, and certain Latinos and Asians displacing blacks.Upscale liberal whites \u201cwho consider themselves committed to racial justice\u201d tend to be \u201cNIMBYists when it comes to their neighborhoods,\u201d Cain wrote, \u201cnot living up to their affordable housing commitments and resisting apartment density around mass transportation stops.\u201d\u201cOne of the key problems of the information/digital economy,\u201d according to Cain,is that it thrives under conditions of amassing large concentrations of human and financial capital, which results in these homogeneous bubbles. It doesn\u2019t help that many of the tech workers are not as inclined to be good neighbors.The trends Cain cites are part of a nationwide shift.From the 1960s and 1970s to 2000, Florida pointed out by email, the basic pattern wasblacks were moving into and staying in cities, and whites were moving out. But in the period since 2000, and earlier than that for very successful cities like New York, San Francisco, Boston, Washington D.C., and Seattle, affluent white highly educated people begin to move in, and less educated whites and particularly less educated and less affluent blacks begin moving out.is ultimately a question of whether the most prosperous parts of blue America can be opened up to new entrants, or whether they will remain closed off and increasingly unaffordable. It is also a political test for whether progressives will be manipulated by knee-jerk suspicions, or be able to think clearly about using the market to serve human needs.The maneuvers in California are a reflection of a larger problem for Democrats: their inability to reconcile the conflicts inherent in the party\u2019s economic and racial bifurcation.In principle, greater inequality produces a demand for more redistribution. Democratic politicians should respond by imposing higher taxes on the wealthy and spending the proceeds on the less well off.In practice, Rodrik writesdemocracies have moved in the opposite direction. The progressivity of income taxes has decreased, reliance on regressive consumption taxes has increased, and the taxation of capital has followed a global race to the bottom. Instead of boosting infrastructure investment, governments have pursued austerity policies that are particularly harmful to low-skill workers. Big banks and corporations have been bailed out, but households have not. In the United States, the minimum wage has not been adjusted sufficiently, allowing it to erode in real terms.Why?is not friendly to redistribution, because it believes in meritocracy \u2014 a world in which effort gets rewarded and low incomes are more likely to be the result of insufficient effort than poor luck.\u201cWealthy individuals\u201d are at the top, according to Lind, with a \u201clarge luxury-service proletariat at the bottom.\u201d Democrats, in this scheme, have become the party ofthe downtown and edge city elites and their supporting staff of disproportionately foreign-born, low-wage service workers.Lind\u2019s point raises a fundamental question for the Democratic Party: Can it find a way to hold its \u201chourglass-shaped\u201d political coalition together?Over the next decade or so, the Republicans will split between their growing nationalist-populist wing and their business establishment wing, a split that the nationalist-populist wing will eventually win. The Democrats will face a similar split between the increasingly pro-corporate but socially liberal Clinton wing and a more economically progressive Sanders wing, a split that the Clinton wing will eventually win.The outcome?The Democrats will become the party of urban cosmopolitan business liberalism, and the Republicans will become the party of suburban and rural nationalist populism.Clearly, the 2016 election demonstrated the fragility of the Democratic coalition and its vulnerability to challenge from the populist right.Dani Rodrik picks up this point in his Project Syndicate essay:Why were democratic political systems not responsive early enough to the grievances that autocratic populists have successfully exploited \u2014 inequality and economic anxiety, decline of perceived social status, the chasm between elites and ordinary citizens? Had political parties, particularly of the center left, pursued a bolder agenda, perhaps the rise of right-wing, nativist political movements might have been averted.The forces behind the conversion of the Democratic Party into \u201cthe party of urban cosmopolitan business liberalism,\u201d as described by Drutman, may be inexorable. If so, Rodrik\u2019s call on the center-left to adopt a \u201cbolder agenda\u201d may be beyond reach.Taking it a step further, a Democratic Party based on urban cosmopolitan business liberalism runs the risk not only of leading to the continued marginalization of the minority poor, but also \u2014 as the policies of the Trump administration demonstrate \u2014 to the continued neglect of the white working-class electorate that put Trump in the White House.In other words, Democratic strategists looking to piece together a 21st century political alliance have to consider the unintended consequences of taking the easy route: constructing a coalition explicitly dominated by elites.I say easy because \u2014 compared to the average resident of the United States \u2014 the affluent are \u201cvastly more engaged politically,\u201d as Douglas S. Massey and Jacob S. Rugh, sociologists at Princeton and Brigham Young University, write in a forthcoming paper, \u201cIsolation at the Extremes\u201d:Whereas 99 percent of the wealthy voted in the 2012 presidential election and 60 percent gave money to a political candidate, the corresponding figures were just 78 percent and 18 percent for Americans in general. As a result, the affluent are far more likely to have their political preferences reflected in public policies than other Americans.The force that had historically pushed policy to the economic left \u2014 organized labor \u2014 has for the most part been marginalized. African-American and Hispanic voters have shown little willingness to join Democratic reform movements led by upper middle class whites, as shown in their lack of enthusiasm for Bill Bradley running against Al Gore in 2000 or Sanders running against Clinton in 2016.Advertisement"}

Yet studios are more reliant than ever on the box office. Squeezed by the rise of subscription streaming services like Netflix, the six major studios reported an 18 percent drop in home-video rental and sales revenue, including video-on-demand purchases, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the 2016 period.Digital TV Research, a British media consultancy, estimated in October that piracy would cost the global movie and television business $37.4 billion in lost revenue this year, an 18 percent increase from 2017. Losses in 2022 were projected to reach $51.6 billion.Mergers could lead to budget cuts for the nonprofit Motion Picture Association. Under the current setup, the six member studios chip in more than $16 million apiece annually to fund the association\u2019s global operations, according to tax filings.\u201cI do not think we have punched our weight in terms of influence \u2014 the power that we should have, given the jobs we support,\u201d said Jeff Shell, chairman of the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, which includes Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features. Mr. Shell added that the M.P.A.A. is \u201ca big, complicated organization and needs an executive to go in and rethink every part as a business \u2014 what should be invested in and grown, what should be scaled back.\u201dMr. Rivkin acknowledged that the organization faces challenges big and small, including questions about its identity and its structure. Netflix plans to release 80 original movies this year but is not a member. Should it be? But he spoke about solutions with a confidence that felt genuine, calling the association \u201ca dust-covered diamond that can easily shine again.\u201d\u201cReinvigorated at every level,\u201d he said of the association.At the same time, Mr. Rivkin aggressively disputed the notion that Mr. Trump and Hollywood are on opposite sides.\u201cPresident Trump probably knows this industry better than any president since Reagan,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he understands that entertainment is important both as an economic force \u2014 jobs in every single state \u2014 and as a projection of American values. It\u2019s our soft power. It\u2019s showing the world what America is capable of.\u201dHerding studio chiefs is harder than it used to be. In Mr. Valenti\u2019s era, the film factories were stand-alone entities whose interests were in lock step. Today, the studios are owned by sprawling conglomerates, which employ their own lobbyists and often have competing interests.One of Mr. Rivkin\u2019s cousins, the Democratic fund-raiser and education advocate Jamie Alter Lynton, is married to Mr. Lynton, the former Sony chief.Brian Henson, chairman of the Henson Company and Jim Henson\u2019s son, agreed \u2014 with a twist.\u201cI think that putting his ego aside actually is part of his ego,\u201d he said. \u201cCharlie wants to be the guy who makes things happen for others.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The actions have weighed on the stock prices of large international corporations, and if implemented, could hurt their bottom lines.But global companies mostly have not detailed the potential impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies. Will that now change? With first-quarter earnings imminent, and tensions with China escalating, shareholders may want companies to make specific disclosures. The companies may be tempted to say little. After all, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade restrictions have merely been threatened, and may not occur if deals are struck. But in the past, companies have refreshed their outlooks in the face of circumstantial economic and geopolitical events, like the Gulf War. And investors will likely press firms to estimate the impact of a trade war and describe the measures they will take to protect their businesses.Still, the prospect of a trade war raises questions about the adequacy of corporate disclosure. Those of G.M., contained in its latest annual report, seem quite detailed. They offer quite specific warnings about the risks of doing business in China, and the company even mentions the possibility of trade agreements falling apart. But financial reports from Boeing and Apple arguably have less on potential problems in China and trade disputes.Boeing\u2019s annual report did mention tariffs and embargoes as threats. But the report, released in February, also sounded a bullish note on the global economy that now almost sounds like it was from a different era:\u201cThe long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries.\u201dWill such language remain in Boeing\u2019s reports?- Peter EavisFor years, investors had a singular focus on the Federal Reserve and its plans to raise rates.Any indication that the Fed could move more aggressively than expected to tighten monetary policies and stocks would pull back.Now the Fed has company in sending jitters through the market: Trade.A one-two punch from the White House and the Fed pushed stocks on Wall Street down Friday. The S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both finished off more than 2 percent.Markets began to slide at the start of trading after President Trump\u2019s threat on Thursday to heap fresh tariffs on China. Investors took little comfort in statements from the administration\u2019s top economic policymakers, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants.Comments from Mr. Powell in the early Friday afternoon added to the unease. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell highlighted the strength of the United States economic recovery and gave little indication that the Fed planned to deviate from its gradual path of lifting interest rates.On WABC Radio\u2019s \u201cBernie & Sid in the Morning\u201d show, Mr. Trump said:\u201cNow we could\u2014the easiest thing for me to do would be just to close my eyes and forget it.\u201d\u201cIf I did that, I\u2019m not doing my job. So, I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain but the market\u2019s gone up 40 percent, 42 percent \u2014 so we might lose a little bit of it\u2014 but we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn\u2019t do.\u201dThe president also took to Twitter to defend his approach to trade policy. Mr. Trump, in a tweet, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese \u201cget tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\u201dThat followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.More from what a representative for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said:\u201cWe feel America is very arrogant. They have taken a wrong action. The result is that they will hurt themselves.\u201dThe Chinese official said that the two sides can\u2019t negotiate under the current conditions. And in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, Larry Kudlow \u2014 who has been national economic adviser for just under a week \u2014 said he could not predict when talks would begin. He added:Earlier this year, stocks sold off after the jobs report for January showed a 2.9 percent annual increase in wages, a relatively strong rise. Investors feared that a sustained increase in earnings could prompt consumers to buy more goods and services, pushing up prices in the process. Concerns receded after February\u2019s report showed a 2.6 percent jump in wages, and March\u2019s rise of 2.7 percent is not likely to stir up more worries.The March report contained data that could do even more to quell investors\u2019 nerves over inflation. While the report revised February\u2019s gain higher to 326,000 jobs from 313,000, it sharply reduced the January figure to 176,000 from 239,000. The January revision prompted Jim Vogel, of FTN Financial, to write:\u201cThat collapsed what had been an upward slope to the last two years of payroll growth and implicitly reduced the upward pressure on wages that so many are still certain will arrive this year.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisThe headline numbers The takeaways\u2022 \u201cThat\u2019s something I get no credit for, by the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been for equal opportunity in gay marriage for the last 12 or 13 years.\u201d\u2022 \u201cSee this?\u201d he says. \u201cThese are front-stabbing knives.

{"Headline": "The Fight With the West Is Isolating Russia. But That Isn\u2019t Stopping Putin.", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 At least one bright spot stands out in the Russian economy, even as its prospects darken in the face of escalating sanctions: the manufacture of work uniforms.The production of specialized work clothes, including bulletproof vests, is one of the lone growth areas in the economy, up by 27 percent, said Igor Nikolaev, director of the Strategic Analysis Institute at the FBK auditing and consulting firm. The comments came at an otherwise gloomy news conference Tuesday focused on Russia\u2019s economic prospects.That statistic, amid a generally dormant economy kept afloat as usual by energy sales, seemed to underscore what many analysts are saying at the moment: President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s increasingly aggressive posture toward the West is producing a boomerang effect, with an isolated Russia likely to suffer long-term economic damage as a result.The confrontation is likely to only get worse, analysts say, for one main reason: Mr. Putin and his closest advisers are convinced they are justified in their policies and have persuaded important portions of the elite as well as the bulk of Russians that the country is thriving, rebuilding its global muscle rather than weakening itself.\u201cThe party of war has won within the Russian elite,\u201d said Yuliy A. Nisnevich, a political-science professor. \u201cThere are people in the elites who would like the confrontation to stop \u2014 these are the people who would like to spend or earn money abroad. But the party of war, the people who get their money inside the country and live here, is prevalent now.\u201dRussia, of course, professes its innocence on all fronts. It accuses the West of suffering from an advanced case of Russophobia, a longstanding disease that emerges from hibernation whenever Russia begins to \u201cget up off its knees.\u201dSergei V. Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, said in a television interview broadcast Tuesday that the last vestiges of trust with the West were evaporating, sinking below even Cold War levels. \u201cThere were communication channels during the Cold War, and there was no obsession with Russophobia, which looks like genocide through sanctions,\u201d Mr. Lavrov told the BBC.From the Western countries\u2019 perspective, however, the mood is one of enough is enough, and they are gradually acting in concert in delivering that message to the Kremlin. Economic sanctions imposed after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, which represented the start of deteriorating relations, have remained intact despite repeated predictions from the Kremlin that one European Union member or another would eventually veto them.More recently, there was the mass expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats from Western nations after the chemical poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain in March; harsh United States sanctions against several Russian oligarchs, political figures and companies; and the bombing of Syria by the United States, France and Britain over the weekend.In Russia, the population can basically be broken down into three groups, said Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, a Russian scholar currently at the Polish Institute of Advanced Studies in Warsaw.The circle around Putin and the bulk of the population are sure that Russia is doing everything right, while the urban elite, including a majority of the business community, thinks it has gone too far and needs to find a way to reset relations with the West, he said.The latter group views growing Western consolidation with trepidation, he said, while the Putin court and the majority \u201cbelieve that quite soon the Western unity will vanish.\u201dThere are those who believe that the Russians have some hold over Mr. Trump. That explanation does not have much public currency in Russia, where the attitude swings between humor and exasperation.If the value of the ruble in relation to the dollar used to fluctuate according to the price of oil, it is now Trump tweets about Russia that send it swinging, goes one joke.But economists are not laughing about the sanctions imposed by the United States last week. The hardest hit was Rusal, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of aluminum, which appeared on the sanctions list and saw its value plummet. Japan just became the latest country to announce that it would halt purchases from the company.The Russian Parliament expedited a draft of proposed countersanctions last week that ranged from halting the import of medicine from the United States, to cutting off titanium and uranium sales, to allowing the open theft of American intellectual property. A statement by one legislator, Pyotr O. Tolstoy \u2014 a descendant of the writer \u2014 that Russians would happily drink brewed tree bark instead of using American medicine provoked widespread derision.On social media, the idea of imposing countersanctions has become known as \u201cbombing Voronezh,\u201d a provincial Russian city, the idea being that such measures invariably hurt Russians.\u201cWe all see that the sanctions standoff is strengthening,\u201d said Mr. Nikolaev, the economist, and the Russian response \u201cmight in fact harm us.\u201dBoeing, for example, buys about 35 percent of its titanium, which is used extensively in the 787 Dreamliner, from VSMPO-Avisma, the state monopoly that controls titanium production. The company warned in a statement that such a measure could adversely affect 20,000 employees and the economy as a whole.The outcry from businesses over the potential countersanctions was such that Russian Parliament postponed discussion of the measures until May 15 to allow for consultations.Ultimately, the path is clear, with the upshot of actions from both the West and Russia driving the \u201cdeglobalization\u201d of Russia, said Evsey Gurvich, the head of the Expert Economic Group, an independent analytic center. As the West shuns Russia, the country will withdraw more and more to try to protect itself from further sanctions, he said.This year economic growth will be lower than the 2 percent anticipated, with expert predictions ranging from 1.7 percent to none.The result, some experts noted, is the state\u2019s taking control over more of the economy as it tries to protect jobs and industries from the fallout from sanctions, driving Russia back toward the Soviet model. In addition, when a big company like Rusal gets hit with sanctions and its revenues plunge, there is less tax revenue for the budget so social services like medicine and education suffer cuts.No one expects economic issues to change Mr. Putin\u2019s mind about confronting the West either. The upshot is that the Kremlin elite who are winning the internal struggle value geopolitical goals far more than the country\u2019s economic development, experts said.\u201cWhen we say that we are not successful and quote economic numbers, they say that they do not care about this,\u201d said Leonid Gozman, a political commentator and former politician.An earlier version of this article misstated the date of a BBC interview with Sergei V. Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister.

{"Headline": "Alexander McQueen\u2019s Legacy: The Sarabande Foundation", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince 2015, when the foundation\u2019s headquarters opened in the East End neighborhood of Haggerston, the former Victorian-era stables have housed 12 artist\u2019s studios that thrum with activity day and night. The occupants run the gamut of creativity from painters and multimedia artists to photographers, jewelers and fashion designers.Sarabande is a charitable trust established in 2007 by the fashion designer Lee Alexander McQueen, who used the title of his spring collection for its name. It became the major beneficiary of his estate after his death in 2010 and, by the end of 2016, had received 10.6 million pounds ($15 million). The money funds graduate and postgraduate scholarships and subsidizes the studio space, for which scholarship recipients can become priority candidates to use for free for a year and then for a further year to rent at a low rate of about \u00a31 per square foot. Other studio occupants pay the same rate throughout their tenancy.\u201cSarabande is unique as a hub of creativity and an incubator of young talent,\u201d Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a patron of the foundation, said in an email. \u201cIn only a few years, it has established itself as one of the most important and exciting community of artists in Britain.\u201dResidents say the studios are affordable sanctuaries, allowing them to develop their creative practices while benefiting from the organization\u2019s business education programs, networking opportunities and mentoring support. \u201cIt brings some much-needed freedom to what I can do,\u201d said Katie Roberts Wood, a women\u2019s wear designer who has been using a studio since October. \u201cI have to run a business but I also have to be able to function fully from a creative side, or it doesn\u2019t work. I feel like Sarabande pays equal attention to both these aspects, which is so rare.\u201dThat dual emphasis is thanks to Trino Verkade, a founding trustee and driving force behind Sarabande\u2019s development. In 1994, she became Mr. McQueen\u2019s first employee and stayed for 18 years, providing the business acumen to support his creative talent. She also brought to the foundation years of experience as an executive vice president at Thom Browne and, most recently, chief executive at Mary Katrantzou.Ms. Verkade said Sarabande\u2019s goal was to plug the gaps left by reduced government support, rising college fees and a dearth of practical business advice for fledgling operations. \u201cBritain has done a good job exporting talent,\u201d she said, but \u201cthere\u2019s all this untapped potential here. That\u2019s a real business opportunity.\u201dShe and her team help successful studio applicants focus on what they want to achieve during their residence, which begins with one year but may be extended to two.Mr. Skelton, a men\u2019s wear designer who uses hand-dyed vintage fabrics and hand-spun, hand-woven material from Indian farmers in the Himalayas for his bespoke collections, said starting a business was overwhelming, prompting countless questions including how to create a costing sheet, to handle exports and to protect intellectual property. \u201cThe business support from Trino has been really invaluable,\u201d he said.The patrons, along with supporters like the fashion designer Giles Deacon, and Matthew Slotover, the co-founder of the Frieze art fairs, help review scholarship and studio applications but, to ensure a diverse range of talent, other sources also are considered. Saelia Aparicio Torinos, an artist who now works in a Sarabande studio, made the connection through a partnership between Sarabande and Bloomberg New Contemporaries, an annual arts exhibition where she showed in 2016.With a constant flow of visitors coming to events or scheduled tours like a recent one by patrons of the Royal Academy of Arts, the studios are rarely quiet. The gallery owner Sadie Coles came by to order a custom ring from Castro Smith, the current jeweler in residence, and the actress Gwendoline Christie (\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d and \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d) to buy one of Ms. Horton\u2019s stuffed shrimp for her boyfriend, Mr. Deacon \u2014 the kind of traffic that Ms. Verkade said had the foundation looking for more studio space.Along with Mr. McQueen\u2019s estate, Sarabande relies on personal donations and company sponsorships. Jasmin Reif is one of two resident artists who received a commission from Ketel One Vodka, the brand owned by the Dutch liquor company Nolet. It asked her to create an artwork inspired by its more than 300-year-old distillery in Schiedam, the Netherlands. So she is working on a mask made of copper, the traditional material used to make their stills, which she will photograph in one of her old masters-inspired self-portraits.It is the kind of thing Mr. McQueen might have done. Trained as a tailor on Savile Row and with a place at the University of London\u2019s Slade School of Fine Art at the time of his death, \u201cLee worked across different creative disciplines,\u201d Ms. Verkade said. \u201cHe worked with jewelers, milliners, even glass blowers.\u201dThe sense of community among the residents, she added, also has led to interdisciplinary collaborations.Ms. Reif, who now knits pieces for Mr. Skelton, considers herself an artist and a designer. \u201cIn both industries, you normally have to choose to be on one side or the other,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the first place where I no longer had to do that.\u201dThe artists and designers at Sarabande studios work across a wide variety of creative disciplines, reflecting Mr. McQueen\u2019s passion for art in all its forms. They include:\u2022 Mr. Smith, who learned the ancient art of engraving by hand during an apprenticeship in Hatton Garden, the historic center of London\u2019s gold and diamond trade, and studying with masters of the art in Japan. His intricate signet rings were discovered on Instagram by Dickon Bowden, vice president of Dover Street Market, who, in turn, introduced him to Sarabande. \u201cBeing here has plugged me into a network,\u201d said the 29-year old-jeweler, whose bedroom formerly doubled as his work space.\u2022 Ms. Roberts-Wood, who completed five years of medical training before switching to fashion design. The 32-year-old women\u2019s wear designer uses her science background to create innovative techniques such as layering fabric to create a dress that is not stitched together. \u201cMy clothes are made in an intelligent and engineered way but this is offset by a very romantic sensibility,\u201d she said.\u2022 Ms. Reif, a German artist and designer whose candlelit self-portrait photographs feature handmade props, like masks knitted from recycled plastic bags and donated yarn. The 34-year-old has just been shortlisted for a Villa Massimo fellowship, a prestigious German award that offers a study visit in Italy.\u2022 Mircea Teleaga, who was selected for a Sarabande scholarship by the artist Dinos Chapman. Mr. Teleaga attend the Slade school and then, in 2016, began a studio residence. On April 11, the Romanian painter, 29, will open his solo show, curated by William Davie, an image archivist at the Gagosian Gallery in London. \u201cIt would have been impossible to do this kind of show if I was on my own,\u201d Mr. Teleaga said.An earlier version of this article misstated the relationship that the fashion designer Giles Deacon and Matthew Slotover, the co-founder of the Frieze art fairs, have with the Sarabande Foundation.

{"Headline": "Charitable Giving by Corporations Is Also About Getting, a New Study Finds", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe same goes for the Walmart Foundation\u2019s contributions to reduce carbon emissions in China and to protect wilderness areas in the United States, or the Dow Chemical Foundation\u2019s contribution to Habitat for Humanity. These companies might be ruthless in their lines of work \u2014 fighting against environmental regulations or more stringent labor standards \u2014 but their foundations are in it to do good to the world.Sifting through the donations to charity from 1998 to 2015 by foundations set up by the largest companies in the United States \u2014 those in the Fortune 500 or the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 Marianne Bertrand of the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business; Matilde Bombardini and Francesco Trebbi of the University of British Columbia; and Raymond Fisman of Boston University detected a pattern of contributions to 1,087 charities linked to 451 members of Congress.Turns out that the spending is a little more self-serving than companies would have us believe. Some of the charitable giving looks a lot like corporate lobbying. Because companies get a break for such giving, it amounts to political spending at taxpayers\u2019 expense. \u201cFirms deploy their charitable foundations as a form of tax-exempt influence seeking,\u201d the researchers write.Think of it like this: One way a company could please Senator Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee and is a member of the committees on finance, agriculture, the budget and taxation, would be to have a corporate political action committee donate directly to his campaign.But there is another way, one that often slips below the radar of campaign-finance watchdogs. Why not donate to the Partnership for a Drug-Free Iowa, where the senator has been an honorary advisory board member?A corporation could also give to the University of Northern Iowa Foundation, on whose board Mr. Grassley sat as a trustee. Over the period covered by the study, the foundations of AT&T, ConAgra Foods, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Medtronic, Merck, Monsanto, Nationwide Insurance, Principal Financial Group and Rockwell Collins all contributed to one or the other.Mr. Grassley\u2019s office, when asked about the corporate contributions to causes linked to the senator, said: \u201cSenator Grassley receives many requests to support various nonprofit organizations. He lends his name to some, but declines most.\u201dThe researchers who conducted the new study don\u2019t claim that any specific charitable contribution was meant to manipulate the political process. But their work lays bare the extent to which corporate donations may respond to political, rather than charitable, motivations.The new research uncovers patterns in the aggregate data that suggest corporate donations are often dictated by recipients\u2019 political clout. For instance, a company foundation will donate more to charities in districts where the representatives have gained seats on a committee that is important to the company. And when the member of Congress leaves office, corporate donations to charities in his or her district will dip.Corporations\u2019 philanthropy often flows to the same areas as their political action committee contributions: Charities in districts where companies favor a particular candidate tend to get more corporate donations.A charity need not have been founded by a member of Congress to get corporate money. But it helps. A nonprofit is more than four times more likely to receive grants from a corporate foundation if a politician sits on its board. And corporate foundation grants are even more likely if the politician happens to sit on a committee being lobbied by the firm.The authors of the study examined only a subset of corporate philanthropy, money flowing through corporate foundations that must disclose the recipients of their largess. But the research suggests that the impact of corporate contributions could be much bigger than even critics of campaign-finance practices realize.The researchers estimate that over 7 percent of charitable donations by corporate foundations are intended to buy political leverage. Applied to $18 billion worth of corporate philanthropy in 2014, that would amount to $1.3 billion, almost four times as much as total political action committee contributions that year and 40 percent more than the corporations\u2019 lobbying expenditures.There are a couple of lessons here. For those who favor campaign-finance reform, perhaps the most urgent message is that there are many doors that corporate America can use to buy influence. But the research also highlights the way that companies interact with society.Corporations are likely to tally their foundations\u2019 charity as a decided plus on the dashboard of corporate social responsibility. But politically motivated charitable giving meant to undercut regulations, promote a tax cut or otherwise gain a break could actually reduce total welfare.As the researchers write, \u201cIf corporations\u2019 good deeds (in the form of charitable contributions) cater to politicians\u2019 interests, who as a result put the interests of business ahead of those of voters, the overall welfare effects are ambiguous \u2014 society benefits via increased charity, at the potentially high cost of distorting laws and regulation.\u201dNone of this would happen, of course, if politicians weren\u2019t so hungry for corporate money. \u201cCompanies wouldn\u2019t do this if it didn\u2019t pay off,\u201d Professor Bombardini told me. \u201cPoliticians get good publicity by channeling funds that are valuable to the community. Whatever makes you look good, you want to take credit for it.\u201dBut with a new wave of scandals engulfing some of the nation\u2019s corporate titans, it would behoove them to honestly assess the ultimate purpose of their charity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Plan to Deploy the National Guard Puzzles Many at the Border", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMcALLEN, Tex. \u2014 They arrive a few dozen at a time, their children by their side, their belongings in government-issued plastic bags.The immigrants who step inside a Catholic Charities relief center in this South Texas border city are the focus of national controversy, but their concerns are more logistical than political. One of the first things they do after sitting down is fix their shoes \u2014 most have spent a few days in federal detention before coming here; they had to remove their shoelaces, and now they sit in the center\u2019s blue hard-backed chairs, tying up their shoes.Dozens of immigrants, mostly from Central America, have been crossing illegally here every day, most of them scooped up by federal Border Patrol agents, given a court date and an ankle bracelet monitoring device, and dropped off at the downtown bus station. From there, they are led by volunteers to the nearby relief center, where they put their belts back on, eat a bowl of cereal, sort through donated clothes and change their infants\u2019 diapers.In the drama that is the migrants\u2019 journey, this is the intermission \u2014 the limbo of waiting for the journey to start up again. And it goes on, seven days a week, morning to night, regardless of the news out of Washington.\u201cThey will always come,\u201d said Mariana Salinas, 43, who was apprehended crossing the Rio Grande on an inflatable mattress with her two sons last week after fleeing the threat of gang violence in her native El Salvador. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it for the kids.\u201dEarlier this week, on the day White House officials announced that President Trump planned to deploy the National Guard to the southern border, Ms. Salinas was one of about 170 newly released immigrants who were assisted by the center. The day before, the number was about 140.There was little evidence of that this week at the border, where a steady flow of immigrants made their way out of the detention center, through the relief center, and from there, onward to cities around the country. Border apprehensions have slid significantly over the past year, but the Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday that illegal border crossings had surged in March: The 37,393 individuals apprehended on the Southwest border was a 203 percent increase over the same period in March 2017, though the number was lower than in 2013 and 2014.\u201cThe number of illegal border crossings during the month of March shows an urgent need to address the ongoing situation at the border,\u201d Tyler Q. Houlton, the department\u2019s press secretary, told reporters in Washington. \u201cAs the president has repeatedly said, all options are on the table.\u201dThree of the four governors in the states that share a border with Mexico \u2014 Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas \u2014 have expressed support for Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to mobilize the National Guard to help secure the border. The Democratic governor of Oregon, Kate Brown, has said that if asked, she would refuse to deploy any Guard troops.But here in the Rio Grande Valley at the southern tip of Texas, one of the busiest corridors for human smuggling and illegal entry into the United States, the issue takes on a far more nuanced tone.The Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies were rarely mentioned in the dining room and lobby of the McAllen respite center. Although the center was busy, no one working to help handle the flow seemed to think they needed help from the National Guard. These immigrants were mothers and fathers, teenagers and infants \u2014 men with baseball caps changing their child\u2019s diaper, mothers and daughters brushing their teeth for the first time in days at the bathroom sink, men eating bowls of chicken soup.Many of the other Americans who live here \u2014 those who legally call the border home and have done so for years, sometimes generations \u2014 appeared to share the same view: There is no security crisis, only the daily challenge of meeting the basic needs of migrants who keep filling downtown McAllen.\u201cWe\u2019re not in a position where military zones are needed in our communities,\u201d said Sergio Contreras, the president of a regional business group, the Rio Grande Valley Partnership. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s helpful. We want to showcase that there\u2019s other means of securing the border.\u201dAt the relief center on Wednesday, Lilian Morales Gonzalez, 22, tried to soothe her crying 2-month-old baby, a statue of Jesus behind her. She came from Guatemala \u2014 \u201cso my son can grow up with his father,\u201d she said \u2014 and was apprehended on Monday morning. She said Mr. Trump and his policies had no effect on her decision.Ismelda Cruz, 28, also came from Guatemala. She, her husband and 7-year-old daughter crossed the Rio Grande at Reynosa, Mexico, fleeing the criminals she said were trying to recruit her husband. Asked if the presence of National Guard troops would deter people from making the journey from Guatemala, Ms. Cruz replied, \u201cThey\u2019re always going to find a way through.\u201dMigrants who were recently apprehended, longtime residents and local officials in McAllen and other cities in the Rio Grande Valley said that with or without the National Guard, and with or without the White House\u2019s increasingly anti-immigrant rhetoric, people would keep crossing. They worry that a deployment of troops would hurt the region\u2019s economy and add to the inaccurate perception that Texas\u2019 border cities were unsafe.\u201cWe\u2019ll get the bad publicity,\u201d said Tony Martinez, the mayor of Brownsville, an hour\u2019s drive to the east. \u201cNobody is sitting around here locking their doors and taping up their windows. It\u2019s not a matter of security. Immigrants don\u2019t want to migrate. They have to. This charade that Washington, or Trump more particularly, is imposing on the border is nothing more than empty rhetoric.\u201dA show of military force on the border in this part of Texas would be nothing new.The Texas Republicans who lead state government have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on increasing border security, deploying heavily armed river patrol boats, purchasing a high-tech surveillance airplane and posting state troopers in the highway medians near the border, and previous United States administrations have on occasion dispatched National Guard units. In 2014, former Gov. Rick Perry ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to the border, in a state-ordered mobilization that Gov. Greg Abbott continued after he took office in 2015.For the most part, the troops assisted local and federal law enforcement, in an approach officials described as \u201creferring and deterring\u201d \u2014 aiming to deter illegal activity with their physical presence, and to refer those suspected of being illegal immigrants to law enforcement officials. Some of the troops lived in motels; the cost for the deployment, as estimated in 2014, was $12 million a month.These days, for all the emphasis on border security, the Rio Grande Valley displays few signs of an outright militarization. The binational culture of the region \u2014 Texas license plates are visible on cars, as are plates from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas \u2014 has frayed in recent years, but remains intact. Business leaders in the valley say construction has increased, but they worry about a recent decline in retail sales tax, which they attribute in part to fewer shoppers coming from Mexico.\u201cWe just did a binational run into Matamoros, Mexico,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cWe were in Matamoros and we all had nice breakfasts. We had 800 runners from both sides. We\u2019re doing a lot of wonderful things in spite of what\u2019s going on in Washington.\u201dIn McAllen, a majority-Hispanic city of 142,000, the migrants are largely invisible, except for when they walk to and from the bus station or the relief center.The center \u2014 a storefront that blends in with the Tex-Mex restaurants, nightclubs and clothing stores \u2014 has become a hub of activity on the quiet downtown streets.With insufficient space to detain everyone, federal authorities for years dropped off immigrants who had promised to appear in court at the bus station downtown. Sometimes they had a bus ticket, purchased by their relatives, but sometimes they did not. The immigrants were on their own to sort out their travel arrangements. Many of them were hungry, tired, confused.In stepped Sister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley.

She had a bus ticket to Phoenix, Ariz., where her mother lives and where she has a court date next week.Sister Pimentel looked through her paperwork and asked Ms. Cruz a simple question.

{"Headline": "Vanishing Spanish Village Sees a Future in Its Roman Past", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDriebes JournalDRIEBES, Spain \u2014 The 339 inhabitants of Driebes have reasons to worry. The village has only one shepherd left. He is 82. The school, built for as many as 50 children, now holds 11. So far this year, six of its aging residents have died and not a single birth has been registered.The demographic evolution of Driebes is set to cut the population to less than 200 inhabitants within 20 years, warned the mayor, Pedro Rinc\u00f3n. That is, unless Driebes can attract tourism or investment.That is why he and his dwindling band of constituents got so excited last summer when archaeologists spent a month excavating outside Driebes, on a plateau overlooking the Tagus river.Now Driebes is pining for the Caraca digs to resume, hoping a Roman past can help secure the village\u2019s future as a tourist destination.That may be something of a pipe dream. Even so, this month, the village organized a competition in which 19 graffiti artists covered walls around Driebes with Roman-themed murals.\u201cIt makes me proud to see the people from this village welcome with such enthusiasm an excavation project, especially because archaeology shouldn\u2019t just be about finding old things but also transmitting knowledge to those who live here today,\u201d said David Alv\u00e1rez Jim\u00e9nez, a historian who is involved in the Caraca project.Until the 1950s, Driebes maintained a population of almost 1,200, not bad for a village located in a vast area known as \u201cthe Lapland of Spain\u201d because of its sparse population.But just as Caraca was abandoned by the Romans, presumably because their mining activities ended, so too Driebes started emptying because of its dwindling agriculture.Villagers steadily moved to the new dormitory towns and factories built around Madrid, Spain\u2019s capital, just 50 miles away.Mr. Rinc\u00f3n, the mayor, was born in Driebes in 1962, but left when he was an infant, because his father found work in an oil refinery in Arganda del Rey, a town of over 50,000 inhabitants some 30 miles from Driebes.Mr. Rinc\u00f3n himself went on to work in the same refinery, but then returned to his village when the refinery closed 24 years ago. He set himself up as an independent meat distributor and was elected mayor in 2010.\u201cI always felt that I\u2019d been snatched away as a baby from the family village that I really love,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky to come back and also work here, but there\u2019s no question that we will need to create more jobs to save this village and keep young people.\u201dHis own daughter, Montserrat, 32, lives in Driebes with her parents but is now unemployed.Driebes is not alone in facing a bleak future, even as Spain\u2019s economy continues its strong recovery from its 2012 banking crisis.Around Driebes, some villages have survived only on the whims of good fortune or special investment projects.In Estremera, the village\u2019s economy was lifted a decade ago by the opening of a penitentiary, whose inmates now include Catalan politicians awaiting trial for trying to secede from Spain.Like most other villages, Driebes has kept itself alive through a mix of regional, national and European subsidies.\u201cIf we talk purely about economics, neither our school, nor our medical center nor anything else in this village is now viable without subsidies,\u201d said Mr. Rinc\u00f3n, the mayor.The only thriving business involves retired people, he said, since about 40 pensioners regularly visit a community center that used to welcome about 10 people a decade ago.Fernando Bachiller Higuera, one of seven farmers remaining in Driebes, said that he would struggle to break even without the subsidies he received from the European Union\u2019s common agricultural policy to grow cereals on land that \u201cisn\u2019t actually that suitable for cereals,\u201d he said.\u201cI only became a farmer because my father died and something had to be done with the land, and we could get European subsidies,\u201d Mr. Bachiller Higuera, 47, said.\u201cIf my two sons decide they prefer studying than the fields, I myself will stop in 20 years and this farming story will come to an end,\u201d he said.On weekends and during the summer vacations, the population of Driebes swells as former residents return to enjoy traditional village feasts and take a break from city life. Even so, a dozen houses stand in ruins, half awaiting demolition.\u201cWhat this village doesn\u2019t have in physical beauty, it compensates for with its great personality and the friendliness of its people,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Teresa Vadillo S\u00e1nchez, who works in a town 30 miles away but returns most weekends with her daughters to a family home where her mother now lives alone.It\u2019s too early to understand the Roman history that once breathed life into Caraca. But using a drone and ground radar technology, archaeologists have mapped the town that they will unearth, pending more funding.Last summer, 15 people got paid to help with the first excavation, but the archaeologists caution against raising expectations about their project and how it could bring economic sustainability to Driebes.\u201cIt\u2019s great to get local people involved, but excavations are slow and expensive,\u201d said Emilio Gamo, one of Caraca\u2019s archaeologists. \u201cSo the people should also know that the dynamics of archaeology aren\u2019t necessarily those of a tourism project.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Belgium May Have New Appeal for Millennials: Join the Army and Sleep at Home", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 In armies around the world, basic training is more than just a course in fitness, military organization and weapons skills.It plays a crucial psychological role, taking raw recruits away from civilian life, plunging them into life in barracks, breaking down their sense of self and molding them, sometimes brutally, into a cohesive unit of soldiers.But it may soon be significantly less brutal in Belgium, where the army is considering plans to let recruits sleep at home on weekdays during training. They already have the right to return home during the weekend.Government officials say the change is needed to make a graying army \u2014 the average age in the Belgian armed forces is 44, more than a decade older than in France, Germany or Britain \u2014 more attractive to millennials.\u201cSociety is constantly evolving, the dreams and expectations of young people are evolving, and so the army has to evolve with it,\u201d said Alex Claesen, a media officer for the Belgian military. He added that the idea was part of broader proposals to better serve the \u201cwishes and capacities\u201d of recruits.Many veterans and defense experts, however, are aghast, arguing that the policy could undermine unit cohesion and set a dangerous precedent for other Western armies. But many declined to go on the record with their criticism.Danny Lams, a former Dutch paratrooper and chairman of a veterans\u2019 organization, condemned the plans.\u201cIf you allow the recruits to go home during the week, the military will soon ask for a mobile home if they are sent to the front,\u201d he added.Belgium would be the first country in modern Western military history to make such a move, according to experts from the European Defense Agency, which monitors defense capabilities of European Union member states.\u201cEvery army trains to go to war, and there will be no sleeping at home when you go to war,\u201d said Vir Maram, 35, a reservist corporal of the French Foreign Legion who served several tours under the command of Western armies and NATO in Afghanistan, Iraq and Mali and who is studying international security in Brussels.\u201cAn army evolves with the way that it fights,\u201d he added, \u201cbut the only thing that changes are the weapons we fight with \u2014 the nature of war itself doesn\u2019t change, and so the basic principles of the army don\u2019t change.\u201dMilitary service was mandatory in Belgium until 1994 for men turning 18 or ending their studies for one year. Since then, the head count of the country\u2019s armed forces has gradually diminished, to about 28,500 active personnel from 40,000.Belgium now has about 2.6 soldiers per 1,000 civilians, fewer than many of its NATO allies. And the average age has crept up.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a Dad\u2019s Army,\u201d said Roger Housen, a retired colonel in the Belgian armed forces, referring to a television comedy about the British Home Guard, a World War II volunteer force made up of men exempt from conscription, often because they were considered too old to fight.\u201cThe army is right to try to attract more youngsters, as many senior personnel will retire over the next five years,\u201d Colonel Housen said. But the requirement to live in barracks, he said, was not the main factor driving young people away.About 20 percent to 25 percent of recruits chose to end their contracts early, official army statistics show, but only 16 percent of those who leave say they do so because of \u201cfamily reasons.\u201dMore important, Colonel Housen said, was the effect of cuts in the Belgian defense budget over the past decades, which meant that \u201cyoung people don\u2019t have the appropriate equipment, they lack the means to train in a convenient way, they don\u2019t have the right garrisons, the right training infrastructure, they don\u2019t have the required readiness.\u201d\u201cAs a matter of fact, they can\u2019t do the things they want to do, and the things they joined the armed forces for,\u201d he added.Mr. Claesen, the army spokesman, said that a growing economy and increasingly lucrative civilian jobs for young people had kept many millennials away from the military. Others, he added, deem the prospect of patrolling the streets of Antwerp and Brussels under the country\u2019s continuing counterterrorism operation, Vigilant Guardian, not adventurous enough.\u201cContributions to NATO operations are important,\u201d said Oana Lungescu, the senior spokeswoman for NATO. \u201cBut so are defense spending and having the right capabilities.\u201dAs for Mr. Maram, the Legionnaire, he said: \u201cIn the French Foreign Legion, we stay in the barracks for the first five years.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want next, the army can go on strike? You want unions in the army?\u201d he said, bursting into laughter. \u201cHow I hate the 21st century!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fixing the \u2018Involuntary Housewife Visa\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs. Dalmia, a native of India, had to overcome the H-4 hurdle to obtain a green card and work authorization before finally becoming a naturalized United States citizen in 2002.I came to America from India at age 23. That was in 1985, a golden age of immigration to this country. It didn\u2019t feel like it, though, because it still took my husband, a medical physicist, and me a good seven years to trade up from our student visas for an H-1B for him and an H-4 spouse visa for me. Eventually we got the ultimate prize: green cards \u2014 which, to our amusement, weren\u2019t even green back then.An H-1B, which is primarily reserved for high-tech talent, allowed my now ex-husband to accept a job at a Detroit cancer hospital. But my H-4 barred me from working, even though I already had several years of journalism experience along with a degree in biology and chemistry. I had to wait another two years for my green card before I got the legal right to earn a living.Putting my career on hold until I was 30 was frustrating, especially since we had a baby to support. But Indian spouses on H-4s \u2014 well over 90 percent of them women \u2014 who came after me envy my experience.This happened because in 1990, Congress imposed an annual limit on employment-based green cards that was far too low for America\u2019s growing economy. This was on top of the overall green card cap and country-specific quotas. With the I.T. revolution taking off and Silicon Valley aggressively recruiting Indians on H-1Bs, the timing of this third blow couldn\u2019t have been more inopportune.The upshot is that Indians who\u2019ve applied for their H-1B in the past six years may end up retiring before seeing their green cards. And their spouses may have to abandon hope of ever working in America unless they can get their own H-1B.That was never easy. These visas have always been in short supply. Over the past six years, they\u2019ve been running out within the first week after the government starts accepting applications. It also means finding an employer in the same town as your husband that is willing to hire and sponsor you despite the cost and the uncertainty involved. That\u2019s why Indian women plaintively refer to the H-4 as an \u201cinvoluntary housewife visa.\u201dRestrictionists assume a zero-sum math for workers: A job gain for a foreigner is a job loss for an American. By that logic every college graduate who enters the job market would be cause for mourning. But that\u2019s backward, given that skilled individuals create, not take away, jobs, and no economy succeeds by shackling qualified people.Not letting them do so is a personal tragedy for them. But it also turns the restrictionist worry that immigrants today prefer to live transnational lives rather than assimilate into a self-fulfilling prophecy. A job is not just income. It is also an assimilation program because it offers an entry into a new culture and a chance to form new friendships.Because getting a green card took only a few years when I came, I, like many other spouses in my situation, used that time to obtain a graduate degree and build skills in preparation for entering the job market. However, what would be the point of investing that kind of time and effort in an advanced degree if there is so little certainty that it would actually offer a return one day? Many H-4 wives I know end up staying at home, Skyping with friends and family back home to escape the boredom and isolation of being confined to a \u201cgilded cage\u201d \u2014 their description of their life in America.I remember feeling an exhilarating world of opportunities open up before me when I got my green card. It is sad \u2014 and senseless \u2014 that President Trump is so determined to prevent others like me from experiencing the full promise of America and participating fully in American life.Advertisement"}

Why?\u2022 What questions do you still have?When I first discovered the power of documentaries, one film that truly inspired me was \u201cUnzipped,\u201d a quintessential fashion documentary. To make this film, the director, Douglas Keeve, followed one of the era\u2019s most successful high-fashion designers, Isaac Mizrahi, as he planned his fall 1994 collection. Mr. Keeve\u2019s romantic connection to his subject seems to inform every gorgeous black-and-white frame of 16-millimeter film.

I think the answer lies somewhere among the stunning works of painting and sculpture inside the Met. Here, works of fashion are interpreted in an art historical context that elevates what we are looking at beyond a consumer good or star vehicle.

A Chinese state oil giant vowed to put the party front and center in its joint ventures with foreign partners.And Cummins, the engine maker from Indiana, felt the party\u2019s reach, too, when it tried to appoint a new manager for one of its China businesses. The party said no.\u201cIn the past the American general manager did not understand why the party was involved in decision making,\u201d said Hu Hongwei, the party\u2019s representative to Cummins\u2019s China joint venture, according to The People\u2019s Daily, the party\u2019s official newspaper.But Cummins\u2019s Chinese partner then rewrote the business\u2019s articles of association to give the party more power, Ms. Hu said. The American manager \u201chas begun to understand it,\u201d she added.The Communist Party\u2019s rise in the Chinese offices and factories of foreign companies is yet another challenge for multinationals doing business in the country, which has the world\u2019s second-largest economy, trailing only that of the United States. President Trump\u2019s protectionism has put American companies in particular in the middle of a brewing fight between Beijing and Washington.Should a trade dispute between China and the United States worsen, Beijing could be moved to intensify the party\u2019s role in foreign business even further, creating yet another headache for businesses operating in China.The party\u2019s expanding presence in business is part of a broader push by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president and the party\u2019s top leader, to make it stronger. He has reshaped education to include more Communist Party mythology and increased the party\u2019s role in China\u2019s military. Mr. Xi\u2019s take on Communism \u2014 called \u201cXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d \u2014 has been unveiled with great fanfare across the country.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen the party so forcefully articulate its own goals,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a senior adviser and China head at Crumpton Group. \u201cCompanies are now trying to coordinate with the party in a way that doesn\u2019t sacrifice their own shareholder interest.\u201dThe Communist Party has long been part of doing business in China. While party committees are a fixture in many foreign-managed workplaces, they were seen by foreign executives for years as more like social clubs. They would meet to read party announcements, recruit new members, make sure dues were collected and generally keep an eye on operations.But on at least three occasions in recent months, foreign executives have been approached by their Chinese joint venture partners demanding that they involve internal party committees in strategic decisions, say lawyers and business executives.\u201cInfiltration by party operatives into the executive circle of foreign-invested enterprises is not extensively apparent at this time but things are certainly going in that direction,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing whose clients include American multinational corporations.He said several of his clients in joint ventures had received explicit requests to give their internal party organizations a greater say in the company\u2019s operations. At some companies, the requested language requires a board of directors to consult with the committee before making business decisions.Foreign business associations in China have spoken out. In November, the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce said it was concerned about \u201cproactive calls on foreign-invested companies to promote the development of the Communist Party of China within companies.\u201d The European Chamber of Commerce has called such incidents a \u201cgreat concern\u201d that would represent \u201ca significant change from the legal framework under which joint ventures were negotiated and under which they have been operating successfully for decades.\u201dThe creeping influence of the party in foreign offices and factories is a sensitive subject in a country where the party seems ready to punish anyone who questions its widening influence. Many companies are loath to discuss the issue.Cummins, for example, declined to comment on the changes to its joint venture\u2019s articles of incorporation that gave the party greater power. Cummins had not \u201cexperienced any challenges or impact due to the structure we have in place and the role of the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d a spokesman said.Dongfeng\u2019s other partners, like Peugeot and Dana, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A Honda spokesman declined to comment about its partnership with Dongfeng.However, the Honda spokesman confirmed that the party claimed a more assertive role in another joint venture with a different Chinese company, GAC Group.GAC, an automaker owned by Guangzhou Automobile Group, is pushing its joint ventures to change their articles of association to give the party a greater role, a spokeswoman said. In addition to Honda, it has joint ventures with Toyota and Mitsubishi, both of which declined to comment.In November, at the most important Communist Party meeting, which takes place every five years, Mr. Xi called on officials to strengthen the party in \u201cgovernment, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west.\u201d The message was quick to reach party members lower down in the ranks.Soon after Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, party officials in the central province of Hunan issued a notice to members instructing them to write the party into legal documents for private and state-owned companies alike. The document was accidentally made public when a local state-owned newspaper published it, but it was quickly taken down.Over the past year, the state-owned oil giant Sinopec has begun to ask its foreign joint venture partners to legally require \u201cparty-building work,\u201d according to one executive with direct knowledge of the requests who was not authorized to speak publicly. Party building is an amorphous term that can mean general recruiting and educating but can also refer to more direct, specific activity. The foreign executive told Sinopec that putting the party in the joint venture\u2019s legal documents would pose major problems for the head office overseas.Sinopec did not respond to several requests for comment.Dongfeng Motors, Cummins\u2019s partner and one of China\u2019s biggest carmakers, has long had strong Communist Party ties.Instructors at Communist Party schools have used Dongfeng\u2019s joint venture with Nissan as a model of how the party can be involved with business, according to the book \u201cThe Party\u201d by Richard McGregor. When the partnership was negotiated, Dongfeng insisted that the new company give the chief party representative a senior management role, with a salary and compensation for expenses.Today, Dongfeng\u2019s Communist Party committees are working to expand their influence further. In other Dongfeng joint ventures, committees have tried to make the party more relevant for employees by holding social events.In 2016, a group of employees from Dongfeng-Cummins traveled to the site of the Communist Party\u2019s first base, according to Dongfeng\u2019s website. On a rainy day, the group dressed in Red Army outfits, huddled together to hold a red flag with the hammer and sickle and smiled for the camera.Ailin Tang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "If There\u2019s a U.S.-China Trade War, China May Have Some \u2018Unconventional Weapons\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are ways to make life harder for American companies in China that need not be formal, or widely publicized.Until Thursday afternoon, there had been a reassuring sense of restrained, tit-for-tat reciprocity in the trade skirmish between the United States and China.That is doubly true in a potential trade war with China, for several reasons.Because the country exports far more in goods to the United States than it imports, China simply doesn\u2019t have as much room to keep up with escalating American tariffs, especially given the Chinese government\u2019s desire to cushion its citizens from higher prices for food staples.Moreover, China has in the past proved willing to use a wide range of government powers to achieve commercial objectives \u2014 from campaigns against out-of-favor companies in state media to selective, stepped-up regulatory enforcement. And if things really get nasty, the United States and China are financially intertwined in ways that China could seek to exploit \u2014 though not without creating risks for a country holding $1.2 trillion in United States Treasury bonds.\u201cOne of the very important tools that the Chinese have is the ability to make life difficult for a large number of American businesses,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University who studies Chinese economic relations. \u201cThey have all of these unconventional weapons that are not covered by traditional trading rules that could be potent weapons in actually fighting a trade war.\u201dThe details of what China might do are speculative. Thus far, China\u2019s government has reacted to new tariff actions by the Trump administration with relatively restrained words and promises of proportional responses to the American government\u2019s actions. The Americans put tariffs on steel and aluminum; China responds by taxing American pork. The Trump administration\u2019s plans to tax $50 billion worth of Chinese imports is met with threats by the Chinese to subject $50 billion worth of American products to the same. Those tariffs won\u2019t even go into effect until after a comment period, setting up a potentially long period of lobbying and negotiation that could rein in their scope or even delay them indefinitely.But just because matters have been calibrated thus far doesn\u2019t mean they will stay that way. American financial markets have been swinging wildly in recent weeks as investors revise their predictions for what might come next.In 2017, the United States imported $506 billion in goods from China while exporting only $131 billion in goods to China, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\u201cIt mathematically means that China can\u2019t match the U.S. dollar for dollar,\u201d said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.So, for example, if the Trump administration follows through on the president\u2019s suggestion to consider expanding the tariffs to cover $100 billion more of goods, it would strain the Chinese government to respond in a dollar-for-dollar manner.And that\u2019s before you account for the Chinese government\u2019s reluctance to put tariffs on goods that might carry some political or strategic cost.For example, in its planned retaliatory tariffs, the Chinese government included narrow-body aircraft but not wide-body aircraft. This makes sense strategically, Mr. Setser argued, because only two companies in the world make wide-body planes: Boeing and Airbus. If China put a tariff on planes from the American Boeing but not the European Airbus, it would lose leverage with Airbus with which to extract favorable prices and access to cutting-edge technology.China has already imposed tariffs on the easy stuff: luxury goods like American wine and liquor, and agricultural goods that are considered luxuries within China, like almonds and pistachios. It is unlikely there will be uprisings in the streets of Shanghai if Kentucky bourbon gets more expensive.But in the latest round, China has said it will raise tariffs on American soybeans. That is likely to cause President Trump political problems in farm states, but it also risks raising food costs within China. It\u2019s a fair bet, then, that China views remaining options as even more problematic for the prices of staple goods or the country\u2019s industrial strategy. In other words, for China the low-hanging fruit is gone. If this trade battle continues to escalate, China will have to bear a greater cost.That reality could push China to seek other buttons to press. And while there is no recent precedent of a trade war to draw from, the Chinese government\u2019s actions in other types of disputes offer a potential road map. For one thing, American companies do significant business in China that doesn\u2019t show up in trade data. When Apple assembles an iPhone in Zhengzhou and sells it in Shanghai, that doesn\u2019t count as international trade, though the profits accrue to the benefit of a California-based company. The Chinese government has any number of tools to try to weaken that business if it wishes. It could decide that phones made by a foreign company are a national security threat, or shut down plants because of minor regulatory problems.Making life difficult for American companies in China as retaliation in a trade war need not be formal and widely publicized. American automakers who make cars in China might find their local joint-venture partners squeezing them out. Regional governments might send safety inspectors to plants of American companies so often as to disrupt production.For years, American politicians have fretted about China\u2019s role as the United States\u2019 largest creditor; the nation has accumulated a huge stockpile of Treasury bonds over the last 20 years.Could China use its role as No. 1 lender to exert pressure in a trade war?It would be a risky maneuver, in which China itself would potentially have much to lose. But it can\u2019t be ruled out. If China were to suddenly unload some of its holdings, or even signal an intention to buy fewer dollar assets in the future, that would probably cause long-term interest rates in the United States to rise, at least temporarily. And this would cause some pain in the United States, as borrowing costs \u2014 whether for the federal government or individual home buyers \u2014 would rise.Even after all that, bond prices would most likely readjust over time as other buyers took advantage of the rise in interest rates. In the medium term, the performance of the United States economy and actions of the Federal Reserve do more to determine bond prices than the decisions of a single buyer or seller, even one as large as China.That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room to cause some near-term pain and disruption. \u201cThe Chinese have some leverage to rattle U.S. bond markets, even if the threat of substantive action is not very credible,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.Given that a trade war with such a major trading partner is without precedent in modern times, we don\u2019t really know what it would look like. But it\u2019s a safe bet that Chinese officials are already thinking through their options in case that is where the latest round of economic saber rattling ultimately leads.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in \u2026 Gibraltar", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate8 PhotosA SEASIDE VILLA IN GIBRALTAR$6 MILLION (4.2 MILLION BRITISH POUNDS)\u201cThe beauty of the house is its position: It\u2019s literally hanging off the side of the cliff,\u201d said Sammy Armstrong, director of Savills Gibraltar, which has the listing. \u201cStanding in the garden, all you can really see is sea.\u201dThe main floor has an open living-and-dining area, with glass doors across the back that lead to a stone terrace, heated swimming pool and hot tub. The kitchen is off the dining area, with Silestone counters and Miele appliances. All the furnishings, as well as several decorative chandeliers and the atmospheric lighting, are included in the asking price, Ms. Armstrong said.Three bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms are on the second floor. The master suite is on the top floor, where the views are the most spectacular. The suite includes a study, and a bathroom with a Duravit tub that has a whirlpool feature, a walk-in shower and mood lighting. Both the second and third floors have large balconies facing the sea.A wine cellar and two additional bedrooms and bathrooms are on the lower level, with skylights that bring in natural light, Ms. Armstrong said.The property sits among five other villas and nine townhouses, and is part of the first phase of Buena Vista Park Villas, a gated community still under development in the South District neighborhood. The area, which is almost completely residential, is the only one in Gibraltar with large villas, Ms. Armstrong said.MARKET OVERVIEWAnd Gibraltar, which is just 2.6 square miles, is currently undergoing a building boom, he said, as developers seek to meet pent-up housing demand created by the influx of foreign workers, many of whom favor the modern developments around the marinas of Ocean Village and Queensway Quay.Recently, Mr. Nicholls said, his sales team sold 105 apartments in just three weeks in a planned high-rise yet to be publicly marketed. Part of a complex called EuroCity, the building will start construction this summer, with prices ranging from around 167,000 pounds, or just under $240,000, for a studio to more than 1 million pounds, or about $1.4 million, for a penthouse.In the last five years, home prices have been steadily increasing, Ms. Armstrong said, after remaining flat during the global financial crisis of 2008. A new high-quality apartment sells for an average of about 5,500 to 6,000 pounds (or between $7,860 and $8,600) a square meter, compared to around 4,500 to 5,000 pounds (or about $6,400 to $7,100) five years ago, she said.The market for rentals is also very strong, Mr. Lugaro said: \u201cWe have a huge portfolio of people looking to rent, and there are no properties for them.\u201dWHO BUYS IN GIBRALTARAbout three-quarters of foreign buyers are British, Ms. Armstrong said. The rest are primarily European, although she said she has also worked with Israelis and Australians.While demand is driven in large part by imported labor, the strong rental market is also attracting foreign investors, \u201cwho come along and buy 20 apartments,\u201d she said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers, said Christina Wright, a lawyer in Gibraltar.The typical deposit is 2 percent of the purchase price. Buyers hire a lawyer to handle the transaction, at a fee of roughly 0.5 percent of the price.Stamp duty is charged on properties that sell for more than 200,000 pounds, or about $285,000, at a rate that ranges from 2 percent to 3.5 percent. But for first- and second-time buyers, Ms. Wright said, there is a waiver on the first 260,000 pounds, or about $370,000, of the sale price.Gibraltar has a leasehold structure on most of its properties. While some old buildings are freely owned, the government owns at least 90 percent of the land, Ms. Armstrong said, and leases to developers run for 149 years.WEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYEnglish; British pound (1 pound = $1.43)TAXES AND FEESProperty taxes on this home are about 2,500 pounds, or $3,574, annually, Ms. Armstrong said, and the ground-lease rent is an additional 290 pounds, or $415, a year. Annual homeowners\u2019 fees are 3,300 pounds, or $4,718.CONTACTslide showAdvertisement"}

Both women are daughters of Cho Yang-ho, the airline\u2019s chairman.In the \u201cnut rage\u201d incident, Cho Hyun-ah used abusive language, threw documents and even made flight attendants kneel and beg for forgiveness for serving the nuts without first asking her \u2014 and in an unopened package, rather than on a plate. Still not satisfied, Ms. Cho ordered the Korean Air plane back to its gate while it was taxiing at New York\u2019s Kennedy International Airport so she could have the chief flight attendant removed.During the furor in South Korea over the \u201cnut rage\u201d episode, Cho Hyun-min, then a Korean Air executive in charge of corporate communications, sent a Twitter message to her sister, vowing \u201crevenge\u201d against unspecified enemies of the family, according to investigators. She later apologized for what she called her \u201cimmature\u201d behavior.In the latest incident, Cho Hyun-min, who now oversees marketing at the airline, was accused in news reports of throwing a cup of water at an executive for an advertising company during a meeting last month. The incident was cited as an example of what South Koreans call \u201cgapjil\u201d \u2014 the abuse of underlings and subcontractors by executives who behave like feudal lords.On Friday, Korean Air officials declined to comment on the police investigation. But they said Ms. Cho had raised her voice after becoming displeased with answers she got from the advertising executive, and that she threw water on the floor, not at the man\u2019s face.Korean Air also released a copy of a text message it said Ms. Cho sent to the executive, apologizing for her behavior. The executive accepted her apology in a text message, vowing to work harder to produce a better advertising campaign for Korean Air, according to the company.\u201cI apologize with my head down for my foolish and reckless behavior,\u201d Ms. Cho wrote on her Facebook page on Thursday, after South Korean news media began reporting the episode.The police said their investigation was preliminary and that they would decide later whether the case merited a full-fledged investigation and criminal charges.Over the years, a handful of chaebol families have developed reputations for running their corporate empires like the military dictators who set the stage for their success in the decades after the Korean War.South Koreans covet jobs at chaebol companies, which are among the most lucrative in the country. But there is also deep resentment of the families who run the conglomerates, especially the children of the founding tycoons, who are widely considered greedy and arrogant.\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Cho Hyun-ah asked a fellow executive when the \u201cnut rage\u201d incident became an issue, according to prosecutors.Ms. Cho later apologized repeatedly for her misconduct, and her father was forced to fire her. She recently made a comeback, however, landing a management post at a Korean Air-owned hotel business.South Korea often brims with schadenfreude when a chaebol scion is publicly humiliated. This week, some visitors to the website of President Moon Jae-in\u2019s office demanded that Korean Air be barred from using \u201cKorean\u201d in its name.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is Your City\u2019s Twin?", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nLet\u2019s imagine that you\u2019re looking for a job and want to live in a city similar to your hometown.You don\u2019t have to guess. One reliable measure of how similar two cities are is their job mix, which reflects both local advantages and history (coal, a port, great universities) and local demand (a young population that needs teachers, or an older population that needs nurses).On a 100-point scale, where zero would mean completely non-overlapping distributions of job postings and 100 would be identical ones, the similarity between Dallas and Atlanta is 85. Often, the highest-similarity pairings are nearby or even in the same state: Miami and Orlando; Los Angeles and San Diego; Columbus and Cincinnati; and New York and Boston.Midsize and smaller metros, though, tend to look more like their neighbors. Contrast San Francisco with, say, Rochester. The three places most similar to Rochester are Syracuse, Buffalo and Albany, all in upstate New York. Granted, there are more nearby cities in the dense Northeast than in the more sparsely settled West, but the general pattern still holds. For the largest metro areas, the most similar counterparts are 403 miles away, on average, compared with 176 miles for smaller ones.Some metros show up often as being similar to others. Kansas City, Mo., for instance, comes closest to being not just the Albuquerque of the Midwest, but also the Cape Coral of the Midwest, the Fresno of the Midwest, the New Haven of the Midwest, and more. Its mix of job postings looks most like the United States over all, with relatively few job titles either over-represented or under-represented.After Kansas City, the places most like the nation over all are Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago and St. Louis.In contrast, San Jose, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., are the large metro areas that look least like the United States over all. They all stand out for particular industries: tech in the Bay Area, and government in Washington. One thing that many large metros with an unusual job mix have in common is a higher cost of living. In the most expensive places, some jobs get priced out: It may not be worth it to put a back office or call center in Manhattan or San Francisco if it can as easily go somewhere cheaper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rent Control Campaign in California Is Taken to the Streets", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 How do you get a landlord to endorse a proposal to limit rent increases?Yong Her, a 39-year-old bookkeeper, was one of 40 or so organizers who considered the question on a recent afternoon. The group had gathered in a conference room here to discuss strategies for getting people of various backgrounds, incomes and occupations to sign a petition to put a rent-control measure before Sacramento\u2019s voters.It was one small scene in what is shaping up as an epic battle on the state and city levels to combat California\u2019s affordable-housing crisis. Pitting a rising tenants rights\u2019 movement against apartment owners, the fight will consume tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of organizing effort and political advertising before the November election.If the Sacramento initiative were to make the ballot and ultimately pass, rent increases would be capped at 5 percent a year. That kind of law is a fairly easy sell in higher-density apartment complexes where everyone is a renter. But organizers need 50,000 signatures for the measure to be certified. That means they have to comb the city in search of registered voters willing to sign \u2014 and they aren\u2019t going to reach their goal, let alone pass the law, unless they persuade homeowners and small landlords to join together with tenants.So before organizers like Ms. Her left that evening to go door to door with bags full of pens and petitions, they watched while their colleagues play-acted some scenarios. The hardest one was getting a landlord to sign. The man playing the landlord was skeptical (\u201cStop right there \u2014 I\u2019m a landlord\u201d). The man playing the organizer was gentle and persistent (\u201cIt\u2019s just to put it up for a vote\u201d).The room took a few minutes to review the performance and suggest improvements. (One person recommended telling landlords that the proposed law could save them money by creating a board to rule on rent disputes, keeping them out of small-claims court.) Then Ms. Her and another organizer, Marie Camacho, left to do the real thing.A short drive later, they were in a sprawling neighborhood of single-family homes with long and winding streets. It seemed an unproductive place to go knocking, but Ms. Her was not intimidated.\u201cIt\u2019s very doable,\u201d she said.In California, where one in five people lives in poverty once rent is figured in, lawmakers have offered a flurry of bills to streamline building regulations, expand tenant protections and put more money toward subsidized housing. For many tenants, those efforts are not nearly enough. Up and down the state, activists and renters\u2019 groups are using California\u2019s tradition of citizen government to put voter initiatives on the ballot.As a result, this year\u2019s rent-control drives are more ambitious, in county seats like Sacramento, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and Santa Ana; big Los Angeles suburbs like Pasadena, Glendale, Inglewood and Long Beach; and the San Diego suburb of National City.Some organizers are so confident that they are willing to try do-overs. The Santa Rosa City Council passed a rent-control measure in 2016, prompting a landlord-backed proposal that repealed the measure in a special election last year. Now, after the fires that destroyed thousands of homes across Santa Rosa and surrounding Sonoma County last year, organizers are getting ready to collect signatures for an initiative to put rent control back in place.\u201cPeople are already supportive of rent control, and even more so after the fire,\u201d said Davin Cardenas, a director at the North Bay Organizing Project. \u201cThe need has not gone away, so we feel like we have a very good chance of winning.\u201d\u201cIt will be a full-scale campaign and probably one of the most dominant ones on the airwaves,\u201d said Steve Maviglio, a longtime political consultant who is now working with the California Apartment Association, a landlords\u2019 group.State-level initiatives usually come down to money. With California\u2019s 40 million people spread across two megaregions along with dozens of small cities and a wide expanse of rural areas, election campaigns are TV-centric and almost presidential in scope.\u201cThis is the defining issue for California right now,\u201d said Jim Ross, a political consultant for the Coalition for Affordable Housing, which is pushing for the Costa-Hawkins repeal and at this point is almost entirely financed by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. \u201cEveryone in California has a story about rental housing \u2014 it\u2019s the thing that pulls us together.\u201dCertainly everyone has an opinion. On the recent evening in Sacramento, as Ms. Her and Ms. Camacho went door to door, pretty much everyone who answered seemed to agree that California had a dire housing problem and that something needed to be done.Jessica Repa was the first person to sign Ms. Her\u2019s petition. Ms. Repa, 43, who is at home raising two children, used to live in San Francisco and grew accustomed to the security of rent control.While she didn\u2019t commit to supporting the initiative if it qualifies for the ballot, she said, \u201cI agree that it needs to be something people consider as a solution.\u201dLater in the evening, Ms. Camacho stopped by the home of Tony Rittell, a 75-year-old retired computer programmer. He listened politely but didn\u2019t sign.\u201cThere is definitely an issue in California,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure rent control is the way to go. I mean, they\u2019ve had rent control in San Francisco for how many years?\u201dHe added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem. They need to build more units.\u201dToward the end of the evening, after a few miles of walking, Ms. Her came across a landlord \u2014 the scenario that her colleagues had practiced. He was Gustavo Casillas, 62, a retired landscaper who also owned rental property. But Ms. Her did not have to do much persuading to get him to sign. Mr. Casillas picked up the pen without hesitation.Why would a landlord sign a proposal for rent control? \u201cWe haven\u2019t raised the rents in years because we want to keep them there,\u201d he said of his tenants. \u201cI don\u2019t care for homelessness, especially with veterans. I think more should be done about that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their concerns are closer to home.\u201cFacebook has got to start treating influencers with more respect,\u201d said Roozy Lee, a social media promoter who manages a network of celebrity and influencer Facebook pages with more than 200 million combined followers. \u201cThese people need to make a living.\u201dChief among influencers\u2019 complaints: Even though Facebook has made it easy for them to reach enormous audiences, it has been slow to deliver tools that would let them share in the advertising revenue their posts generate. Facebook has also cracked down on certain types of link-sharing deals that many influencers have used to earn money on the side.Fidji Simo, a vice president of product at Facebook, said the creator community is \u201cincredibly important\u201d to the company. \u201cWe\u2019ve been listening closely to them to better understand what more we can do to help them achieve their goals and develop their presence on Facebook,\u201d she said.Until recently, Facebook influencers mostly kept their complaints to themselves out of fear of angering the company. But as Facebook flails in the public eye over its data and privacy issues, some power users are seizing on a moment of vulnerability to push for change.Facebook appears to be listening. In recent weeks, the company has invited groups of influencers to meetings at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. Topics discussed at the meetings included improving reach for creators, branded content policies and better lines of communication with company leadership, according to a person with knowledge of the meetings, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were confidential.Arguments about monetization, as the practice of letting creators share directly in advertising proceeds is called, are as old as the system itself. YouTube, which opened a revenue-sharing program more than a decade ago, has long been accused by angry creators of demonetizing videos for arbitrary and inscrutable reasons.Those complaints gave rise to violence last week, when Nasim Najafi Aghdam, a YouTube creator who had been angered by the platform\u2019s revenue-sharing policies, shot and injured three employees at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., and then killed herself.But some of these features are still not widely available, and many influencers say that Facebook\u2019s charm campaign amounts to too little, too late.Mr. Hamilton, he of the hot-pepper thong video, said, \u201cI did 1.8 billion views last year. I made no money from Facebook. Not even a dollar.\u201d\u201cI understand where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d said Mr. Shaba. \u201cFacebook was turning into a viral media dumpster, and they wanted to eliminate that. Still, I\u2019d still prefer that over seeing a million wedding pictures.\u201d\u201cA good video can be the catalyst for a meaningful connection,\u201d Mr. Lax said. \u201cThink of a good Facebook video like a Mother\u2019s Day card. It doesn\u2019t stop someone from sharing her feelings with her mom \u2014 it gives her a jumping-off point.\u201dWhile waiting for Facebook to invite them into a revenue-sharing program, some influencers struck deals with viral publishers such as Diply and LittleThings, which paid the creators to share links on their pages. Those publishers paid top influencers around $500 per link, often with multiple links being posted per day, according to a person who reached such deals.\u201cPeople are saying that their feeds are getting stale, and they\u2019re missing the diversity of content they felt they had selected,\u201d Gretchen Tibbits, the president of LittleThings, told me. \u201cPeople carefully curated their feeds, and Facebook took that away.\u201dMs. Simo, the Facebook executive, said in a statement that \u201cour branded content policies prohibit Pages and Profiles from accepting payment to share content they did not have a hand in creating, since the spirit behind branded content is to have a collaboration between brands and creators to produce content.\u201dIn Facebook\u2019s defense, it\u2019s hard to feel entirely sympathetic for the people who built huge followings with videos like \u201cSweater Pill Hacks\u201d and \u201cTinder Girl Gets High Off Fake Weed,\u201d only to have them pushed out of sight. Facebook is attempting to clean up its platform, and some creators did clutter the site with clickbait and spammy links. But all of this jockeying raises a larger question about how well Facebook truly knows its users, and how much it can steer their media preferences without veering into paternalism.Right now, the social network is working to improve what Mr. Zuckerberg has called the \u201clong-term well-being\u201d of its users. But what if what many Facebook users really want \u2014 as measured by their clicks and eyeballs \u2014 are prank videos, D.I.Y. hacks, and sensational headlines?Mr. Shaba, the co-founder of The Pun Guys, said that he had been trying to produce more high-quality content that would have a better chance of getting boosted by Facebook\u2019s algorithms. But he said that he hadn\u2019t yet cracked the code.\u201cOur fans are messaging us being like, \u2018You guys don\u2019t post videos anymore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Shaba said. \u201cWe have.

The unemployment rate hasn\u2019t budged since October, but remains at its lowest level since 2000.\u201cThe fundamentals still remain solid,\u201d said Dan North, chief economist for Euler Hermes North America.The slowdown in March wasn\u2019t a surprise. February\u2019s job growth was probably inflated by a surge in hiring in construction and the retail sector that reflected unseasonably warm weather in much of the country. Both sectors slumped in March as winter storms blew through the eastern United States.\u201cWe\u2019ve had such unsustainably strong results in January and February that it was largely expected that we were due for some payback,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley. \u201cThe weak number in headline payrolls does not change the fact that trend job growth is strong.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a standoff, almost, on wages,\u201d said Jason Guggisberg, a vice president at the staffing firm Adecco. \u201cWho\u2019s going to go first?\u201d\u201cWhether trade tensions and threats come to fruition or not, even if there\u2019s not follow-through, the lingering uncertainty and the market volatility that it creates will start to permeate business decisions and household decisions,\u201d Ms. Zentner said. Already, she said, there are signs that upper-income households are becoming less confident, a sentiment that could affect consumer spending.The market reaction to Friday\u2019s report was more muted. The uptick in wages was sufficient to suggest that the job market remains healthy, but probably not big enough to force the Federal Reserve to reconsider its policy of gradual rate increases, said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics for Bank of America.Mr. Powell\u2019s prepared remarks made no mention of the looming threat of a trade war with China. But Ms. Meyer said the added uncertainty surrounding trade could tend to make policymakers more cautious.\u201cThe risks have increased given some of the headlines around trade,\u201d Ms. Meyer said.Perhaps the biggest surprise in the blockbuster report for February was the surge of workers into the labor force. That flood of new workers partly reversed in March, when the labor force shrank by 158,000 people. Beyond such monthly gyrations, however, the labor force has been growing gradually, an impressive feat given the ongoing retirement of the baby-boom generation.\u201cI\u2019ve had more conversations about retirees in the last month than I have in the last year,\u201d said Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup, a staffing firm. \u201cThat\u2019s an ideal population because they\u2019re still highly skilled and they\u2019re experienced.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They said he had told the committee that he was responding to popular demand that he seek another term.Within hours of announcing his intention to run, the president traveled to London to attend a meeting of Commonwealth leaders. His office did not give a date for his return, leading to renewed rumors in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, that Mr. Buhari would once again be receiving medical attention in London.Mr. Buhari enjoyed widespread support after winning the election in 2015, but it dissipated as Nigeria suffered through a recession in 2016 and 2017, and new attacks from Boko Haram, the Islamist rebel group.\u201cSecurity and the economy are the two main areas of disillusionment,\u201d said Sola Tayo, a fellow at Chatham House, a British foreign affairs think tank. \u201cWhilst the economy has picked up since the recession, the security situation appears to be deteriorating.\u201d\u201cThe herder-farmer conflict, rural banditry and the increase in kidnapping are being discussed more openly and government performance being judged more critically,\u201d she said.It was predictable that Mr. Buhari would run again, said Ayisha Osori, a Nigerian author, lawyer and political activist.

{"Headline": "China Is Set to Take a Hard Line on Trump\u2019s Trade Demands", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Staking an assertive negotiating stance, China says it will refuse to discuss President Trump\u2019s two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks.The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America\u2019s $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing\u2019s $300 billion plan to bankroll the country\u2019s industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft.The reason: Beijing feels its economy has become big enough and resilient enough to stand up to the United States.A half-dozen senior Chinese officials and two dozen influential advisers laid out the Chinese government\u2019s position in detail during a three-day seminar that ended here late Monday morning. The officials and most of the advisers at the seminar gave an overview of China\u2019s economic policies, including an in-depth review of the country\u2019s trade policy, to make sure China\u2019s stance would be known overseas. All of the officials and most of the advisers at the seminar insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.It is not clear what will happen when the two sides sit down this week or whether either will find a reason to waver. Still, the Chinese and American positions are so far apart that China\u2019s leaders are skeptical the two sides can find common ground by the end of this week. They are already raising the possibility that Chinese officials may fly to Washington a month from now for further talks.\u201cI don\u2019t expect a comprehensive deal whatsoever,\u201d said Ruan Zongze, the executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, which is the policy research arm of China\u2019s Foreign Ministry. \u201cI think there is a lot of game playing here.\u201dBeijing is frustrated with Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to impose tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese goods and dismayed by suggestions in the West that China has a weak bargaining position. Chinese officials think the country\u2019s one-party political system and President Xi Jinping\u2019s enduring grip on power \u2014 particularly after the repeal of presidential term limits in March \u2014 mean that China can outlast the United States and Mr. Trump in any trade quarrel.The Chinese government believes Mr. Trump\u2019s background as a businessman means that at some point he will agree to a deal. Seminar participants also reaffirmed previous Chinese trade policy offers to further open the country\u2019s financial and automotive sectors, though not in ways that would impact China\u2019s industrial modernization program, called Made in China 2025. They also suggested that China would be willing to tighten its intellectual property rules so as to foster innovation within China as well as protect foreign technologies from counterfeiting and other illegal copying.China is insisting that the parameters of any negotiations be limited, and that the tariff threat be removed before a final deal can be struck.Chinese officials have reached out to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has reacted positively to China\u2019s overtures in the auto and financial sectors. Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who will be on the Trump administration\u2019s team in Beijing later this week, has sought to calm investors worried that the rhetoric between Washington and Beijing could break out into a full-blown trade war.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.China\u2019s position is that the bilateral trade imbalance arises from differences in savings rates. Households in China save roughly two-fifths of their income. Americans, on average, save almost nothing. So money from China tends to flow to the United States, buying factories, technology companies, real estate and more, and Americans in turn spend much of that money to buy goods from China. Many economists in the United States, including some at the Treasury, share that view.By contrast, many trade lawyers, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and Mr. Trump contend that the trade deficit stems to a large extent from unfair practices, including cheap loans by state-controlled banks to exporters.China is ready to discuss shrinking the $375 billion annual trade deficit. But it wants to do so by buying more high-tech American goods. Washington has long blocked such deals because of concerns that they may have military value. China is also willing to buy more oil, natural gas, coal and other goods from the United States, and to help finance the extra pipelines and other infrastructure that would be needed to move them to China.A senior Chinese government official said that Beijing is unwilling to negotiate with the United States on any curbs on Made in China 2025, which includes large-scale government assistance to favored industries in advanced-technology manufacturing. China perceives the American demands as an attempt to stop China\u2019s economic development and technological progress, the senior Chinese official said.Germany and other countries also have industrial policies, and the United States has not objected to them, he added. American and European officials have argued that those policies elsewhere are much narrower and less ambitious.Other advisers and officials said that the United States had misunderstood the Made in China 2025 industrial policy. They expressed hope that it might be possible to resolve differences by explaining the program better and making very small tweaks to it \u2014 a stance that still may not appease the Trump administration.The Chinese government is not simply throwing money, land and other resources to favored industries like robotics, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and aircraft manufacturing, they said. China is engaged instead, they contended, in a carefully thought-out program that measures potential profits for each dollar of investment. So China\u2019s program bears some resemblance, they said, to private sector investment programs in the West.One subject was repeatedly and conspicuously avoided by all officials throughout the seminar, even when advisers occasionally speculated about it: whether China might someday try to link trade disputes to national security issues.China has been deeply involved in international pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, an issue of high importance to the Trump administration. Beijing also wants to someday assert control of Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing regards as a renegade territory.Tsinghua University\u2019s new Academic Center for Chinese Economic Practice and Thinking organized the seminar, which was held at Tsinghua and two other venues in western Beijing. President Xi graduated from Tsinghua, which is in Beijing and is China\u2019s top university, and he has filled much of the senior ranks of his government with Tsinghua professors and graduates.In some respects, the hard stance struck by Chinese officials reflects a hardening of public attitudes in China.Washington officials cited ZTE\u2019s repeated violations of sanctions against Iran and North Korea, but many in China saw it as a reminder by the United States that sizable sectors of the Chinese economy still rely on American-made goods. Much of the Made in China 2025 policy is aimed at reducing that dependence.The ZTE case \u201chas changed a lot of Chinese people\u2019s opinion,\u201d said Mr. Ruan, of the China Institute of International Studies. \u201cIn the past, people saw us as interdependent.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Schwarzman, the Wall Street billionaire, was prepared to cut a $25 million check to the high school he attended here in the 1960s, to help it pay for a huge renovation project.He wanted only a few things in return.For starters, the public school should be renamed in his honor. A portrait of him should be displayed prominently in the building. Spaces at the school should be named for his twin brothers. He should have the right to review the project\u2019s contractors and to sign off on a new school logo.The school district\u2019s officials accepted the deal.So it was that this Philadelphia bedroom community of 55,000, not normally a hotbed of civic unrest, exploded into a populist fury.\u201cHelp me understand how you could make such a monumental decision without even asking?\u201d demanded Gwen Vance, a lung-transplant nurse who graduated from Abington in 1980.She was one of roughly 250 town residents who showed up at a standing-room-only school board meeting Tuesday night to vent about what felt a bit like a hostile Wall Street takeover of a local institution. The five-hour meeting, in an auditorium at the junior high school, ran well past midnight. There was shouting, name-calling and more than one demand for officials to resign.\u201cI just think there\u2019s too much influence about big money, Wall Street money, in our society,\u201d complained Robert Durham, who works at the local Chevrolet dealership and sent two sons through Abington Senior High School. He arrived at the meeting 45 minutes early, wearing dark pants and a bright green sweater.The school board president, Raymond McGarry, accepted responsibility. \u201cI was so focused on the positive aspects of this that, frankly, I was blinded,\u201d he said.Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s private equity firm, the Blackstone Group, who attended the meeting, insisted that Mr. Schwarzman was all right with his name not being on the school. \u201cThe naming was inconsequential,\u201d she said.Under the amended agreement, the Stephen A. Schwarzman Center for Science and Technology will feature plaques or photos of him. It is unclear if his portrait also will hang in the building.A decade has passed since the global financial crisis. The economy is growing; unemployment is low. But emotions are still running hot about the role that big banks and other Wall Street firms \u2014 and their millionaire and billionaire leaders \u2014 play in America. Yawning inequality has cemented the feeling that just about everything is available for purchase by the very, very rich.Mr. Schwarzman, with an estimated $12 billion fortune, is the embodiment of that caste. He has become a public supporter of President Trump. That helped him land a major international investment last year, but it also made him a polarizing figure in Abington, which voted more than 2-to-1 for Hillary Clinton in 2016.Naming-rights deals are common, but they increasingly risk provoking fierce reactions \u2014 sometimes leading to embarrassing retreats by the wealthy patrons and the recipients of their largess.Mr. Schwarzman has used his wealth to get his name attached to stuff near and far.Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s cash-for-naming-rights frenzy was underway as early as 2004, right here in Abington, when he donated $400,000 to the high school to build a new football stadium. It was named in his honor.During his youth, his family moved to Abington from downtown Philadelphia. Abington was known for its good schools, and his mother wanted a better education for her children.By this decade, the high school needed an upgrade. Its main building dated back to the 1950s. It lacked anything resembling cutting-edge computer or science facilities.Amy Sichel, the longtime Abington School Superintendent, started searching for a benefactor to help bankroll a renovation project that the school board estimated would cost roughly $100 million. Mr. Schwarzman, one of the school\u2019s most famous alumni, was an obvious target.During the ensuing months, Dr. Sichel, a former school psychologist who is one of the highest-paid superintendents in Pennsylvania, discussed her high school\u2019s needs with Mr. Schwarzman and his philanthropic team. He was especially interested in having the school embrace technology.By the following January, Mr. Schwarzman had committed $25 million to the renovation, which would feature improved science labs, a new laptop for each student and coding classes available to all.Mr. Schwarzman announced his donation at a gathering of 3,000 school superintendents in Nashville on Feb. 15. There was no mention that Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s name would be plastered all over the school.That was because that detail was still being discussed, said Dr. Sichel. So were other requirements contained in the original agreement, which was finalized on March 22 but never signed. The deal also stipulated that the renovated building should feature a portrait of Mr. Schwarzman that he commissioned and that his twin brothers, Mark and Warren Schwarzman, should have spaces named for them.\u201cControversy over the naming and process aside, the need and desire for the funds still exists, and Mr. Schwarzman is unwavering in his desire to help,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, the Blackstone spokeswoman.In a phone interview on Friday, Dr. Sichel said that given the size of the gift, she and the board \u201cwere sure that it would come with some kind of naming opportunity.\u201dShe said she was shocked by the visceral objections the name change inspired.The outcry, raised by the school board\u2019s ratification of the deal on March 27, started with social media posts. It culminated in angry emails to school officials and a petition to oppose the renaming.School board meetings in Abington are normally dull affairs that sometimes last less than 15 minutes. But the gathering on Tuesday immediately took on a circuslike atmosphere.Officials first gave an exhaustive presentation about the planned renovations. \u201cThis is a punishment!\u201d shouted a woman in the audience, filled with locals in pressed khakis or Eagles jerseys. One woman clicked away on knitting needles.The anger was not just about the school being renamed for Mr. Schwarzman. It was that the school board forged the deal in secret.David Brooks, who graduated from the high school in 2000, said the board was one of three things: \u201cbrazen,\u201d \u201csneaky\u201d or \u201cstupid.\u201d If the school\u2019s name could be auctioned for $25 million, he added, \u201cwhat else is for sale?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the date on which Stephen A. Schwarzman, while speaking to a gathering of school superintendents in Nashville, announced a donation to the high school he attended. It was Feb. 15, not Feb. 14.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Dirt Save the Earth?", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "FeatureAgriculture could pull carbon out of the air and into the soil \u2014 but it would mean a whole new way of thinking about how to tend the land.Supported byThe couple quickly settled into their bucolic new surroundings. Wick began fixing leaks in the barn. Rathmann loved watching the many animals, including ravens, deer and the occasional gopher, from the large porch. She even trained the resident towhees, small brown birds, to eat seed from her hand. So smitten were they with the wildlife, in fact, that they decided to return their ranch to a wilder state. For nearly a century, this had been dairy country, and the rounded, coastal hills were terraced from decades of grazing. Wick and Rathmann would often come home and find, to their annoyance, cows standing on their porch. The first step they took toward what they imagined would be a more pristine state was to revoke the access enjoyed by the rancher whose cows wandered their property.Within months of the herd\u2019s departure, the landscape began to change. Brush encroached on meadow. Dried-out, uneaten grass hindered new growth. A mysterious disease struck their oak trees. The land seemed to be losing its vitality. \u201cOur vision of wilderness was failing,\u201d Wick told me recently. \u201cOur na\u00efve idea was not working out so well.\u201dWick was especially bothered by the advance of a prickly, yellow-flowered invasive weed called the woolly distaff thistle. He pulled it, mowed it, doused it with herbicides. But the distaff kept moving into what had been pasture. He thought about renting goats to eat the weeds and brush, but they were too expensive. He even considered introducing wild elk, but the bureaucratic hurdles seemed too onerous.Then Wick and Rathmann met a rangeland ecologist named Jeff Creque. Instead of fighting against what you dislike, Creque suggested, focus on cultivating what you want. Squeeze out weeds by fostering conditions that favor grasses. Creque, who spent 25 years as an organic-pear-and-apple farmer in Northern California before earning a Ph.D. in rangeland ecology, also recommended that they bring back the cows. Grasslands and grazing animals, he pointed out, had evolved together. Unlike trees, grasses don\u2019t shed their leaves at the end of the growing season; they depend on animals for defoliation and the recycling of nutrients. The manure and urine from grazing animals fuels healthy growth. If done right, Creque said, grazing could be restorative.This view ran counter to a lot of conservationist thought, as well as a great deal of evidence. Grazing has been blamed for turning vast swaths of the world into deserts. But from Creque\u2019s perspective, how you graze makes all the difference. If the ruminants move like wild buffalo, in dense herds, never staying in one place for too long, the land benefits from the momentary disturbance. If you simply let them loose and then round them up a few months later \u2014 often called the \u201cColumbus method\u201d \u2014 your land is more likely to end up hard-packed and barren.Wick was persuaded. He began preparing for the cows\u2019 return. He dug wells for water, pounded in steel posts and strung nonbarbed wire. He even bought a molasses lick to supplement the animals\u2019 diet of dry thatch. He didn\u2019t want medicated livestock excreting drugs that might harm the worms and insects living in his soil \u2014 most cows are routinely dewormed \u2014 so he tracked down a herd of untreated cows and borrowed them for the summer of 2005.The cows beat back the encroaching brush. Within weeks of their arrival, new and different kinds of grass began sprouting. Shallow-rooted annuals, which die once they\u2019re chewed on, gave way to deep-rooted perennials, which can recover after moderate grazing. By summer\u2019s end, the cows, which had arrived shaggy and wild-eyed after a winter spent near the sea, were fat with shiny coats. When Wick returned the herd to its owner that fall, collectively it had gained about 50,000 pounds. Wick needed to take an extra trip with his trailer to cart the cows away. That struck him as remarkable. The land seemed richer than before, the grass lusher. Meadowlarks and other animals were more abundant. Where had that additional truckload of animal flesh come from?Creque had an answer for him. The carbohydrates that fattened the cows had come from the atmosphere, by way of the grass they ate. Grasses, he liked to say, were like straws sipping carbon from the air, bringing it back to earth. Creque\u2019s quiet observation stuck with Wick and Rathmann. It clearly illustrated a concept that Creque had repeatedly tried to explain to them: Carbon, the building block of life, was constantly flowing from atmosphere to plants into animals and then back into the atmosphere. And it hinted at something that Wick and Rathmann had yet to consider: Plants could be deliberately used to pull carbon out of the sky.Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, agricultural practices and animal husbandry have released an estimated 135 gigatons \u2014 135 billion metric tons \u2014 of carbon into the atmosphere, according to Rattan Lal, a soil scientist at Ohio State University. Even at current rates, that\u2019s more than a decade\u2019s worth of carbon dioxide emissions from all human sources. The world is warming not only because fossil fuels are being burned, but also because soils, forests and wetlands are being ravaged.In recent years, some scientists have begun to ask whether we can put some of that carbon back into the soil and into living ecosystems, like grasslands and forests. This notion, known as carbon farming, has gained traction as it becomes clear that simply reducing emissions will not sufficiently limit global warming. According to the 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an authority on climate science that operates under the auspices of the United Nations, humankind also needs to remove some of the carbon already in the atmosphere to avoid, say, the collapse of polar glaciers and the inundation of coastal cities worldwide. \u201cWe can\u2019t just reduce emissions,\u201d Keith Paustian, a soil scientist at Colorado State University and an author of an earlier I.P.C.C. report, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s all hands on deck. Things like soil and land use \u2014 everything is important.\u201dSome of the proposed methods to begin this drawdown include scrubbing the air with great air-conditioner-like machines; fertilizing the oceans with iron dust to prompt algal blooms that, when they die, carry captured carbon to the bottom of the sea; capturing and storing the carbon dioxide that results when energy is produced by burning trees and other plants that removed carbon from the atmosphere during their growth; and crushing and spreading certain types of rock, like basalt, that naturally absorb atmospheric carbon. None of these approaches are yet proved or affordable at the scale needed to make a difference. The most obvious hurdle is the additional energy some of them require, which, unless it comes from a free, renewable source, adds more costs.Plants, however, remove carbon from the atmosphere already, require no additional power and grow essentially free. During photosynthesis they harness the sun\u2019s energy to make sugars by combining hydrogen atoms (acquired from water molecules) with carbon atoms (from carbon dioxide), while emitting oxygen as a byproduct. (Lest we forget, the fossil fuels that now power civilization contain carbon removed from the air during photosynthesis millions of years ago.) Every spring, as the Northern Hemisphere greens, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dips, before rising again the following fall and winter as foliage dies. Some scientists describe this fluctuation as the earth breathing.Nearly all the carbon that enters the biosphere is captured during photosynthesis, and as it moves through life\u2019s web, every organism takes a cut for its own energy needs, releasing carbon dioxide as exhaust. This circular voyage is the short-term carbon cycle. Carbon farming seeks to interfere with this cycle, slowing the release of carbon back into the atmosphere. The practice is often conceptualized and discussed in terms of storing carbon, but really the idea is to change the flow of carbon so that, for a time at least, the carbon leaving a given ecosystem is less than the carbon entering it.Dozens of land-management practices are thought to achieve this feat. Planting or restoring forests, for one: Trees lock up carbon in woody material. Another is adding biochar, a charcoal made from heated organic material, directly to soil. Or restoring certain wetlands that have an immense capacity to hold carbon. (Coal beds are the fossilized remains of ancient marshes and peatlands.)More than one-third of earth\u2019s ice-free surface is devoted to agriculture, meaning that much of it is already managed intensively. Carbon farming\u2019s fundamental conceit is that if we change how we treat this land, we could turn huge areas of the earth\u2019s surface into a carbon sponge. Instead of relying solely on technology to remove greenhouse gases from the air, we could harness an ancient and natural process, photosynthesis, to pump carbon into what\u2019s called the pedosphere, the thin skin of living soil at the earth\u2019s surface. If adopted widely enough, such practices could, in theory, begin to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, nudging us toward a less perilous climate trajectory than our current one.In a 2016 paper, Pete Smith, a soil scientist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, and the influential climate scientist James Hansen argued that land-management practices are one of the few affordable options available today for drawing down carbon. \u201cWhat\u2019s surprising to me is that we\u2019ve not done it sooner,\u201d says Smith, who is also a lead author on a recent U.N. report that explores carbon-dioxide-removal technologies. \u201cThis has the potential to make a huge difference.\u201d Otherwise, Hansen told me, we\u2019re leaving the problem to our grandchildren. \u201cThat assumption that somehow young people, and people later this century, are going to figure out how to suck it out of the air \u2014 that\u2019s a pretty big burden to place on them,\u201d he said.The I.P.C.C. is preparing a special report on climate change and land use, to be finalized in 2019, that will consider in greater detail the potential of sequestering carbon in soil. But for now the biggest international effort to promote carbon farming is a French-led initiative called \u201cfour per 1,000.\u201d The proposal aims to increase the amount of carbon in the soil of crop- and rangelands by 0.4 percent per year through a variety of agricultural and forestry practices. These include agroforestry (growing trees and crops together increases carbon retention), no-till agriculture (plowing causes erosion and carbon loss) and keeping farmland covered (bare dirt bleeds carbon). Doing so, the French argue, could completely halt the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide.Few experts I spoke to think the impact would be quite that grand; Pete Smith, for example, estimates that soil could, at the most, store just 13 percent of annual carbon-dioxide emissions at current levels. \u201cI appreciate that everyone wants to save the planet,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut we shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves that this is all we need to do.\u201d Even so, the four-per-1,000 goal highlights how a relatively small annual increase in soil carbon could, on a large-enough scale, have a substantial impact. Increasing soil carbon could yield other benefits, too: Improvements in soil fertility, water retention and greater crop resilience would help agriculture adapt to a warming world. More soil carbon would also reduce the amount of fertilizer needed, decreasing emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, a byproduct of excess nitrogen fertilization. It would be profoundly appropriate if agriculture, whose modern practices have themselves contributed to climate change, could become part of its solution. Farming, responsible for the birth of civilization, could now help save it.Silver was skeptical that she could measure what was likely to amount to very small changes in his land\u2019s soil carbon. The endeavor seemed akin to looking for cups of water added to a swimming pool. But she did sketch out a way to arrive at a definitive answer. When Wick offered to underwrite such a study, she warned him that he might not like the results. She wasn\u2019t just going to tell him what he wanted to hear. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I had to work with her,\u201d Wick recalls.Silver agreed to the project, which she began that year. Seeking baseline values for the carbon concentrations in the soil, she and her students collected samples from different rangelands in Marin and Sonoma Counties. The samples with the most carbon, it turned out, came from current and former dairy farms. What distinguished these operations, she learned, was that they often sprayed manure onto their pastures; this was done both to fertilize the land and dispose of waste. Apparently, how soil was treated could very much affect its carbon content \u2014 a surprise. The larger implication was that people could potentially \u201cgrow\u201d soil carbon deliberately.But how quickly could they do so? Silver found an answer, in part, by looking for nuclear fallout. In the mid-20th century, radioactive carbon isotopes were spewed into the atmosphere as a result of aboveground nuclear tests. Plants around the world absorbed those isotopes during photosynthesis, effectively turning them into a time stamp. Wherever that carbon shows up, it must have arrived there relatively recently. On dairy farms, Silver found the isotopes a full three feet below the surface. This was another surprise. Conventional wisdom holds that it takes perhaps hundreds of years for carbon-rich topsoil to accumulate. On these dairy farms, however, atmospheric carbon had pushed deep into the earth in a matter of decades.Wick wanted to know if he could deliberately replicate this process on his ranch \u2014 but without manure, which, as it decomposes, can release potent greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. The former traps about 30 times as much heat as carbon dioxide, the latter 300 times as much. As a carbon-farming tool, manure might be self-defeating.Jeff Creque, a onetime organic farmer, had a suggestion: Why not use compost? Compost can contain manure, but whereas manure alone can release nitrogen as nitrous oxide, the nitrogen in compost becomes locked up in complex molecules. At least in theory, that limits the escape of a powerful greenhouse gas. In 2008, Wick, Silver and Creque spread several semi trucks full of the stuff, purchased from a composting plant near Sacramento, onto Wick\u2019s ranch and on another ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. In total, it amounted to about half an inch spread over three acres.After three years, Wick was disappointed to discover that grazing on its own wasn\u2019t leading to carbon sequestration. In fact, the soil lost carbon in untreated control plots. No one knows precisely why, but grasslands throughout California are bleeding carbon. European settlers introduced shallow-rooted annual grasses to the state, which partly displaced deeper-rooted perennial grasses. So carbon put into the ground long ago by deep-rooted grasses may now be seeping out. That\u2019s what made the treated plots so remarkable. They had the same history and were exposed to the same conditions, but instead of losing carbon, they absorbed it \u2014 at a rate equivalent to nearly 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide per acre per year. That\u2019s roughly equal to your car\u2019s emissions if you drove from Miami to Seattle.Silver had thought that the compost would simply break down, releasing its carbon back into the atmosphere or, worse, produce nitrous oxide. But those emissions never occurred; moreover, judging by its chemical signature, most of the carbon moving into the soil came from the air, not the compost. The compost appeared to help the plants draw more carbon from the atmosphere than they otherwise would have.When it comes to mitigating climate change, soil scientists are most interested in what Silver calls occluded carbon \u2014 organic material, often in the form of dead microbes, trapped in clods of dirt. This type of carbon can potentially stay locked away for centuries. (Another carbon type, called labile carbon, continuously cycles among the atmosphere, plants and organisms in the soil.) It was precisely this more durable carbon, Silver discovered, that increased in the treated plots.Her findings corresponded with a shift in recent decades in scientists\u2019 understanding of how soil carbon forms. Previously they emphasized how dead organic material had to physically work its way into the soil. But the newer model stressed the importance of living plants. Their rootlets are constantly dying, depositing carbon underground, where it\u2019s less likely to go airborne. And perhaps more important, as plants pull carbon from the air, their roots inject some of it into the soil, feeding microorganisms and fungi called mycorrhiza. An estimated 12,000 miles of hyphae, or fungal filaments, are found beneath every square meter of healthy soil. Some researchers refer to this tangled, living matrix as the \u201cworld wood web.\u201d Living plants increase soil carbon by directly nourishing soil ecosystems.In the years that followed, Silver\u2019s analyses of soil cores indicated that the treated land kept taking in carbon. Computer simulations suggest that it will continue to do so for decades. It also retained more moisture and grew about 50 percent more grass. One dose of compost ignited what Silver calls a state change: The plants and the soil \u2014 and everything that inhabited it \u2014 moved toward a new equilibrium in which the soil ecosystem pulled in and retained greater amounts of carbon.Silver began publishing her findings in scientific journals in 2010. Her second paper, written with her postdoc Marcia DeLonge and the graduate student Rebecca Ryals, offered a remarkable bit of extrapolation. California has about 56 million acres of rangeland, the single largest type of land use in the state. If compost made with manure was applied to just 5 percent of that area, they calculated, it would offset emissions from about 80 percent of the state\u2019s agricultural sector \u2014 all the cows raised, crops grown, fertilizer applied and tractors driven in California. Much of that offset came from diverting manure from festering lagoons \u2014 where it releases methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere \u2014 into compost, a one-time benefit. But the ongoing drawdown of carbon dioxide from enhanced grass growth could be important, too. If you treated 41 percent of the state\u2019s rangeland, Silver told me, carbon pumped into the earth by photosynthesis might render the entire agricultural sector of the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy carbon-neutral for years to come.Farmers\u2019 obsession with soil health isn\u2019t new, of course. It has been a preoccupation for ages. But modern, conventional agriculture has largely relied on synthetic fertilizer to compensate for losses in natural fertility. And while fertilizers help plants grow, some evidence suggests that they can, in excess, accelerate the loss of carbon from the soil. An influx of nutrients may feed precisely those microbes that release carbon back into the atmosphere. Plants may also excrete less carbon into the earth when bathed in synthetic fertilizers, causing the ancient relationship among plant roots, soil fungi and microbes \u2014 the symbiosis that increases soil carbon \u2014 to fray.In recent years, the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service, which was founded in response to the Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s, has promoted the fostering of soil carbon as an important farming practice. But one of the more remarkable aspects of the regenerative-agriculture movement is that it has been driven largely by farmers themselves. Its proponents fret over soil carbon not necessarily because the N.R.C.S. tells them to, or because they worry about the planet\u2019s fate. They have discovered that doing so can help their bottom line.Darin Williams is one such farmer. He lives near Waverly, Kan., with his wife, Nancy, in a tidy, gray-painted house with a stone chimney. A life-size plastic deer sits on his front lawn, run through with arrows; he uses it for target practice to sharpen his hunting skills. He\u2019s a big man with a baby face and a mischievous squint. When he drove me around his farm last October in his red \u201cone-tonner\u201d pickup truck, he talked incessantly about soil.For nearly 20 years, Williams worked as a contractor, building houses in Kansas City. But work dried up after the financial crisis hit in 2007. Williams decided to return to the family farm near Waverly, an area of gently rolling plains, and give farming a try. His family had farmed some when he was a teenager before leasing the land to tenants for years, and he knew it was difficult to make ends meet. But he was inspired by an article about a North Dakota rancher and farmer named Gabe Brown, who claimed to have developed, through trial and error, a more efficient and cost-effective way to farm.The gist of Brown\u2019s argument was that if you focus on the health of the soil and not on yield, eventually you come out ahead, not necessarily because you grow more corn or wheat per acre but because the reduction in spending on fertilizer and other inputs lets you produce each bushel of grain more cheaply. Williams decided to follow Brown\u2019s prescription. \u201cIf after three years, I\u2019m bankrupt, I\u2019ll admit it was a bad joke,\u201d Williams remembers thinking.Seven years later, his gamble seems to have paid off. He started with 60 acres, now farms about 2,000 and, when I visited last fall, had just purchased an additional 200. In one of his fields, we walked down a lane he had mowed through his warm-weather cover crops \u2014 plants grown not to be harvested, but to enrich the soil \u2014 which towered over us, reaching perhaps eight feet. They included sorghum, a canelike grass with red-tinted tassels spilling from the tops, mung beans and green-topped daikon radishes low to the ground. Each plant was meant to benefit the earth in a different way. The long radishes broke it up and drew nutrients toward the surface; tall grasses like sorghum produced numerous fine rootlets, adding organic material to the land; legumes harbored bacteria that put nitrogen into the soil. His 120-strong herd of British white cattle \u2014 he introduced livestock in 2013 \u2014 would eventually eat through the field, turning the plants into cow patties and enriching the soil further. Then he would plant his cash crops. \u201cHad I not found this way to farm,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe would not be farming.\u201dA mat of dead vegetation \u2014 from cover crops, cash-crop residue and dung \u2014 covered Williams\u2019s fields. The mulch, along with his cover crops, inhibited weeds from becoming established, a major concern for conventional farmers, because so many weeds have evolved resistance to herbicides. \u201cI don\u2019t lie awake at night wondering how I\u2019m going to kill weeds,\u201d Williams said.Williams doesn\u2019t till his fields. By minimizing soil disturbance, no-till farming prevents erosion, helps retain moisture and leaves the soil ecosystem \u2014 worms, fungi, roots and more \u2014 mostly intact. At one of his soybean fields, Williams showed me how this translated to soil with \u201cstructure.\u201d \u201cSee how that crumbles into a cottage-cheese look?\u201d he said, massaging a fistful of earth. Small clods fell through his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want.\u201d Worm holes riddled the dirt, giving it a spongelike quality that was critical, he said, for absorbing rain and preventing runoff. Weather patterns seemed to be changing, he noted. Rain used to arrive in numerous light storms. Now fewer storms came, but they were more intense. \u201cWe have to be able to capture rain and store it,\u201d he said.By focusing on soil health, Williams says he has reduced his use of herbicides by 75 percent and fertilizers by 45 percent. He doesn\u2019t use pesticides \u2014 he relies instead on beneficial insects for pest control \u2014 and he saves money by not buying expensive genetically modified, herbicide-resistant seed. He estimates that he produces a bushel of soybeans for about 20 percent less than his conventionally farming neighbors. Last fall, he claims, his yields ranked among the highest in the county. While doing all this, he has so far raised the amount of soil organic matter, a rough predictor of soil carbon concentrations, from around 2 percent to 3.5 percent in some fields. Gabe Brown, for his part, says he has more than tripled his soil carbon since the 1990s. And an official with the U.S.D.A.\u2019s Agricultural Research Service confirmed to me that the amount of carbon in Brown\u2019s soil \u2014 what his farming has pulled from the atmosphere \u2014 was between two and three times as high as it was in his neighbors\u2019 land.The successes of Brown and Williams suggest that farmers can increase carbon in the soil while actually reducing their overall expenses. This could be vital, because in order for carbon farming to have an impact on the climate, as much land as possible, including both crop- and rangeland, will have to be included in the effort.Critics of regenerative agriculture say that it can\u2019t be adopted broadly and intensively enough to matter \u2014 or that if it can, the prices of commodities might be affected unfavorably. Mark Bradford, a professor of soils and ecosystem ecology at Yale, questions what he sees as a quasi-religious belief in the benefits of soil carbon. The recommendation makes sense intuitively, he told me. But the extent to which carbon increases crop yield hasn\u2019t been quantified, making it somewhat \u201cfaith-based.\u201dWilliam Schlesinger, an emeritus soil scientist at Duke, points out that \u201cregenerative\u201d practices might inadvertently cause emissions to rise elsewhere. If you stop tilling to increase soil carbon, for example, but use more herbicides because you have more weeds, then you probably haven\u2019t changed your overall emissions profile, he says. He thinks the climate-mitigation potential of carbon farming has been greatly oversold.Williams has reduced his herbicide use, not increased it, but Schlesinger\u2019s broader point \u2014 about the need for a careful overall accounting of greenhouse gases \u2014 is important. Williams, Brown and others like them aren\u2019t focused on climate change; no one really knows if the carbon they put in the ground more than offsets the methane produced by their cows, for example. What they do demonstrate is that augmenting soil carbon while farming is not only possible, but also beneficial, even in a business sense. And that makes the prospect of rolling out these practices on a larger scale much easier to imagine.In the absence of federal leadership on climate \u2014 and as emissions continue to rise globally, shrinking the time available to forestall worst-case outcomes \u2014 state and local governments (as well as nonprofits) have begun to look into carbon farming. Last year, Hawaii passed legislation meant to keep it aligned with the Paris agreement, which President Trump has said he will abandon; the state has also created a task force to research carbon farming. The New York state assemblywoman Didi Barrett introduced legislation that would make tax credits available to farmers who increase soil carbon, presumably through methods like those employed by Darin Williams and Gabe Brown. A bill to educate farmers about soil has been proposed in Massachusetts. And in Maryland, legislation focused on soil health passed in 2017. Other carbon-farming projects are in the works in Colorado, Arizona and Montana.But it is California, already in the vanguard on climate-mitigation efforts, that has led the way on carbon farming. By 2050, the state aims to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 20 percent of what they were in 1990. Nearly half its 58 counties have farmers and ranchers at various stages of developing and implementing carbon-farming plans. San Francisco, which already has the largest urban composting program in the country, hopes to become a model carbon-farming metropolis. Cities don\u2019t have much room to plant trees or undertake other practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere, says Deborah Raphael, the director of San Francisco\u2019s Department of the Environment. But they can certainly produce plenty of compost. \u201cIf we can show other cities how doable it is to get green waste out of landfills, we can prove the concept,\u201d Raphael told me. \u201cWe like to say that San Francisco rehearses the future.\u201dMany of California\u2019s carbon-farming efforts owe a debt to Wick, Creque and Silver. In 2008, they founded the Marin Carbon Project, a consortium of ranchers, scientists and land managers. The goal is to develop science-based carbon-farming practices and to help establish the incentives needed to encourage California farmers to adopt them. Silver continues to publish her findings in respected journals. Creque also started a nonprofit, the Carbon Cycle Institute, that assists farmers and ranchers in making carbon-farming plans.Wick has thrown himself into the policy realm, hiring a lobbyist in Sacramento to push a carbon-farming agenda. (In 2014, he even testified before Congress, outlining the project\u2019s discoveries and explaining how compost could increase soil carbon on public lands. He deliberately mentioned \u201cclimate\u201d only once.) Educating policymakers matters because, as Torri Estrada, executive director of the Carbon Cycle Institute, points out, carbon-mitigation efforts that focus on agriculture can be much cheaper per ton of carbon avoided than the flashier energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects that usually get most of the attention. The major obstacle to their implementation, he says, is that government officials don\u2019t understand or know about them.California\u2019s Healthy Soils Initiative, which Wick helped shape, explicitly enlists agriculture in the fight against climate change. In principle, that means this carbon farmers can receive money from the state\u2019s climate-mitigation funds not just for compost but also for 34 other soil-improving practices already approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. That\u2019s important because the compost needed to cover just a few acres can cost thousands of dollars. Wick has also tried to tap federal funding. Once N.R.C.S. scientists vet Silver\u2019s work, a compost amendment could become the service\u2019s 35th recommendation. As a result, farm bill money, which farmers receive to subsidize food production, could help finance carbon farming done according to Wick\u2019s protocol \u2014 not to fight climate change explicitly (which is now seen as politicized), but to bolster the health of soil (which isn\u2019t).As a carbon-farming tool, compost bears some notable advantages \u2014 namely, it works both preventively and correctively. Composting prevents emissions from the starter material \u2014 manure, food scraps \u2014 that, if allowed to decompose, might emit potent greenhouse gases. (About one-fifth of United States methane emissions comes from food and other organic material decomposing in dumps.) By enhancing plant growth, it also aids in removing carbon from the atmosphere, a corrective process. And because the carbon in nearly all organic material was originally pulled from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, compost that enters the soil represents the storage of carbon removed from the air earlier \u2014 the grass eaten by cows that became manure, or the trees that became wood chips \u2014 and at a different location. That, too, is corrective.Calla Rose Ostrander, Wick\u2019s right-hand person at the Marin Carbon Project, told me that the project\u2019s greater goal is to completely reframe how we think about waste, to see it as more than a nuisance \u2014 to recognize it as a resource, a tool that can help us garden our way out of the climate problem. Before the modern era, farmers had no choice but to return human and animal waste to the fields. (Wick is looking into the possibility of composting human waste as well; the end product is called humanure.) In a sense, Wick and Ostrander seek to resurrect these ancient practices and, with the aid of modern science, to close the loop among livestock, plants, air and soil \u2014 and between cities and the agricultural land that feeds them.But the group also has critics. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical of their results and their claims,\u201d William Horwath, a soil scientist at the University of California, Davis, told me. He wants to see Silver\u2019s experiments replicated. This is the project\u2019s major weakness: Its big idea is based almost entirely on extrapolation from a few acres in California. At this point, it\u2019s impossible to say whether compost can cause land to become a carbon sponge in all climates and conditions, and for how long treated grassland will continue to take in and retain its carbon.Cows, a flash point in any discussion about climate change, may also present problems. Ruminants burp methane, and while carbon farming does not require their presence, some argue that merely accepting them on the land undermines the goal of reaching a carbon-neutral or -negative future. Livestock emissions account for almost half the heat-trapping gases associated with agriculture, so an obvious way to reduce emissions is to decrease the number of cows on the planet. Instead of dumping compost on rangeland, says Ian Monroe, a lecturer on energy and climate at Stanford University, why not allow forests cleared for pasture to regrow, and change people\u2019s eating habits so they include less meat?Criticism is directed at compost too. The stuff requires energy to produce; huge machines are required to shred the material and keep it aerated. And it\u2019s unclear if compost, like synthetic fertilizer, can cause nitrogen pollution when put on the land, or how much greenhouse gas composting itself generates. (As long as compost mounds are regularly aerated to prevent low-oxygen conditions, composting is thought to produce few emissions.)Organic material from municipal sources can contain bits of plastic and glass, which no one wants on their fields. Manure might carry seeds of invasive plants. (Silver has seen no evidence of this.) Spreading compost on public rangeland could disrupt plant communities, squeezing out species adapted to conditions of scarcity. And in any carbon-farming scheme, who will monitor and verify that far-flung stretches of land are really absorbing and storing the carbon as they\u2019re supposed to?Horwath considers the amount of compost used in Silver\u2019s research \u2014 about 10 times the usual application, he estimates \u2014 to be unrealistically high for practical use. \u201cIt seems an inordinately large amount to apply to any system,\u201d he told me. And given what he sees as the many unknowns in Silver\u2019s research, that compost would be put to better use on cropland where, he says, scientists know with greater certainty that it could improve water retention and the efficiency of fertilizer.Then there\u2019s the problem of supply. Demand for San Francisco\u2019s compost, which mostly goes to vineyards in California\u2019s wine country, already outstrips what\u2019s available. But Wick thinks more starter material shouldn\u2019t be hard to find: Americans throw out between 30 and 40 percent of all the food they buy, sending it to landfills where it rots and generates greenhouse gases. Silver has calculated that there\u2019s enough organic waste material in California to treat one-quarter of its rangeland every few decades.Still, given the energy requirements, the logistical headaches and the cost, skeptics question whether spreading compost across extensive portions of the world\u2019s surface \u2014 including conflict zones in the Sahel or Central Asia \u2014 is really feasible. Even if it is, soils probably can\u2019t soak up carbon indefinitely. If they have a saturation point, increases in carbon will eventually stop when that moment is reached. And because soil degradation can cause the release of whatever carbon it holds, treated lands would have to be well cared for in perpetuity.Down the road, he showed me a composting facility that Creque dreamed up initially. He and Wick hoped it would serve as a self-sustaining prototype. \u201cAnything that has ever been alive can be composted,\u201d he told me, surveying the 10-foot-tall piles of chicken droppings and feathers, horse bedding (manure and straw) and shredded trees. A tractor mixed woody refuse with animal waste \u2014 to get the composting process started requires the right mix of carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. (That\u2019s why some backyard composters recommend urinating on the pile to kick things off: Urine is rich in nitrogen.)Across the lot, a hulking machine straddled rows of steaming black compost, turning them with a metal spinner. Compost has to be regularly \u201cfluffed,\u201d or aerated, Wick explained, to prevent anaerobic microbes from producing methane and nitrous oxide. The manure piles were acrid, but the compost itself had a rich and pleasant odor, like cigars.Wick hopes that facilities like this will someday dot the American agricultural landscape. The idea is to manufacture compost close to both its source material and the place where it will be used, obviating the emissions from carting heavy materials over long distances. The plant also embodied Wick\u2019s contention that composting can help farm carbon and manage waste at the same time. The challenge of affordably creating millions of tons of compost and applying it to great expanses of land is formidable. But there is a pleasing symmetry to the idea that we could use waste to bring the excess carbon in the atmosphere back to Earth, all while making the world lusher and more bountiful.When I first got in touch with Wick, in late 2016, he greeted me with a question: \u201cDo you know how the earth\u2019s atmosphere was oxygenated?\u201d He was referring to a period 2.3 billion years ago when oxygen, produced by photosynthetic organisms, began building up in the atmosphere, prompting a mass extinction and clearing the way for multicellular life (and, eventually, humans).\u201cCyanobacteria?\u201d I guessed.\u201cVery good,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might work.\u201d Evidently I had passed some sort of scientific literacy test. But his bigger point was that living things \u2014 and particularly photosynthetic life \u2014 had always been the great engineers of the planet\u2019s climate. Now, he believed, we could use that fact to our advantage.That sort of cosmic thinking about the planet and its history is ultimately what makes Wick\u2019s vision so compelling and potentially powerful. The essential insight is one often overlooked when we talk about climate change: The element that threatens to smother civilization is also, in different forms, the fundamental building block of life. To prevent carbon from causing misery and destruction, perhaps we just need to change its location. Perhaps we can find a way to pull it from the air and restore it to the earth.Advertisement"}

Bernstein. \u201cStrategically, if you\u2019re the U.S. and you\u2019re trying to plan industrial policy, this deal makes sense.\u201dMobile carriers in China have already announced bold plans to roll out 5G networks, and the creation of a new American wireless giant would be unlikely to affect them. China Mobile, which has nearly 900 million wireless customers, is aiming to begin large-scale 5G trials in several Chinese cities this year.Other Chinese companies are still vulnerable to American pressure, though. In particular, the United States government has placed restrictions on one giant Chinese supplier of the equipment that will make those new networks possible, and is investigating another.Serious disruption to either company\u2019s business could mean a boon for their main rivals in telecommunications equipment, Nokia of Finland and Ericsson of Sweden.It could also put SoftBank in an awkward position.\u201cSoftBank has been working with ZTE in Japan, but now they have to try to find other partners,\u201d said Tsutsumu Ishikawa, an independent expert in Tokyo who covers the mobile industry.\u201cIf the administration for whatever reason doesn\u2019t want Chinese suppliers of network equipment in Japan, either \u2014 and it\u2019s possible \u2014 then I\u2019m sure Masa would be willing to compromise,\u201d Mr. Lane said, using Mr. Son\u2019s nickname. \u201cI think he\u2019s quite pragmatic.\u201dA SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment.As much promise as 5G seems to hold for tomorrow\u2019s economy, it is not clear that technologies such as driverless cars will have matured by the time the new mobile networks are ready. That means carriers in the United States and China may be racing to build infrastructure more quickly than the technology that would make best use of it is developing.At a recent Huawei summit meeting in the company\u2019s home city, Shenzhen, executives sounded eager to tame sky-high hopes for 5G, describing the technology as an evolution and not a revolution.\u201cWe do have expectations for 5G, but the expectations are not as great as everyone imagines,\u201d said Eric Xu, Huawei\u2019s deputy chairman. \u201cBecause we have implemented 4G very well, we don\u2019t see many clear applications that can only be supported with 5G.\u201dDoubts about the technology\u2019s near-term usefulness are also why telecom carriers outside China and the United States, as well as other notable exceptions like Japan and South Korea, are moving toward the 5G age more cautiously.\u201cA lot of people are genuinely struggling to figure out, \u2018What is the business case for 5G?\u2019\u201d said Ramakrishna Maruvada, a telecom analyst in Singapore with Daiwa Capital Markets. \u201cMost operators do not think faster consumer broadband is a good enough reason to be pursuing a huge leap in technology.\u201dCade Metz contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Strong Economy Won\u2019t Make You Popular These Days", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sharma is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.With Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron visiting Donald Trump this week, much of the commentary has focused on how wildly different the staid German chancellor and the globally minded French president are from the mercurial American president. But the three do share one trait: They are all unpopular at home despite the good economic times.This is new. For most of the postwar era, voters in the big democracies rewarded leaders for strong economies and punished them for policies that hurt growth. Now the link between good politics and good economics seems to have broken.Last year, the global economy was finally accelerating out of the long torpor that followed the financial crisis of 2008. Unemployment hit lows not seen in decades, and inflation all but disappeared. Yet by January, my index of approval ratings for leaders in 20 major democracies showed their average rating hitting a new low of just 35 percent, down from a peak of more than 50 percent a decade ago.The same decline has bedeviled Mr. Macron and other decidedly mainstream leaders like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Shinzo Abe, prime minister of Japan. Yet none of these leaders comes close to matching President Trump for outrageousness. All three are seen as economic reformers who have produced relatively strong results, yet they all have approval ratings around 40 percent, just as bad as Mr. Trump\u2019s.All politics is local, and maybe all of these leaders are suffering setbacks owing to domestic political issues. But that would be quite a coincidence. Something else seems to be at work.Perhaps the most persuasive explanation is the rise of angry populism, built on a rejection of the established order and a growing focus on issues of culture and national identity, rather than practical economic outcomes.In the past populism tended to rise in bad times and ebb in good ones, so you might have expected it to recede as the global recovery increased employment and wages over the past 18 months. But economic factors may no longer matter as much in a bitterly emotional political age, and leader approval ratings have continued to fall.The changing nature and control of the news also helps to explain an even more unexpected disconnect between political and economic reality: the rare leaders who remain popular despite a faltering economy. In my index, which uses only polls independent of government control, there are just two \u2014 both elected autocrats.These trends are worrying. Good economics should remain good politics. Democracies work best when voters hold politicians accountable for economic results. If leaders sense that the economy no longer matters, they are free to push any policy that will energize their base \u2014 which may explain Mr. Trump\u2019s recent nationalist threats against China and populist threats against big companies, both potentially bad economic policies.And then there is this worrisome thought: If leaders embrace aggressively populist and nationalistic policies in good times, what will happen when the economy takes a turn for the worse?Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Catalans, a Day of Books, Roses and, of Course, Politics", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince medieval times Catalans have celebrated the feast of their patron, Sant Jordi, or Saint George, on April 23, which happens to coincide with the deaths of both William Shakespeare and Miguel de Cervantes.Almost a century ago, business-savvy publishers turned it into a book-selling event. Men traditionally offer women roses, and women buy them books in return \u2014 though these days women also receive books to ensure gender equality. All through Barcelona and other Catalan cities, bookstands are erected side-by-side with flower stalls.\u201cOf course Sant Jordi is always a great feast, but it\u2019s also true that this Sant Jordi isn\u2019t like all others, and that we now have people who are in prison instead of being out on the streets, enjoying this with us,\u201d Ms. Colau said.She also lamented the fact that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019s government was still administering direct rule over Catalonia.Not everyone was pleased to listen to her.\u201cCatalan society is divided, so Sant Jordi should never be the day to talk politics and divide people even more,\u201d said \u00c1lex S\u00e0lmon, the editor of the Catalan edition of El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper.The book stall was selling copies of nine different books opposed to independence.\u201cSeparatism has infiltrated and tried to destroy every aspect of life in Catalonia, even sadly Sant Jordi,\u201d said Albert Boadella, a playwright who is the unofficial \u201cpresident\u201d of Tabarnia, as his supporters lined up to have their photo taken with him.A short distance away, the mood at another stall run by one of the main pro-independence associations was more somber. People gathered there were writing letters into scrapbooks that will be sent to the jailed politicians.\u201cWe and those of Tabarnia can each have our own space, with no need to talk to each other,\u201d said Xavier Vidal, while he supervised the letter-writing session. \u201cSant Jordi is a very special celebration of Catalan culture, but every day is important to reach our goal of independence.\u201dThe feast is also an opportunity for readers to meet their writers. Established authors organize book-signings, while debut writers aim for the release of their work to coincide with Sant Jordi to jump-start sales.Some acclaimed novelists have recently published books about the history and politics of Catalonia, like Eduardo Mendoza, who was born in Barcelona but now mostly lives in London.\u201cI wanted to put my own ideas in order, as well as clarify things for others,\u201d Mr. Mendoza said. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading and hearing things about the Catalonia of 2018 in terms of oppression and Franco, when all of that is so clearly in the past.\u201dAt another stall, Toni Alb\u00e0, an actor and theater director, took a different view about the legacy of Franco\u2019s dictatorship, while he signed copies of his own book, based on extracts from Hamlet and titled, \u201cTo Be or Not to Be Catalan.\u201dMr. Alb\u00e0 was recently indicted on a charge of publishing insults on Twitter, including words directed at a Spanish judge who sent Catalan politicians to prison. \u201cI was a child under Franco, so I sadly know all about censorship in Spain,\u201d he said.About 1.5 million books are sold during Sant Jordi in Barcelona, yielding around 20 million euros ($24 million) in revenues, which represents a significant portion of the annual income of publishers, particularly smaller ones who specialize in books written in the Catalan language.Sant Jordi is also essential for the flower economy, even if the roses start to sell at a discount as the day nears its end.\u201cYou can end up walking away with a bunch of cheap flowers, while the books are thankfully more stable,\u201d joked Claudio L\u00f3pez Lamadrid, the editorial director of the Spanish subsidiary of Penguin Random House. \u201cIf people then read them, great, but at least they buy them.\u201dOf course, this year some of the roses were yellow rather than red. \u201cI wanted a yellow rose to make clear that it\u2019s not normal to have people in prison because of their ideas,\u201d said Txema Escorsa, a teacher.Mar\u00eda Navarrete Cano said she wrote her book \u201cFrom Catalonia with Love\u201d because she was frustrated that her relatives in the southern region of Andalusia couldn\u2019t come to terms with her support for independence, since part of the family emigrated to Catalonia from Andalusia in the 1950s.\u201cI really care for my family in Andalusia and I\u2019m not against anybody who is Spanish \u2014 so I really want them to understand that this is only about being against a Spanish government that\u2019s been hurting Catalans,\u201d she said.His work denounces the mistakes of secessionism, and has already sold 10,000 copies since being published last month, in both Catalan and Castilian Spanish.\u201cOf course many people feel exhausted by our political situation, but it doesn\u2019t mean they can ignore it altogether \u2014 whether they like it or not and even on Sant Jordi,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But if Republicans pull it out \u2013 that is, if they lose the popular vote by a small enough margin that gerrymandering and the geographic concentration of nonwhite voters frustrate the public\u2019s will \u2013 it will be the result of tribalism. It won\u2019t be because the G.O.P. won voters over with a tax cut.That\u2019s not what they expected. The people who rammed through a massive tax cut without hearings or analysis thought they could sell it to voters as free money for everyone; never mind the big bucks for corporations and the wealthy, look at the extra cash we\u2019re putting in your pocket.Voters are, of course, right to have negative views about TCJA. It\u2019s a mess of a bill; it will do little for economic growth, while increased deficits will create pressure to cut social insurance programs that affect many more people than the relative handful of wealthy stockholders who will win big. But voters should have been negative about the Bush tax cut too. Why do voters seem so much more woke? Why is this time different?Another answer might be that the Bush tax cut was pushed through in a very different fiscal environment. Readers of a certain age may recall that when Bush ran in 2000, the U.S. actually had a budget surplus \u2013 which he claimed simply to be giving back to voters. But during the Obama years voters were subjected to constant scare talk about deficits and debt \u2013 some from centrist scolds, some from the very Republicans who rammed through their tax cut. This may have made voters more aware of the downside to big tax cuts for the rich, even if they got a bit themselves.Finally, many people \u2013 rightly \u2013 don\u2019t trust anything associated with Trump. Now, Bush officials were systematically deceptive in everything they said about tax policy (and much else); but Bush didn\u2019t tweet out four or five blatant lies every day, and it took both the Iraq debacle and Katrina to finally wake up voters and the media to the Bush administration\u2019s relatively subtle although deep dishonesty.Anyway, whatever the reason, the tax cut is looking like the political loser it deserves to be.

{"Headline": "Is Trump Serious About Trade War? China\u2019s Leaders Hunt for Answers", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In an elegantly furnished back room at a conference in eastern China in December, a member of the Chinese leadership asked American tech executives for help.He has not been alone.In these meetings, the Americans have warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints should be taken seriously because of widespread frustration in Washington with Chinese policies, especially a $300 billion program to dominate critical high-tech industries, known as Made in China 2025, that has alarmed the United States national security establishment.It is unclear whether that message is making it through to Mr. Xi \u2014 or whether he has chosen to ignore it after concluding that Mr. Trump is bluffing and that the United States will back off, as it has in the past.\u201cWhen you have this kind of regime, you want to report the good story,\u201d said Tao Jingzhou, a managing partner at the global law firm Dechert who deals with senior Chinese officials. \u201cI have the impression the leadership is not fully briefed about the seriousness of the atmosphere against China in the U.S. establishment.\u201dDespite this deep bench of expertise, the Chinese leadership appears at a loss, grasping for interlocutors in an American political landscape that has been scrambled by Mr. Trump. For more than two decades, Beijing has watched corporate America make the case for trade with China and one American president after another embrace that agenda. But Mr. Trump has defied that pattern.\u201cChinese experts do not understand the current state of the United States,\u201d said Jie Zhao, a professor at the China Executive Leadership Academy Pudong, which trains senior civil servants in Shanghai. \u201cThey do not understand Trump, do not understand his team and do not understand the source of his policies.\u201dPart of the problem is that the leadership\u2019s usual contacts in the United States \u2014 often establishment figures with backgrounds in international finance and diplomacy \u2014 have been largely sidelined by Mr. Trump.\u201cThe people with whom Chinese officials are familiar in Washington are mainly the enemies of Trump,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cTrump hates those people.\u201dLooking for answers, Vice President Wang has met instead in recent weeks with three former Treasury secretaries \u2014 Timothy Geithner, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Lawrence H. Summers \u2014 as well as Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative, and William S. Cohen, the former defense secretary.Business leaders who have met with Chinese leaders in the same period include Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs.\u201cThey ask, \u2018Who can we talk to?\u2019\u201d said David M. Lampton, the scholar who has recently hosted five Chinese officials. \u201cThey don\u2019t see a stable structure.\u201dBut Professor Lampton, of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, added that despite their frustration, the Chinese seemed satisfied that they can \u201coutlast a U.S. administration that alienates its allies, erodes its own political base and has a public with a low threshold for pain.\u201dThere are vague hints of disagreement in Beijing over how to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade threats. Some in the elite have emphasized the potential impact of a trade war on the Chinese economy and urged negotiations, while others have argued that the dispute is part of a broader effort to thwart China\u2019s rise \u2014 and that Beijing must respond accordingly.\u201cOn the trade war issue, the hawkish atmosphere in China is quite strong right now,\u201d said Chen Jieren, a political commentator in Beijing.Although the tariffs that Mr. Trump has enacted thus far hit only a small segment of China\u2019s steel and aluminum sector, the pain of a proposed additional set would be spread across manufacturers of more than 1,300 goods.Given the party\u2019s tight control of the media, there has been no outcry against Mr. Xi\u2019s policies like that by some American business leaders against Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. It helps that no single sector or region in China stands out as especially vulnerable, though the aerospace industry could be stung and Chinese automakers eyeing exports to the United States would be disrupted.But speaking at the conference, Fan Gang, the director of China\u2019s National Economic Research Institute, warned of \u201csystematic risk\u201d to manufacturing supply chains. And Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, suggested that a trade war could destroy 10 million jobs.One sensitive question in Beijing is the fate of the Made in China 2025 plan, which has been the focus of the Trump administration\u2019s complaints. The program would provide subsidies and loans to help Chinese firms acquire foreign competitors, develop advanced technologies and dominate key sectors such as alternative energy, robotics, telecom and artificial intelligence.The military and security apparatus, and the industries close to them, regard the program as essential to China\u2019s strategic ambitions. But discerning the attitude of China\u2019s economic policymakers is more difficult, and not simply because it would be politically taboo to back away from a plan that Mr. Xi has blessed.Premier Li Keqiang, for example, has tended to take more conciliatory positions in trade disputes than colleagues in the leadership who favor asserting China\u2019s clout as a global power. But Mr. Li also leads a cluster of government ministers who are the main architects and advocates of the Made in China 2025 program.They include Miao Wei, the minister of industry and information technology, and Wang Zhigang, the minister of science and technology. Like Mr. Li, both grew up in central China\u2019s impoverished Anhui Province and favor an extensive role for the state in upgrading Chinese industries, acquaintances said.On the other hand, the policymakers closest to Mr. Xi \u2014 men with finance backgrounds including Mr. Liu and Vice President Wang \u2014 are more interested in seeking geopolitical parity with the United States and less enthusiastic about industrial policy in general.They worry that state intervention may distort markets and exacerbate the problems of China\u2019s already debt-laden financial system, people who know them said.Yet such concerns have not translated into a willingness to retreat on the Made in China 2025 program in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats. \u201cI don\u2019t think China is willing to compromise Made in China 2025,\u201d said Da Wei, a professor at the University of International Relations in Beijing. \u201cThis is the core of the competition.\u201dMr. Xi has charted a moderate course so far, retaliating in equal measure when the Trump administration has imposed tariffs, while urging that the dispute be resolved through negotiation.But talks have stalled since Chinese officials rejected American demands that Made in China 2025 be rolled back. A Chinese spokesman said on Thursday that no actual trade negotiations were underway.Reporting was contributed by Jonathan Ansfield, Javier C.

{"Headline": "For Scott Pruitt, a Spotlight Shines on His Ethics, Not His E.P.A. Rollbacks", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It should have been Scott Pruitt\u2019s finest moment. Mr. Pruitt\u2019s proposal is designed to unravel a signature piece of Mr. Obama\u2019s environmental legacy, hand a victory to the American automakers and please his boss, President Trump. But instead of basking in glory, Mr. Pruitt is caught up in a swirl of allegations of impropriety \u2014 most recently centered on the fact that last year he rented a room in Washington from the wife of a prominent lobbyist.Mr. Pruitt unveiled his rollback in a hastily announced presentation at E.P.A. headquarters after canceling a plan to speak at a suburban Virginia auto dealership, a more public setting that might have exposed him to questions about the lease arrangement, or about his first-class air travel at taxpayer expense over the past year, for which he has also faced criticism. Mr. Pruitt declined to field questions at the event.Late Monday, Mr. Trump phoned Mr. Pruitt to reassure him that his job was safe. \u201cKeep your head up, keep fighting, we got your back,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Pruitt, according to an administration official. Then on Tuesday morning, John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, called Mr. Pruitt to reaffirm the president\u2019s sentiment, the official said.Despite the president\u2019s encouraging language in the call, the depth of Mr. Trump\u2019s support can be difficult to gauge. He dislikes direct confrontation and has been known to pivot from chummy chatter with an associate, in private, to an abrupt firing.On Tuesday morning, Senate Democrats sent a letter to the E.P.A.\u2019s inspector general asking him to open an investigation into Mr. Pruitt\u2019s housing arrangements in 2017.An E.P.A. spokesman on Tuesday said the lease arrangement was consistent with federal ethics regulations.Mr. Curbelo is a co-chairman of the House Climate Solutions Caucus, a bipartisan group that has called for efforts to address global warming.The E.P.A. spokesman said that Mr. Pruitt had not been aware that the personnel actions had not been submitted to the Presidential Personnel Office and had directed them to be submitted for review. The spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, also said that the agency had \u201cclear authority\u201d to make staff appointments.Mr. Trump has sought to build a legacy of rolling back regulations on American industry, and Mr. Pruitt has proved to be one of his most effective lieutenants. In his first year on the job, Mr. Pruitt initiated the rollbacks of more than two dozen major environmental rules. The proposed rollback on vehicle mileage and emissions standards that he announced Tuesday is arguably the largest of those. Last year, soon after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the nation\u2019s biggest automakers asked the president to loosen an Obama-era rule that would have forced automakers to build cars that achieve an average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, nearly doubling their mileage while also reducing a major source of greenhouse gas pollution.At Mr. Trump\u2019s request, Mr. Pruitt declared the auto regulation too onerous on industry and filed a legal document to reconsider it with the expectation of filing a new, weaker rule later this year.Late Monday, the dealership said the event had been canceled. Instead, the Tuesday morning event was held at the E.P.A. headquarters, attended by a handful of auto industry lobbyists. The E.P.A. invited only a small handful of reporters to attend.Afterward, when asked about the ethics questions facing his tenure, Mr. Pruitt turned and left the room, flanked by members of his security detail.Some Republicans believe the E.P.A. chief\u2019s efforts to roll back regulations will keep him in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces. \u201cSo far, his reforms are estimated to save taxpayers over $1 billion in deregulatory savings,\u201d Senator James M. Inhofe, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s fellow Oklahoma Republican, a senior member of the Senate environment committee and a longtime supporter of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s, wrote in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019s been an effective member of the president\u2019s team and I look forward to continuing to work with him to restore the E.P.A. to its proper size and scope,\u201d Mr. Inhofe wrote.Conservative supporters said they believed it would take more than the apartment and travel scrutiny to bring down Mr. Pruitt. Myron Ebell, who led the Trump administration\u2019s E.P.A. transition team, said he thought that as long as Mr. Pruitt pursued Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda his job would be safe.Mr. Trump is \u201cgiving us a number of surprises, and one surprise could be that he stands by Pruitt,\u201d Mr. Ebell said.Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Lisa Friedman contributed reporting from Washington, and Hiroko Tabuchi from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Finds California Wine Pairs Well With a Trade War", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "Retaliatory tariffs are a blow to exporters increasingly catering to young, newly wealthy Chinese looking for bottles with cachet.Supported byCabernet isn\u2019t the most obvious pawn in a trade war between the United States and China. Airplanes and their parts are the leading American export to China. Soybeans and wheat grow in Trump country.But China\u2019s selection of wine as a target of retaliatory tariffs did not surprise Michael Honig, a winemaker in the Napa Valley, where the tariff would hit hardest.\u201cThe reason the government realizes they should penalize us is, we are branded,\u201d said Mr. Honig, the president of Honig Vineyard and Winery. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to go after a wheat grower, because who is a wheat grower? It\u2019s a commodity. We are not a commodity.\u201dThe news was an unwelcome turn of events for Mr. Honig and many California winemakers, who have spent years trying to carve out a place in the hearts of wealthy Chinese consumers. That hard work has earned them a prized sliver of what is becoming one of the fastest-growing markets for wine imports.China\u2019s imports of American wine reached $82 million last year \u2014 not including bottles entering duty-free through Hong Kong \u2014 a sevenfold increase in the last decade. But growing visibility may have turned Napa wine into easy prey.\u201cWine is something people can relate to,\u201d said Jim Boyce, who has been covering the industry from Beijing for a decade on his blog, the Grape Wall of China. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting a tariff on Chinese dumplings. It\u2019s something you can feel on an emotional and personal level.\u201dIt is that group, one or two levels below China\u2019s ultrarich, that holds huge potential for California vintners. Those consumers are far more numerous than 1-percenters. And more crucially, they\u2019re the ones driving the recent blossoming of a wine culture in China in which bottles are actually consumed rather than simply traded among elites as trophies.Mr. Honig and his business partner and wife, Stephanie, have spent a decade wooing that clientele, making a trip a year to China to pitch sommeliers in top restaurants and hotels. He has recently expanded beyond the obvious stops in Beijing and Shanghai, visiting cities like Guangzhou, in southern China.\u201cThere are people who want to spend the most, but there are also aspirational buyers,\u201d Mr. Honig said. \u201cYou may want to buy the Rolls-Royce, but you can afford the Mercedes.\u201d And that\u2019s his sweet spot.His most popular cabernet goes for around $25 a bottle wholesale, and he sends more than 500 cases of it every year to a plucky Shanghai importing business started by two brothers with dual citizenship. With existing tariffs and value-added taxes mixed in, the total charge tacked on to California wine was already close to 50 percent. After the importer factors in shipping, takes its cut and passes the bottles to a hotel or retail store, which takes its cut, the Napa red ends up selling for the equivalent of around $100.An extra 15 percent charge would be brutal. \u201cNo one wants to overpay,\u201d Mr. Honig said. \u201cIf all they\u2019re looking at is two different bottles side by side, and we are competing with Australia and Chile, that\u2019s a big competitive disadvantage.\u201dChilean and New Zealand wines face no Chinese levies, thanks to free-trade agreements. Australian bottles will enter the country tariff-free next year.Larry Yang, an importer in Shanghai, said his customers liked California wines, but not enough to ignore an even higher price tag. The wine isn\u2019t cheap as it is, he said, and if it gets pricier, he will look elsewhere.\u201cThere are so many countries producing fine wine,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to buy relatively expensive California wine. I could choose from New Zealand, Australia, Chile and South Africa.\u201dAnd Chinese drinkers have a growing array of homegrown brands to choose from. Expert winemakers have spent years harvesting cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc varietals at the foothills of the Helan Mountains in Ningxia, a region that borders Inner Mongolia. They have started winning international awards, even beating out French favorites.Then the government began protecting its domestic players.Sophisticated wine shops have sprouted up across Shanghai, the online retailer Alibaba now runs a yearly wine sale, and other sites will deliver cases to people\u2019s doors within two days. In August, China got its first master sommelier, a distinction reserved for people who can pass a rigorous series of tests, including verbal and tasting exams.It wasn\u2019t like this when David Pearson made his first business trip to Beijing 15 years ago, intent on selling Chinese customers on his super-premium Napa wine Opus One. The rich drank French Bordeaux if they drank wine at all. He had to make the case for his California winery, a joint venture between Robert Mondavi and Baron Philippe de Rothschild.He found a natural audience.\u201cPeople will buy symbols of luxury \u2014 watches, cars, expensive bottles of wine \u2014 to demonstrate they have the means to do that,\u201d said Mr. Pearson, the Opus One chief executive. \u201cThere was no middle market. You were either spending all your money on the highest quality of wine or you couldn\u2019t afford to buy anything other than the least expensive wine.\u201dThe change started when Xi Jinping became president in 2013 and began an anti-corruption campaign that zeroed in on illicit gift-giving. Wine imports dipped for a couple of years but then recovered as sellers began to learn how to market to a person who would buy a bottle at a time, not several cases.\u201cThe distributors who learned how to deal with consumers survived and got better at it,\u201d said Mr. Boyce, the wine blogger.It isn\u2019t clear how exactly the new tariffs will affect Opus One. Mr. Pearson sells the wine to a group of intermediaries in France known as negociants, who then send it to Chinese importers. It\u2019s also unlikely that anyone willing to spend the $600 for Opus One in China would even notice the added charge.The middle-market wine buyer \u2014 with $20 or so to spare \u2014 would notice. France and Australia are already monsters in that market, sending half of all of the foreign wine that went to China last year. The United States share is just 2 percent, and it has been shrinking. The Wine Institute, which represents California growers, says that\u2019s partly because they\u2019re selling less for a higher price.\u201cCalifornia has had a tough time getting into the conversation,\u201d said David Amadia, the president of Ridge Vineyards. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t considered a top wine region in China.\u201dAfter his Geyserville zinfandel blend was served at a meeting between Mr. Xi and President Barack Obama in 2013, a flurry of new importers began asking for 1,000 cases at a time. He was initially excited about the attention. Then he realized he had no idea where it was going, or who exactly was so interested in it.\"We had concerns about gray market and counterfeiting,\" he said. So he rejected those orders, and says other American winemakers may also be choosing control over quantity. No one knows how much fake wine flows in China, but experts say French and Australian labels are stolen most often, and slapped on random bottles, because they are so well known and abundant.On Mr. Pearson\u2019s desk, in Napa, he has a box of counterfeit Opus wines on display. The scammers did a terrific job on the box, he said, other than the \u201cX\u201d they inserted into the name Rothschild.\u201cPart of me takes a strange amount of pride in it,\u201d he said. \u201cYour brand has to have enough value associated with it in order for someone to think it\u2019s worth counterfeiting.\u201dAilin Tang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Caught in the Middle as Trump Threatens China", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 One is a good customer, a military ally and an old friend, although lately its behavior has been erratic.The other is also a good customer, and despite a few spats and some lingering mistrust, it\u2019s getting to be a more lucrative and dependable business partner all the time.Which side would you choose?That more or less sums up the dilemma confronting Europe as it watches the escalating conflict between its two biggest trading partners, the United States and China.The United States is Europe\u2019s biggest market for exports like cars and other goods, not to mention a NATO ally. But China is big, too \u2014 and getting ever bigger.The Trump administration has also threatened the institutions that govern global relationships, calling NATO obsolete and stoking trade tensions. So China no longer automatically seems like the less reliable partner.European leaders were largely silent after President Trump threatened to impose another $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. But watching from a safe distance as China and the United States argue is not an option for Europe. Its economy is too deeply entwined with both.\u201cWhat can they do in terms of staying out of the crossfire?\u201d said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics in Britain. \u201cNot a lot.\u201dAlthough Mr. Trump\u2019s threats are aimed at China, Europe is certain to suffer collateral damage if the president follows through. A spiraling war of tariffs and counter-tariffs would interfere with the global flow of raw materials and components for manufactured goods, disrupting the European economy. And some European companies, like the German carmaker BMW, manufacture in the United States and export to China. Such companies would see their sales suffer if China were to slap tariffs on American goods.The mere threat of a trade war has already unsettled financial markets and made it more difficult for companies to raise money, Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, said Friday. \u201cNone of this supports growth and employment,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said at a conference in Cernobbio, Italy.\u201cHe has created an environment to divide countries,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Sapir, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cMaybe we will remember that 2017 was the last year of the functioning of the multilateral system.\u201dIt\u2019s possible Europe might enjoy a few short-term benefits as China and the United States duke it out. If, for example, China were to raise tariffs on Boeing airliners, Boeing\u2019s European rival, Airbus, could take advantage. But positive effects of that sort are not likely to outweigh the risks.European companies have invested far more in the United States over the years than they have in China. But increasingly, China is where the action is. Germany\u2019s total trade with China, exports and imports together, is already bigger than it is with the United States. And China is the biggest single market for companies like Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s largest carmaker.China is also where more German companies are putting their money.Even so, Europe remains wary of China\u2019s intentions. Though European leaders use tamer language, they share some of Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about unfair competition from Chinese companies that receive government subsidies. They worry that Chinese companies are stealing European technology, and accumulating too much economic power.In recent years, Chinese investors have snapped up European assets including Greek ports, German machinery companies and a 10 percent stake in the automaker Daimler. The Chinese government\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d campaign, a plan to dominate cutting-edge industry, is a threat to German companies that supply precision machinery that the Chinese companies are not yet able to manufacture themselves.Get the Morning Briefing in your inbox. What you need to know to start your day, each weekday morning.At the same time, Europe and the United States have been through a lot together, most notably the Cold War. Both are multiparty democracies with free market economies, unlike China\u2019s one-party autocracy. And European and American historical and cultural ties go back centuries.Still, a trade war could push Europe closer to China.Europe\u2019s most immediate preoccupation is to resolve its own trade disputes with Mr. Trump. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, is negotiating with Wilbur Ross, the United States commerce secretary, about winning a permanent exemption from tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. A temporary exemption to the tariffs expires May 1.Ms. Malmstrom and other European leaders have also made plain their unhappiness with what they see as Mr. Trump\u2019s crusade to undermine the World Trade Organization as the arbiter of trade conflicts. They may see China as a potential ally in efforts to preserve the W.T.O., of which China is also a member.\u201cThe E.U. believes that measures should always be taken within the World Trade Organization framework which provides numerous tools to effectively deal with trade differences,\u201d a representative for the European Commission said in a statement.For the moment, there is little Europe can do but hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s bluster is just a tactic to win concessions from China, and that no trade war will break out. There are few other good options.Mr. Sapir of Bruegel argues that, longer term, Europe should push for reforms of the trade body to respond to American criticism that the organization is too slow moving, and has failed to curb unfair competition by China. Mr. Trump is unlikely to take much interest in fixing the global trade regime rather than ignoring it, Mr. Sapir said, but it\u2019s still worth a try.\u201cThat is the only structural solution,\u201d Mr. Sapir said. \u201cOtherwise, we will always be caught in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Memphis Rally Embodies Dr. King\u2019s Activist Spirit", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEMPHIS \u2014 They waved signs that said \u201cI Am.\u201d They came as labor leaders and politicians, retail workers and teachers. Most of all, they came with a pointed declaration: The struggle continues.Thousands of people descended on this impoverished southern city on Wednesday in a show of force that was as much a commemoration as a call to action, as the nation remembered the 50th anniversary of the death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.An emotional crowd gathered around the Lorraine Motel balcony here where Dr. King was slain by an assassin\u2019s bullet, observing a moment of silence while a bell tolled at 6:01 p.m., the time he was shot. The balcony was draped in a black sheet with a wreath of red and white flowers attached to it. While many celebrated the achievements of the civil rights icon, they also lamented the country\u2019s continuing struggles with poverty, racism and inequality.\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong in our nation, where we live, where a minimum of 48 million people are living in poverty,\u201d said Martin Luther King III, Dr. King\u2019s oldest son, his voice roaring like his father\u2019s at a rally. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable. We must do better.\u201dMany activists expressed concern that Dr. King\u2019s legacy might be sanitized as someone who simply advocated peace. They said they hoped that this moment would provide a chance to highlight the forceful lengths to which he was willing to go \u2014 like resistance through civil disobedience \u2014 to overcome racism.Many said they saw this as an urgent moment.There are racist elements in the country, Mr. King said, \u201cand some of the things that have been said by the president have given rise to this behavior. And so we got to find a way to work on the president\u2019s heart, like we worked on George Wallace\u2019s heart years ago and changed him.\u201dMr. King and his sister Bernice King essentially endorsed today\u2019s social justice movements \u2014 from Black Lives Matter to #MeToo \u2014 as extensions of their father\u2019s work. Speaking on Tuesday evening at the Mason Temple, where Dr. King gave his final public address before he was killed, Ms. King said that her father had planned to preach a sermon titled \u201cAmerica may go to hell.\u201d But he was killed before he ever got a chance to deliver it.\u201cIt\u2019s time for America to repent,\u201d Ms. King said, before a fervent and rapt crowd.A rally on Wednesday morning organized by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the Church of God in Christ drew a crowd carrying signs with messages like \u201cFight Poverty\u201d and \u201cWe got nothing to lose but our chains.\u201d A banner hung high above a stage that read \u201c#I AM 2018,\u201d a nod to the \u201cI Am a Man\u201d slogan that Memphis sanitation workers used when they were striking in 1968, a cause that prompted Dr. King to travel to Memphis a half-century ago.In many ways, this city is the ideal backdrop to channel Dr. King\u2019s fight. Racial tensions still run deep. Last week, a convenience store clerk fatally shot Dorian Harris, a black teenager, after he stole a beer. The clerk fired at the teenager down the street, and did not check to see if he had struck him. The boy\u2019s dead body was discovered two days later. The clerk has been charged with murder.Poverty remains endemic. Memphis is the poorest large metropolitan area in the country. More than a third of children live in poverty, including nearly 50 percent of black children. The income gap between black and white residents of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, has remained the same over the last 40 years, with black median income about half of what it is for white people.\u201cHe probably would feel sad about Memphis, as so many other places where he did a lot of his work,\u201d Ms. King said of her father. \u201cThe concentration of this poverty that we as a country never really confronted, we haven\u2019t dealt with.\u201dDr. King\u2019s death only hastened the decline of predominantly black communities that were starved of resources.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have this in Memphis,\u201d said Al Lewis, 64, a retired postal worker, pointing to an empty lot next to a bungalow home enveloped in weeds and trees in a southeast Memphis neighborhood. \u201cThe soul of the city died.\u201dMr. Lewis remembered hearing the news that Dr. King had been shot while he was at his aunt\u2019s house. He raced home and as he was coming to the door, his father came out with a rifle, his mother trailing behind.\u201cBaby don\u2019t go, don\u2019t go, don\u2019t go,\u201d Mr. Lewis recalled his mother saying.\u201cThey\u2019ve killed our leader, let\u2019s go kill some of them,\u201d Mr. Lewis recalled his father responding.His mother was eventually able to talk down his father, he said.White people fled the city, which is now about two-thirds black, and manufacturing companies followed, leading to a steep decline in the economy and quality of life.Mr. Lewis is among a group of Memphis activists who vigorously, and often disruptively, protest police abuses and the city\u2019s low-wage economy. They even shouted down the white mayor on Wednesday, as he spoke from the Lorraine\u2019s balcony, which was draped in a black sheet.On Tuesday morning, Mr. Lewis and his wife, Catherine, hopped into their sport-utility vehicle and led a caravan of activists to a FedEx shipping facility. The activists parked in the middle of the road in front of the entrance. They blasted music and danced in the streets.They left at the urging of the police after about 30 minutes, though some were arrested later in the day while protesting in front of a jail.But this, the activists said, was the legacy of Dr. King that they did not want lost amid the ceremony surrounding his death.\u201cSince this is the poorest city in the country, we just didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be fitting to honor Dr. King by having a damn banquet or giving out some awards,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cWe decided to do a direct action, civil disobedience in honor of how he would have done if he was here. This is what he came here to do. We\u2019re trying to finish that off.\u201dFollow John Eligon on Twitter @jeligonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It Even Possible to Succeed as House G.O.P. Speaker?", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs. Reynolds studies Congress, with an emphasis on how congressional rules and procedure affect domestic policy outcomes.The speaker of the House\u2019s institutional responsibilities date to the founding of our country, but the modern speakership is focused largely on its political roles: protecting the House majority and advancing the party\u2019s policy goals. Success in one dimension \u2014 as Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s decision to retire reflects \u2014 does not always translate into success in the other.So let\u2019s assume Mr. Ryan isn\u2019t an exceptional Republican political liability. What about on policy? We can assess his record by looking at what bills the speaker decided to consider in the House. For that, there are two dynamics to assess: One involves keeping things off the agenda that could split the party, even if they could pass the House with votes chipped in from the other party. As Dennis Hastert, a former speaker, put it, \u201cThe job of the speaker is not to expedite legislation that runs counter to the wishes of the majority of the majority.\u201d The second dynamic entails advancing policies favored by his party.If Democrats were to take control of the House in November, a postelection departure by Mr. Ryan wouldn\u2019t have been surprising; it\u2019s unusual for a losing speaker to continue to lead his party in the minority. (Ms. Pelosi is a notable exception.) But even if Republicans retain control of the House in November, the challenges presented to Mr. Ryan in terms of racking up policy wins were likely to get worse, not better.The House seats most likely to be lost by Republicans in November are largely held by members who generally cooperate with Mr. Ryan, leaving behind a smaller majority with a more extreme center of gravity. Senate Republicans face kinder headwinds \u2014 10 Democratic incumbents are running for re-election in states that Mr. Trump carried \u2014 and are more likely to retain control of their chamber; they may even gain a few seats. But a filibuster-proof Senate majority in 2019 is extremely unlikely, and the level of polarization in the Senate means that building a coalition in the Senate that attracts, say, seven Democratic senators may not be meaningfully different from the current task of garnering the support of nine.Together, these forces would have left Mr. Ryan to deal with a worse version of his current dilemma on must-pass measures like large spending bills: Any measure that can clear the Senate is likely to need some Democratic support in the House to pass.But to avoid the pitfalls that have plagued Mr. Ryan, any Republican successor will be wise to avoid making promises on which he or she can\u2019t deliver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An International Final Four: Which Country Handles Student Debt Best?", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by In America, college student loan defaults are a really big problem. In Australia? No worries. Policy analysts generally agree on a need for reform, but not on which path policymakers should take. Can America learn anything from other nations? We gathered experts with a range of perspectives, from America and abroad, and asked them to compare the systems in Australia, Britain, Sweden and the United States. We chose this grouping of nations because they highlight important differences both in loan repayment systems and in related policies such as tuition and loan limits, not necessarily because they all belong among the best systems in the world. In the spirit of March Madness, we devised a bracket-style tournament, seeding the countries so that those with more similar systems would meet in the semifinals.Sweden and the United States differ in whether the monthly loan payment remains the same over time and in the number of years borrowers can repay their loans. The average American borrower with a bachelor\u2019s degree leaves college with $28,400 in debt. Students can borrow for both tuition and living expenses, although loan limits make it hard for an undergraduate to borrow more than $45,000 over four years.In Sweden, average debt levels are similar \u2014 the equivalent of around $21,000 \u2014 even though students borrow only for living expenses (Swedish universities do not charge tuition). Interest rates are also very low; the rate for 2018 is now 0.13. In the United States, borrowers are required to begin making payments six months after leaving college. By default, payments are set so the whole principal and interest, which is tied to the market rate at the time the loan is made (currently 4.45 percent), will be paid off in equal monthly installments paid over 10 years. Swedish borrowers, on the other hand, pay off their loans over a much longer period. Borrowers can be in repayment for up to 25 years, with the typical borrower paying for 22 years. In Sweden, payments are automatically set so they increase by 2 percent each year. Borrowers can ask to reduce their payments to as low as 5 percent of income in cases of financial hardship, and any remaining debt is forgiven at age 68.Panelists generally saw Sweden\u2019s extended repayment window as an advantage.\u201cThe shorter term in the U.S.A. means that low-earning graduates will always struggle and be at risk of default,\u201d said Lorraine Dearden, professor of economics and social statistics at University College London and a fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Some panelists did point out that Sweden\u2019s repayment policy benefits from the country\u2019s tuition-free college and low interest rates. This could, however, be a problem for larger goals of equity. In these countries, students take out loans in name only. The loans have principal and interest like regular loans, but must be repaid only if the borrower makes above a certain amount.In both countries, payments are collected automatically through the tax system and adjust automatically with income \u2014 similar to tax withholding in the United States. Students can also choose to pay for tuition up front, but 85 percent to 90 percent instead take out an income-contingent loan.Most English universities charge the maximum-allowed tuition of the equivalent of about $12,900, and students can also borrow for living expenses (tuition is free for Scottish students at Scotland universities). The average debt load after leaving a degree program is more than $60,000.Australia has lower tuition levels, which range up to the equivalent of $8,300 per year depending on the course of study, and lower average borrowing ($23,500). Australian students are also limited to borrowing only for tuition, not living expenses.British borrowers pay an interest rate set at the inflation rate plus up to 3 percent, depending on income, whereas Australia sets the interest rate at the inflation rate for all borrowers.Britain collects payments for up to 30 years, after which any remaining amount owed is forgiven. The typical borrower spends about 27 years in repayment. Australia collects payments as long as the borrower is living and making a sufficient income, but the typical borrower spends only nine years repaying the loans. Simplicity is Britain\u2019s main advantage, according to several of our experts. Those who preferred the British system also cited the forgiveness provision and the ability to borrow for living expenses as important factors.\u201cThe English system has the advantage of providing students with loans for living expenses, not just tuition,\u201d Ms. Scott-Clayton said. \u201cThis is an important feature for promoting equitable access to higher education.\u201dNicholas Barr, professor of public economics at the London School of Economics, who ultimately picked Australia, summarized the trade-offs, arguing that the \u201cU.K. design is better in principle but the system in Australia works better in practice.\u201d Ms. Dearden thought Britain\u2019s interest rate was too high and likely to \u201cdisproportionately hit middle-earning graduates rather than rich graduates.\u201d Panelists generally liked Australia\u2019s sliding-scale approach to the percentage of income paid toward student loans even though it adds a bit of complexity.\u201cIf the Australian system is able to convey to potential students that the loan is income-contingent even though the exact repayment calculation is more complicated, then you\u2019re less likely to distort labor market decisions while still getting the benefits of using loans to increase access,\u201d said Bridget Terry Long, Saris professor of education and economics at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. \u201cAlso, students finish repaying their loans a lot faster.\u201dAs in the first matchup, panelists also looked beyond repayment to the loan systems and the amount students are expected to borrow. \u201cEnglish tuition charges are excessive, and this contributes to the very large subsidies in that system, because a lot of the debt doesn\u2019t get repaid,\u201d said Bruce Chapman, professor of economics at Australian National University, as he cast his vote for Australia. Sandy Baum, a fellow at the Urban Institute who ultimately chose Britain based on the availability of forgiveness and the use of an above-inflation interest rate, said, \u201cIn England, debt levels are too high, but that is about the pricing system and the lack of payments up front, not the loan repayment system.\u201d Mr. Usher\u2019s conclusion echoed Mr. Barr\u2019s: \u201cThe U.K. system is exquisitely designed according to rationalist principles, but it commands almost no public respect.\u201dIn unanimously choosing Australia, panelists agreed that automatic collection of income-based payments is a critical ingredient of a well-functioning loan system. \u201cWhen borrowers have the choice to repay through their employer, this cuts out much of the red tape and the distorted incentives of middlemen,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, a senior fellow at Consumer Federation of America.Many of our panelists could not evaluate a loan repayment system without also considering the price of tuition or questions of access. There are big differences among the four countries beyond how students repay loans. Rethinking repayment is a start, but bigger changes to how students pay for college may be necessary. Our panelists agreed that the best student loan repayment system is one that is simple, that is based on students\u2019 incomes, that spreads loan payments over longer periods and that\u2019s able to collect payments automatically through the tax system.Democrats and Republicans share blame for a system that seems broken, and major reforms don\u2019t seem near. Maybe the first step is acknowledging that possible ideas for improvement don\u2019t stop at the border. We\u2019re interested in what you have to say \u2014 whether you\u2019re an American, or whether you\u2019ve attended college abroad. In the comments section, tell us the best or worst feature of your country\u2019s system.

Five years later, the garment industry looks set to return to business as usual. Supported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Mahmudul Hassan Hridoy, a sweet-natured, soft-spoken 32-year-old, walks with a crutch and suffers from terrible headaches. Sometimes at night he pulls his hair out while he sleeps. He is single, though he has been married; his wife left him when he was in an accident and permanently injured. He owns a small pharmacy, and, once a month, he holds meetings there. Shiuli Begum, for example, plump 26-year-old with a little-girl voice, who now lives on a wooden plank bed in a cement-walled metal-roofed shanty a half mile from Rana Plaza. She spends her days watching television and napping thanks to the sleeping pills on which she is now dependent; she cannot read. She can no longer have children and she can barely move, as her spinal cord was crushed. \u201cTo go to the bathroom is an ordeal,\u201d she said.And 28-year-old Shila Begum, a short, stout and fiery widow with a 14-year-old daughter she cannot afford to send to school. Her kidneys were smashed, as was her right hand. \u201cI cannot work,\u201d she said, dressed in a bright fuchsia, orange, and lemon yellow tie-dye head scarf and pants cinched by a medical corset, her forearm in a brace, standing next to the marshy lot where Rana Plaza once loomed. But like everyone else here, she can remember.\u201c\u2018Help me!\u2019 people screamed,\u201d recalled Mr. Hridoy, absently picking at a thigh of Kentucky Fried Chicken and staring out the smudgy window at the typically epic traffic jam on the dusty highway out front, the relentless barrage of klaxons nearly drowning him out. He was remembering the moment the seventh floor of the eight-story Rana Plaza retail and apparel manufacturing complex crumbled beneath his feet five years ago today. The catastrophe injured 2,500 and killed more than 1,100. It was the deadliest garment industry accident in modern history.\u201c\u2018Save me!\u2019 they cried,\u201d Mr. Hridoy said. \u201cBut nobody was listening.\u201dMr. Hridoy had worked for Rana Plaza for two weeks: he had quit his post as a nursery schoolteacher, because it was poorly paid, to become a quality inspector for New Wave Style Ltd. As he was good at math, management assured him he would move up the ladder quickly. The promise of increased income was irresistible: his girlfriend of three years was pregnant. \u201cThat\u2019s why I joined Rana Plaza,\u201d he said. They had married three days before the collapse. When he opened eyes in the rubble, he realized he was pinned under a concrete pillar. As everything came into focus, he saw he was face-to-face with one of his good friends, Faisal, who worked on the second floor as a sewing machine operator. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how,\u201d Mr. Hridoy said. \u201cI guess my floor dropped down to his.\u201dFaisal\u2019s skull was shattered, he said, in a whisper. \u201cAnd his brains were spilling out.\u201d He began to cry. \u201cI can\u2019t forget how his head exploded in front of me,\u201d Mr. Hridoy said, as he sobbed. \u201cThose memories still haunt me.\u201d In 2015 and 2016, two of the members of his survivors\u2019 network committed suicide by hanging themselves in their living rooms.The land where Rana Plaza once stood is now overgrown with weeds. On the street-facing side, a cement monument, topped by an enormous pair of sculpted fists grasping the hammer and sickle, has been erected in victims\u2019 memory. It is usually surrounded by parked cars.\u201cEighty-three percent of our foreign currency comes from the garment sector,\u201d said Siddiqur Rahman, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers & Exporters Association in an interview this week in his grand, air-conditioned office at the organization\u2019s headquarters in Dhaka. \u201cFifty million people depend on it, and our economy is dependent on it.\u201d He added that the government would like to double output in the next five years. Nobody outside of Bangladesh paid much attention to these tragedies until the Tazreen Fashions factory went up in flames in the Dhaka suburb of Ashulia in November, 2012. At least 117 died, many burned beyond recognition, and more than 200 were injured. NGOs tried to enlist brands to sign a legally binding agreement to improve factory safety, but only two \u2014 PVH and Tchibo of Germany \u2014 joined. Five months later, Rana Plaza happened. After a month of \u201chighly embarrassing media coverage,\u201d as Scott Nova, executive director of the Washington-based Worker Rights Consortium described it, in something of an understatement, international fashion brands who source in Bangladesh announced the creation of two five-year compliancy agreements. The nonbinding Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety was led by Walmart, and signed by 28, among them Gap, Target, and Hudson\u2019s Bay, owners of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. Independent inspectors and engineers identified and corrected safety infractions, such as locked or nonexistent fire exits and dangerous wiring. All told, 97,000 hazards were repaired in 1,600 factories. Mr. Rahman reported that 900 factories that did not meet compliance standards were shut down by the government.Last week, the Center for Global Workers\u2019 Rights released a study of the impact of the Accord, and heralded both as a success: in five years, more than 97,000 hazards in 1,600 factories were rectified, providing safer environments for 2.5 million workers. \u201cThe Accord has undoubtedly saved lives,\u201d said Liana Foxvog, director of Organizing and Communications for the International Labor Rights Forum, another Washington-based human rights organization.Improvements don\u2019t mean sweatshops no longer exist in Bangladesh. This reporter visited one in Dhaka, three days before the Rana Plaza anniversary. Fire buckets were filled with trash, emergency water bins were cracked and half empty, no one wore safety masks, most workers \u2014 some in their early teens \u2014 were barefoot, wiring was exposed, bolts of fabric and scraps littered the floors, window panes were broken, and the lone stairwell out of the tenement-like building was obstructed by cartons of finished product destined for Russia.And both the Accord and the Alliance are about to expire. The Accord is set to be renewed for three more years; the Alliance will be dissolved. Advocates are urging former Alliance members to sign on to the new, if brief, Accord. After the extension expires, monitoring is expected to be handed over to the Remediation Coordination Cell, a national initiative that will monitor compliance in garment factories. Advocates as well as U.S. and E.U. diplomatic representatives in Bangladesh are not sure this is a good idea, given that at least 10 percent of the country\u2019s parliament members own factories. \u201cYou can imagine the collusion,\u201d Ms. Foxvog said.Already, there has been union repression, with the jailing of labor leaders, which, Mr. Nova said, \u201chas had a chilling effect on the industry,\u201d and wage negotiations later this year are expected to be fraught and will no doubt trigger worker protests and unrest. At issue particularly is that minimum wage, \u201cwhich by our estimates is one-fifth a conservative living wage,\u201d Mr. Nova said.Worker unions will demand an increase to about $175 a month. Few outside the industry believe they will succeed.This morning, nearly 3,000 survivors and supporters \u2014 including nurses and doctors who treated victims \u2014 gathered at Rana Plaza to mark the anniversary and honor the injured and the dead. Under the blazing noontime sun, they formed human chains across the property, and marched with banners that read \u201cWorkers of the World Unite!\u201d Union leaders and activists called for justice and placed wreaths of marigolds and roses on the monument. Hawkers wandered through the crowd with buckets of fresh pineapple and cucumber spears on their head. Police stood discreetly on the fringe, in the shade.Locals were not surprised when Rana Plaza went down. The day before the accident, the wall on the third floor split open like a fault line; workers fled en masse into the street. An engineer called to inspect the damage recommended the building be immediately condemned. \u201cThe crack was so huge I could put my hand in it,\u201d said Ms. Begum, the single mother, who was then a sewing machine operator for Ither Tex Ltd., the fifth-floor tenant. Managers heeded the engineer\u2019s suggestion somewhat: they sent everyone home but ordered them to return in the morning. And they did, hesitantly. \u201cI was scared,\u201d Ms. Begum said. \u201cI was really in a panic.\u201d They came back, she said, because they feared if they didn\u2019t, they would not be paid at the end of the month.Around 8 a.m., Mr. Hridoy heard a knock on his front door: it was his neighbor, who was also his boss, reminding him to report for work. He made his way to the factory, clocked in, and took his position on the denim line. At 8:45, the power snapped off. Management turned the generators on. As they began to rumble, so did the building.\u201cIt felt like the floor under my feet was moving,\u201d Mr. Hridoy said. \u201cThen it was disappearing.\u201d Ms. Begum, two floors below Mr. Hridoy, was sewing jeans for a French brand \u2014 she doesn\u2019t remember which one \u2014 when the concrete ceiling fell on her, landing on her torso and her right hand. Her long hair became entangled in the sewing machine, she said, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t free myself because my hand was stuck.\u201d Sixteen hours later, neighbors who joined the hundreds of emergency responders at the site rescued her. \u201cThey showed up with iron rods and pipes, and pried me out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said my guts were all over the place.\u201d She began to weep as she retold the story. \u201cI passed out and came to my senses 27 days later,\u201d she said. She received no government compensation but did get a bit of financial assistance from nonprofits. \u201cNothing from the brands,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I come here,\u201d she said, looking at the void that was Rana Plaza, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t want to live anymore.\u201dHousebound Shiuli Begum was a sewing jeans for Joe Fresh and Primark, when, she recalled, \u201cEverything went dark and I felt things falling all over me.\u201d She lost consciousness, and 36 hours later woke up in a hospital. She also received no compensation, not even the 45,000 taka (roughly $530) pledged by brands. \u201cYou had to lobby for the money,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was too infirm.\u201d Her husband is a day laborer and her caregiver.Mr. Hridoy was the only one of the three who was compensated by the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund, a $30 million endowment underwritten by brands. He used the $600 he got to open his drugstore, and he also founded the Savar Rana Plaza Survivors Association. It currently has 300 members. He does not, however, hold out hope that anything has really changed. \u201cThe labor law in this country is pro-owner, not pro-worker,\u201d he said. When oversight reverts to local governance, he said, \u201call will return to how it was when Rana Plaza happened.\u201d Akram Hosen contributed reporting.An earlier version of this article misstated the duration of the renewal of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety.

{"Headline": "Sanctions Are Hurting North Korea. Can They Make Kim Give In?", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "The isolated North is finding ways to cope with tough new penalties. Is the economic pressure enough to get Kim Jong-un to give up his weapons?Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 On a dark February night, the trucks unloaded their contraband near Hyesan, a North Korean town across a narrow river from China. As border guards looked the other way, workers used carts to pull the cargo of metal ore \u2014 tungsten, lead, zinc, copper and gold concentrates, all banned from export under United Nations sanctions \u2014 across the frozen river.By sunrise, all that was left were tire tracks and footprints across the river\u2019s frozen surface.A North Korean witness told an acquaintance living in South Korea that ore, as well as other materials, was being smuggled into China at the crossing almost every night. He said smugglers also headed the other way, moving sugar, flour and 50-kilogram sacks of fertilizers into North Korea.But the elaborate efforts to smuggle goods in and out of North Korea are among the signs that the closed, secretive country is finding ways to cope.The North is also responding with patriotic appeals and belt-tightening, and by prioritizing the allocation of resources to the military and political elite. Despite shortages, exchange rates and key consumer prices are stable, and there is no sign of an approaching famine, according to recent visitors and North Korean defectors who remain in contact with people inside the country.Since then, Mr. Kim has taken steps to appear willing to cut a deal, offering what sound like concessions to the United States, but can also be seen as clever negotiating tactics. On Saturday, Mr. Kim said that \u201cwe no longer need\u201d any nuclear or missile tests, and that the North would close a nuclear test site, according to the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency.One day earlier Mr. Moon said that Mr. Kim removed a key obstacle to negotiations with the United States by ceasing to demand the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea as a condition for denuclearizing his country.It is far from clear, however, whether the pain from sanctions is forcing Mr. Kim to make concessions, and whether it could be enough to drive him to trade away his nuclear arsenal.Many analysts and North Korean defectors have doubts about whether economic pressure alone, no matter how painful, can change the behavior of an impoverished, tightly controlled nation that has endured extreme hardship before.\u201cIf you think the North Koreans would revolt or the regime would collapse because of sanctions, you don\u2019t know anything about the North Koreans,\u201d said Kang Mi-jin, a North Korean defector who collects North Korean consumer prices for the South\u2019s central Bank of Korea. \u201cThese are people who survived the famine by eating weeds and even talk proudly about it.\u201d\u201dWe are starting to see the first major test of the North Korean economy under Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.Since September, the United Nations Security Council has banned all key North Korean exports, including coal, iron ore, seafood and textiles. If enforced fully, they could eliminate a full 90 percent of the country\u2019s total exports in dollar terms.North Korea can still extract 1.2 million barrels of gasoline, diesel and kerosene from the four million barrels of crude oil a year it is allowed to import, mostly from China, said an energy analyst, Lee Jong-heon. But the combined 1.7 million barrels of refined petroleum would be less than half the amount needed to run all of the 280,000 cars in North Korea, much less heat homes and meet other needs, Mr. Lee said.Experts said the sanctions, and China\u2019s apparent willingness to enforce many of them, had dealt a blow to one of the few bright points in the North Korean economy: trade with China, which had been an eager market for ore and other North Korean natural resources.\u201cProduction has sharply decreased, if not come to a compete halt, in coal, iron, zinc and copper mines,\u201d said Jiro Ishimaru, who runs Asia Press, a Japan-based website that monitors North Korea with the help of informants inside the country. \u201cMany miners don\u2019t report for work because management can\u2019t provide rations or pay wages.\u201dNorth Korean exports to China, which account for more than 90 percent of the North\u2019s external trade, plunged by one third to $1.65 billion last year, with volumes dropping by 60 to 95 percent in recent months. Its official trade deficit against China more than doubled last year to $1.68 billion.\u201cPetty traders from the North who used to cross into China in the morning on foot or in small cars and then returned in the evening with auto parts and food to sell on the black market no longer come,\u201d said Wu Qiang, a North Korea expert in China.Without foreign currency, North Korea will struggle to finance imports of consumer goods for its people and raw materials for its factories. It will also be unable to import fertilizer in time for the planting season, raising the specter of a return of food shortages, said Jin Qiangyi, director of the Center for North and South Korea Studies at Yanbian University.Humanitarian aid workers who have recently visited the country warn that food shortages could be exacerbated by the lack of fuel, which could hamper North Korea\u2019s ability to transport grain from areas of surplus to places where there is not enough. Trucks that used to carry goods twice a day now run only once a day on some routes, though some are extending their decks to carry more loads.Despite these privations, analysts say there are few signs that North Korea\u2019s economy has reached a breaking point.In Pyongyang, there is still enough electricity to keep streetlights on at night, said South Korean journalists who visited this month. Everyone seemed to carry a cellphone, and women were more fashionably dressed than before, they said.After soaring last year, gasoline prices have stabilized in recent months, though they remain nearly twice as high as a year ago. North Korea is likely to respond by further reducing its reliance on oil \u2014 petroleum accounts for only 12 percent of its energy production \u2014 using North Korean coal that it once exported to China in its own domestic power plants instead, said Mr. Lee, the energy expert.\u201cI don\u2019t think the North will surrender its nuclear weapons because of oil shortages,\u201d he said.The elites have also been enriched, allowing them to stockpile goods and foreign currency.\u201cWe have seen no big disruption in markets yet that could be attributed to sanctions,\u201d Mr. Ishimaru of Asia Press said. \u201cNorth Korean markets have proved quite resilient against sanctions.\u201dMs. Kang, the defector who collects data using informants in the North, said the country was now far better positioned to ride out the sanctions than in the past. \u201cThey have markets,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is rice there. Many have cash reserves.\u201dShe said the North had also benefited from smuggling that had brought in hard currency and some consumer goods.The actual extent of smuggling could be far larger than estimated. Nighttime smuggling operations have become more common along the border with China, said defectors with sources inside North Korea. North Korean secret police officers collude with border guards to create a window of several hours during which smugglers are free to move goods in and out of the country, they said.Ms. Kang, who also reports for the Seoul-based website Daily NK, said her sample study of North Korean towns near the border showed that the number of smugglers had doubled in recent years, especially since sanctions began to make their effects felt last year.\u201cThe screws have been tightened, so the pain is now bigger, but I don\u2019t think it is lethal,\u201d said R\u00fcdiger Frank, an economist at the University of Vienna who studies the North. \u201cI am not convinced that the sanctions were the main factor that led to the current talks.\u201dIt may be too early to judge the full impact of the sanctions, which began to hurt only in the second half of 2017, after China appeared to step up enforcement. This means conditions in North Korea could deteriorate further.Some analysts have argued that Mr. Kim\u2019s decision to travel to Beijing and meet with President Xi Jinping last month may have been a sign of his desperation to ease sanctions.The recent improvements in living standards in North Korea could mean its political elite and new middle class may be unwilling to tolerate a return to economic hardship, said Kim Dong-yub, a North Korea analyst at the Seoul-based Institute for Far Eastern Studies.In Pyongyang, some families make fewer trips to restaurants and choose cheaper domestic goods over more expensive imports. Outside the capital, rural families now sometimes make do with only two meals a day.\u201cMy worry is that the gains and progress made in recent years in terms of food security and marketization could fade as a result of the sanctions,\u201d said Katharina Zellweger, who has visited North Korea 70 times since 1995, living there from 2006 to 2011 to run a Swiss aid program. \u201cThat would mean we are moving backward.\u201dOne Chinese trader who does business with middle-class North Koreans said that he had noticed a growing discontent with the government because of the shortages.\u201cI can feel they are not satisfied with the government, and if the authorities cannot resolve the sanctions problem, such dissatisfaction will go on and on,\u201d said the trader, who asked to be identified only by his English name, Terry, for fear of repercussions in North Korea. \u201cThey have lost the loyalty toward the regime.\u201dBut the Kim government still has enormous power to suppress or deflect discontent. No organized antigovernment resistance exists in North Korea, where the government maintains a tight grip on society and relies on the police, backed by a system of informers, to imprison critics.Complete control over the news media, and the North\u2019s almost total isolation from the internet, allows the government to shape how many people perceive reality. Bombarded by daily propaganda appeals, North Koreans are more likely to see themselves as citizens of a small nation persecuted by hostile Americans than they are to blame Mr. Kim\u2019s government for their economic hardship, recent visitors and defectors say.\u201cWe do ask people about sanctions,\u201d said Linda Lewis, the North Korea country representative for the American Friends Service Committee, a humanitarian aid group, who last visited in November. \u201cWe ask about the impact of them. The answer that we usually get from people is: \u2018We\u2019ve never experienced a life without sanctions, so how would we know?\u2019\u201dEcho Hui contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Many publications have been criticized for publishing too narrow a range of opinions. And several publications, including The Times, The Atlantic and The Washington Post, have recently made high-profile conservative hires.But the particular Trump phenomenon is different from a broader issue, as the next section shows.[Receive the day's most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] Nearly every major publication employs conservative voices. There is also a conservative media industry with an enormous combined audience, including Fox News, Sinclair, talk radio, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s opinion pages and smaller magazines like National Review and The Weekly Standard. Outside of conservative media, though, many of the conservative voices fall into a single category: anti-Trump, socially moderate writers. Readers say they also want to hear other conservative arguments.On immigration, for example, Bonnie Gauthier said that she wanted to understand what drove support for border-security measures, including a wall. Jeffrey Marsh wants to hear more defenses of Trump policies. Patricia Valiton wants to read more pro-gun arguments. Even many readers who say they disagree with these arguments said they would like to understand them better.\u201cWhile I am pro-choice, science continues to push the boundaries of fetal viability to earlier and earlier stages.

Why does the United States have the world\u2019s most expensive health care system?

Whatever.We don\u2019t fight trade wars any more, I thought. Instead, we make trade deals to keep goods flowing around the world.Boy, was I ever wrong. Apparently, we\u2019ve been doing trade wrong for years. That\u2019s what the president of the United States says, and if you can\u2019t trust the president, then what\u2019s your problem?See? Fun!Who doesn\u2019t like wars that are good and easy to win? I want in on the fun! Therefore, my fellow Americans, I am boldly declaring my own war.After all, I seem to have a deficit with every one of my trading partners. A quick look at my receipts from ShopRite and Whole Foods shows that they have been taking advantage of me for years! And don\u2019t get me started on Apple. I spend and spend, and do they send me any money in return? They do not. It\u2019s abusive!Like the president, I did not have the honor of serving in our armed forces. No problem. This might be my chance to put on a uniform, maybe one with lots of shiny medals and ribbons to commemorate the seamless steel pipe skirmishes I\u2019ve been involved in. Or maybe I could do what the young people do \u2014 some kind of cosplay that lets me suit up as a Viking, or a \u201cStar Wars\u201d storm trooper, or even the rampaging DC Comics character Harley Quinn, girding my loins for economic battle.The problem was that I don\u2019t know enough about economics to understand what exactly I\u2019m supposed to do. My mind must be insufficiently deep or subtle to understand these issues, I decided. And so I called a couple of experts, actual economists.First I called Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration. He told me that my personal trade deficit is not as bad as I think it is. \u201cI have a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars trade deficit with P.F. Chang\u2019s every year, but I\u2019m a very happy loser,\u201d he said.The problem with trying to engage in a personal trade war, he explained, is that individuals don\u2019t often produce things that are easy to put a value on and barter.\u201cI give lectures in economics,\u201d he said, so \u201cI need to find those suckers who are willing to take them so I can eat.\u201d As for me, he said, I have only one product \u2014 basically, paragraphs. \u201cYou\u2019re in worse shape than I am! You should be afraid,\u201d he said.That, he said, is the lesson of trade wars: \u201cTrade stops, and things that used to benefit both of us go away.\u201dThat sounds like the opposite of good and easy to win.I decided to check in with an economist from the Democratic side of the aisle, Austan Goolsbee, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration. I told him about my idea.\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy idea,\u201d he said, helpfully. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to declare a trade war on the grocery store and I\u2019m going to be better off.\u2019 The thing that you\u2019ve forgotten is that you get a lot of food there.\u201dIt was as Mr. Holtz-Eakin had told me: While businesspeople often see the world in terms of winners and losers, trade policy is about trying to find ways to let a swelling economic tide raise all boats.\u201cTrade deals are about setting the ground rules so other people can get what they want,\u201d Mr. Goolsbee said. When you stop them all from getting what they want, he said, you\u2019ve \u201cgot the game wrong.\u201dI had to admit that the two economists had a point. I may feel that Whole Foods has, in fact, gotten \u201ccute\u201d by charging so much for wild-caught gulf shrimp and those really amazing rotisserie chickens. But if I don\u2019t trade with Whole Foods any more, will that really let me \u201cwin big\u201d?I really like those shrimp on the grill; they\u2019re my big weekend splurge. And if I stop spending money in grocery stores altogether, well, what will I eat?Mr. Goolsbee said I was getting the idea: \u201cBuilding walls to trade, that doesn\u2019t make you rich. That makes you poor.\u201d And, apparently, shrimpless.Zero sum \u2014 the idea that there have to be winners and losers \u2014 \u201cis fundamentally the wrong way to think about trade, and doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he said. Mr. Goolsbee added that, \u201csadly, it seems that the White House is espousing exactly that view.\u201dSo he\u2019s saying that I\u2019m crazy, and I\u2019m wrong, but I\u2019m not alone.

{"Headline": "How to Understand What\u2019s Happening in North Korea", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistNorth Korea doesn\u2019t have enough food, it lacks Facebook and Beyonc\u00e9, and its diplomats have to ration their use of computers in the Foreign Ministry because of electricity shortages.But North Korea excels at choreography and theater, and its officials are well educated, very savvy, and agile with a pirouette. So we have peace breaking out on the Korean Peninsula \u2014 and President Trump gets some credit for that.As with any circus performance, it\u2019s amazing to behold but not quite as billed.As Kim Jong-un stepped into South Korea on Friday \u2014 the first North Korean leader to do so \u2014 let\u2019s acknowledge that he has played a weak hand exceptionally well. Kim is now aiming to squirm out of sanctions, build up his economy and retain his nuclear arsenal, all while remaining a global focus of attention. It\u2019s a remarkable performance.\u201cNorth Korea expert\u201d is an oxymoron, but from someone who has been covering the country since the 1980s, here\u2019s my take on why we should be deeply skeptical \u2014 and yet relieved, even a bit hopeful.President Trump\u2019s tightening of sanctions and his belligerent rhetoric genuinely did change the equation. All this was meant to intimidate Kim, but it mostly alarmed President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and galvanized him to undertake successful Olympic diplomacy that laid the groundwork for the North-South summit meeting.Inspiring, but count me skeptical.When North Korea talks about \u201ccomplete denuclearization,\u201d it typically means that the U.S. ends its alliance with South Korea, and then North Korea will no longer need nuclear weapons to defend itself. But the U.S. won\u2019t give up the South. And North Korea has been pursuing nuclear weapons since the 1950s, and I don\u2019t know any expert who thinks that it will genuinely hand over its arsenal.It\u2019s even less likely that North Korea will give up its nukes now that it sees Trump poised to tear up the Iran nuclear deal.Kim\u2019s game plan seems to be to sign pledges for denuclearization, leaving details to be worked out in follow-up talks, knowing that the pledges won\u2019t be fully implemented and that there will never be intrusive inspections. This may be disingenuous on the part of North Korea, but that\u2019s not terrible: It provides a face-saving way for both North Korea and the U.S. to back away from the precipice of war.Trump and Kim both badly want a meeting, so expect North Korea to release its three American detainees in the coming weeks and to make soothing statements. Trump and Kim will present themselves as historic peacemakers as they sign some kind of declaration calling for peace and denuclearization, with some kind of timetable; Trump\u2019s aides will then say that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize more than Barack Obama did.\u201cOver 100,000 people, a figure that includes countless innocent family members of so-called enemies of the state, are effectively consigned to die in North Korea\u2019s political prisons,\u201d Navi Pillay, a former U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told me. \u201cThe forced abortions, infanticide, persecution of Christians, torture and summary executions that regularly occur in those various facilities are well documented. President Trump can demand that the Red Cross and the international community be given access to North Korea\u2019s prisons and labor camp systems.\u201dIn the meantime, I\u2019m guessing that the North will halt all nuclear and missile testing (hopefully, including short-range missiles), and will stop production of plutonium at its reactors in Yongbyon (North Korea may also claim to stop enriching uranium, but that\u2019s more difficult to verify). In exchange, China and South Korea will quietly ease sanctions \u2014 and Kim will get what he has always wanted, the legitimacy of being treated as a world leader, as an equal, and as the ruler of a de facto nuclear state.Both Kim and Trump benefit politically from that scenario, and for that matter so does the world: Hard-liners will fume that we\u2019re being played and that the North is not verifiably giving up nuclear weapons \u2014 true \u2014 but it\u2019s all preferable to war.How does this end? The West\u2019s plan is to drag things along until the North collapses. This may happen. The problem is that it was also the U.S. plan in 1994 in a previous nuclear deal. And I confess that I chose to be The New York Times\u2019s bureau chief in Tokyo in the late 1990s partly so that I could cover what I thought might be the collapse soon of the North Korean regime. I learned then not to make predictions about the timing of the demise of the Kim dynasty.In effect, the emerging framework is a backdoor route to a nuclear cap or to the \u201cfreeze for a freeze\u201d solution that North Korea and China have previously recommended and that Trump has rejected. It may all fall apart. But it\u2019s possible now to envision a path away from war, and for that even we skeptics should be grateful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Faulting a Chinese Tonic, He Got 3 Months in Jail. Then Cheers.", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 For nearly 100 days, a Chinese doctor, Tan Qindong, was jailed for an essay he wrote. He slept beside a toilet, crammed in with other suspects, with little but steamed buns to eat. But his offending article was no dissident political tract.Dr. Tan was arrested for writing online late last year that a popular Chinese tonic liquor appeared to be quack medicine, and a potential \u201cpoison\u201d for many retirees who drink it every day, lured by swarms of ads on daytime television and its claims to be favored by emperors centuries ago.For the Hongmao company, its attempt to silence Dr. Tan has backfired monumentally.Almost overnight, he has become a public hero for challenging the company, which is the mainstay of the economy in Liangcheng County in Inner Mongolia, a region in northern China where it is based. Some seemed to allude to broader lessons about China\u2019s tight restrictions on public debate and criticism.Chinese news outlets and law experts have said that the Hongmao company and its official backers should explain who authorized his arrest and gave the police the power to spirit Dr. Tan 1,700 miles from his home in Guangzhou, a city in China\u2019s far south, to a squalid cell in Liangcheng County.The number of cases of Chinese companies mobilizing the police against critics or commercial rivals has shrunk in recent years, he said.\u201cBut in this Hongmao Medical Tonic case, the role of the public security authorities in local protectionism has again come to the fore,\u201d Professor Wang said. \u201cThe fundamental problem is that for a long time in Chinese law, the boundary between civil and criminal cases has been blurred.\u201dDr. Tan never expected such a ruckus after he published his essay criticizing Hongmao in December. He initially shared his views on a blog, which he said only a few fellow doctors read. He then spread it on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service, where it was viewed more than 2,000 times, according to the police.But the title of Dr. Tan\u2019s article was eye-catching: \u201cChina\u2019s miracle liquor, \u2018Hongmao Medical Tonic,\u2019 a poison from heaven.\u201d Dr. Tan argued that the supposed curative effects of the 67 ingredients said to be used in the alcohol-based elixir were unclear at best, and could be dangerous for people with high blood pressure or diabetes.Hongmao had brushed aside these medical concerns, and its plethora of ads on Chinese television have exaggerated its powers, Dr. Tan wrote. Citing traditional Chinese medical theories, it claimed to relieve ailments like painful joints, frail kidneys, and weakness and anemia in women by combining 67 ingredients from plants and animals.His essay had little initial impact. But in January, when Dr. Tan entered an elevator to his apartment, two men jumped in and showed police badges. They revealed that they were officers, sent from Inner Mongolia to detain and question him. Later, they took Dr. Tan to Liangcheng County by train and a long car ride.\u201cHonestly, that time was not for humans,\u201d Dr. Tan said after his release. \u201cEvery day I slept beside the toilet, every day I ate two and a half pieces of steamed bread. There was no freedom.\u201dDr. Tan said thoughts of suicide crossed his mind before he steadied himself and began to accept that he could be convicted and imprisoned for a year or two. But then this week, a news report mentioned his detention and his case became a national controversy.After the initial reports, the police in Liangcheng County at first insisted that they had plenty of evidence to support their charge.Dr. Tan was freed on a kind of bail. But the investigation has not officially ended, and his lawyer, Hu Dingfeng, said he could still be rearrested. But if the police entirely abandon their case, Dr. Tan may seek compensation from the government, Mr. Hu said in a phone interview.\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic about how this case will go,\u201d Mr. Hu said. \u201cThe case should be withdrawn, but it\u2019s too early to say.\u201d\u201cAfter we heard the news this week, we took the tonic off our shelves,\u201d Han Li, a drugstore manager in Beijing, said in an interview. \u201cThere was not notification from above; we just worried that there\u2019d be a problem.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Dr. Tan Qindong was arrested. As reported elsewhere in the article, it was in January, not December.Advertisement"}

Selahattin Demirtas, the leader of the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party, or HDP \u2014 one of three parties in the nation\u2019s Parliament that oppose President Erdogan\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP \u2014 has been imprisoned, along with eight other HDP lawmakers. Eleven of the party\u2019s 59 lawmakers have been expelled from Parliament.Traditionally, the paper ballots were placed in official envelopes after being stamped by ballot-box officials to prevent voter fraud. The new law stipulates that even ballots missing the stamp of the polling officials will be considered valid, raising fears of ballot stuffing.Ms. Aksener is Mr. Erdogan\u2019s only right-wing challenger in Turkey, where right-wing parties have formed the government for all but 17 months since 1950. She split from the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party last year over differences with the party leader\u2019s decision to support Mr. Erdogan during last April\u2019s referendum on an executive presidency. If she manages to significantly increase her votes, she could hurt Mr. Erdogan.Ms. Aksener\u2019s Good Party could be disqualified from contesting the election because of a shrewd move by Mr. Erdogan in choosing the election date. Turkish electoral law requires a political party to hold its party congress six months before contesting an election. The Good Party misses the June 24 deadline by four days.Turkey has a high electoral threshold, requiring parties to win 10 percent of the national tally before they can gain representation in the legislature. The party is currently polling just under ten percent. Mr. Erdogan has left Ms. Aksener with little time or space to build her nascent faction into a formidable oppositional force.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s other challenger is the imprisoned HDP leader Mr. Demirtas. He is charismatic like Mr. Erdogan and relatable. During the June 2015 elections, he broadened the HDP\u2019s traditionally narrow Kurdish nationalist base by reaching out to liberal Turkish voters. It was first time a pro-Kurdish party crossed the 10 percent electoral threshold and entered the Turkish Parliament.The new Turkish Parliament is most likely to be dominated by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party; the Republican People\u2019s Party, an insipid force that still won 130 out of 550 seats in the last election; and the hard-right MHP, which is allied with Mr. Erdogan and will contest in coalition with his AKP.The executive presidency, which would repose great powers in Mr. Erdogan, will kick in after June 24, and Turkey will formally switch to a new era where the president will be the ultimate head of state, government, police, army and the ruling party.Soner Cagaptay is a senior fellow and director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Goldman booked $10 billion in revenue for the quarter, its highest total in three years and a 25 percent increase over the same period in 2017. It reported profits of $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion a year earlier.Investors were unimpressed. After rallying in early trading on Tuesday, Goldman shares fell more than 1 percent. Its competitors\u2019 shares had followed a similar trajectory, falling or barely moving after they reported quarterly earnings on Friday and Monday.The stock market\u2019s roller-coaster ride in the year\u2019s first quarter enlivened Wall Street. It was a welcome change after a period of steady gains and muted trading activity that depressed bank profits, which are typically driven by frequent changes in the markets.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see a big recovery from last year,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at the investment bank JMP Securities.The upturn in trading was not the only good news for Goldman. The bank has been bulking up its lending business, which Mr. Blankfein has said the bank would rely on to maintain steady growth the next time financial markets start to skid. Goldman said on Sunday that it had bought Clarity Money, a lending app with more than one million users.The increase in lending appeared to pay dividends in the first quarter. Revenue from loans and other debt products rose more than 50 percent compared with last year. The push also helped Goldman take advantage of rising interest rates, which contributed to the business\u2019s $550 million in interest income for the quarter.Investors apparently want something more. The hedge fund manager Douglas Kass said in a message posted on Twitter early Tuesday that he expected Goldman\u2019s stock to drop. \u201cAll the gain relative to expectations came from lower tax rate,\u201d he said.Those in the market for bank stocks have mostly shown little enthusiasm for the biggest institutions\u2019 first-quarter performances, despite their apparent strength.Mr. Ryan of JPM Securities said he was not surprised that banks were recording healthy results because they had gotten plenty of help from the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts and a general improvement in the United States economy. Investors, he said, wanted to know that the banks could continue their stellar performances after the initial stimulus from the tax cuts fades.\u201cPeople are looking for signs of sustainability,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting indications thus far on the earnings calls that the outlook is much better than what\u2019s already been anticipated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Build Dubai of the Balkans, Serbia Deploys Bulldozers and Baseball Bats", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Bojan Bjelobaba, the owner of a carwash and auto-repair shop in Belgrade, says he has been threatened for refusing to vacate his 38-year-old business so that it could be razed to make way for a park.It\u2019s part of a development, with an investment of 3 billion euros, or about $3.6 billion, that is taking shape in Serbia\u2019s capital along the east bank of the Sava River. An extravagant and controversial project known as the Belgrade Waterfront, it is at the heart of a plan by Serbia\u2019s governing elite to transform this aging European metropolis into the Dubai of the Balkans.A married couple, Ivan and Vida Timotijevic, who live smack in the middle of the development, have had their electricity and water cut off because they refuse to budge. If the government has its way, a boulevard will run through the site where their house sits.They are among the last of the holdouts staring down the development.The project of luxury skyscrapers and sprawling shopping malls has become a symbol of the plan of Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vucic, to give the city \u201ca new identity,\u201d removed from the country\u2019s militant past and international isolation.Mr. Vucic \u2014 an ultranationalist during the Balkan wars of the 1990s who turned into a pro-European reformer as he gained more political power \u2014 aims to achieve his goal with borrowed money and revenue from the sale of state land to wealthy bidders from Russia, China and the Gulf States.Critics say the Serbian government is letting nothing stand in the way.Rubble of a former Federal Interior Ministry building, pounded by NATO warplanes in 1999, has been swept away to make way for three towers, built by an Israeli-owned company, AFI Europe Group. And about a mile away, at the waterfront construction, residents have been moved out of their homes.In the view of officials, the protesters miss the broader goals of the waterfront\u2019s redevelopment. \u201cWe want to restore Belgrade to its former glory and make it a great, respectable city again after years of shame that came with wars and unrest,\u201d said the mayor of Belgrade, Sinisa Mali.But it isn\u2019t only the residents directly affected by the project, and complaining of strong-arm tactics, who object to the way the development is being carried out.Before construction began, two years ago, 231 families were moved from state-owned property for the project, but some refused to leave. One night, about 30 masked men with baseball bats and heavy equipment appeared at the site. By dawn, several residential and business buildings had been razed to allow construction to start.The raid, in 2016, shocked Serbs, who took their anger to the streets, denouncing what they said were the elite\u2019s corrupt practices. The protests morphed into the largest antigovernment demonstrations since a popular uprising toppled the Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 2000.The financial backing for the development has also raised concerns about a lack of transparency and excessive foreign influence. The Belgrade Waterfront project is being funded by an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, Eagle Hills Properties, which signed a contract with the Serbian government in 2015.The multibillion-dollar investment is just part of a flood of money from the United Arab Emirates that has been flowing into Serbia.Mohammed bin Zayed, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, has identified Serbia as the main destination in the western Balkans for his country\u2019s efforts to diversify its economy before oil runs out.It started in 2013, when Mr. Mali brokered a deal with Etihad, the national carrier of the United Arab Emirates, to buy a 49 percent stake in Serbia\u2019s state-owned and near-bankrupt Jat Airways, restructuring it under the name Air Serbia and turning the Belgrade airport into a regional hub.The Emirates also signed an agreement with Serbia\u2019s government to invest in developing farmland and to purchase state-owned agricultural companies. And they are pouring money into Serbia\u2019s defense industry, including aerospace manufacturing.Many Serbs have questioned the way the deals between Serbia and the United Arab Emirates have been worked out behind closed doors. But the Emirati leader likes the top-down decision making, analysts say, and Serbia\u2019s president likes to see cash flow into the country without the regulations and safeguards Western investors expect.\u201cTheir political cultures are in many ways compatible \u2014 it\u2019s U.A.E. sultanisim meets the Balkans\u2019 authoritarianism,\u201d said Tena Prelec, a researcher on southeastern Europe at the London School of Economics and the co-author of a paper on Emirati investments in Serbia.But the Belgrade Waterfront project has been the most contested undertaking using money from the Gulf.At the waterfront, two residential buildings shaped like a wave are nearly complete. The first owners of the most expensive address in Belgrade, a city of two million people, will pay as much as \u20ac7,000 euros per square meter, or about $8,500, in a country with an average monthly salary of \u20ac375 euros, or about $455.In all, 5,700 homes and eight hotels will be built in the development between the river and the railway tracks running to the city\u2019s 19th-century Central Train Station.About a mile of cement tiles has been laid along the river to form a brand-new boardwalk, dotted with children\u2019s slides, a boat landing, a restaurant, a bike lane and a fence of giant posters depicting buildings to be constructed in the next 30 years. Those include the largest shopping mall in the Balkans.\u201cWe are trying to do everything anew without breaking the city\u2019s bond to its past,\u201d Mr. Mali insisted. \u201cWhat\u2019s important for us now is to have fast trains, sprawling highways and beautiful buildings to live and work in. That\u2019s the measure of our success these days \u2014 not how much territory we\u2019ve conquered in a war with our neighbors.\u201dBut Bojan Kovacevic, president of Serbia\u2019s Academy of Architects, called the Belgrade Waterfront development a \u201ccrime against urban planning.\u201d He says the Dubai-like skyscrapers and walled-off neighborhood modeled on the Persian Gulf\u2019s gated communities have no place in a city like Belgrade.\u201cHe\u2019s building a Forbidden City in the heart of Belgrade,\u201d Mr. Kovacevic said of the president. \u201cHe keeps saying it\u2019s a new identity and he\u2019s the one shaping it. But did he ask us if we want a new identity? Have we debated it? Have the experts been consulted?\u201dSome residents continue to resist. Mr. Bjelobaba, the owner the auto-repair business, said that a construction explosion went off recently while he was working in the shop and a wall collapsed.\u201cIt was not a coincidence. It was not an accident,\u201d he said, adding that it was a sign that the authorities were stepping up pressure to make him leave the property.The Timotijevics, who live on their pensions, refuse to move into temporary accommodations before receiving what they call adequate compensation.\u201cI am waiting for the bulldozers to come,\u201d Mr. Timotijevic said. \u201cI am not leaving my property.

{"Headline": "Qualcomm May Be Collateral Damage in a U.S.-China Trade War", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A looming trade war between the United States and China has put Qualcomm, one of America\u2019s largest technology companies, squarely in the middle of the battlefield.A major supplier in both China and the United States, the San Diego-based chip maker has long managed to play the trading relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies to its advantage. But an escalating trade battle over which country will dominate the technologies of the future is now threatening Qualcomm\u2019s business and its growth.In China, Qualcomm\u2019s plan to acquire NXP Semiconductors, a critical part of its growth strategy, has been stalled by a prolonged antitrust review, a move critics see as Chinese retaliation for President Trump\u2019s aggressive trade moves. On Thursday, Chinese officials said that Qualcomm will have to make more concessions to compensate for the market power it would enjoy after completing the deal, without providing details.Qualcomm\u2019s situation illustrates the perils of trying to punish a major trading partner that has become a crucial link in supply chains stretching across the globe. By targeting foreign players with ties to their own markets, the United States and China are putting their own economic futures at risk. The question is whether the Trump administration will balk at paying that price \u2014 or see its goal of punishing China for unfair trade practices as more important than any collateral damage that could ensue.\u201cThey\u2019re obviously really caught in the middle,\u201d Andrew Gilholm, the director of analysis for greater China at Control Risks, said of Qualcomm. \u201cThe demands the Chinese government has on them, and the demands coming from the U.S. side, at some point might become irreconcilable.\u201dThe cold war that is emerging between the United States and China is increasingly centered on the kind of advanced computer chips that Qualcomm produces. The company\u2019s chips are now common in smartphones, but they also serve as the basis of next-generation 5G systems, vast networks of sensors that may soon govern the function of everything from autonomous vehicles to smart power grids and manufacturing systems. Qualcomm is locked in competition with China\u2019s Huawei for dominance of this new industry.The emergence of this technology means that, for the Trump administration, national security is no longer confined to airplanes, tanks and weapons systems. Since these chips allow companies to collect vast amounts of information, control critical infrastructure and know the location of people and objects in real time, foreign ownership could pose an unprecedented security threat.The administration\u2019s focus on Qualcomm\u2019s technology may be partially of the company\u2019s own making. Earlier this year, the company asked the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which evaluates foreign acquisitions for national security threats, to intervene as it faced a hostile takeover attempt by Singapore-based Broadcom.Daniel H. Rosen, a partner at the research firm Rhodium Group, said policymakers worldwide are just now discovering that using foreign technology creates vulnerabilities that have outpaced governments\u2019 ability to manage them.\u201cThis is not just a China-U.S. phenomenon, but a matter of things which just a few years ago we thought were relatively benign now being weaponized in ways that we haven\u2019t anticipated,\u201d he said.But trying to clamp down on Chinese products and investment flowing into the United States could be more painful for American companies that depend on access to partners and markets around the world than for their Chinese counterparts.While China has already threatened tariffs of its own on United States products, it has other ways to retaliate \u2014 most notably, making life difficult for the many American businesses that depend on the country to source products or sell to China\u2019s growing middle class.For Qualcomm, that may already be happening. Its plan to expand its business into technology-connected vehicles depends in large part on acquiring a Dutch firm, NXP Semiconductors, for $44 billion. The deal has been approved by every government except for China, whose regulators have asked for more time to assess any antitrust violations.On Thursday, Gao Feng, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, said that the acquisition could have a \u201cprofound\u201d impact on the technology industry but that the plan Qualcomm submitted to the regulator on how it would mitigate market competition issues would not be enough.Many observers believe that China is using the review as leverage to exert pressure on the United States, which sees Qualcomm\u2019s success as critical to American dominance in 5G.\u201cAt a time when there is so much trade friction, Chinese regulators don\u2019t necessarily need to stall the deal. They just need to continue postponing the review,\u201d said Guan Zhisheng, an associate professor of economics at Sun Yat-sen University.If trade tensions between the United States and China continue, American companies \u2014 especially those that use China as a platform to export to the United States \u2014 could see themselves embroiled in more time-consuming regulatory reviews revolving around pricing, monopoly power, food and drug safety, or bribery, Mr. Gilholm of Control Risks said. \u201cThat is another potentially very powerful front in this that China has not really used yet,\u201d he said.Qualcomm\u2019s bottom line is also likely to be hurt by American efforts to target the Chinese. On Monday, the United States government said it was placing a seven-year ban on exports of American products to Chinese telecom firm ZTE, after the company made false statements to the government as part of an investigation into possible violations of American sanctions.Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, said this will be a considerable blow to the company, which provided chips for more than half of the roughly 45 million smartphones that ZTE sold globally last year. Qualcomm declined to comment.Qualcomm has found itself under an increasingly uncomfortable spotlight in China in recent years. By 2013, the company was deriving more revenue from China than any other market, just as the Chinese government began expressing concern that its companies were forced to depend on the network infrastructure of American technology giants like Qualcomm and Cisco.In late 2013, Chinese government investigators raided the Beijing and Shanghai offices of Qualcomm. After a 15-month investigation, regulators handed the company a record $975 million fine and declared Qualcomm a monopoly. The firm was forced to slash prices and pledge to move more of its sophisticated manufacturing to China and help boost the technological abilities of Chinese companies. Today, a growing chorus of American companies have complained that China has pressured them into sharing their technology in similar ways.If China wanted to retaliate, Mr. Fang said, the simplest option would be to emulate American actions toward Huawei. \u201cThey could ban products from Qualcomm, Intel and Cisco in government, infrastructure and other areas of the market, based on security concerns,\u201d he added.In targeting Qualcomm, China could be seeking to influence the Trump administration by putting pressure on a company that has been politically connected in the United States, often serving as an unofficial liaison between the countries.Over the years, Qualcomm has lobbied the United States government to further its interests in China, at one point helping to pave the way for China to join the World Trade Organization. In the late 1990s, Clinton administration officials pushed China to adopt American standards for mobile phones on behalf of Qualcomm.But Qualcomm\u2019s ability to influence the White House is unclear: The Trump administration has focused on recruiting American companies to build up their businesses domestically, not encouraging them to go abroad.\u201cYes, the Chinese have a way to squeeze Qualcomm to really hurt their China revenue, and yes, Qualcomm has fought a lot of battles in the U.S. government arena,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThe one weakness in the Chinese approach is it\u2019s not clear the Trump administration cares about how much U.S. firms make in China.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of Guan Zhisheng. He is an associate professor at Sun Yat-sen University, not an assistant professor. It also misstated the location of NXP Semiconductors. It is based in the Netherlands, not Denmark.Ana Swanson reported from Washington and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong. Cao Li contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Era of Very Low Inflation and Interest Rates May Be Near an End", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoves in global bond markets over the last few months suggest changing expectations about prices.For years, the world economy has been trapped in a low-inflation, low-interest-rate rut. Yet the latest shifts in global markets suggest that this could, at long last, be ending. You see a similar pattern in the bond prices of other advanced nations. For example, German 10-year yields rose to 0.64 percent Wednesday from 0.31 percent in September.If this really is the start of a resetting of inflation and interest rates toward more historically normal levels, it will be mostly good news for the world economy. Central bankers have spent years trying unsuccessfully to get inflation to the 2 percent level many of them aim for. In many ways the low interest rates of recent years have been a reflection of economic weakness around the globe. So as long as the moves don\u2019t go too far, increases in inflation and interest rates would be a sign the global economy is returning to a more prosperous equilibrium like the one that prevailed before 2008.The shift looks to be driven mostly by a rise in investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation. In the United States, prices of inflation-protected bonds imply that investors currently expect consumer prices to rise 2.09 percent annually over the next five years, up from 1.65 percent expected in September.That, in turn, partly reflects a sharp run-up in oil prices over the same period, which seems likely to push up consumer prices for gasoline and other fuels in the months ahead. But strikingly, inflation expectations for the period between five and 10 years from now have also risen, when the impact of the recent oil price rise should have long since passed.A number of factors are involved in this shift. Economic growth is solid across almost all of the world\u2019s major economies for the first time in a decade, meaning there should be upward pressure on demand for all sorts of raw materials.And with the United States closing in on full employment (or arguably already there), the Federal Reserve is looking more confident than it has in years in its intentions to keep raising interest rates.Trump administration policies may also be playing a role.New tax cuts and spending legislation will result in hundreds of billions of dollars more in Treasury bonds being issued in the years ahead than had seemed likely not that long ago. This means the government may need to pay higher interest rates to find buyers of that debt. And if threats of a trade war with China or other countries turn into reality, this will tend to increase inflation, driving up prices both directly through new tariffs on imported goods and indirectly by encouraging less efficient production.All of those forces are doing battle with longer-standing pressures in the other direction that have been in place since the global financial crisis a decade ago. This includes a chronic shortage of demand for goods and services and declining growth in the working-age population in many rich countries.There have been fake-outs in bond and commodity markets on this front before, including in the second half of 2013 and in the months surrounding President Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory. This could be another one, and reverse itself soon enough.But in the meantime, you can view the higher volatility in the stock market in the last couple of months as a consequence of this standoff between forces of inflation versus deflation, between higher interest rates and lower rates, and between a world economy straining against the limits of its capacity versus one that still is working through chronic oversupply.On Tuesday, when long-term Treasury rates soared, the stock market fell, as investors tried to assess the consequences of this higher-rate environment for stocks.After nine years of economic expansion and rising stock prices, the market is richly valued relative to earnings. Each $100 invested in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 currently generates only $4.78 in earnings at Tuesday\u2019s closing price. That low return might be tolerable when money invested in an ultrasafe Treasury bond \u2014 or even in a savings account \u2014 generates very low returns. As a reminder, stock market volatility skyrocketed in early February upon publication of new wage data suggesting that inflation pressures might be building, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster.In the short run, markets can be shaped by all kinds of things, whether algorithmic trading or a run of bad news for a major company or a presidential tweet. But in the longer run, economic fundamentals are powerful forces. And if this really is the turning point toward something more closely resembling the pre-2008 inflation and interest rate environment \u2014 still a big if \u2014 it will have an impact for nearly everyone, not just people with money to invest.Advertisement"}

We have two such men much closer to home.Is there any wonder that our streets are dirtier, our subways are falling apart, our infrastructure is crumbling, the number of homeless on the streets is climbing and our children are not being well educated? All of these concerns apparently are not as important as the fragile egos of the men elected to address them.I have only two words for Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio: Grow up!CAROL NADELL, NEW YORKTo the Editor:The bitterness of feuds between governors and mayors over the years points to an institutional source for these conflicts. That source is the state\u2019s control over many city functions and undue influence over others. The framework is dysfunctional: Governors can interfere when it is convenient for their personal political agendas and neglect legitimate city needs when it suits them.Forty-three percent of the state\u2019s population lives in New York City, and millions more in the near suburbs depend on city services for work or well-being. Yet the governor has no meaningful obligation to partner in the development and execution of effective policies for the city. If called to account for city problems, the governor can always blame the mayor.Somewhere, Norman Mailer and Jimmy Breslin \u2014 who when running for mayor and City Council president in 1969 called for New York City to become the 51st state \u2014 are saying, \u201cI told you so.\u201dPHILIP SILLER, NEW YORKTo the Editor:The citizens of New York City must demand that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio appear at a public forum to explain to the residents of the city \u2014 as well as to tourists and to commuters who work in the city \u2014 why the transit system is utterly dysfunctional and why they are not able to come to an agreement about how and when to fix it.Millions of us depend on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority every day, yet none of us can reliably predict whether or not we will be able to arrive at our workplaces, meetings, job interviews, court appointments, doctor appointments or children\u2019s schools on time. For many of us, the unreliability of the subways and buses results in docked wages, extra child care costs, lost jobs, evictions and other grave consequences.Neither of them will take responsibility for a situation that, if not fixed, will cripple the city and eventually the state economy.AMY WILKINS, BROOKLYNAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Opioid Crisis Foretold", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.One of the more distressing truths of America\u2019s opioid epidemic, which now kills tens of thousands of people every year, is that it isn\u2019t the first such crisis. Across the 19th and 20th centuries, the United States, China and other countries saw drug abuse surge as opium and morphine were used widely as recreational drugs and medicine. In the West, doctors administered morphine liberally to their patients, while families used laudanum, an opium tincture, as a cure-all, including for pacifying colicky children. In China, many millions of people were hooked on smoking opium. In the mid-1800s, the British went into battle twice \u2014 bombing forts and killing thousands of civilians and soldiers alike \u2014 to keep the Chinese market open to drug imports in what would become known as the Opium Wars.That history has either been forgotten or willfully ignored by many in the medical and political establishments.WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFOREMr. Courtwright says that this was not a simple case of historical amnesia. In the earlier epidemic, doctors \u201cmade mistakes, but it was a bad situation to begin with,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no equivalent of Purdue Pharma flying you off to the Bahamas for the weekend to tell you about the wonders of these new drugs.\u201dWHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?The AIDS crisis might provide public officials some lessons for how to move forward. Like with opioids, the federal government responded to that epidemic by doing next to nothing for many years. But an organized movement led in part by people with H.I.V. and gay activists eventually forced Congress to create and fund new programs. For example, in 1990 Congress approved the Ryan White Care Act, a bipartisan bill that poured billions of dollars into providing treatment and support to people with H.I.V. By 1995, the federal government was spending $3.3 billion a year (about $5.4 billion today after adjusting for inflation) on AIDS efforts, not including billions spent through mandatory programs like Medicaid and Medicare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That was up from just $116 million in 1985.Though slow to act, Congress eventually treated AIDS as a complex, multidimensional problem and tackled it by funding prevention, treatment, support services and research. Lawmakers provided money to make expensive antiretroviral drugs accessible to more people and allocated money to help house people infected with H.I.V., recognizing that they needed more than just access to drugs.Leaders in both parties are responsible for this crisis. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and members of Congress did too little to stop it in its earlier stages. While Mr. Trump talks a lot about the problem, he seems to have few good ideas for what to do about it. As we\u2019ve learned the hard way, without stronger leadership, the opioid epidemic will continue to wreak havoc across the country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cubans Doubt a Change at the Top Will Bring Change at the Bottom", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAVANA \u2014 The streets brimmed with people going about their day, hauling handcarts of fruit down narrow side streets, shuffling along sun-faded esplanades, waiting impatiently at the crosswalks of busy intersections.Rather, the long-awaited transition was a seamless and carefully managed affair, cloaked in the quiet formalism of a modest ceremony before the nation\u2019s national assembly.He stood in the sun accompanied by his friend Ulises Menendez, an electrician, who nodded quietly and added: \u201cIllusions are a terrible thing in Cuba. You cannot have them because you never know what will happen and we are tired of disappointment.\u201dThere is a serious lag between change at the top and change on the bottom in Cuba.After Ra\u00fal Castro officially took over the presidency from his brother Fidel in 2008, he pushed through unprecedented reforms to open up the economy and chart a new future. That included brokering a deal to make peace with the United States, which paved the way for a flood of well-heeled American visitors that is now, under President Trump, slowing drastically.Here on the island, many feel deflated by so much promise with so little impact on their daily lives. They express a sense of a hopelessness \u2014 a disappointment more deeply felt because of all the anticipation that preceded it.Those economic reforms? Some have failed to materialize, while the most successful \u2014 the issuing of licenses to start small businesses \u2014 has all but stalled as the state deliberates how to move forward. The rapprochement with the United States? President Trump all but torpedoed it, at least in tone. Even the island\u2019s historic escape valves \u2014 visas and undocumented migration to the United States \u2014 have been turned off.In the most recent blow, the United States Embassy in Havana vastly reduced its staff and stopped issuing visas to Cubans after dozens of its personnel were mysteriously sickened in what the State Department has described as attacks of unknown origin.That happened after the immigration pipeline of Cubans trying to reach the United States had already been abruptly squeezed by the Obama administration. Before leaving office, President Barack Obama put an end to the longstanding policy known as wet-foot-dry-foot, which allowed Cubans who made it to American soil or border crossings without a visa to stay in the United States.Now the Trump administration\u2019s decision to shut down many of the functions of the Havana embassy is making it even harder for Cubans to head north.Without an operating consular office, Cubans had to travel to Colombia earlier this year to even apply for their visas, a costly endeavor considering that their average salaries amount to about $1 a day. Today, that pipeline has been blocked, too. Visa issuance for Cubans hoping to visit their families in the United States is now being done from Guyana.\u201cThere are thousands of parents who have children in the U.S. and who are not going to be able to visit them,\u201d said one Cuban doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she and her partner are trying to leave the country without permission. \u201cWith Obama, there was a big step forward because relations were reestablished. And now just because of Trump\u2019s whim, things have become worse than ever.\u201dIt is still unclear exactly how Mr. Trump\u2019s promised reversal of Obama administration policies will play out over the long haul. Some American visitors to Cuba say they did not take any measures to come to the island that were not already in place following the opening of relations between the two nations.In the first quarter of 2018, visits to the island from non-Cuban Americans dropped by nearly 60 percent, according to government figures.For Cubans who have been fortunate enough to find work in the booming tourism industry, the results have been devastating.N\u00e1yade Trini\u00f1o Ginori, a 44-year-old teacher who joined the wave of private-sector opportunities as a tour guide, says she has not hosted a group of Americans since last June. While leading tours, she earned about $100 a day, an enormous sum in Cuba \u2014 100 times her state salary as a teacher.\u201cBecause of the policies of the new U.S. president, I\u2019m out of work,\u201d she said.For now, she has decided to return to teaching, at a slightly better salary than before, but nowhere near what her tourism job paid.Feeling trapped is nothing new to Cubans. Many stayed in the country during its toughest periods either because they could not find a way to leave or because of their commitment to the ideals extolled by Fidel Castro.But today, some feel as though they are in a pressure cooker, or a fishbowl, looking out at the world from the confines of Cuba yet unable to participate.Alejandro Rodriguez, 29, a popular DJ in Havana, scrolled through his Facebook feed on a recent night with envy.He shook his head.\u201cHe\u2019s gone, she\u2019s gone,\u201d he said, ticking off the friends who have fled. \u201cPeople are leaving any way they can.\u201dMidway through a scroll, he stopped.\u201cThis guy just claimed political asylum in France on his layover to Russia,\u201d he said with grudging admiration. \u201cWhat a move.\u201dThe very idea of a political transition to a new Cuban president makes little sense to him \u2014 especially one he expected to propagate the same reality.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was this transition happening, and I would bet that most of my neighbors didn\u2019t know either,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s not important. It\u2019s just that whatever happens up there doesn\u2019t trickle down to us. S o why does it matter?\u201dLike others in his generation, the future seems a distant concern, perhaps more of an idea than a reality. With so much reform and so little change, daily life is where hopes begin and end.As Cuba\u2019s new president traded off at the podium with the old one at the National Assembly this week, residents in the neighborhood of La Ceiba took to other forms of entertainment. They huddled in a worn down park, browsing the relatively new luxury of public internet that has come to Havana in recent years.It was a midmorning affair, with well-groomed youth staring down at cellphones, dashing off messages or chatting with family abroad. Nearby, parked outside of the neighborhood bodega with a few friends, Luis Ernesto Rodriguez, 28, sized up his day.As a construction worker, he helps build and finish houses, irregular work that earns him less than $80 a month. Today, however, he was off.\u201cThe people I am working for can\u2019t afford to buy the materials, so what can I do?\u201d he said. \u201cHere, it\u2019s day-to-day.\u201dOlder men worked along the periphery of the denuded space, collecting trash or fixing cars.\u201cThe youth of today are different from us,\u201d said Alberto Gonzalez, a 54-year-old trash collector whose pushcart was littered with glass bottles and refuse. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see firsthand the benefits of the revolution that we did.\u201dHe and at least some of his generation buy into Cuba\u2019s social compact. They have seen better times, and to them working toward a common prosperity amounts to more than just words.Still, life is hard. On his base salary of about $10 a month, there are few luxuries for Mr. Gonzalez. Beers cost $1 a piece, after all. Though in some ways he resents the young men and women sitting around in the park and not working, he understands.\u201cToday,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is nothing for the youth.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described adjustments to immigration policy under the Obama administration. President Barack Obama did not end the Cuban adjustment act. He ended \u201cwet foot dry foot,\u201d a rule that allowed Cubans who arrived without visas to remain in the United States.Hannah Berkeley Cohen and Ed Augustin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Post-Campaign Campaign of Donald Trump", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "FeatureHe has been president for more than a year \u2014 so why is he still holding rallies?Supported bySaccone took the stage briefly before Trump did, and his people were circulating in the hangar: normal-looking suburban Republican operatives and volunteers of the sort who are still jarring to see attached to the Trump roadshow, like insurance-claims adjusters piled into the bed of a monster truck. But this was a Trump event in spirit: the email advisory from Donald J. Trump for President Inc., his official presidential campaign committee, described it as a \u201ccampaign rally\u201d but did not mention Saccone, explaining instead that Trump would \u201chighlight the benefits that his historic tax cuts are providing hard-working families across Pennsylvania and to celebrate our booming economy now that America is once again open for business.\u201d Onstage, Trump seemed to intermittently remember the tax cuts and the booming economy, and even more intermittently that he was supposed to be promoting the candidate, whom he had reportedly derided in private as \u201cweak.\u201d But he mostly did what he usually does at his rallies: recite the latest verse of the ballad of Donald Trump, the president who would be doing great things for the people in this room were it not for his many antagonists.This evening, he was talking about Peggy Noonan, the conservative Wall Street Journal columnist. (\u201cShe\u2019s a Bushie!\u201d an older man next to me yelled scornfully.) Noonan had apparently written something, or (more likely) said something on cable news, where she appears often as a pearl-necklaced avatar of political normalcy, about Trump\u2019s appearing inadequately presidential. \u201cI\u2019m very presidential!\u201d Trump told us, with mock indignation. Then he stiffened in his suit and adopted a stentorian tone, like a fourth grader doing an impression of his school principal. \u201cLaaaadies and gentlemen,\u201d he intoned, \u201cthank you for being here tonight. Rick Saccone will be a great, great congressman. He will help me very much. He\u2019s a fine man, and Yong is a wonderful wife. I just want to tell you on behalf of the United States of America that we appreciate your service. And to all of the military out there, we respect you very much. Thank you. Thank you.\u201d He broke character for a second: \u201cAnd then you go, \u2018God bless you, and God bless the United States of America, thank you very much.\u2019\u2009\u201d He turned and faced the V.I.P. guests in the riser behind him, and did a sort of rigid penguin walk.The crowd whooped and laughed \u2014 not the cruel laughter you come to know at Trump rallies but real belly laughter, for what was a genuinely funny bit. Trump, who loves nothing more than being loved, kept penguin-walking, and everyone kept laughing. It took a few more seconds for the spectacular strangeness of the moment to settle in: We were watching a sitting American president imitating an American president.Except now, he wasn\u2019t. Watching Trump step into the archetype momentarily and then just as quickly step out, it hit me: Even in Trump\u2019s mind, that president was someone else, somewhere else. It was as if I were sitting on a commercial flight, at cruising altitude, when the pilot suddenly plopped down in the next seat, commiserated about the tarmac delays and poor in-flight service, then popped an Ambien and went to sleep.By the time the first dates of the tour were announced, on Nov. 29, it had been tactfully rechristened a \u201cthank-you tour\u201d: nine rallies in nine states throughout December. \u201cI was with the advance team yesterday, and they\u2019re showing me all the different places he\u2019s going in the next two weeks,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, at the time a member of the executive committee of Trump\u2019s transition team, told the Fox Business Network\u2019s Maria Bartiromo. \u201cThis is a guy who doesn\u2019t give up.\u201dHe didn\u2019t: After taking a few weeks in January and February to be inaugurated and acquaint himself with the business of running the country, Trump held another rally. He has been holding them regularly ever since, sometimes as often as twice a month. His itinerary has not once diverged from the states on his electoral map; he had been to the exact same hangar in Moon two days before winning Pennsylvania in 2016. There have been 20 rallies in all, give or take a couple that might be construed as more conventional presidential appearances \u2014 though it is hard for even these to not take on the character of a Trump rally when he takes the stage. They amount to one of the few sustained, continuous projects of his presidency, and represent a genuinely novel contribution to the theater of American politics: a \u201cBasement Tapes\u201d of the Trump years, a never-ending tour with stakes perpetually hazy and unclear.From the beginning, I thought it would be important to witness these rallies, and I went as often as I could. Whenever I did, I was confronted with the question of what it was, precisely, that I expected to witness. Was it the people who turned out to see him? I was curious, at first, who they would be \u2014 who would show up for what were, in effect, campaign rallies for a campaign that ended months ago. I interviewed them, diligently filling notebooks:I walked in here, somebody told me to [expletive] off. I\u2019m a Nazi \u2019cause I\u2019m going in here. This guy outside, he says, \u2018Nazis should die!\u2019 O.K., I\u2019m with you! I\u2019m on the same side! I\u2019m not a [expletive] Nazi!I liked everybody but Trump and Ted Cruz. But because he was our nominee, I voted for him. I\u2019ve warmed up to him. I just wish he would, uh, calm it down a little bit? With the tweeting?But you\u2019ve read all this before, haven\u2019t you? The spectrum of people at these rallies was not appreciably different from the spectrum at Trump\u2019s actual campaign rallies, which was itself fairly representative of the broader rallygoing Republican electorate in 2016 \u2014 and interviewing people at campaign events, as every reporter believes secretly but is not allowed to admit, is almost always a waste of time for everyone involved in the exchange, like asking Mets fans at a Mets game why they like the Mets.These rallies rarely produced news, and what news they produced was usually limited to something Trump said, which meant you could just as easily cover it from the comfort of your own couch, thanks to the handful of live-broadcasting TV crews that was always packed onto a riser in the back of the venue. These people served double duty as a hate totem for the events, the most reliable targets for ritual humiliation from the stage. Huddled around their tripods, buffeted by thousands of boos and obscenities, they called to mind weathercasters lashed to telephone poles, early-Dan Rather-style, in a hurricane. Their footage, chopped up and YouTubed and GIFed and John Olivered, would be injected into the infinitely subdividing capillaries of social-media outrage in near real time. Sometimes at the rallies, I would look at these camera crews and then open Twitter on my phone, watch it welling up with cascades of disbelief at whichever deliberately disbelief-inducing thing Trump had just said, and wonder what the point of any of us being there was.Only a man like this could conceive of a permanent campaign, extending infinitely after Election Day, as something desirable. From the first, the postelection rallies were bemoaned as, at best, a waste of presidential time, but this missed their peculiar intimacy. To feel as if you were witnessing something essential and true about Barack Obama, you would have had to see him alone in his study late at night. To witness the same of Trump, you have to stand among thousands gathered to see him \u2014 and see him seeing you seeing him.This was in Melbourne, Fla., last February \u2014 Trump\u2019s first rally after taking office. He was in Mar-a-Lago mode, open-collared and visibly at ease, more so than he had been at any point since Inauguration Day. Five days earlier, Michael Flynn, his national security adviser, had resigned over Flynn\u2019s contacts with Russian officials, and Trump had asked the F.B.I. director, James Comey, to stop investigating him. One of the largest single-day demonstrations in American history had been staged in protest of Trump \u2014 less as a president than as a human being \u2014 dwarfing his own inauguration\u2019s attendance. His travel ban was gummed up in federal court. But this wasn\u2019t Washington, or the Fourth Circuit; it was Florida, \u201cmy second home,\u201d as Trump had described it. \u201cCome here \u2014 let him up, I\u2019m not worried about him,\u201d he said as the man made his way to the stage. \u201cHop over the fence! He can do it \u2014 look, this guy\u2019s in great shape. This guy is great \u2014 don\u2019t worry about him.\u201dThe man\u2019s name, it would later be ascertained, was Gene Huber. He was a car salesman from Boynton Beach, very tan, with a close-cropped corona of graying hair, in good shape just as the president said, wearing a commemorative T-shirt from Trump\u2019s inauguration featuring the same presidential seal as the lectern behind which he now embraced Trump in a bear hug. \u201cThis guy! He\u2019s been all over television, saying the best things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSay a couple words.\u201d\u201cMr. President, thank you, sir!\u201d Huber said, slightly wild-eyed with adrenaline, looking not at Trump but at the cameras. \u201cWe the people, our movement, is the reason why our president of the United States is standing in front of us today. When President Trump, during the election, promised all these things he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us.\u201d\u201cIt is great to be back in the incredible, beautiful, great state of Iowa!\u201d Trump said, as he took the stage in Cedar Rapids the following evening. \u201cHome of the greatest wrestlers in the world, including our friend Dan Gable \u2014 some of the great, great wrestlers of the world, right? We love those wrestlers.\u201dIt was five months into his presidency by then, and five rallies. In Nashville in March, Trump railed against the judge in Hawaii who issued an injunction against his revised travel ban \u2014 \u201cThis ruling makes us look weak!\u201d \u2014 and against his own staff, which had advised him to revise it in the first place. Five days later, the same day James Comey was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee about Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump was at another rally, this time in Louisville, Ky., talking about Colin Kaepernick: \u201cThere was an article today that reported that N.F.L. owners don\u2019t want to pick him up because they don\u2019t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump!\u201dThe rallies had ceased to be the curiosity they were at first. Out of basic psychological necessity, if nothing else, the country was learning to metabolize the Trump presidency\u2019s daily news barrage, of which the rallies were but one minor component, another assaultive stream of words and images entering the public consciousness in a disembodied, decontextualized way: Here was Trump, shouting somewhere. At the events, you would be reminded, with some surprise, that these moments occurred at fixed coordinates in space and time, as opposed to simply materializing in the news cycle in which the country was now trapped, 24 hours a day, by virtue of Trump\u2019s own unwavering attention to it.The texture of this was familiar to anyone who watched Trump during the campaign. The conventional speech was there, nominally, a formal structure around which Trump improvised, embroidering it with anecdotes that may or may not have happened, turning over parts of the speech in the light and opening up the back end of it to show the audience, to let them in on the secrets, to convey a sense that he was leveling with the people who had the good sense to be there at that moment, offering a sensation of truth if not always the complete thing (Iowa\u2019s state health-insurance exchange had lost most of its providers, but not all of them). It was fun to listen to, because Trump \u2014 and this is still perhaps the most incredible thing about his candidacy, in retrospect \u2014 was somehow the first politician in however many decades of modern American political oratory to capitalize on the fact that nobody likes listening to modern American political oratory.There was also a dissonance to these speeches, however, now that Trump had settled into his presidency. Before the election, his subversion of the forms of American politics served to underscore the basic argument of his campaign, which was that America\u2019s problems could be solved easily if you overthrew the country\u2019s governing class, with all their idiocies of convention. But Trump and his voters had done exactly that, and America\u2019s problems had not instantly disappeared. One of Trump\u2019s more reliable impulses is evading responsibility, and he spent much of these speeches herding together the scapegoats \u2014 the media, the recalcitrant Democrats, the F.B.I., the system \u2014 who might account for his situation, without appearing to realize that he was drawing the self-portrait of a man who had wanted power but gotten authority instead.The afternoon before the rally, I was settling into my seat in an American Airlines Airbus on the runway in Charlotte, N.C., when the pilot got on the intercom: \u201cIf everyone could take their seats quickly, please,\u201d he said, a note of apologetic bewilderment in his voice, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to beat Air Force One into Phoenix today.\u201d Trump, he explained, was due into Phoenix around the same time we were. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get in ahead of them, we\u2019re going to be put in a holding pattern.\u201dA groan went up from the passengers. \u201cI got held up in Florida by Air Force One for four hours,\u201d a woman sitting behind me grumbled.Across the aisle, an older man was saying something about Joe Biden and his Secret Service entourage taking up whole cars on Amtrak between Washington and Wilmington. \u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d he protested, \u201cboth sides do this!\u201d And so we hurtled west in our climate-controlled specimen vial of the national argument, trying desperately to outrun the man at the center of it.It was 107 degrees in Phoenix, and outside the downtown convention center paramedics with IV bags balanced on their shoulders were tending to rallygoers who had succumbed to the heat; an elderly woman in a Hawaiian shirt had toppled out of the V.I.P. line and was vomiting on the pavement. Inside, I passed a man wearing pleated khaki slacks and a sweat-drenched sleeveless undershirt with an American flag draped over his shoulders, serape-style, as if he were on his way to see Mad Max\u2019s keynote address at CPAC. It was possible that the events in Charlottesville had depressed turnout, but it seemed just as possible that it was the heat, and the prospect of waiting outside for hours in it to file into a convention center that, when I got inside, was full, but not packed as other rallies had been.Trump recited from all of his post-Charlottesville news releases; he had them printed out. \u201cI said, \u2018Racism is evil.\u2019 Now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there, and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am. But I mean, do you ever see anything \u2014 and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings. Because they\u2019re putting like seven people all negative on Trump! And they fired Jeffrey Lord \u2014 poor Jeffrey. Jeffrey Lord.\u201dThe crowd cheered for its newfound elitism, but the energy in the room was sagging palpably. It had been a long, hot day. They were still heckling the TV people in the media pen, but it felt unfocused, pro forma. \u201cSo the point is \u2014 and I didn\u2019t want to bore you, because you understand where I\u2019m coming from. You people understand. But the point is, that those were three different \u2014 there were two statements and one news conference. The words were perfect. They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain. But they don\u2019t put on those words. And they don\u2019t put on me saying those words.\u201dThe adjective I instinctively reached for, watching it, was \u201cNixonian,\u201d but even Nixon generally confined this kind of thing to the White House tapes. Trump\u2019s very public spleen-venting more closely resembled that of Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s vice president and the reluctant and disastrous steward of Reconstruction after his death. In February 1866, after Congress tried and failed to override Johnson\u2019s veto of a law providing federal protections for freed slaves, he gave an impromptu speech to his supporters in which he compared his Senate antagonists to Confederate generals, fulminated about supposed assassination plots against him, and in the space of barely an hour, used his own name more than 200 times. Congress impeached him two years later.\u201cThis was a Castro speech in length,\u201d Rick Wilson, the Republican strategist, was saying on the CNN-equipped flat screens at the Phoenix airport as I waited for my flight home. \u201cIt was an astounding chain of lies tied together by a man who obviously is mentally unstable.\u201d David Jolly, the former Republican congressman from Florida, told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes the next day: \u201cListen, there is no moral equivalency between this president and some of the dictators we\u2019ve seen in the Dark Ages of the Middle East and other places around the globe. But the politics of some of those dark dictators was to always have an enemy. And that is what this president has modernized.\u201dIt is true that it is hard to get through a Trump rally now without thinking of the Philippines\u2019 Rodrigo Duterte, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan or the other authoritarians for whom Trump has openly expressed his admiration. And yet, watching Trump onstage in Phoenix, the instincts he was following seemed to be much more those of an entertainer than those of a demagogue. It had the feel of being in the studio audience for an unusually angry late-night host\u2019s opening monologue. He was a guy on a stage, improvising, trying to hold the crowd, toggling between the riskier material and the easy applause lines, trying to figure out what they liked and how to give them more of it. The applause for clean coal was tepid, so he moved on to Joe Arpaio. He talked about Jonathan Gruber, the economist who helped design the Affordable Care Act, but no one seemed to know who that was, so he reached into the tangle of Fox News chyrons balled up in the back of his head and came up with something about all the people who wanted to tear down George Washington statues, and the crowd roared its indignation at this movement that did not, in any meaningful sense, exist.These moments have political consequences, but when you are watching them in person, the imperatives at play seem mostly emotional; the needs on display are raw and visible, and curiously small. But then you see the same speech on a screen, outside the reality-impeding Faraday cage of the rally venue, and you are reminded that this is the president: that he commands a nuclear arsenal and a legal system that can put people in jail or throw them out of the country and a surveillance apparatus of godlike omniscience and an unshakably loyal third, at least, of the American population. The man is trying for \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d and it comes out as Hugo Chavez\u2019s \u201cAl\u00f3 Presidente.\u201dTrump does not speak to history except in extremely rare cases, like his Inaugural Address or his State of the Union address, in which circumstances absolutely, nonnegotiably force him to do so. Otherwise he is always speaking to a proximate audience; unlike other presidents, the speaking, not the speech, is the point. The words would make little sense without their immediate social context. To be a member of his audience is to feel valued, part of an intimate and privileged \u201cyou\u201d defined in relation to some broader population: Gene Huber\u2019s \u201cwe the people\u201d rather than the Constitution\u2019s.\u201cDo you like me?\u201d he asked us in the airplane hangar in Moon. He looked like he was feeling good \u2014 certainly better than in Phoenix. There was talk of his finally escaping the padded cell of convention and expertise that had half-contained his presidency. Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser, and Hope Hicks, his communications director and human security blanket, had recently tendered their resignations. In three days he would fire \u2014 or rather, order fired \u2014 his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and not long after that, his acting F.B.I. director, Andrew McCabe, and his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster. The White House lawyer who had been advising him on the Russia investigation, John Dowd, would quit. We \u2014 he and we, together \u2014 were forging deeper into the unknown, and it seemed to exhilarate him.I was there, and I can report that yes, the crowd was really big. You couldn\u2019t hide that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Harry Potter Landmark: At $68 Million, the Most Expensive Broadway Nonmusical Play Ever", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s another one: \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d a two-part drama now in previews and opening April 22, cost about $68.5 million to bring to Broadway, including not only $35.5 million to capitalize the show \u2014 more than for any other nonmusical play in history \u2014 but also another $33 million to clear out and redo the theater.It\u2019s a huge bet in a flop-prone industry, but also a seemingly safe one, predicated on the expectation that \u201cCursed Child\u201d will become a big hit on Broadway, a long-running production that can spin off profits for years.Even in previews, as the cast finds its footing and the creative team makes adjustments, the show is setting box-office records. Potter fans have been filling up the Lyric, one of Broadway\u2019s largest theaters, and the $2.1 million the play took in during the first week of April was more than any play had previously grossed in a single week.The record-setting $35.5 million capitalization \u2014 the amount raised from producers and investors to pay an unusually large cast and crew, rehearse an unusually long show and build an unusually elaborate production \u2014 was disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By comparison, most nonmusical plays on Broadway are between $3 million and $5 million, and even the splashiest musicals rarely top more than $25 million.But the capitalization is only a portion of what it took to pave the way for \u201cCursed Child\u201d to get to Broadway.The work on the building was expected to cost about $10 million, according to documents filed with the New York City Department of Buildings.The play, a two-part experience with a running time of more than five hours, is a sequel to the series of young adult fantasy novels written by J.K. Rowling about a boy wizard. \u201cCursed Child\u201d takes place 19 years after the final book, at a time when Harry and his friends have become parents.\u201cCursed Child\u201d was written by Jack Thorne, based on a story by Mr. Thorne, Ms. Rowling and the director John Tiffany. It was developed in Britain and has been sold out in London\u2019s West End for 22 months, and last year it won a record nine Olivier awards \u2014 the British equivalent of the Tonys \u2014 including one for best play. A third production, in Melbourne, Australia, is scheduled to open next year.In response to questions about the show\u2019s finances, two of the lead producers, Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, offered a tour of the renovated theater. Strolling through the theater, they showed off phoenix sconces and dragon lanterns and a lobby wall featuring prints of patronuses (silvery animal guardians).The color scheme is rich and dark \u2014 most of the walls are painted a color called raven plume \u2014 and a custom carpet features H monograms (for Hogwarts, Harry\u2019s alma mater). The newly adorned exterior features giant wings and large sculptures of a child (symbol alert!) trapped in a nest.\u201cWe wanted to create a mood, without crossing a line into theme park,\u201d Mr. Callender said. Ms. Friedman added, \u201cIt was really important to us that the lobbies and the front-of-house had the atmosphere of the Harry Potter world, because this is the beginning of the audience\u2019s experience.\u201d\u201cI find the costs here difficult to comprehend,\u201d Ms. Friedman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a number I do not like.\u201dBut she also said that particular aspects of \u201cCursed Child\u201d make it expensive. A play in two parts required twice as much time to rehearse; the show\u2019s elaborate illusions required significant substage mechanics and extra training. It took 16 weeks just to load the show\u2019s set elements into the theater.Investment documents filed with the New York attorney general\u2019s office offer a rough breakdown of the capitalization, including $11.7 million for the physical production, $7.8 million for \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d costs, including the design and signage of the facade, $3.4 million for advertising and publicity and $3.2 million for salaries.That money goes to pay a cast and crew that is much bigger than for most plays. According to Ms. Friedman and Mr. Callender, a shop crew of 220 people was assembled to build and install the scenery and lighting and costumes. The show has 40 actors, a stage crew of 26, some 16 people assigned to wardrobe and hair and 5 stage managers.The Broadway production is already largely sold out through next March, although there are periodic releases of more tickets, including some low-priced ones every Friday. Each part of the show had a recent average ticket price of $164.83 and a top price of $286.50; 300 seats per performance cost $40 or less. The two parts can be seen on the same day or consecutive days.Among the biggest beneficiaries will be Ms. Rowling. The investment papers do not detail her compensation, but say that the \u201cunderlying rights owner, licensor and their affiliates\u201d \u2014 a group that includes Ms. Rowling \u2014 will initially receive 31 percent of the play\u2019s net profits, and that cut will eventually rise to 41 percent as the show moves deeper into profitability. Ms. Rowling can profit from the play in other ways as well; she is the third lead producer, through her company Harry Potter Theatrical Productions.Her deal appears to be more lucrative than the ones negotiated by other prose writers whose work was the basis of a Broadway show. Harper Lee, before her death, signed an agreement giving her 2.5 percent of the net profits, plus an author royalty, for a coming stage adaptation of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d (that money will now go to her estate), while Ron Chernow, the author of a biography of Alexander Hamilton, gets 1 percent of the adjusted grosses from \u201cHamilton.\u201dThe comparisons, however, are imperfect. Fiction writers generally get a bigger share of profits than do writers of nonfiction, since the novelists actually dream up their characters. And, unlike \u201cMockingbird,\u201d \u201cCursed Child\u201d is not adapted from a novel \u2014 it is a new story, created for the stage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "300 Meters in Gaza: Snipers, Burning Tires and a Contested Fence", "Date": null, "News": "Advertisement\nA fence that divides Israel and Gaza has become the latest flashpoint in the decades-old conflict, with Israeli soldiers unleashing lethal force against mostly unarmed Arab protesters who have been demonstrating for weeks.Israeli farming communitiesNir OzIsraeli military Israeli military Israeli military ISRAELFenceWatchtowerGAZAPhotographer killedBurning tiresConflictzoneProtesters heading to fenceFamily and prayer areaSoccer fieldLocaljournalistsFood Field hospitalAmbulancesIsraeli farming communitiesNir OzIsraeli military Israeli military Israeli military ISRAELFenceWatchtowerPhotographer killedGAZAConflictzoneBurning tiresFamily and prayer areaProtesters heading to fenceSoccer fieldLocal journalistsField hospitalAmbulancesIsraeli farming communitiesNir OzWatchtowerIsraeli military Israeli military Israeli military ISRAELFenceGAZABurning tiresConflictzoneFamily and prayer areaProtesters heading to fenceSoccer fieldLocal journalistsFieldHospitalAmbulancesIsraeli farming communitiesNir OzISRAELIsraeli military Israeli military FenceConflictzoneBurning tiresGAZAFamily and prayer areaProtesters heading to fenceSoccer fieldFieldhospitalThe image above shows how each side was arrayed on March 30 in Khan Younis, one of five demonstration sites where more than 100 Palestinians have been killed since the protests began seven weeks ago.The Palestinians are protesting Israel\u2019s blockade, which has been choking off the impoverished coastal strip for over a decade. They also want to reassert the rights of refugees and their descendants to reclaim their ancestral lands in Israel, 70 years after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced.In Israel\u2019s view, there is nothing benign about the Palestinian claim of a right of return. It would amount to the destruction of Israel by demographic means. And they see the protests as providing cover for violent attacks.SderotKhan YounisprotestsISRAELProtest sites1 MILEAbasan al-KabiraBeitHanounEASTERN BORDERBaniSuheilaRafahBeitLahiyaKhanYounisGAZATelAvivAl QararaWESTBANKTal asSultanGazaCityDeiral BalahGazaIsraelGAZA IS ABOUT 25 MILES LONGNORTHSderotKhan YounisprotestISRAELProtest sitesAbasan al-Kabira1 MILEBeitHanounEASTERN BORDERBaniSuheilaRafahBeitLahiyaAl QararaKhanYounisTelAvivGAZAGazaCityWESTBANKTal asSultanDeiral BalahGazaIsraelGAZA IS ABOUT 25 MILES LONGNORTHSderotBeitHanounNORTHBeitLahiyaProtest sitesGazaCityGAZAGAZA IS ABOUT25 MILES LONGISRAELDeiral BalahAl QararaKhan Younis protestBaniSuheilaAbssanAl-KabiraKhanYounis1 MILETal asSultanRafah\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in a position where we have to handle hundreds or thousands of people inside Israel,\u201d Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel\u2019s National Security Council, said recently. \u201cThis is something we would not be able to contain. So the right way is to make sure nothing happens to the fence.\u201dThat means stopping people from touching it, even with deadly force. Though the protests were initially billed as nonviolent, the Israelis say they have repeatedly discovered grenades and other explosives along the fence, and that Palestinians have sometimes thrown firebombs at their soldiers, not just rocks. Israeli forces have responded lethally.Few Israelis believe Hamas, the militant Islamic group that rules Gaza and is running the protests, is capable of peaceful protest.The closer to the fence protesters move, the more perilous it becomes for them. The Israelis have made clear that people they believe are \u201cinstigators\u201d are fair game to be targeted. Videos have surfaced of people being shot with their backs turned to the fence, while praying, or with nothing in their hands.Israeli snipers have positioned themselves atop large sand berms that military engineers are continually reconfiguring with tanks positioned nearby. After protesters burned tires to obscure the soldiers\u2019 view and rolled them toward the fence, the Israelis brought in giant industrial fans to disperse the thick black smoke and powerful water cannons to douse the fires. Soldiers have fired countless volleys of tear gas to try to push back crowds of demonstrators.The military insists that its soldiers are instructed to shoot to warn, then shoot to wound, before shooting to kill. But the defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said: \u201cAnyone who approaches the fence endangers his life.\u201dSome of the protesters sit, while others dart around, taunting Israeli sharpshooters. And some risk their lives by trying to get up to the fence.The Palestinians have much to be angry about. A collapsing economy and a worsening public health crisis along with the 11-year blockade of the tiny, jam-packed territory makes it almost impossible to leave. But the effort is billed as the Great Return March for a reason: Most Gazans are Palestinian refugees or their descendants, and marching on the fence highlights their desire to reclaim the lands and homes from which they were displaced 70 years ago in the war surrounding Israel\u2019s creation.When a demonstrator is shot, others rush to him and quickly carry him off the field to waiting ambulances or to tents that triage and give first aid to the injured. Farthest from the fence, along a road leading to central Khan Younis, is a field hospital with doctors and enough equipment to perform procedures short of major surgery. Other medical tents are staffed mainly by volunteer nursing-school graduates.As of Friday, 34 people had been killed, three of them under 18 years old, and more than 3,000 had been injured in the demonstrations, according to Gaza health officials. More than 1,000 have been hit by live fire; nearly 1,000 have suffered from gas inhalation; 300 from being hit by rubber bullets and eight people lost fingers or feet.Entire tent villages have been set up to meet the basic needs of demonstrators, and then some. Vendors sell falafel, nuts, sweets and lemonade from ramshackle huts. Once a day or so, a delivery arrives with free slices of pizza or cakes. Large dedicated prayer areas accommodate the faithful. Gaza journalists and radio hosts occupy other tents.The tents nearest the fence, still not safe from Israeli snipers, house young men, some of them just groups of friends, others organized for various task such as providing tires to burn.Farther back, many Gaza clans have pitched more elaborate tents with blankets and gas stoves inside, creating the feeling of an offbeat family reunion across much of the protest grounds. At the entrance to one tent, women baked saj, a round bread, over a wood fire on Thursday to hand out to demonstrators. Another tent, with coffee and comfortable sofas inside, was reserved for religious officials.The organizers have created a festival-like atmosphere, with a robust schedule of daily events: Volleyball and soccer games played by amputees, poetry readings, musical performances, even horse races. The sudden crackle of gunfire and wail of sirens are at times the only giveaways to what is happening a short distance beyond the tents to the east.Avocados, carrots and an abundance of other crops grow along the Gaza border on the Israeli side. Hundreds of Israeli citizens live within a mortar shell\u2019s range of Gaza territory in small communities of farmers such as Nir Oz and Kisufim. The army says its fierce defense of the fence is protecting those citizens \u2014 and stopping infiltrators from kidnapping a soldier or two \u2014 a longstanding Hamas tactic.In the Israeli community of Nahal Oz near Gaza on April 6, a group of young people climbed an old watchtower along the community\u2019s western edge, looking out on the disturbances as if they were sitting in the nosebleed seats at a baseball game.Parking lots full of tanks tucked away behind berms make up only part of the military\u2019s presence along the Gaza border. A $2 billion underground wall project is under way to prevent Hamas from digging any more tunnels into Israel used by attackers. And Israel\u2019s Iron Dome anti-missile batteries protect southern cities such as Sderot from Gaza rockets \u2014 though its sensors are so easily triggered that air-raid alarms have been set off in the area by gunfire alone.Additional reporting by Megan SpeciaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren Buffett Isn\u2019t a Fan of Bonds. But They May Be Good for You.", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a rough first quarter for bonds, which fell in value amid fears that inflation, the archnemesis of fixed-income investors, was coming back into the picture.Instead of rallying when stocks were falling \u2014 typically the case for the last three decades \u2014 bonds merely managed to lose less than stocks. When the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 10 percent from late January to early February, the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate U.S. Bond index fell more than 1 percent.It\u2019s not profitable to argue with Mr. Buffett about the markets. He is right, of course. The return prospects for bonds aren\u2019t particularly appealing today. That\u2019s because low bond yields reduce the odds that you will earn a return that keeps pace with inflation in coming years. And with the Federal Reserve pushing its target interest rate higher, bond prices are likely to suffer. (When rates rise, bond prices fall. A bond fund\u2019s total return is the sum of the interest paid plus changes in bond prices.)But Mr. Buffett is a singular investor, one with deep pockets and an extremely long-term perspective, and he has an excellent track record of exploiting market sell-offs. Most people aren\u2019t like that.According to Morningstar Direct, $59 billion is invested in long-term bond funds and exchange-traded funds (defined as portfolios with average durations above six years). But that total is dwarfed by the more than $1.5 trillion invested in intermediate-term portfolios (3.5- to six-year average duration), which include core bond funds hewing to the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index. Another $431 billion is invested in short-term portfolios (one- to 3.5-year average duration).Ms. Jones points out that from a low yield of 1.38 percent in July 2016, the 10-year Treasury note now yields nearly 3 percent. \u201cWe are in a bond bear market,\u201d she said. But that\u2019s nothing like a stock bear market.Since July 2016, the average intermediate bond fund has managed to post flat performance as higher yields have offset price declines. Shorter-term portfolios have eked out a small gain. On an inflation-adjusted basis, bond funds have negative returns over that stretch. A stock bear market, by contrast, doesn\u2019t begin until stocks have fallen at least 20 percent.Still, core bond funds\u2019 struggles have been unsettling. And with a strong-enough economy spurring the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, bond investors may need to reduce expectations.At the same time, the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate is ratcheting up its risk. The duration of the index has increased from around 3.5 years in 2008 to six years today as the composition of the index shifted in response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy. Treasury bonds, which tend to have longer durations, now represent more than one-third of the index compared with 22 percent in 2007. And corporations have spent the last decade issuing longer-term bonds to take advantage of low interest rates.Mr. Chiappinelli said investing in a portfolio that is increasing its duration when interest rates \u201cwere at historic lows is the exact opposite of prudence.\u201d\u201cWe tend to talk about owning the aggregate index as a core, and then adding some risk around it. Well, now might be a time to keep your core but add some less risky bonds,\u201d Ms. Jones said.\u201cShorten up your entire bond portfolio to two or three years and you could probably afford to own fewer bonds and increase your stocks,\u201d Mr. Fisher said. His expectation is that the overall volatility of a portfolio 30 percent in short-term bonds and 70 percent in stocks is going to be on par with one that is 40 percent invested in a fund tracking the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index and 60 percent in stocks.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the return of bonds will be, and I am not suggesting it will be as good as the past 17 years, but I do expect the volatility of bonds relative to stocks to stay the same,\u201d Mr. Roth said.Unless you are as patient and prescient as Mr. Buffett, owning a slug of less-volatile bonds can help you stick to a long-term investing strategy when stocks fall.An earlier version of this article misquoted Peter Chiappinelli.

From Hollywood, Disneyland and the Beach Boys\u2019 surf cities, its pop culture radiated eastward across the continent, and beyond. Its freeways and sprawling suburbs seemed to represent the new American residential model. Its ambitions for public parks and education were stupendous. Within a five-year early-1960s span during the sun-king administration of Gov. Pat Brown, father of the current Gov. Jerry Brown, the University of California system opened three new campuses: at San Diego, Irvine and Santa Cruz, all now major research centers.In its promise of fresh starts and new opportunities, California was to the rest of the country what America, in its best version, was to the world. The booming economy, sunny (and not yet smog-drenched) skies, and shiny new schools and roads drew millions of new residents to the state after World War II (including my own parents, who moved from suburban Philadelphia, where they grew up, to the Inland Empire of Southern California, where they raised my siblings and me). Kevin Starr, who as state librarian became California\u2019s most influential chronicler, signaled the state\u2019s symbolic role by calling his multivolume history \u201cAmericans and the California Dream.\u201dLess than 10 years later, California still has serious problems, but over all its prospect is the envy of most other states. Its success is uneven and, in Pastor\u2019s term, \u201ctentative,\u201d with obvious challenges that range from class-based inequities in its richest cities to environmental sustainability for the state as a whole. But Schwarzenegger\u2019s successor, Jerry Brown, will end his fourth and final term as governor with a large budget surplus. (His four terms have not been consecutive: Brown was, famously, also Ronald Reagan\u2019s successor as governor more than 40 years ago.) One American in eight now lives in California, and it accounts for a larger share than that of the country\u2019s output, innovation, job creation and wealth. While other state legislatures fight to retain gerrymandered political maps and enact voter-suppression schemes, California took the lead (under Schwarzenegger) in getting rid of gerrymanders, a movement Schwarzenegger himself is now trying to extend across the country.California has of course also become the Democratic Party\u2019s most important stronghold. In 2016 Hillary Clinton carried California by well over four million votes \u2014 and ran behind Donald Trump by more than a million in all the other states combined. This distinct political identity naturally feeds the impression, among progressive admirers and conservative critics alike, of California as a realm apart. So do the declarations by Brown and his attorney general, Xavier Becerra, of their commitment to environmental and immigration policies at odds with Trump\u2019s.Positions like these amount to the \u201cState of Resistance\u201d of Pastor\u2019s title, but the book\u2019s argument is actually the opposite of what \u201cresistance\u201d might imply. Instead, Pastor, a sociologist at the University of Southern California, suggests that at just the moment California seems most out of sync with national trends, it is in fact regaining its role as bellwether and pioneer. \u201cThe country needs resistance to be sure,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut it also needs a vision of what America can become.\u201d In his book, which is concise, clear and convincing, he contends that the redemptive arc of modern California\u2019s history offers both cautionary and constructive guidance on a vision for the country as a whole.Pastor sets out his story in three acts \u2014 rise, fall, recovery \u2014 each of which offers surprising insights for readers outside the state (and many inside as well). In describing the post-World War II years of expansion, which took place under governors of both parties, he emphasizes how heavily they involved public spending and investment \u2014 roads, schools, parks, both advanced research universities and numerous community colleges \u2014 and how much they shared a goal of preparing the state for new arrivals and future citizens. \u201cCalifornia in the 1950s and 1960s was precisely the sort of demonstration project for an active government that many conservatives seem to fear at a national level,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe real secret to California\u2019s once and future success was exactly its agreement on a social compact in which the public and private sectors worked to create paths upward for both those who were in the state and those who were to come.\u201dThe unhappy decline that constituted the second act was, in Pastor\u2019s view, an uncannily precise preview of the economic, social and political discontents that now embitter our national politics. Deindustrialization hit California as hard in the 1980s as it hit any place in the Midwest. (Forty percent of the lost American manufacturing jobs in the early 1990s were in this one state.) Ethnic change was much more rapid. Pastor points out that between 1970 and 1990, the share of California\u2019s population that was foreign-born rose from 9 percent to 22 percent. This was distinctly different from the rest of the country, where the foreign-born share rose in the same period from around 4 percent to just over 6 percent, and it led to what Pastor calls the \u201cracial generation gap.\u201d That is, a politically and economically powerful older generation, mainly white, resisted paying taxes to build schools and parks for a younger generation that was mainly nonwhite.The result, Pastor says, was a several-decade escalation in the politics of fear, austerity and resentment, which harmed the state while also driving the California Republican Party further right, and eventually out of power. From Reagan through Schwarzenegger (with the exception of Jerry Brown), Republicans dominated the governorship of California. Now Republicans hold no statewide office at all. Of California\u2019s 53 congressional seats, only 14 are in Republican hands, a number almost certain to go down after this year\u2019s midterm elections.Then we have the recent years of recovery, about which many reports (including some I have written) emphasize the savvy of Brown and his team. Pastor stresses instead two structural favors. One was a return to the collaborative public-private ventures, with an emphasis on long-term investment, that marked the state in its highest-growth years. Even today\u2019s center of extreme private wealth, the Bay Area tech industry, illustrates the point, Pastor says. Its leaders recognize that they and the state rise or fall together. Because they \u201coften see themselves in a sort of collective ecosystem that allows for individual success,\u201d within this zone of hyper-capitalism \u201cthere has been a sense, now somewhat eroded by growing internationalization, of business responsibility for stewarding the region.\u201dThe other factor in the modern rise, he emphasizes, is on-the-ground social movements: by labor unions, by immigrants and immigrant-rights advocates, by students, by Latino or African-American groups, and by others determined to offset corporate power with their organized voting and protest strength. Pastor is an academic sociologist, and this part of his book is written more in sociologese than the rest, including its extensive discussion of \u201cintersectionality,\u201d the overlapping effects of barriers of race, gender, class and other inequalities. But it ends with a list of practical lessons that can be drawn from California\u2019s recent history to the national politics of coming years. One of these involves appreciating the geographical breadth a progressive movement can have. In California terms, this has meant fielding candidates and motivating voters in the conservative inland regions as well as along the coast. The national counterpart would be Democrats contesting races even where they seem to have no chance. Another lesson suggests progressive groups build alliances with business leaders, as in Silicon Valley.\u201cAmerica now looks like California at its lowest point,\u201d Pastor says. He offers a guide to a possible path back up.James Fallows is a national correspondent for The Atlantic. His latest book is \u201cOur Towns: A 100,000-Mile Journey Into the Heart of America,\u201d with Deborah Fallows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Doubles Down on Potential Trade War With China", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said Thursday that the United States would consider slapping tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods, escalating a potentially damaging trade dispute with Beijing.\u201cRather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that he had instructed the United States trade representative to determine whether tariffs on an additional $100 billion in goods were warranted and, \u201cif so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs.\u201dThe move is a high-stakes gamble aimed at cowing China into backing down and forcing it to make the kinds of changes that the United States is seeking \u2014 namely reducing the coercive tactics American officials say Beijing uses to try to dominate leading-edge industries like artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicles. But the move could ultimately bring about the kind of retaliation from Beijing that has spooked stock markets.It also means that the United States would be somewhat more likely to place levies on Chinese products that American households routinely purchase, like furniture, clothing or shoes \u2014 an outcome the Trump administration said it sought to avoid with its initial round of tariffs.The president\u2019s announcement was immediately criticized by manufacturers, retailers and politicians from states whose economies depend on agriculture.Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said Mr. Trump was \u201cthreatening to light American agriculture on fire.\u201d\u201cHopefully the president is just blowing off steam again, but if he\u2019s even half-serious, this is nuts,\u201d Mr. Sasse said. \u201cLet\u2019s absolutely take on Chinese bad behavior, but with a plan that punishes them instead of us. This is the dumbest possible way to do this.\u201dIn a statement, Robert Lighthizer, the trade adviser who is carrying out an investigation into Chinese practices, described the president\u2019s threat as \u201can appropriate response,\u201d saying China should have responded to the initial tariffs levied by the United States by changing its behavior.On Friday, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce accused the United States of starting the conflict and said that \u201cthe Chinese position has been made very clear. We do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight a trade war.\u201dHe added that if the United States followed through with its threats, \u201cThe Chinese side will follow suit to the end and will not hesitate to pay any price and will definitely fight back. It must take a new comprehensive response and firmly defend the interests of the country and the people.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s effort to raise the stakes on Thursday seemed poised to send financial markets spinning, with futures on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-index down and the yen climbing against the dollar. Markets were tame in Asia midday on Friday, which was a holiday in China.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.Companies potentially caught in the middle of a trade war called on the Trump administration to back down and try to work with the Chinese.\u201cThe announcement that the administration may issue $100 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese products is irresponsible and destabilizing,\u201d said Dean C. Garfield, the chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents companies such as Amazon, Apple and IBM. \u201cWe call on both sides to halt unproductive and escalatory rhetoric, recognizing that these words and actions have global consequences.\u201dChina experts have questioned whether Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive negotiating style will leave Chinese leaders with enough political room to make concessions to the Americans. Bowing to the president\u2019s demands could be seen internally as weakness, and the changes that the administration wants \u2014 reducing China\u2019s dominance in cutting-edge manufacturing and technology \u2014 is not something Beijing is likely to agree to.Including this most recent action, the United States would be placing tariffs on a total of $153 billion of Chinese products. The $100 billion threat came on top of the tariffs on $3 billion in Chinese steel and aluminum that he imposed last month and the tariffs on a further $50 billion in Chinese goods that he has threatened to impose in recent days.The total is now so large that China would have trouble finding enough American goods to penalize if it sought to impose a proportional retaliation. China bought only $130.4 billion worth of American goods last year, while the United States bought $505.6 billion worth of Chinese goods.The National Retail Federation blasted the move as a dangerous game of chicken that would put the United States on the losing end of a trading relationship that has benefited American companies and consumers.\u201cThis is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start. We are on a dangerous downward spiral, and American families will be on the losing end,\u201d Matthew R. Shay, the president and chief executive of the retail group, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the administration to change course and stop playing a game of chicken with the nation\u2019s economy.\u201dThe Chinese have tools other than tariffs at their disposal, including limiting the operations of American banks and other service providers in China. The government could also urge the Chinese public not to buy American-brand cars like Chevrolets and Fords, even though those are built almost entirely from Chinese-made parts and assembled in factories in China.The biggest question would be whether China would start retaliating not commercially but through geopolitical actions. While Trump administration trade officials appear to have been operating with considerable autonomy from those responsible for issues like North Korea and Taiwan, policymaking is much more unified in China.Chinese experts have made clear that they perceive the ever-larger rounds of American tariffs as part of a broad American challenge that goes beyond dollars and cents. \u201cIt is more than just a trade issue: It involves geopolitical reasons,\u201d Wu Xinbo, the chief of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in an interview this week. \u201cTrump has mentioned before, if China doesn\u2019t agree on economy and trade, the U.S. will reconsider China issues \u2014 that includes the South China Sea and Taiwan.\u201dPresident Xi Jinping of China is scheduled to give a major speech on Tuesday at the Bo\u2019ao Forum on the Chinese island of Hainan, which may give more clues to China\u2019s response. The speech has been billed by other Chinese officials as a moment when Mr. Xi would lay out a blueprint for China\u2019s economic overhaul and liberalization, a potential peace offering to the Trump administration, said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s move may throw a small monkey wrench into Xi\u2019s plans,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cHe may now need to couple such a proposal with the warning that China will continue to defend itself against foreign pressure.\u201dAna Swanson reported from Washington, and Keith Bradsher from Shanghai.

It is also hard to take seriously, given how quickly Mr. Trump changes his mind and how rarely and clumsily he tends to follow through on tough talk.If you\u2019re confused or shocked by these announcements, you are not alone.

Both men sought to tamp down the contentious back-and-forth between the two economic giants. On CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin emphasized that the United States was willing to negotiate with China, but he acknowledged that there was \u201cpotential for a trade war.\u201dAnd investors found few bright spots in afternoon comments from Jerome H. Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve. In a speech in Chicago, Mr. Powell gave little indication that he planned to deviate from the Fed\u2019s gradual path of lifting interest rates. He also suggested after his speech that he was unsure how the new tariffs imposed by the United States and China would affect the economy.By the time markets closed, both the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 2 percent.Mr. Trump, who had been a cheerleader for the rising stock market, acknowledged in a radio interview that was aired on Friday that the trade friction could take a toll on the market. The S.&P. 500 is now down 2.6 percent for the year and more than 9 percent from its late January peak.\u201cI\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He added: \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished.\u201dMr. Powell\u2019s comments underscored the shaky position stock investors are in, buffeted almost daily by conflicting announcements from the White House and by tariff announcements from Beijing that have strained one of the world\u2019s most important economic relationships. A deep trade freeze between the two countries could chill global growth.So far, though, there is little evidence of a slowdown. And without one, the Fed, as Mr. Powell suggested, will probably keeping raising rates, which traditionally is viewed as a drag on stocks.The losses on Friday were especially heavy for American companies reliant on global trade. The aircraft maker Boeing tumbled 3 percent, and Caterpillar, which sells lots of construction and mining equipment in China, sank 3.5 percent.With China tailoring its tariffs toward American agricultural products, investors also dumped stocks tied to the sector. The fertilizer giants CF Industries and Mosaic each fell more than 3 percent, as did Deere, the farm equipment maker.The gloomy trading day in the United States followed a mixed day elsewhere.Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 closed down 0.4 percent, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng ended up 1 percent. Major European benchmarks like France\u2019s CAC-40, Germany\u2019s DAX and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 were all lower. (Mainland Chinese markets were closed on Friday.)On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he had instructed his top trade officials to determine whether additional tariffs on $100 billion worth of Chinese imports were warranted and, \u201cif so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs.\u201dThe comments were part of a roller-coaster week that has whipsawed investors.\u201cPeople have started to feel like this is a bit of the children\u2019s game.

{"Headline": "We Already Know How to Protect Ourselves From Facebook", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Tufekci is the author of \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest.\u201dThis week, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is scheduled to testify before two congressional committees amid the growing outcry over the company\u2019s data collection practices. Because I have been analyzing the potential negative effects of Facebook on politics for a long time, I am fielding a lot of inquiries about what legislators should ask Mr. Zuckerberg.Here\u2019s my answer: Nothing. We already know most everything we need for legislators to pass laws that would protect us from what Facebook has unleashed.The sight of lawmakers yelling at Mr. Zuckerberg might feel cathartic, but the danger of a public spectacle is that it will look like progress but amount to nothing: a few apologies from Mr. Zuckerberg, some earnest-sounding promises to do better, followed by a couple of superficial changes to Facebook that fail to address the underlying structural problems.This has been Facebook\u2019s public relations strategy for years. After each scandal, it expresses regrets, announces a few cosmetic fixes and then works like mad to scuttle any legislation that might have a favorable impact on the core problem: how our data is harvested, used and profited from. It would be a shame if we went through that again.In addition to apologizing, Mr. Zuckerberg will no doubt promise more transparency. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m all for transparency. But while transparency can help us diagnose problems in the online economy, it alone doesn\u2019t fix them.Mr. Zuckerberg is also likely to promise to lock down all the data Facebook has collected on billions of people. That sounds like a good idea, but it is mostly irrelevant now; the data is already compromised.So why did it give away people\u2019s data in the past? In part because it is a reckless company (\u201cMove fast and break things\u201d used to be a company motto of sorts). And in part because the data \u2014 a tantalizing resource for programmers \u2014 could be used to lure developers to make games, quizzes and other apps for Facebook that would keep users coming back to the site.But that phase of the company\u2019s development is over. Because Facebook does not sell our data directly (or even want to), extracting promises from Mr. Zuckerberg that it not do so would be worse than a toothless remedy. It would only serve Facebook\u2019s business model.What would a genuine legislative remedy look like? First, personalized data collection would be allowed only through opt-in mechanisms that were clear, concise and transparent. There would be no more endless pages of legalese that nobody reads or can easily understand. The same would be true of any individualized targeting of users by companies or political campaigns \u2014 it should be clear, transparent and truly consensual.Second, people would have access, if requested, to all the data a company has collected on them \u2014 including all forms of computational inference (how the company uses your data to make guesses about your tastes and preferences, your personal and medical history, your political allegiances and so forth).Third, the use of any data collected would be limited to specifically enumerated purposes, for a designed period of time \u2014 and then would expire. The current model of harvesting all data, with virtually no limit on how it is used and for how long, must stop.Fourth, the aggregate use of data should be regulated. Merely saying that individuals own their data isn\u2019t enough: Companies can and will persuade people to part with their data in ways that may seem to make sense at the individual level but that work at the aggregate level to create public harms. For example, collecting health information from individuals in return for a small compensation might seem beneficial to both parties \u2014 but a company that holds health information on a billion people can end up posing a threat to individuals in ways they could not have foreseen.Facebook may complain that these changes to data collection and use would destroy the company. But while these changes would certainly challenge the business model of many players in the digital economy, giant companies like Facebook would be in the best position to adapt and forge ahead.If anything, we should all be thinking of ways to reintroduce competition into the digital economy. Imagine, for example, requiring that any personal data you consent to share be offered back to you in an \u201cinteroperable\u201d format, so that you could choose to work with companies you thought would provide you better service, rather than being locked in to working with one of only a few.Right now, Silicon Valley is stuck in a (very profitable) rut. To force it to change would not only make us safer but also foster innovation.That would be a better, more satisfying outcome than any dramatic \u201cHave you no sense of decency, sir?\u201d moment that a congressional hearing might produce.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can \u2018Reluctant Trump\u2019 Voters Rescue the G.O.P.?", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWith Democrats winning in normally deep red places like Alabama and Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District, it looks like a blue wave is swelling for the midterm elections.There\u2019s still time for Republicans to change that, but first they must figure out how to mount an effective defense. To do that, they need to focus on a largely overlooked group of voters: Donald Trump voters who did not like him.Both exit polls in 2017 and analysis of recent generic congressional ballot polls \u2014 which indicate a Democratic lead \u2014 show that willingness to vote Republican or Democratic is highly correlated with one\u2019s opinion of President Trump. That can mean only one of two things: Either people who voted for Mr. Trump without liking him are so discouraged they aren\u2019t even answering polls (unlikely) or millions of Trump voters are intending to vote for Democrats in the fall.That probably shocks political pros from both sides of the aisle. Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office, while tumultuous, followed a predictable script. He signed the Republicans\u2019 signature agenda item, a giant tax-cut bill. He pursued a traditional business-friendly Republican program for deregulation and promoted conservative priorities like stricter immigration policy. He appointed the conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, regularly attacked the news media and provoked liberals with culture-war tweets (like berating N.F.L. players for kneeling during the national anthem).This combination of stoking racial resentment and promoting Republican policy was supposed to be his ticket to victory. Yet his job-approval ratings continued to fall during the year, hitting a nadir about the time he endorsed Roy Moore, who lost in Alabama\u2019s special Senate election.It\u2019s not a surprise, though, if you look at the characteristics and beliefs of these \u201creluctant Trump\u201d voters. According to the George Washington University Battleground Polls from September and October 2016, which also tracked voters who disliked both candidates, these people were largely self-described independents and ticket splitters. They leaned Republican, but they were not hardened partisans. Instead, they were willing to break with their preferred party when personalities or circumstances permitted.These polls also make crystal clear how much Mr. Trump bothered them. In both sets of the battleground polls, these voters strongly thought Republicans were best able to handle taxes, jobs, the economy and foreign affairs. Yet when they were asked the identical questions about which of the two candidates they trusted more, they backed Mrs. Clinton or rated the two evenly. They also strongly thought Mr. Trump did not have the temperament for the job, nor was he honest and trustworthy.Crucially, these voters made up their minds very late in the race. In September, 68 percent thought they would vote for a third-party candidate or were undecided. This changed little by mid-October. In this poll, taken during the height of the controversy over the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, 54 percent still intended to vote third party or were undecided. This group didn\u2019t break for Mr. Trump until the very end of the race, when they returned to their party preferences to reluctantly back the Republican over the Democrat.Republicans who want to reverse the special election trends of 2017-18 must incorporate these findings into their messaging and campaigns. Simply encouraging partisans to vote won\u2019t be enough: These swing voters still don\u2019t like Mr. Trump, and they don\u2019t respond to simple, partisan appeals.Instead, Republicans need to focus on the voters\u2019 choice in November. Their midterm votes will not be a consequence-free way to express displeasure with the White House; their vote will empower Democrats to do the very things these voters don\u2019t want them to do.This also requires the right use of imagery and pictures for television ads and staged events. That means knowing exactly who these voters are: They are disproportionally employed, married men with children at home. They are also mainly college educated and are the likeliest group to call themselves \u201cupper class.\u201d These are upscale suburban dads, not suburban moms.These men see some things in Mr. Trump that they can respect. The George Washington Battleground Polls found the men thought Mr. Trump was a strong leader and overwhelmingly thought he said what he believed.Reducing the infighting and lack of coordination between Congress and the president is also a must. When asked about the most important challenge facing America, they cited many common priorities: jobs, the economy and so forth. They also mentioned one unusual item: dysfunction in government. Every time it looks like the president, Congress or both can\u2019t handle their jobs, it drives home the message that Republicans can\u2019t do what many of these voters want most: make government work.Parties that hold the White House almost always lose seats in the midterms. The difference between defeat and disaster, however, depends a lot on how swing voters view that party and its record. Republicans still have a chance to avoid disaster if they know those swing voters are largely Republican-leaning dads upset with Mr. Trump and figure out how to appeal to them.Do that and the party might just keep control of the House and important governorships. Fail and a 2010-style blue tsunami may just wash Republicans out to sea.Advertisement"}

On the economic side, some parts of America, mainly big coastal cities, have been getting much richer, but other parts have been left behind. On the political side, the thriving regions by and large voted for Hillary Clinton, while the lagging regions voted for Donald Trump.But what\u2019s behind this divergence? What\u2019s the matter with Trumpland?Regional disparities aren\u2019t a new phenomenon in America. Indeed, before World War II the world\u2019s richest, most productive nation was also a nation with millions of dirt-poor farmers, many of whom didn\u2019t even have electricity or indoor plumbing. But until the 1970s those disparities were rapidly narrowing.And at the same time, regions that started with a poorly educated work force are in a downward spiral, both because they\u2019re stuck with the wrong industries and because they\u2019re experiencing what amounts to a brain drain.While these structural factors are surely the main story, however, I think we have to acknowledge the role of self-destructive politics.And when it comes to national politics, let\u2019s face it: Trumpland is in effect voting for its own impoverishment. New Deal programs and public investment played a significant role in the great postwar convergence; conservative efforts to downsize government will hurt people all across America, but it will disproportionately hurt the very regions that put the G.O.P. in power.The truth is that doing something about America\u2019s growing regional divide would be hard even with smart policies. The divide will only get worse under the policies we\u2019re actually likely to get.Advertisement"}

So, I\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be a little pain, but the market\u2019s gone up 40 percent, 42 percent \u2014 so we might lose a little bit of it \u2014 but we\u2019re going to have a much stronger country when we\u2019re finished. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. We have to do things that other people wouldn\u2019t do.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said on Friday that a correction was normal after such a long stretch of rising stock prices. He insisted that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy would be good for economic growth and that he was not concerned about daily declines in stocks.\u201cI think these are all long term positive things that the president is willing to defend our interests,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He added that he continued to be optimistic that a mutually beneficial agreement could be worked out.\u201cI think this could be good for us and good for them,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump, in a tweet on Friday, criticized both China and the World Trade Organization, saying that the Chinese \u201cget tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.\u201dThat followed another early morning tweet, in which Mr. Trump boasted that the new metals tariffs he has put into effect on China and other nations had not hurt American consumers as his critics predicted.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.On Friday morning, the White House issued an additional statement defending the president\u2019s actions.\u201cYear after year, China continues to distort global markets and harm U.S. businesses and consumers with unfair trade practices,\u201d the press office said.\u201cThe president is for free trade, but it must also be fair trade. Addressing unfair trade practices and ensuring that global trade is free, fair, and reciprocal will have a significant positive long-term impact on the U.S. economy,\u201d the statement said.But the approach has come under swift and stinging criticism from lawmakers of both parties, as well as industries whose businesses depend on access to China\u2019s markets.Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, called Mr. Trump\u2019s actions \u201creckless,\u201d saying in a tweet that 60% of her state\u2019s exports to China are agricultural products. \u201cChina\u2019s unfair trade policies need to be reined in but this isn\u2019t the way to do it.\u201dIn his statement on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he had instructed the agriculture secretary to implement a plan to protect farmers and agricultural interests. It is unclear what that plan could entail, but Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that if the president chose to subsidize farmers, he could spark a wider conflict with countries beyond China, which would object to unfair competition from American agriculture.White House trade advisers have described the tariff threats as a long overdue action against a pernicious cheater in global trade, saying China has long engaged in pressure, coercion and outright theft to gain access to valuable intellectual property. Yet the escalating threat of a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies has unnerved many American businesses that depend on China as a source for goods or as a market for their own products.China was celebrating a national holiday Friday and did not immediately announce any concrete action against the president\u2019s threat of an additional $100 billion in tariffs. A spokesman said the Chinese Ministry of Commerce had \u201ctaken note\u201d of the White House\u2019s statement, adding that \u201cthe Chinese position has been made very clear. We do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight a trade war.\u201dIf the United States follows through with its threats, the Chinese \u201cwill follow suit to the end and will not hesitate to pay any price,\u201d he said, arguing that the United States initiated the conflict.In the meantime, the trade measures ignited a swift response from manufacturers, retailers and politicians from states whose economies depend on agriculture. Although China exports far more to the United States than it imports, China is still the United States\u2019 third largest export market after Canada and Mexico, a vital destination for American-made goods like Boeing airplanes, luxury automobiles and soybeans.\u201cHopefully, the president is just blowing off steam again, but if he\u2019s even half-serious, this is nuts,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s absolutely take on Chinese bad behavior, but with a plan that punishes them instead of us. This is the dumbest possible way to do this.\u201dThe National Retail Federation criticized the new round of tariffs as a dangerous game of chicken ending with the United States on the losing end of a trading relationship that has benefited American companies and consumers.\u201cThis is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start. We are on a dangerous downward spiral, and American families will be on the losing end,\u201d Matthew R. Shay, the president and chief executive of the retail group, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the administration to change course and stop playing a game of chicken with the nation\u2019s economy.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington, and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

In 2016, Hillary Clinton offered many thoughtful proposals, precisely none of which she got to implement.This is a time for big ideas. One of the Trump presidency\u2019s only silver linings is its proof that our political discourse had been too narrow. Frustrated Americans don\u2019t feel bound by old rules. Almost 63 million of them voted for a man who had no political experience and made a mockery of politics as usual.I think they\u2019re right about that, too. Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, has a nice framing. He says that the late 1960s and the 1970s should have moved a reasonable person to the right on economic policy, in response to rampant inflation, rising crime, sky-high top tax rates and breakdowns in Europe. The last 15 years \u2014 with \u201cwidening inequality, financial crisis, zero interest rates, rising gaps in life expectancy and opportunity,\u201d as Summers notes \u2014 should move that same person to the left. Different eras require different solutions.The details will be important. Done wrong, any of these ideas could fizzle. They could make people lose even more faith in government. Done right, though, the ideas could mimic the grand successes of government: Social Security, Medicare, the military, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the highway system, public universities, medical research and a Defense Department project that became the internet.It\u2019s time to dream big again.Advertisement"}

Tyson, an economist at the Haas School of Business of the University of California, Berkeley, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any who have said the appropriate response is a series of tariffs on a bunch of goods, most of which don\u2019t have any real link to the underlying issue.\u201dHis advisers have stressed that economists largely agree with Mr. Trump that the Chinese are stealing American intellectual property and restricting access to their market in ways that put American companies at a disadvantage.\u201cNo free-market guy, no free-trade guy disagrees on this subject,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the new director of the National Economic Council, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThe guild, if you will, the brethren of the economic profession have all agreed that something has to be done.\u201dPeter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that \u201cwhat we have here is a situation where every American understands that China is stealing our intellectual property, they\u2019re forcing the transfer of our technology when companies go to China, and by doing that, they steal jobs from America, they steal factories from America, and we run an unprecedented $370-billion-a-year trade deficit in goods. This is an unsustainable situation.\u201d\u201cI think the basic issue that the Trump administration is pointing to \u2014 the lack of intellectual-property protection \u2014 is a serious one, particularly for the United States,\u201d said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist who headed President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely serious and appropriate issue for the administration to be concerned with.\u201dWhat worries Mr. Mankiw and others is Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs, which administration officials have portrayed both as a bargaining chip and as a policy Mr. Trump would certainly carry through on.Because tariffs would raise prices for American businesses and consumers that buy imported goods, \u201cyou\u2019re hurting yourself if you follow through with it,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said. \u201cIt just seems to me to be a not very smart threat to be making, given that it would not be rational to follow through with it.\u201dEconomists who don\u2019t like tariffs but favor action against China largely say the United States should be forming a multinational coalition to confront the Chinese.\u201cAny good strategy has to include getting other countries on your side,\u201d said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama. \u201cIf it\u2019s the United States versus China, we\u2019re similar-sized economies. If it\u2019s the United States and the world versus China, that\u2019s not something China can win.\u201dMr. Furman, Mr. Mankiw and others said the United States should continue to press its case against China before the World Trade Organization \u2014 a strategy that Mr. Navarro and other advisers to Mr. Trump say has not produced favorable results in the past. The economists who disagree with the administration\u2019s approach also stress, frequently, that joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have given the United States leverage in this dispute.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a terrible mistake\u201d to have quit the agreement, said Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business and another past chairman of Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cThis was a coalition of the vast majority of the economies of Asia outside of China, agreeing to principles exactly of the form that we\u2019re now saying that we want. We would be in a lot better situation if we had all of those people on our side.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s unilateral approach, including his tariff threats, has drawn qualified support from at least one unlikely high-profile economist: Martin Feldstein, of Harvard, a chairman of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.Mr. Feldstein began a syndicated op-ed column last month, on the subject of Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, by declaring, \u201cLike almost all economists and most policy analysts, I prefer low trade tariffs or no tariffs at all.\u201d But he went on to criticize China\u2019s intellectual-property policies and predict that the United States \u201ccannot use traditional remedies for trade disputes or World Trade Organization procedures to stop China\u2019s behavior.\u201d\u201cIf that happens, and U.S. firms can do business in China without being compelled to pay such a steep competitive price,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe threat of tariffs will have been a very successful tool of trade policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, analysts warn, the region is becoming a battleground in what feels like a new Cold War.Russia, they say, is expanding its influence and magnifying ethnic tensions in countries that hope to join the European Union. Its involvement has already spurred Brussels to revive dormant aims for enlargement. It is also prompting fresh attention from Washington about security risks to NATO members.\u201cRussia is looking for ways to retaliate that are asymmetric and provide Moscow opportunities,\u201d he said.In the Balkans, the competition with Russia has the potential to sow fresh instability in a region still emerging from the vicious war of 1992-95 that broke apart the former Yugoslavia.Yet Bosnia and Herzegovina, the broken country patched together in 1995 at the end of the war, remains a fragile construct, riven by corruption, weak leadership, and ethnic and nationalist strains among communities \u2014 a metaphor for the Balkans.Wary of Russian meddling, the European Union is holding out a renewed prospect of membership to Bosnia and to the other five nations of the Western Balkans \u2014 Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo \u2014 in return for fundamental structural reform.The skepticism among these countries about Brussels is deep. Many doubt the sincerity of a European Union that is turning more populist, more wary about migration and more cautious, after Romania and Bulgaria, about taking in nations before they are ready for membership.No one believes any of these countries is yet ready to join. But the urgency for reform fell away as the goal receded.But with Britain leaving the bloc and Russia playing on the fissures of the region, the European Union has now laid out a relatively detailed plan for the Balkans.It has even gone on record to say that if all goes well, Serbia and Montenegro, the only two countries now engaged in an accession process and hence the front-runners, could join by 2025.Bulgaria, the current president of the bloc, will hold a special Balkans summit meeting in May. T he Balkans are on the agenda for the European Council in June, and the British will be hosts of a Western Balkans summit meeting in July, just before NATO has its own meeting in Brussels.Mr. Bildt said tartly: \u201cWhether this is realistic or not remains to be seen.\u201d\u201cToday the countries show clear elements of state capture, including links with organized crime and corruption at all levels of government and administration, as well as a strong entanglement of public and private interests,\u201d it said.There is strong evidence of \u201cextensive political interference in and control of the media\u201d and lack of independence in the judiciary, it noted.Add to that uncompetitive economies and the flight of young people looking for better jobs, and prospects seem dim.But now the Americans are suddenly more interested, too. Renewed Washington concern \u201cstems in part from concerns about expanded Russian influence,\u201d said A. Ross Johnson, noting that Congress now demands that the Defense Department provide \u201can assessment of security cooperation between each Western Balkan country and the Russian Federation.\u201dRussia is trying to establish itself in the region, both with government and business, so when these countries do enter the European Union, \u201cthey will bring Russian influence with them,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said.The strategy is similar to what China and Russia are doing with Greece and Cyprus, widely considered places where Russian money can be laundered into euros.Russia is also deeply engaged in local language media, both with Kremlin-owned websites like Sputnik and with bots that harp on local grievances.\u201cIs the E.U. sensitive enough to what is happening in Serbia?\u201d Mr. Galeotti asked.He thinks not. \u201cE.U. policy has generally been to support whatever keeps the Western Balkans quiet,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply dangerous and creates the perfect environment for Moscow to play its games.\u201dBrussels, he and others say, should put more weight behind both the carrots and the sticks \u2014 offering genuine incentives for institutional reform, and genuine sanctions for falling short.A former senior United States official called the region a new Cold War battlefield, and said that Brussels was too rigid with the ways it tried to keep people on the good behavior track, while the money is not as connected as it should be to reform goals.The official, who asked for anonymity to preserve influence in the region, said that the countries reformed only when Brussels and Washington worked together to push leaders hard to break old habits of corruption, state capture, a politicized judiciary and Russian shell companies trying to take over key infrastructure and media.\u201cIf we import fragile states into the E.U., we import fragility,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we compromise on conditions, we let in fragile countries open to foreign influences, so we have to be tough on the entry requirements.\u201dThe irony of history, Mr. Bildt mused, is that had Yugoslavia remained together, it almost surely would have been in the European Union by now, having been well ahead in 1990 of current members Romania and Bulgaria.\u201cIf the wars of dissolution hadn\u2019t happened, all of this area would have been an E.U. member,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Balkans have always lived best when integrated into a wider framework, as necessary today as in the past, and the one available today is the European Union.\u201dMr. Kupchan remains an optimist. \u201cWe know where this story will ultimately end, with all the former Yugoslav states integrated into the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump to the presidency.Now Mr. Needham is leaving his job there to become chief of staff for one of the Republican establishment\u2019s favorite sons, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.The move is certain to raise questions about whether Mr. Rubio, whose hopes of becoming president in 2016 were dashed by Mr. Trump, may be positioning himself for another run. And it underscores how unsettled the conservative movement remains nearly two years after Mr. Trump won the Republican presidential nomination and became the party\u2019s improbable leader.Both are also quite young. Mr. Needham is 36 and Mr. Rubio is 46. And both believe that the Republican Party has not done enough to rethink its animating ideas and appeal to voters at a time when Mr. Trump remains woefully unpopular with younger Americans.In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Rubio said that since his presidential campaign ended in March 2016, he has spent a lot of time contemplating what Mr. Trump got right and what he misjudged. And while Mr. Rubio insisted he had no plans to run for president again \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s so far-off in the future, I don\u2019t know where my mind will be\u201d \u2014 he said he believed that the conservative movement\u2019s tenets need to evolve beyond sterile economic arguments of low taxes and high economic growth.\u201cI think the challenge is how the policies that come from those principles, by necessity, have to look different in the 21st century than they did in 1980 or 1985,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cAmerica is not an economy. It\u2019s a country,\u201d he added, channeling some of Mr. Trump\u2019s populism. \u201cAnd we have a bigger job than just to increase G.D.P.\u201dMr. Needham said he agreed with that diagnosis.\u201cAny fair-minded observer of the last several years would say conservatives have work to do in order to assure our principles remain relevant,\u201d Mr. Needham said in an interview. \u201cThere was truth in candidate Trump\u2019s declaration that this is the Republican Party, not the Conservative Party. Our challenge as conservatives is to build a movement that inspires a majority coalition of Americans.\u201dBut beyond their shared views on the party\u2019s need to have a better 20-year plan, the two have taken very distinct approaches to leadership. Mr. Needham has been a leading practitioner of the uncompromising, scorched-earth style of political combat that was a trademark of Tea Party-inspired politicians and activists. He frequently clashed with the Republican leadership in Congress and challenged it to drive a harder bargain on issues like defunding the Affordable Care Act, which led to a two-week government shutdown in 2013 that most Republicans came to see as ill advised.Mr. Needham and Mr. Rubio have often had very different things to say about Mr. Trump. Given his anti-establishment sensibilities, Mr. Needham has largely lauded the president\u2019s agenda of low taxes and a hard-line posture toward China. He has praised Mr. Trump for helping the Republican Party forge a stronger bond with Americans who feel socially and economically disconnected and who are eager to shine a light on the corruption and cronyism they believe is rampant in Washington.Mr. Needham and Mr. Rubio both agree there is a need now to work with the president as much as possible while also looking beyond him to plan for what the party and the country look like once he is gone.\u201cAs someone who\u2019s lived his career in the movement, the challenge is preserving the principles that Reagan fought for while also being able to refresh that pool of ideas to keep pace with our times,\u201d Mr. Needham said. \u201cThat\u2019s a bigger effort than any one president or any one person.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a meeting with business leaders last year, an executive of one of America\u2019s largest exporters told the president that labeling China a currency manipulator could be harmful for his business, a person briefed on the discussion said.The president responded incredulously, and was surprised when the other executives in attendance said they completely agreed, the person said.The Treasury Department determines if a country should be labeled a currency manipulator based on bilateral trade deficits and signs that another country is depressing the value of its currency. The United States has not officially called another country a manipulator since it slapped the label on China in 1994, and doing so is supposed to kick-start negotiations to resolve the problem.This year China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and India were placed on Treasury\u2019s monitoring list for potential currency manipulation.Corporate chiefs and investors are hoping that the U.S. and China can negotiate a settlement before the tariffs go into effect. But that looks highly uncertain. The countries are not currently engaging in formal negotiations, and the United States has not presented China with a list of actions it could take to avoid the tariff threats.Instead, the Trump administration appears to be pushing ahead on tariffs, as well as restrictions on investment that are expected be announced in the coming months. The United States trade representative is aiming to publish a list of Chinese goods as early as next week that would incur additional tariffs if Mr. Trump makes good on his most recent threat to tax an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods.The White House has already begun imposing tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum and has outlined another $50 billion worth of imports that would be subject to tariffs, including flat-screen TVs. The Chinese, in return, have begun imposing tariffs on American pork and threatened levies on additional products, primarily agricultural.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ten Women Whose Tongues and Pens Were as \u2018Sharp\u2019 as Knives", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionDorothy ParkerWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cOne must have a mind of winter,\u201d Wallace Stevens writes in his poem \u201cThe Snow Man.\u201d It\u2019s the cold eye that beholds, without sentimentality or fear, \u201cNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.\u201d In \u201cSharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion,\u201d the journalist Michelle Dean has rounded up 10 minds of winter, all of them female, all of them prominent writers whose criticism, long-form reporting, fiction and satire have shaped thinking on world events and cultural dramas: Dorothy Parker, Rebecca West, Hannah Arendt, Mary McCarthy, Susan Sontag, Pauline Kael, Joan Didion, Nora Ephron, Renata Adler and Janet Malcolm. Dean gathered these women together, she says in her preface, \u201cunder the sign of a compliment that every one of them received in their lives: They were called sharp.\u201dIt is, of course, a compliment with an edge. Call a man \u201csharp\u201d and he\u2019s stylish, incisive, smart. Apply it to a woman, Dean writes, and there\u2019s a \u201csense of terror underlying it. Sharpness, after all, cuts.\u201d A virtue of her book is that it shows how each woman, by wielding a pen as if it were a scalpel or a scimitar, confounded the gender norm of niceness and placed her analytical prowess front and center. Among 20th-century intellectuals, \u201cmen might have outnumbered women, demographically,\u201d Dean writes, but \u201cin the arguably more crucial matter of producing work worth remembering, the work that defined the terms of their scene, the women were right up to par \u2014 and often beyond it.\u201d I agree with her.Dean has arranged her book as a series of biographical portraits, one woman to a chapter, in chronological order. She also includes shorter segue chapters \u2014 entr\u2019actes \u2014 in which two or three of the women intersect. (These include cameo appearances by the African-American novelist Zora Neale Hurston and the combative playwright Lillian Hellman.) As with all such lineups, Dean\u2019s raises questions about who is there and who isn\u2019t. Would she have been better off beginning with Virginia Woolf rather than Dorothy Parker? Woolf was a consummate artist and pioneering feminist, arguably greater than any of Dean\u2019s 10, while Parker, who could be harder on herself than she was on her victims \u2014 self-regarding writers (whom she parodied), forgettable plays, bad books \u2014 wouldn\u2019t dream of calling her writing \u201cart.\u201dBy stressing \u201copinion\u201d in the book\u2019s subtitle, however, Dean has framed sharpness as a barbed pulpit in which the public intellectual or critic-as-virtuoso resides. Where the mysterious interiority of Woolf\u2019s novels was never going to grab the masses, Parker\u2019s brittle, witty verse (\u201cIf I\u2019m in bed each night by 10, I may get back my looks again\u201d) had real cultural currency in the late 1920s, with its partied-out flappers and collapsing economy. I do wonder, though, why Camille Paglia, the queen Hippolyte of 1990s cultural criticism, isn\u2019t here.Well, it\u2019s Dean\u2019s party and she\u2019s invited the sharps she most admires, even if they don\u2019t always admire one another. Positioning herself not as a scholar breaking new ground (many of these women have been well covered in biographies, memoirs and academic studies) but as a missionary championing her subjects\u2019 \u201coppositional spirit,\u201d Dean artfully shepherds the reader through the professional and personal ups and downs of each life, keeping an eye on the affinities \u2014 a taste for battle, an ethic of intellectual honesty \u2014 that made some of them allies (McCarthy and Arendt, Arendt and Adler) and drove others apart (McCarthy and Sontag, Adler and Kael).A leitmotif \u2014 at least until Didion, Ephron and Malcolm come along \u2014 is that of being \u201cthe only woman at the table.\u201d Parker embodied this as a member of the Algonquin Round Table, a charmed lunch club in which writers jousted with quips and witticisms. She wasn\u2019t the only woman at this table, but she was the one who memorably bested the men \u2014 her pun on \u201chorticulture\u201d is by far the most quoted piece of Algonquin wordplay. Indeed, two themes run through this book: the hard-won autonomy of the one girl in the boys\u2019 club and her ambivalence toward the feminist movement. Though McCarthy once characterized her heroine in a short story \u2014 a clear alter ego \u2014 as \u201ca princess among the trolls,\u201d and Sontag complained about being the only woman on countless panels, both accepted elevated status as their due and neither felt obliged to lower the ladder for other women. (A story went around that McCarthy baited the younger Sontag, who was suddenly turning heads, by saying, \u201cI hear you\u2019re the new me.\u201d) The political philosopher Arendt \u201cwas steadfastly against feminism until her dying day,\u201d Dean writes. She didn\u2019t think it was a serious use of brainpower. And Didion called some of the movement\u2019s methods \u201cStalinist.\u201dDean teases out the tangled intramural politics, which in many cases trace back to a shared stance against groupthink \u2014 including the groupthink of some schools of feminism. \u201cI ran into quite a lot of people who wanted to cut these women out of history,\u201d Dean writes, \u201cprecisely because they took advantage of their talents, and did so without turning those talents to the explicit support of feminism. It is viewed as an unforgivable lapse.\u201d This is shocking, and it would have been interesting to know if the unforgiving are activists, academics or what.For readers unfamiliar with the work of these women, \u201cSharp\u201d should be eye-opening. Dean traverses the intellectual landscape of the 20th century at an easy gallop \u2014 the boozy cocktail parties; the plotting of editors in their offices; the literary and political trench wars, aggressive essays thrown across the breach like grenades. She is frank, giving us the skinny. She admits that much of Parker\u2019s verse doesn\u2019t hold up (\u201cIt seems clich\u00e9d, overwrought\u201d), and owns that Kael, the brilliant film critic of The New Yorker, was less than authoritative on subjects requiring sustained research. (In her book on \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d Kael lined up opinions that supported her thesis yet never interviewed Orson Welles, the film\u2019s director, who was very much alive.) Writing about Adler, the critic and novelist, Dean shows how a relentless need to attack can shade into self-sabotage: It\u2019s one thing to go ferociously at your subjects, backed by a nurturing editor, and quite another to launch an Electra-like offensive against that editor\u2019s replacement.For those who have lived with these writers for years, Dean can come up short. When she writes that Adler, in her famous New York Review of Books hatchet job on Kael\u2019s criticism, \u201cmade a decent case,\u201d it\u2019s not enough. Adler was lawyerly, certainly, running down Kael\u2019s every repeated trope and overused word, but her attack was as humorless as Kael\u2019s reviews are pleasurable. You can be so right that you\u2019re wrong, and I wondered what Dean really thinks.And what of Ephron, the comic writer and filmmaker whose motto, tattooed on her psyche by her alcoholic mother, was \u201ceverything is copy\u201d \u2014 a phrase that could have been coined by Parker, for whom nothing was sacred and with whom Ephron identified early on. Sure, she wrote \u201cHeartburn,\u201d which shocked the mediacracy by broadcasting raw details from her failed marriage to Carl Bernstein. But what was oppositional about Ephron\u2019s work in Hollywood? Her rom-coms \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d and \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d are formulaic films that pander, with none of the vicious wit her friends enjoyed. (It\u2019s been said that at parties one didn\u2019t want to be the first to leave a conversation that included Ephron, lest she entertain those who remained with a zinger about you.) Did Ephron sell out? Or did she find another way to be the only woman at the table, this time in Tinseltown, where she got to be as trite as the men? Dean doesn\u2019t say.Then there\u2019s Malcolm, who at The New Yorker has made a specialty of reportage that stubbornly hovers in the zone where truth, story, presumption and the law merge into mist. She herself, like the Cheshire Cat, appears and disappears, which brings yet another dimension to writing on subjects such as psychoanalysis, crime, and ethics in journalism and biography. Over a long career, an oppositional sensibility can become a default strategy that subtly or not so subtly distorts the picture, and Malcolm\u2019s ineffable calculation sometimes leaves one queasy about her motives. \u201cThe experience of reading a Malcolm text,\u201d Dean writes, \u201cis always to linger in that sense of uncertainty, both about the nominal subject \u2026 and about exactly what new kind of sly trick the narrator might be pulling on us.\u201d Is this the art of opinion? Or something else?One is also curious to know where Dean stands on Arendt\u2019s \u201cEichmann in Jerusalem,\u201d a 1963 meditation on war crimes that was incendiary because of its problematic phrase \u201cthe banality of evil,\u201d and a tone so cold that Arendt\u2019s friend the Jewish historian Gershom Scholem thought it flippant (some used the word cruel). Dean lays out this controversy, and many others, with a deft hand, but sometimes skips ahead just when we want her to deliver her own view.I was struck, as well, by the number of sloppy sentences. Dean knows that clarity doesn\u2019t exist without precision; Ephron\u2019s meandering style, for instance, is so controlled it\u2019s practically pointillist. And yet Dean\u2019s own writing, direct and lively, can get too loosely conversational \u2014 too wordy and imprecise. Her chatty approach to these formidable women makes them seem accessible, and that\u2019s a good thing. But a blue pencil is as strong as a sword, and more cut and thrust would have made this book sharper.Laura Jacobs\u2019s latest book, \u201cCelestial Bodies: How to Look at Ballet,\u201d will be published in May.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Siberia, an Unlikely Cry: \u2018We Need Greenpeace Out Here!\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTas-Yuryakh JournalTAS-YURYAKH, Russia \u2014 At a truck stop at the northern terminus of the Vilyui ice highway in northeastern Siberia, drivers make small talk not about life on the road but rather the life of the road.It might last another week, suggested one driver casually, tucking into a steaming plate of meatballs.\u201cNot likely,\u201d countered Maxim A. Andreyevsky, 31, the driver of a crude oil tanker truck. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see the shimmer on the surface? It will be gone in a day or two.\u201dEvery spring, thousands of miles of so-called winter highway in Russia, mostly serving oil and mining towns in Siberia and far northern European Russia, melt back into the swamps from which they were conjured up the previous fall. And every year, it seems to the men whose livelihoods depend upon it, the road of ice melts earlier.\u201cOf course people are to blame,\u201d Mr. Andreyevsky said. \u201cThey pump so much gas, they pump so much oil. Brother, we need Greenpeace out here.\u201dWith highways made of ice, including the icy surfaces of deep lakes and rivers, all it takes is one pleasantly warm spring day for the highway to vanish. Every year, officials say, at least one big rig goes through the ice of a lake or big river.\u201cThe danger is always with the daring truck drivers,\u201d said Aleksandr A. Kondratyev, the director of the regional department of roads in Mirny, a diamond-mining town in northeastern Siberia linked to the rest of Russia to the south only by the Vilyui ice road. Most of the time, he said, they escape with their lives.When the Vilyui ice highway first opened in 1976, its builders celebrated the occasion on Revolution Day, Nov. 7, Mr. Kondratyev said. These days, the road rarely opens before mid-December, he said, and it now typically closes on April 1, about a month earlier than it used to.For truck drivers in this part of Siberia, The Plate, the truck stop that marks the Vilyui highway\u2019s northern end, is an island of comfort in a sea of snow.Drivers stepped in, kicked snow off their boots and lined up at a counter to order their last restaurant meal for three days, the typical time it takes to drive over the ice to the next gravel road. Outside, a skinny, angry Siberian husky tied to a tree barked fiercely at anybody who came near.Ice highways are integral to Russia\u2019s mining and oil economy in the Far North, as they are in Canada and Alaska, where ice roads are also freezing later and melting earlier.The highways are surfaced with ice either graded by a bulldozer from frozen swamp or formed by spraying river water onto the intended site of the road and allowing it to freeze.The winter roads take shortcuts across frozen lakes and rivers but mostly traverse permafrost, the layer of frozen, prehistoric swamp that when melted resembles frozen spinach after a spell in the microwave.At the top is what is known as the active layer, or the upper five to 10 feet that thaws and refreezes every year. In the fall, this layer becomes construction material for Russia\u2019s ice road builders.The first crews arrive in a \u201clight column\u201d of bulldozers traveling on the still boggy ground to plow insulating snow from the future road, exposing the soil to cold air and hastening a deep freeze. A bulldozer makes a final pass to smooth it off and the road is done \u2014 until the first warm spring day.This road is in fact a 508-mile long ice rink, hard and slippery under a coating of blown snow, connecting the Yakutsk and Irkutsk regions of Siberia. When the road melts, The Plate truck stop shutters for the summer.Late in the season, Siberian trucking companies raise fees for drivers to compensate for the danger and difficulty of driving during the spring thaw. Ice trucking is in any case handsomely compensated, by Russian standards.In the dead of winter, drivers at The Plate said, shipping companies pay about $500 for a one-way run over the Vilyui highway. After mid-April, the rate goes above $700.But it\u2019s hard work. The wife of one truck driver on the Vilyui highway wrote a book about his life with the title, \u201cTerritory of Risk.\u201dWhen a truck breaks the ice on a river crossing, \u201cyou don\u2019t hear anything,\u201d in the cab over the thrum of the motor, said Aleksandr G. Potashov, nursing a cup of tea at The Plate before setting off. \u201cYou just feel the truck collapsing in.\u201dOn an ice road river crossing, drivers say, seatbelts must be unfastened, to make a quick escape in the event of a breakthrough.Another hazard is melt water pooling on the icy road surface, rendering it too slippery to ascend grades and reflecting light in the shimmer that Mr. Andreyevsky said he had noticed on the road.Out on an ice road, a warm spring day is a curse. Polishing off their meals, drivers recalled melts of years past. In 1996, an unexpectedly warm spring stranded dozens of truckers along hundreds of miles of the Vilyui highway.In these cases, the trucks and their cargo stay put until the next winter. Drivers fell trees and build platforms of logs for the trucks, lest the vehicles sink forever.Ruslan A. Sizonov, a director of logistics at the Alrosa mining company, who said the warming winters were shrinking the window for hauling in heavy equipment and fuel, even as the cost of the road remained the same. Russia\u2019s federal government contracts with the mining company to build the road, at an annual cost of about $3,050 per mile at the current exchange rate.The Arctic has been warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth, scientists say. Last month, the maximum extent of Arctic Ocean ice cover was the second lowest since satellite record keeping began in the 1970s.This year, Mr. Andreyevsky set off in his Renault truck on March 29, two days before the official closure of the road on April 1. While a few warm days came earlier last month, on that day the temperature was a safe -10 degrees Fahrenheit.The plan was to make it to the graveled surface in the south before the melt.If he makes it out with his crude oil load, Mr. Andreyevsky joked, he would only be adding to the road\u2019s woes.\u201cOf course there is an effect,\u201d on the climate from burning oil, he said. \u201cThe exhaust pipes are smoking.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Drops Troop Demand, but U.S. Reacts Warily", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNorth Korea has dropped its demand that American troops be removed from South Korea as a condition for giving up its nuclear weapons, South Korea\u2019s president said Thursday in presenting the idea to the United States.President Moon Jae-in portrayed the proposal as a concession on the eve of talks involving the two Koreas and the United States. The North has long demanded that the 28,500 American troops be withdrawn, citing their presence as a pretext to justify its pursuit of nuclear weapons.The move could increase pressure on the United States to support negotiations between North and South Korea on a peace treaty that would end the Korean War. While Mr. Trump gave those talks his blessing this week, officials said his ultimate goal is to force North Korea to relinquish its nuclear program. A peace treaty, they said, should be signed only after the North has given up its weapons.\u201cWe have great respect for many aspects of what they\u2019re doing, but we have to get it together,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. \u201cWe have to end nuclear weapons.\u201dAnalysts and former officials said the White House was right to be wary of Mr. Kim\u2019s offer. They said it could drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea, which is deeply invested in bringing an end to the 68-year military conflict on the Korean Peninsula and will view Mr. Kim\u2019s offer as an important step in that direction.\u201cIt\u2019s a classic, deft North Korean maneuver, which puts us at a disadvantage and makes us look like bad guys if we reject it,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.In South Korea, where Mr. Moon announced Mr. Kim\u2019s shift, he said it had encouraged the United States to proceed with plans to hold its first-ever summit meeting with North Korea. And he said the North was already showing a willingness to make concessions.\u201cThe North Koreans did not present any conditions that the United States could not accept, such as the withdrawal of American troops in South Korea,\u201d Mr. Moon told newspaper publishers in Seoul, before his own planned summit meeting with Mr. Kim next Friday.\u201cThey only talk about an end to hostilities against their country and about getting security guarantees,\u201d Mr. Moon said. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that the plans for dialogue between the North and the United States could proceed because that has been made clear.\u201dWhen Mr. Moon\u2019s special envoys met with Mr. Kim in Pyongyang last month, Mr. Kim said his country would no longer need nuclear weapons if it did not feel \u201cthreatened militarily\u201d and was provided with \u201csecurity guarantees.\u201dNorth Korea issued an official government statement as recently as 2016 calling on Washington to announce the withdrawal of American troops if it wanted to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.Since the 1990s, however, North Korean officials have occasionally told the Americans and South Koreans that they could live with an American military presence if Washington signed a peace treaty and normalized ties with the North. Mr. Kim\u2019s father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, sent a party secretary to the United States in 1992 to deliver that message.When South Korea\u2019s president at the time, Kim Dae-jung, met with Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang in 2000, the North Korean leader was quoted as saying that keeping American troops in Korea for \u201cstability in Northeast Asia\u201d even after a reunification was \u201cnot a bad idea, provided that the status and the role of U.S. troops be changed.\u201d\u201cIt is desirable that U.S. troops stay as a peacekeeping force in Korea, instead of a hostile force against the North,\u201d Kim Jong-il said, according to the book \u201cPeacemaker,\u201d by Lim Dong-won, who attended the 2000 inter-Korean summit meeting.Despite their suspicions about the younger Mr. Kim\u2019s motives, American officials did not diminish the significance of his offer from a domestic standpoint. For decades, they said, the Kim family has survived by fueling a narrative of American aggression against the North. Declaring they could live with troops could undercut that narrative.They said the announcement built on Mr. Kim\u2019s earlier decision not to protest joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea \u2014 a step that did smooth the way for Mr. Trump to accept Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to meet.To some extent, administration officials also need to manage Mr. Trump, who speaks often of the historic opportunity he has to settle one of the world\u2019s longest-running conflicts.\u201cWe\u2019ve never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it\u2019s father, grandfather or son,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I hope to have a very successful meeting.\u201dThe president did not address the news of North Korea\u2019s offer on troops on Thursday. After Mr. Abe left Palm Beach, Fla., on Thursday, Mr. Trump pivoted from diplomacy to law enforcement, traveling to a sun-kissed military base in Key West to showcase his administration\u2019s efforts to cut off the flow of drugs into the United States from Central and South America.Administration officials have been extremely circumspect about what Mr. Pompeo discussed with Mr. Kim during their meeting over Easter weekend. But he did raise the issue of three Americans detained in North Korea, and officials expressed cautious optimism that the United States was making progress in getting them out.Analysts said that even if North Korea accepted an American military presence in the South, it might demand that it be significantly reconfigured and reduced.In its 2016 statement, North Korea also demanded that the United States stop deploying long-range bombers, submarines and other \u201cnuclear-strike capabilities\u201d in and around South Korea if it wanted a nuclear-free peninsula, a condition that analysts said would doubtless please China.On Thursday, Mr. Moon dismissed concerns that the United States might end up recognizing North Korea as a de facto nuclear power in return for a promise to freeze its nuclear and missile programs.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any difference between the parties over what they mean by denuclearization,\u201d Mr. Moon said. \u201cNorth Korea is expressing a willingness to denuclearize completely.\u201dIn the separate South Korean and American summit meetings with Mr. Kim, Mr. Moon said there would be \u201cno big difficulties\u201d in reaching \u201cbroad agreements in principle.\u201d North Korea, he said, would agree to denuclearize in return for normalized ties with the United States; aid to help rebuild its economy; and a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War. The challenge, he said, is in working out a road map to such a deal.\u201cAs they say, the devil is in details,\u201d Mr. Moon said.Advertisement"}

Senator Susan Collins of Maine had made it clear that she was a no; John McCain, Rand Paul and Murkowski had expressed reservations but not yet declared their decisions.On the plane, Willoughby took the opportunity to ask Murkowski what everyone wanted to know: \u201cHave you decided which way you are going to vote on the health care bill?\u201d Murkowski told Willoughby that the last bill she saw was \u201cunpassable,\u201d adding, \u201cWe have to get this right.\u201dWilloughby left the flight feeling hopeful that Murkowski would not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Three weeks later, Murkowski did, in fact, cast one of the three decisive votes that killed the bill. One of Willoughby\u2019s fellow ReSisters, Julie Nielsen, a fisheries biologist with a side passion for health care reform, was so happy that she put a bright pink sign in the window of her office overlooking one of the main shopping streets in Juneau. \u201cThank you Lisa!!\u201d read the sign. In the middle of the \u201cO\u201d in \u201cyou,\u201d she had drawn a big heart.At a celebration rally in Anchorage a few days later, 200 people, many wearing pussy-hat pink, showed their appreciation. Over and over, the organizer screamed, \u201cThank you!\u201d and the ralliers screamed back, \u201cLisa!\u201d Barely known outside her own state before the Trump era, Murkowski, to moderates and liberals across the country, became an improbable hero, a symbol of resistance and integrity; hundreds of grateful phone calls poured in, as well as calls from the press and from governors wanting to collaborate with her on rethinking health care policy. Murkowski, a Slate headline read, had \u201cstood up for womankind over the threats of men\u201d; Bustle, a website for women, instructed readers on how to write letters to Murkowski that would make sure she knew they cared.The love-in lasted barely four months. Then came the tax bill. Liberals railed against its breaks for the rich; environmentalists bemoaned a provision allowing for drilling in Alaska. Murkowski stayed silent but ultimately announced a few days before the bill came to the floor that she would support it. The responses to her anodyne Twitter feed, which generally features photos of ribbon-cutting-type ceremonies or Alaska\u2019s many waterways, turned almost entirely venomous (\u201cSell Out!!! Shame on you!!\u201d read a typical one). Murkowski\u2019s vote should hardly have come as a surprise; there is no more core value to Republicans than cutting taxes and no dream more dear to most Alaskans than ever more oil drilling.Nonetheless, it was a blow to those who had recently come to hold her in such high regard. \u201cIt was a tough loss from our end, because we really did think we could get her,\u201d says Angel Padilla, the national policy director for the Indivisible Project, a liberal activist group that had helped coordinate protests against the bill in Murkowski\u2019s offices. Nielsen, the biologist, said this spring that she was disillusioned with Murkowski. The pink sign? \u201cI felt like ripping it up,\u201d she told me.When I met with Murkowski at her Washington office in February, she could evaluate those episodes with some distance. We talked in a small, windowless meeting room inside the Hart Senate Office Building. Murkowski, like the room itself, was notably unadorned (although Murkowski, unlike the room, is photogenic); in Alaska, accessibility trumps formality. \u201cEveryone in Alaska just calls her Lisa,\u201d Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins, a state legislator, told me. \u201cShe\u2019s a mononym, like Charo.\u201dLiberals\u2019 disappointment with Murkowski had not escaped her. \u201cYou know,\u201d Murkowski said, \u201cone minute you\u2019re the darling of the world. We\u2019ve come together, and we\u2019ve stood up against the administration. And then when you vote for something the administration supports, everyone says, \u2018What happened?\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, what did you expect me to do?\u2019\u2009\u201d Murkowski looked almost baffled. \u201cI\u2019m still a Republican.\u201dWhile we waited, Murkowski talked about her family: The five brothers and sisters, the husband, Verne, who encouraged her to start her career in state politics while he looked after their two sons (now 25 and 26). The arrangement worked well, but lately even her marriage was feeling the strains of her political life. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten harder,\u201d she said, staring straight ahead through the windshield, \u201cwith the strangeness of politics right now. Because he\u2019s got his opinions, too. And I just sometimes \u2014 well, not sometimes, most times \u2014 when I come home, I am just, I don\u2019t really want to talk about politics. I want to talk about the flooring that you laid in the living room today.\u201d\u201cI had my mom voice on that day,\u201d Murkowski would tell me later. \u201cKarina knows.\u201d She looked at Karina Petersen, her communications director. \u201cI wanted it all in caps with three exclamation points.\u201d Petersen laughed. \u201cWe talked her down to one exclamation point,\u201d Petersen said.Murkowski is one of only a handful of Republican senators who have shown some degree of independence from Trump. The Republican dissenters fall into a few categories. There are the critics, the most vociferous of whom are Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, both senators who are not running for re-election. There are the strayers, among them Murkowski and Collins, who have criticized Trump and also voted against him on major legislation. Rand Paul, the staunch libertarian, votes with Trump less often than any other Republican senator, but he has also gone out of his way to defend him. Lindsey Graham votes with the president slightly more often than Murkowski and Collins, but he joins them in yet another category: the pragmatists. Those senators have staked out the now-controversial position that they would rather get something done than nothing, even if it means compromising with Democrats. Murkowski, who has exercised her independence in all three ways, has nonetheless managed to bring back to her state its most long-desired spoils \u2014 more opportunities for drilling and more opportunities for building in previously protected wilderness.Murkowski landed in the Senate essentially by fiat: In 2002, her father, Frank Murkowski, then a senator, was elected governor of Alaska and had to choose a successor. He publicly considered an up-and-coming mayor from Wasilla, Sarah Palin, then rejected her. Instead, he appointed his daughter Lisa, who had been a state legislator for all of four years. The blatant act of nepotism dogged Frank Murkowski, who went on in 2006 to face Palin in a primary challenge for governor, which she easily won.That history still seemed fresh in 2010, when Palin backed another Republican, Joe Miller, a friend of Palin\u2019s husband and a Tea Party favorite, in his challenge to Lisa Murkowski in the Republican Senate primary. \u201cI think she\u2019s out for her own self-interest,\u201d Murkowski said of Palin on the evening of the election. To the surprise of many Alaskans, Miller won. \u201cDo you believe in miracles?\u201d Palin tweeted to her followers.From the moment the result was announced, friends and supporters began texting Murkowski to urge her to run in the general election as a write-in candidate. \u201cLeadership told her not to do it, that she was going to jeopardize the seat and have a Democrat win,\u201d says Andrew Halcro, a former Republican state legislator and a friend who served with Murkowski. \u201cI think at that point, Lisa recognized, \u2018I don\u2019t have any friends.\u2019\u2009\u201d Murkowski decided to mount the write-in campaign.She ran as a Republican, but in both Alaska and Washington, the party seemed comfortable moving on without her. The National Republican Senatorial Committee spent more than $1 million funding Miller, with the Tea Party Express adding $600,000. Not long after she started the campaign, Murkowski learned, while she was in Alaska, that Senate Republicans were considering voting the next day to remove her from her position as the ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \u201cI have basically been written off by the senatorial committee,\u201d she said, recalling her state of mind in a memoir by Arlen Specter, the moderate former senator from Pennsylvania, \u201cand I\u2019m not going back begging and pleading. My relationships will either stand on their own or not.\u201d In the end, she held on to her post.Murkowski, whom Palin had tried to cast as part of the entrenched establishment, suddenly became the underdog, a shift that galvanized her campaign. Her team passed out plastic bracelets that said, \u201cfill it in, write it in,\u201d with the correct spelling of her name. Murkowski defeated Miller, with the help of traditional Democratic constituencies like women and Alaska Natives. \u201cIt was an unusual coalition for a Republican,\u201d said Mark Begich, at the time Alaska\u2019s other senator and a Democrat.In mid-July, Murkowski sent the group a text with a photo showing her bare, pedicured feet and a thick pile of paper on her lap. \u201cSunday morning with the health care bill,\u201d she wrote. A cousin wrote back: \u201cPeople I run into are telling me that they are worried about you and the pressure you must feel. Like I tell Jack\u201d \u2014 the cousin\u2019s son \u2014 \u201cgo be a leader today. I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d Another added: \u201cWe are tough, and you will be the voice of reason on this. I can feel it.\u201dMurkowski made it clear where she stood on certain issues that would come up in the repeal bill. She announced to the State Legislature that she was concerned about possible rollbacks of the Medicaid expansion and said in no uncertain terms that she would not support a repeal bill that defunded Planned Parenthood, which Alaskans also depend on for community health care. And yet, in subsequent months, the bill \u2014 written by 13 male Republicans \u2014 kept turning up, in revision after revision, with significant cuts to the nonprofit organization\u2019s funding.By early summer, the young staff members answering the phone in Murkowski\u2019s office were subject to scores of aggressive calls from citizens on both sides of the debate. Within the office, there was tension among high-ranking staff members about what she should do. Throngs of health care reporters chased Murkowski down Senate halls, a stress she did not always handle well. \u201cHey,\u201d Murkowski snapped at CNN\u2019s Manu Raju when he followed her down a Senate hallway to try to get a comment on what she thought of the House health care repeal bill. \u201cWould you please be respectful?\u201d she asked, her own tone harsh.Finally, in late July, she voted against a procedural motion that would have allowed the repeal bill to come to the Senate floor. Dan Sullivan, Alaska\u2019s other senator and a fellow Republican, told the press that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had called with a threatening message. Sullivan was concerned, he said, that some of the administration\u2019s pro-energy policies \u201care going to stop.\u201d It was a brazen threat to a member of another branch of government, as if Trump had shown up on the Senate floor to shake a fist in Murkowski\u2019s face.In those tense days leading up to the votes, Patty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington State, occasionally called Murkowski and Collins, who she knew were under considerable pressure, to offer support \u2014 and see if anything had changed. On the issue of Planned Parenthood, Murray told me, \u201cthis is something they have run on, fought for, worked with all of us on for many years.\u201dTo the extent that there is any remaining spirit of bipartisanship in the Senate, Murray believes it is fostered at monthly dinners that the female senators try to have together. They are sometimes held in the Capitol\u2019s Strom Thurmond Room (\u201cironically,\u201d says Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat; Murray has said that Thurmond once tried to fondle her in an elevator). \u201cWe play some music; we drink a little wine,\u201d says Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democratic senator from New York. Once, the group went bowling, complete with shirts embroidered with nicknames. Murray believes that the conversation was different among female senators than among male ones. \u201cMen, when you hear Chuck Schumer\u201d \u2014 the Democratic minority leader in the Senate \u2014 \u201cand I don\u2019t want to frame it just about Chuck, they share information so they can get information to get things,\u201d Murray says. \u201cWe listen to each other to see why we believe. You can go to a gym and find out if the Republicans are having a vote at 4 and feel you\u2019ve got some power. We actually want to understand each other.\u201dThe day of the final vote, Collins joined Murkowski, who was talking to McCain on the Senate floor, to provide moral support and find out if he was with them or not. \u201cYou two are right,\u201d he told them. When Pence turned up to try to persuade McCain to vote for the repeal, Collins left to give them some privacy. Collins walked past Murray\u2019s seat, and the senators exchanged glances.At the first Republican caucus lunch held after the health care repeal failed, Senator David Perdue of Georgia lashed out at the dissenting senators; later, in a news release, he called for more accountability for committee leaders who voted against the party, implying that he thought they should lose their senior posts. \u201cSuffice it to say, it was a harsh lunch with some heavy criticism,\u201d Collins told me. \u201cIt was uncomfortable, definitely, but I was more annoyed. And I did not go to lunch the next day. To try to send a little message of my own.\u201dMurkowski did go; she knew she had already weathered worse from her Republican Senate colleagues. \u201cI would much rather have that airing and be there,\u201d she said, \u201cthan find out later that there was another gathering and that they talked about us.\u201dOne woman at the barbecue \u2014 the only one wearing a suit \u2014 had flown from Washington to present Murkowski with a plaque from the National Association of Community Health Centers. She thanked Murkowski formally; many others expressed their appreciation for her vote against the repeal bill \u2014 and for her resolve. \u201cI just really want to thank you for standing up to him,\u201d said one of the community health center\u2019s social workers, a longtime transplant from New Jersey.Back in Murkowski\u2019s Washington office, her staff debated how to manage her newly heightened profile. Murkowski had no interest in becoming the face of an anti-Trump movement. For months she wanted to operate discreetly under the radar, as she strategized to find a way to get Congress to agree to open ANWR for drilling. In January, shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, she approached McConnell to propose that they attach the ANWR provision to a bill that could not be filibustered, and thus would require only 50 votes to pass. McConnell agreed, and soon after \u201cwas when we really got things going, but we did it quietly,\u201d she told a newsletter that covers the energy industry. She wanted to avoid environmentalists\u2019 typical attempts to \u201cerode and undercut\u201d those efforts, she said.When details of the Senate tax bill started to emerge in the fall, it became clear that many Republicans hoped the ultimate bill would contain a provision that opened up a portion of ANWR for drilling, as well as language that would eliminate the individual mandate for health insurance, which most economists argue would gut the Affordable Care Act. Nonprofit organizations like the Center for Popular Democracy tried to rally grass-roots activists in Anchorage and raised money to fly a handful of Alaskans to Washington to show up at Murkowski\u2019s office. \u201cI thought she would realize she could not maintain her political success, and her popularity, if she was to repeal any part of Obamacare,\u201d says Jennifer Flynn Walker, the director of mobilization for the organization.But in Alaska, most residents knew that she would vote for the tax bill. \u201cYou have to understand, ANWR is like the holy grail for Alaskan politicians for the past 40 years,\u201d Halcro says. For just as long, environmentalists have fought \u2014 and in the past, recruited Republicans like McCain and Collins to their side \u2014 to protect ANWR. But in the end, every Republican senator present, including Murkowski, voted for the tax bill, and for the opening up of the refuge.Murkowski\u2019s approval rating in Alaska, which soared among progressives after the health care bill, dropped lower than it had in at least seven years. On MSNBC, Representative Joseph Crowley, a New York Democrat, attacked Murkowski for supporting the tax bill. \u201cShe got what she wants,\u201d he said, \u201cand that was her price \u2014 to sell out the Affordable Care Act and the American people.\u201dWhatever the polls said, Murkowski clearly considered passing legislation opening ANWR an unmitigated success. At a celebration for the tax bill, Murkowski beamed alongside Trump. \u201cThis is a bright day for America, so we thank you for that!\u201d she told him. In January, she tweeted her support for his State of the Union address. That month, she also posted a photograph of a Washington Post article that the president had sent her about a wilderness region where she hoped to build a road. \u201cLisa \u2014 We will get it done,\u201d Trump had written on the clip.The day I visited the community health center with Murkowski back in Bethel was the same day Trump tweeted that \u201ctwo sides\u201d shared blame for the violence that occurred at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Murkowski had not minced words then: \u201cWhat the president said yesterday was wrong,\u201d she tweeted. She could not just stand by and say nothing, she told me, \u201cwhere there is evil, where there is hatred.\u201d That week in August was a strange time of upheaval, with Trump swinging wildly, attacking even his own party members.I could not help asking in Bethel: Did Murkowski worry, as some psychiatrists were suggesting publicly, that Trump was mentally unfit to be president? She was wearing sunglasses, so I could not read her expression. She paused. \u201cI don\u2019t really know him,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it.\u201dIn her office in Washington, Murkowski was again talking about Trump when an aide poked her head in to say that Mitch McConnell was on the line. Murkowski, who was in midthought, did not move but looked at the aide steadily for a moment, as if to say: And? The aide looked nervous \u2014 McConnell had asked to pull her out, she emphasized, at which point Murkowski got up to take the call. When she came back to the office a few moments later, she looked upbeat. They had been discussing something about funding for wildfire relief, and McConnell was apparently taking her opinion under close advisement. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be loved,\u201d she said. \u201cAgain.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that people know, Don\u2019t forget to check in with Murkowski.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave the incorrect name of the law school that Senator Lisa Murkowski attended. It is Willamette University College of Law, not Willamette University Law School.An earlier version of this article misidentified the party of Andrew Halcro, a former state legislator, when he served with Murkowski in Alaska. He was a Republican, not a Democrat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unclean at Any Speed: Pruitt\u2019s Attack on Obama Auto Pollution Rule", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAnd \u2014 no surprise here \u2014 it would continue Mr. Trump\u2019s yearlong demolition of every important policy Barack Obama put in place to fight global warming. The Clean Power Plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants? Consigned to the dustbin. America\u2019s participation in the historic Paris agreement on global warming? Withdrawn. John Kerry\u2019s decision when he was secretary of state to block the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada? Revoked. And now on the chopping block, the 2012 auto efficiency rule aimed at curbing carbon emissions in the transportation sector, the country\u2019s biggest source of planet-warming gases.In short, adjustments, yes, wholesale revisions, no. There are several reasons for this caution. One has to do with preserving the industry\u2019s reputation and satisfying what amounts to its historical obligation. The Obama administration rules were plenty tough, calling for a doubling in fuel economy for new cars and light trucks, to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025, equivalent to a real-world average of 36 m.p.g. But the automakers signed on, not least because multibillion-dollar bailouts by the Bush and Obama administrations kept them afloat, for which they still owe the American taxpayer a very big thank-you. Backsliding now on public health and the environment would not do the automakers a lot of good.A second reason is California. Because of its uniquely severe smog problems, and because its clean air rules predate federal rules, California has been allowed under the Clean Air Act to set its own, and traditionally tougher, air pollution standards, as long as it is granted a waiver by the federal government to do so. This in effect has confronted the automobile industry with the need to manufacture two versions of its cars \u2014 one for California and the dozen states that have adopted California\u2019s standards, and another for the rest of the country.Part of the genius of the Obama program was that it harmonized California\u2019s rules and the federal rules. But if the Trump administration tries to undermine this deal, California has said that it will once again go its own way, fracturing the American car and light truck market. Automakers don\u2019t need that headache and expense.What Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt could both use is a history lesson. History shows that well-tailored regulation drives innovation and, far from killing jobs, as Mr. Trump contends, creates them. This is true in fields like energy, where clean air mandates led to big investments in wind and solar power. And it\u2019s true also of the automobile industry, where engineers commonly found technological answers to regulatory mandates even as industry lobbyists warned of certain bankruptcy. Detroit and foreign manufacturers in the American market have done well under the Obama rules. Those targets should remain in place and, if anything, be strengthened in the years ahead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I March in Gaza", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr.\u00a0Shammalah is the executive director of the General Union of Cultural Centers in Gaza.KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip \u2014 Early in the morning on March 30, my 7-year-old son, Ali, saw me preparing to leave the house. This was unusual for our Friday routine.\u201cWhere are you going, Dad?\u201d\u201cTo the border. To participate in the Great Return March.\u201dThe Great Return March is the name that has been given to 45 days of protest along the border between Gaza and Israel. It began on March 30, Land Day, which commemorates the 1976 killings of six Palestinians inside Israel who had been protesting land confiscations, and ends on May 15, the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 war that lead to the creation of Israel.\u201cCan I come with you?\u201d Ali pleaded. I told him it was too dangerous. If Israeli military warnings were any indication, the risk that unarmed protesters might be shot by Israeli snipers was too high. \u201cWhy are you going if you might get killed?\u201d Ali pressed me.His question stayed with me as I went to the border encampment in eastern Khan Younis, the southern Gaza town where I live. It remained with me on the following Fridays as I continued to participate in the march activities, and it lingers with me now.So why am I willing to risk my life by joining the Great Return March?There are multiple answers to Ali\u2019s question. I fully believe in the march\u2019s tactics of unarmed, direct, civilian-led mass action. I have also been inspired by how the action has unified the Palestinian people in the politically fractured Gaza Strip. And the march is an effective way to highlight the unbearable living conditions facing residents of the Gaza Strip: four hours of electricity a day, the indignity of having our economy and borders under siege, the fear of having our homes shelled.But the core reason I am participating is that years from now, I want to be able to look Ali, Karam and Adam in the eye and tell them, \u201cYour father was part of this historic, nonviolent struggle for our homeland.\u201dWestern media\u2019s coverage of the Great Return March has focused on the images of young people hurling stones and burning tires. The Israeli military portrays the action as a violent provocation by Hamas, a claim that many analysts have blindly accepted. Those depictions are in direct contradiction with my experiences on the ground.Representatives of the General Union of Cultural Centers, the nongovernmental organization for which I serve as executive director, participated in planning meetings for the march, which included voices from all segments of Gaza\u2019s civil and political society. At the border, I haven\u2019t seen a single Hamas flag, or Fatah banner, or poster for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, for that matter \u2014 paraphernalia that have been widespread in virtually every other protest I have witnessed. Here, we have flown only one flag \u2014 the Palestinian flag.True, Hamas members are participating, as they are part of the Palestinian community. But that participation signals, perhaps, that they may be shifting away from an insistence on liberating Palestine through military means and are beginning to embrace popular, unarmed civil protest. But the Great Return March is not Hamas\u2019s action. It is all of ours.And our action has been so much more than tires burning or young men throwing stones at soldiers stationed hundreds of meters away. The resistance in the encampments has been creative and beautiful. I danced the dabke, the Palestinian national dance, with other young men. I tasted samples of the traditional culinary specialties being prepared, such as msakhan (roasted chicken with onions, sumac and pine nuts) and maftool (a couscous dish). I sang traditional songs with fellow protesters and sat with elders who were sharing anecdotes about pre-1948 life in their native villages. Some Fridays, kites flew, and on others flags were hoisted on 80-foot poles to be clearly visible on the other side of the border.All this was taking place under the rifle sights of Israeli snipers stationed about 700 meters away. We were tense, we were fearful \u2014 indeed, I\u2019ve been in the proximity of people getting shot and tear-gassed \u2014 but we were joyful. The singing, the dancing, the storytelling, the flags, the kites and the food are more than symbols of cultural heritage.They demonstrate \u2014 clearly, loudly, vibrantly and peacefully \u2014 that we exist, we will remain, we are humans deserving of dignity, and we have the right to return to our homes. I long to sleep under the olive trees of Bayt Daras, my native village. I want to show Ali, Karam and Adam the mosque that my grandfather prayed in. I want to live peacefully in my historic home with all my neighbors, be they Muslim, Christian, Jewish or atheist.The people in Gaza have been living one tragedy after another: waves of mass displacement, life in squalid refugee camps, a captured economy, restricted access to fishing waters, a strangling siege and three wars in the past nine years. Israel assumed that once the generation who experienced the Nakba died, the youth would relinquish our dream of return. I believe this is partly why Israel keeps Gaza on the brink of humanitarian collapse \u2014 if our lives are reduced to a daily struggle for food, water, medicine and electricity, we won\u2019t be able to think about larger aspirations. The march is proving that my generation has no intention of abandoning our people\u2019s dreams.The Great Return March has kindled my optimism, but I am also realistic. Alone, the march will not end the siege and the occupation, address the huge power imbalance that exists between Israel and the Palestinians or right the historical wrongs. The work continues until everyone in the region can share equal rights. But I could not be more inspired by or proud of my people \u2014 seeing us united under one flag, with nearly unanimous acceptance of peaceful methods to call for our rights and insist on our humanity.Every Friday through May 15, I will continue to go to the encampments. I will go to send a message to the international community about the devastating conditions in which I am forced to raise my sons. I will go so that I can glimpse our lands \u2014 our trees \u2014 on the other side of the militarized border as Israeli soldiers surveil me through their weapons.If Ali asks me why I\u2019m returning to the Great Return March despite the danger, I will tell him this: I love my life. But more than that, I love you, Karam and Adam.

When one tried to beg off, citing a back injury, he was told: \u201cIf you don\u2019t show up, we\u2019ll come and break your back ourselves.\u201dThe phone call reached Muhammad Nasser Hamoud, a 19-year veteran of the Iraqi Directorate of Agriculture, behind the locked gate of his home, where he was hiding with his family. Terrified but unsure what else to do, he and his colleagues trudged back to their six-story office complex decorated with posters of seed hybrids.They arrived to find chairs lined up in neat rows, as if for a lecture.The commander who strode in sat facing the room, his leg splayed out so that everyone could see the pistol holstered to his thigh. For a moment, the only sounds were the hurried prayers of the civil servants mumbling under their breath.Their fears proved unfounded. Though he spoke in a menacing tone, the commander had a surprisingly tame request: Resume your jobs immediately, he told them. A sign-in sheet would be placed at the entrance to each department. Those who failed to show up would be punished.Meetings like this one occurred throughout the territory controlled by the Islamic State in 2014. Soon municipal employees were back fixing potholes, painting crosswalks, repairing power lines and overseeing payroll.\u201cWe had no choice but to go back to work,\u201d said Mr. Hamoud. \u201cWe did the same job as before. Except we were now serving a terrorist group.\u201dSince declaring a caliphate in 2014, the Islamic State has controlled large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. But after the group retreated from Mosul and Raqqa in 2017, it lost nearly all of its territory.Persistent controlCurrent controlShort-livedPopulated areasISIS Control KeyQamishliKobaniTURKEYDohukManbijHasakaTal AfarSinjarAleppoIdlibMosulRaqqaErbilSyriaIraqSulaimaniyaDeir al-ZourHamaKirkukHawijaMayadeenSukhnaHomsPalmyraLebanonIranTikritAbu KamalQaimAyn al-FarsHadithaHitBaqubaDamascusFallujaRamadiNawaBaghdadRutbaSweidaJordanDara\u2019aPersistent controlShort-livedCurrent controlPopulated areasISIS Control KeyTURKEYTURKEYAleppoMosulRaqqaSyriaSyriaIraqIraqLebanonLebanonIranIranDamascusDamascusBaghdadBaghdadJordanJordanISIS Control KeyPersistent controlShort-livedCurrent ISIS controlPopulated areasTURKEYAleppoMosulRaqqaSyriaIraqIranLebanonDamascusBaghdadJordanISIS Control KeyPersistent controlShort-livedCurrent controlPopulated areasTURKEYMosulIranRaqqaAleppoSyriaIraqDamascusBaghdadRutbaJordanISIS Control KeyPersistent controlShort-livedCurrent controlPopulated areasTURKEYMosulIranRaqqaAleppoSyriaIraqDamascusBaghdadRutbaJordanNearly all of that territory has now been lost, but what the militants left behind helps answer the troubling question of their longevity: How did a group whose spectacles of violence galvanized the world against it hold onto so much land for so long?Part of the answer can be found in more than 15,000 pages of internal Islamic State documents I recovered during five trips to Iraq over more than a year.The documents were pulled from the drawers of the desks behind which the militants once sat, from the shelves of their police stations, from the floors of their courts, from the lockers of their training camps and from the homes of their emirs, including this record detailing the jailing of a 14-year-old boy for goofing around during prayer.BADC\u00a0The ticket book was recovered in early 2017 north of Mosul in the town of Tel Kaif, in a house that ISIS had turned into a police station.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ticket book was recovered in early 2017 north of Mosul in the town of Tel Kaif, in a house that ISIS had turned into a police station.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BADCBADC\u00a0The ticket book was recovered in early 2017 north of Mosul in the town of Tel Kaif, in a house that ISIS had turned into a police station.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BADC\u00a0The ticket book was recovered in early 2017 north of Mosul in the town of Tel Kaif, in a house that ISIS had turned into a police station.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The New York Times worked with outside experts to verify their authenticity, and a team of journalists spent 15 months translating and analyzing them page by page.Individually, each piece of paper documents a single, routine interaction: A land transfer between neighbors. The sale of a ton of wheat. A fine for improper dress.But taken together, the documents in the trove reveal the inner workings of a complex system of government. They show that the group, if only for a finite amount of time, realized its dream: to establish its own state, a theocracy they considered a caliphate, run according to their strict interpretation of Islam.The world knows the Islamic State for its brutality, but the militants did not rule by the sword alone. They wielded power through two complementary tools: brutality and bureaucracy.The documents and interviews with dozens of people who lived under their rule show that the group at times offered better services and proved itself more capable than the government it had replaced.A little more than a decade later, after seizing huge tracts of Iraq and Syria, the militants tried a different tactic. They built their state on the back of the one that existed before, absorbing the administrative know-how of its hundreds of government cadres. An examination of how the group governed reveals a pattern of collaboration between the militants and the civilians under their yoke.One of the keys to their success was their diversified revenue stream. The group drew its income from so many strands of the economy that airstrikes alone were not enough to cripple it.Ledgers, receipt books and monthly budgets describe how the militants monetized every inch of territory they conquered, taxing every bushel of wheat, every liter of sheep\u2019s milk and every watermelon sold at markets they controlled. From agriculture alone, they reaped hundreds of millions of dollars. Contrary to popular perception, the group was self-financed, not dependent on external donors.More surprisingly, the documents provide further evidence that the tax revenue the Islamic State earned far outstripped income from oil sales. It was daily commerce and agriculture \u2014 not petroleum \u2014 that powered the economy of the caliphate.The United States-led coalition, trying to eject the Islamic State from the region, tried in vain to strangle the group by bombing its oil installations. It\u2019s much harder to bomb a barley field. It was not until last summer that the militants abandoned Mosul, after a battle so intense that it was compared to the worst combat of World War II.While the militants\u2019 state eventually crumbled, its blueprint remains for others to use.\u201cThe Islamic State\u2019s capacity to govern is really as dangerous as their combatants,\u201d he said.The day after the meeting, Mr. Hamoud, a Sunni, returned to work and found that his department was now staffed 100 percent by Sunnis, the sect of Islam practiced by the militants. The Shia and Christian colleagues who previously shared his office had all fled.For a while, Mr. Hamoud and the employees he supervised at the agriculture department went on much as they had before. Even the stationery they used was the same, though they were instructed to use a marker to cover up the Iraqi government\u2019s logo.But the long-bearded men who now oversaw Mr. Hamoud\u2019s department had come with a plan, and they slowly began to enact it.What began as a cosmetic change in Mr. Hamoud\u2019s office soon turned into a wholesale transformation.The militants sent female employees home for good and closed the day care center. They shuttered the office\u2019s legal department, saying disputes would now be handled according to God\u2019s law alone.And they did away with one of the department\u2019s daily duties \u2014 checking an apparatus, placed outside, to measure precipitation. Rain, they said, was a gift from Allah \u2014 and who were they to measure his gift?Employees were also told they could no longer shave, and they had to make sure the leg of their trousers did not reach the ankle.Glossy pamphlets, like the one below, pinpointed the spot on the calf where the hem of the garb worn by the companions of the Prophet around 1,400 years ago was said to have reached.AB\u201cThe Sanctity of Men\u2019s Garments\u201d told men how to dress to follow the path laid by Prophet Muhammad.

He took out the slacks he wore to work and asked his wife to trim off 5 centimeters.But the biggest change came five months into the group\u2019s rule, and it turned the hundreds of employees who had reluctantly returned to work into direct accomplices of the Islamic State. The change involved the very department Mr. Hamoud headed, which was responsible for renting government-owned land to farmers.To increase revenue, the militants ordered the agriculture department to speed up the process for renting land, streamlining a weekslong application into something that could be accomplished in an afternoon.That was just the beginning.\u201cConfiscation,\u201d the manual says, will be applied to the property of every single \u201cShia, apostate, Christian, Nusayri and Yazidi based on a lawful order issued directly by the Ministry of the Judiciary.\u201dIslamic State members are exclusively Sunni and see themselves as the only true believers. Mr. Hamoud\u2019s office was instructed to make a comprehensive list of the properties owned by non-Sunnis \u2014 and to seize them for redistribution.The confiscation didn\u2019t stop at the land and homes of the families they chased out. An entire ministry was set up to collect and reallocate beds, tables, bookshelves \u2014 even the forks the militants took from the houses they seized. They called it the Ministry of War Spoils.It was housed in a stone-faced building in western Mosul that was hit by an airstrike in the battle to retake the city. The ensuing fire consumed the structure and blackened its walls. But the charred shapes left behind still told a story. Each room served as a warehouse for ordinary household objects: kerosene heaters in one; cooking ranges in another; a jumble of air coolers and water tanks in yet another.The few papers that did not burn up showed how objects seized from the religious groups they had chased out were offered as rewards to ISIS fighters.\u201cPlease kindly approve the request of the family of the late Brother Durayd Salih Khalaf,\u201d says one letter written on the letterhead of the Islamic State\u2019s Prisoners and Martyrs Affairs Authority. The request was for a stove and a washing machine. A note scribbled at the bottom says: \u201cTo be provided with a plasma TV and stove only.\u201dAnother application from the General Telecommunications Authority requested, among other things, clothes hangers.ABC\u00a0This document was recovered in a bombed-out building in western Mosul that had served as the headquarters of the Ministry of War Spoils.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0This document was recovered in a bombed-out building in western Mosul that had served as the headquarters of the Ministry of War Spoils.

It\u2019s the good life!!! I didn\u2019t buy so much as a single fork.\u201dWhen her concerned teacher wrote back that the apartment had probably been stolen from another family, she shot back: \u201cServes them right, dirty Shia!!!\u201dThose documents revealed the inner workings of Al Qaeda, and years later I wanted to investigate the Islamic State in the same way.When the coalition forces moved to take Mosul back from the militants in late 2016, I rushed to Iraq. For three weeks, I tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to find any documents. Day after day, my team negotiated access to buildings painted with the Islamic State logo, only to find desk drawers jutting out and hard drives ripped out.Then, the day before my return flight, we met a man who remembered seeing stacks of paper inside the provincial headquarters of the Islamic State\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture in a small village called Omar Khan, 25 miles southeast of the city. The next day we traveled to the town, no more than a speck on the map of the Nineveh Plains, and entered House No. 47.My heart sank as we pushed open the door and saw the closets flung open \u2014 a clear sign that the place had already been cleared.But on the way out, I stopped at what seemed to be an outhouse. When we opened the door, we saw piles of yellow folders cinched together with twine and stacked on the floor.Folder after folder, 273 in all, identified plots of land owned by farmers who belonged to one of the faiths banned by the group. Each yellow sleeve contained the handwritten request of a Sunni applying to confiscate the property.BAAC\u00a0The leases were found by Times reporters in the village of Omar Khan in northern Iraq in December 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The leases were found by Times reporters in the village of Omar Khan in northern Iraq in December 2016.\u00a0BAACBAAC\u00a0The leases were found by Times reporters in the village of Omar Khan in northern Iraq in December 2016.\u00a0\u00a0BAAC\u00a0The leases were found by Times reporters in the village of Omar Khan in northern Iraq in December 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Doing so involved a step-by-step process, beginning with a report by a surveyor, who mapped the plot, noted important topographical features and researched the property\u2019s ownership. Once it was determined that the land was owned by one of the targeted groups, it was classified as property of the Islamic State. Then a contract was drawn up spelling out that the tenant could neither sublet the land nor modify it without the group\u2019s permission.The outhouse discovery taught me to stay off the beaten track. I learned to read the landscape for clues, starting with \u0628\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u2014 \u201cbaqiya\u201d \u2014 the first word of the Islamic State slogan. It can be translated as \u201cwill remain,\u201d and marked the buildings the group occupied, invoking its claim that the Islamic State will endure.Once we confirmed that a building had been occupied by the group, we lifted up the mattresses and pulled back the headboards of beds. We rifled through the closets, opened kitchen cupboards, followed the stairs to the roof and scanned the grounds.The danger of land mines and booby-traps hung over our team. In one villa, we found a collection of records \u2014 but could search only one set of rooms after security forces discovered an unexploded bomb.Because the buildings were near the front lines, Iraqi security forces nearly always accompanied our team. They led the way and gave permission to take the documents. In time, the troops escorting us became our sources and they, in turn, shared what they found, augmenting our cache by hundreds of records.They deemed the records to be original, based on the markings, logos and stamps, as well as the names of government offices. The terminology and design were consistent with those found on documents issued by the group in other parts of the caliphate, including as far afield as Libya.As lease after lease was translated back in New York, the same signature inked at the bottom of numerous contracts kept reappearing: \u201cChief Technical Supervisor, Mahmoud Ismael Salim, Supervisor of Land.\u201dOn my first trip back to Iraq, I showed the leases to a local police officer. He recognized the angular signature and offered to escort me to the home of the ISIS bureaucrat.The officer shrugged when asked why a man who had taken part in the group\u2019s organized land theft had not been arrested. His men were overwhelmed investigating those who had fought and killed on behalf of the terrorist group, he said. They didn\u2019t have time to also go after the hundreds of civil servants who had worked in the Islamic State\u2019s administration.Hours later, the man whose signature appeared on the lease for farmland seized from a Christian priest, on the contract for the orchards taken from a monastery, and on the deed for land stolen from a Shia family allowed us into his modest home.The only decoration in his living room was a broken clock whose hand trembled between 10:43 and 10:44.A stooped man with thick glasses, the 63-year-old Salim was visibly nervous. He explained that he had spent years overseeing the provincial office of the government of Iraq\u2019s Directorate of Agriculture, where he reported to Mr. Hamoud, whom we contacted for the first time a few days later.Mr. Salim acknowledged that it was his signature on the leases. But speaking haltingly, he claimed to have been forcibly conscripted into the bureaucracy of the terrorist state.\u201cThey took our files and started going through them, searching which of the properties belong to Shia, which of them belong to apostates, which of them are people who had left the caliphate,\u201d he said.He described informants phoning in the addresses of Shias and Christians.Sunnis who were too poor to pay the rent upfront were offered a sharecropping agreement with the Islamic State, allowing them to take possession of the stolen land in return for one-third of the future harvest.On busy days, a line snaked around his office building, made up of Sunni farmers, many of them resentful of their treatment at the hands of a Shia-led Iraqi government. In the same compound where we found the stacks of yellow folders, Mr. Salim received men he knew, whose children had played with his. They came to steal the land of other men they all knew \u2014 whose children had also grown up alongside theirs.With the stroke of his pen, farmers lost their ancestors\u2019 cropland, their sons were robbed of their inheritance and the wealth of entire families, built up over generations, was wiped out.\u201cThese are relationships we built over decades, from the time of my father, and my father\u2019s father,\u201d Mr. Salim said, pleading for understanding. \u201cThese were my brothers, but we were forced to do it.\u201dAs 2014 blurred into 2015 and Mr. Hamoud and his colleagues helped keep the machinery of government running, Islamic State soldiers set out to remake every aspect of life in the city \u2014 starting with the role of women.Mr. Hamoud, who is known as \u201cAbu Sara,\u201d or Father of Sara, gave in and bought a niqab for his daughter.As he walked to and from work, Mr. Hamoud began taking side streets to dodge the frequent executions that were being carried out in traffic circles and public squares. In one, a teenage girl accused of adultery was dragged out of a minivan and forced to her knees. Then a stone slab was dropped onto her head. On a bridge, the bodies of people accused of being spies swung from the railing.But on the same thoroughfares, Mr. Hamoud noticed something that filled him with shame: The streets were visibly cleaner than they had been when the Iraqi government was in charge.Omar Bilal Younes, a 42-year-old truck driver whose occupation allowed him to crisscross the caliphate, noticed the same improvement. \u201cGarbage collection was No. 1 under ISIS,\u201d he said, flashing a thumbs-up sign.The street sweepers hadn\u2019t changed. What had was that the militants imposed a discipline that had been lacking, said a half-dozen sanitation employees who worked under ISIS and who were interviewed in three towns after the group was forced out.\u201cThe only thing I could do during the time of government rule is to give a worker a one-day suspension without pay,\u201d said Salim Ali Sultan, who oversaw garbage collection both for the Iraqi government and later for the Islamic State in the northern Iraqi town of Tel Kaif. \u201cUnder ISIS, they could be imprisoned.\u201dResidents also said that their taps were less likely to run dry, the sewers less likely to overflow and potholes fixed more quickly under the militants, even though there were now near-daily airstrikes.Then one day, residents of Mosul saw earthmovers heading toward a neighborhood called the Industrial Area in the eastern half of the city. Laborers were seen paving a new blacktop road that would eventually run for roughly one mile, connecting two areas of the city and reducing congestion.The new highway was called \u201cCaliphate Way.\u201dThe new government did not concern itself only with administrative matters. For morality, as for everything else, there was a bureaucracy.The zeal with which the Islamic State policed the population is reflected in the 87 prison transfer records they abandoned in one of their police stations. Citizens were thrown into jail for a litany of obscure crimes, including eyebrow plucking, inappropriate haircuts, raising pigeons, playing dominoes, playing cards, playing music and smoking the hookah.In early 2016, Mr. Hamoud\u2019s daughter Sara ran out for a quick errand without covering her eyes.She was spotted by an officer from the morality police. Before she could explain, he smashed his fist into her eye.From then on, her father forbade her to leave the house, except to drive to the hospital for the appointments that followed the assault, which left her with vision loss, the family said.With change sweeping the region, residents were forced to make fraught choices, among them: Stay or leave, rebel or accommodate.Mr. Hamoud decided to try to escape. He and his eldest son, 28-year-old Omar, had set aside over $30,000 to buy a new home. The morning of their planned departure, Omar withdrew all but around $1,000 from the bank account.Not even two hours later, a unit of masked fighters banged down the family\u2019s front door. One of them was holding the bank slip Omar had signed.\u201cTry this again and we\u2019ll kill every last one of you,\u201d the militants warned.On the western banks of the Tigris River, in a pulverized building, I found an abandoned briefcase.The documents that spilled out revealed that the briefcase belonged to Yasir Issa Hassan, a young professional whose photo identification shows a balding man with a large, aquiline nose. He was the administrator of the Trade Division inside the Islamic State Ministry of Agriculture.The group\u2019s outsize ambitions and its robust bureaucracy hinged on its ability to generate funds. Bulging with accounting forms, budget projections and receipts, as well as two CD-ROMs containing spreadsheets, the briefcase shed light on the scope of the organization\u2019s revenue machine and offered a blueprint for how it worked.The financial reports tallied over $19 million in transactions involving agriculture alone.The documents describe how it made money at every step in the supply chain: Before a single seed of grain, for example, was sown, the group collected rent for the fields it had confiscated. Then, when the crops were ready to be threshed, it collected a harvest tax.You\u2019ll receive Top Stories notifications after the series ends.It did not stop there.Then the bags of flour were loaded onto trucks, which traversed the caliphate, paying more tolls. It was sold to supermarkets and shops, which were also taxed. So were the consumers who bought the finished product.In a single 24-hour period in 2015, one of the spreadsheets in the briefcase shows, the Islamic State collected $1.9 million from the sale of barley and wheat.The organization appeared intent on making money off every last grain \u2014 even crops that were damaged.On just one day, according to another statement, it took in over $14,000 from wheat described as having been scorched in a bombing, and $2,300 from the sale of spoiled lentils and chickpeas. It also took in over $23,000 from grain that had been scraped off the bottom of a tank, according to one spreadsheet.The Islamic State\u2019s tax arm reached into every facet of life in Mosul. Households in Iraq were taxed 2,000 dinars per month (less than $2) for garbage collection, 10,000 dinars (about $8) for each 10 amperes of electricity, and another 10,000 for municipal water.Businesses wishing to install a landline paid a 15,000-dinar (about $12) installation fee to the group\u2019s telecommunications office, followed by a 5,000-dinar monthly maintenance fee.Municipal offices charged for marriage licenses and birth certificates.CBBA\u00a0The paper was recovered by Times journalists in Tal Abta, a village in northern Iraq, in July 2017 in a building used by ISIS fighters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The paper was recovered by Times journalists in Tal Abta, a village in northern Iraq, in July 2017 in a building used by ISIS fighters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CBACBA\u00a0The paper was recovered by Times journalists in Tal Abta, a village in northern Iraq, in July 2017 in a building used by ISIS fighters.\u00a0\u00a0CBA\u00a0The paper was recovered by Times journalists in Tal Abta, a village in northern Iraq, in July 2017 in a building used by ISIS fighters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ordinarily in Islamic practice, the zakat is a tithe used to help the poor. In the Islamic State\u2019s interpretation, an act of charity became a mandatory payment, and while some of the funds collected were used to help needy families, the Ministry of Zakat and Charities acted more like a version of the Internal Revenue Service.Despite hundreds of airstrikes that left the caliphate pocked with craters, the group\u2019s economy continued to function, fed by streams of revenue that could not be bombed under international norms: the civilians under their rule, their commercial activity and the dirt under their feet.It all added up to astonishing sums, as much as $800 million in annual tax revenue, according to the study.Still, the group\u2019s ambition of running a state meant it also had large bills.On a single day in the summer of 2016, the owner of the briefcase handed over $150,000 to one of the group\u2019s accountants to pay for the transport of wheat from one town to another, according to one financial report.In a two-week period the same year, he paid over $16,000 to the Islamic State trade division in the Dijlah district and $14,000 to the one in Kirkuk. He gave an $8,400 cash advance to the group\u2019s Hawija office, $16,800 to the land department and $8,400 to the Islamic State province straddling the Euphrates River.Even as tanks were rolling in and taking surrounding neighborhoods, the trade division continued to make money, pocketing $70,000 in a single sale.One day in late 2016, a flier decorated with the Iraqi flag floated down onto the Hamoud family\u2019s home.The agricultural department official and his extended family were hunkered down inside the living room, sitting elbow-to-elbow on an L-shaped couch, he recalls. By then, the militants had banned both cellphones and satellite dishes. They were cut off from the world.The flier was one of millions dropped over Mosul warning the population to take cover. The military assault was about to begin.\u201cCould this really be happening?\u201d Mr. Hamoud wondered. Then he used a lighter to incinerate the flier.Since then, the militants have lost all but 3 percent of the territory in Iraq and Syria they once held. But they clung so tightly to their caliphate that block after city block was leveled during the battle to take back cities and towns. Thousands of people have lost their homes. New mass graves are being discovered every month. One of them contains the remains of four of Mr. Hamoud\u2019s cousins.Few have anything good to say about their old rulers \u2014 unless prodded to talk about the services they provided.\u201cWe have to be honest,\u201d Mr. Hamoud said. \u201cIt was much cleaner under ISIS.\u201dThough the militants are gone, reminders of the Islamic State and their particular style of governance remain.In the northern town of Tel Kaif, for example, residents recall how the militants conscripted a committee of electrical engineers to fix an overloaded power grid. They installed new circuit breakers, and for the first time, residents who had been accustomed to at most six hours of electricity a day could now reliably turn on lights.In early 2017, Iraqi soldiers reclaimed the town, and were welcomed as heroes. But then they disconnected the Islamic State circuit breakers \u2014 and the power failures resumed.\u201cIf the government was to go back to the system that ISIS put in place, we would go so far as to kiss their foreheads,\u201d Mr. Younes, the truck driver, said at the time.Within a few months, the government did just that.The irony that it had taken a terrorist group to fix one of the town\u2019s longstanding grievances was not lost on its citizens.\u201cAlthough they were not recognized as a state or a country,\u201d said one shopkeeper, Ahmed Ramzi Salim, \u201cthey acted like one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Powell Touts Economy\u2019s Strength in First Speech as Fed Chief", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 Jerome H. Powell used his inaugural speech as Federal Reserve chairman on Friday to highlight the strength of the United States economic recovery, and told a questioner that a potential trade war would have no immediate effect on the Fed\u2019s plans to continue gradually raising interest rates this year.Mr. Powell, in a speech before the Economic Club of Chicago, said the economy continued to experience tailwinds. Referring to the Fed\u2019s policymaking body, he added that \u201cthe labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee expect it to remain strong.\u201dLater, in a question-and-answer session with Mellody Hobson, who heads the economic club, he said it was \u201ctoo early to say\u201d how tariffs imposed by the United States and China might affect growth and inflation.\u201cThe discussion about tariffs is at a relatively early stage, and we talked about this at the F.O.M.C. meeting a couple of weeks ago now,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cAnd people really don\u2019t see yet any implications in the near term for the outlook, because we don\u2019t know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be.\u201dMr. Powell also said, in the question session, that he saw little evidence that regulations were holding back the performance of American banks, or that immigration levels were weighing on wage growth in the United States.In his speech, Mr. Powell said the Fed saw \u201cother signs of economic strength\u201d in the United States, citing \u201csteady income gains, rising household wealth and elevated consumer confidence,\u201d which he said would continue to support consumer spending.\u201cBusiness investment improved markedly last year following two subpar years, and both business surveys and profit expectations point to further gains ahead,\u201d he said. The recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases are helping to lift investment, Mr. Powell said, adding that \u201cstrong global growth has boosted U.S. exports.\u201dMr. Powell\u2019s remarks made no mention of President Trump\u2019s series of trade measures against China, including a directive late Thursday that the United States trade representative consider tariffs on an additional $100 billion of imported Chinese products.Mr. Powell ticked off several indicators that support the idea that the economy is running near so-called maximum employment, which economists generally consider to be the lowest unemployment rate that does not spur rapid inflation. But he said other indicators, such as labor-force participation that remains depressed by historical standards, suggest that the economy has not yet reached that point. He particularly noted still-lagging wage growth. \u201cI will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell, like his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, cast that gradual series of increases as a carefully planned strategy to ensure that the Fed will not need to raise rates abruptly in the event of a steep rise in inflation. \u201cThe F.O.M.C.\u2019s patient approach has paid dividends and contributed to the strong economy we have today,\u201d he said.He closed his prepared remarks by cautioning that events could force the central bank to change course. \u201cOur views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIf the outlook changes, so will monetary policy. Our overarching objective will remain the same: fostering a strong economy for all Americans \u2014 one that provides plentiful jobs and low and stable inflation.\u201dAnalysts said Friday that they did not see anything in the latest jobs report that would cause the Fed to deviate from its current path.\u201cThe Fed will look beyond these temporary disruptions,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at S & P Global Ratings.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Friday that other factors, including subdued inflation data and rising geopolitical risks, could cause Mr. Powell to sound \u201cmore cautious\u201d in his outlook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Six Times Journalists on the Paper\u2019s History of Covering AIDS and Gay Issues", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York Times had a spotty record of covering the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s \u2014 and gay culture in general. Times staffers reflect on the paper\u2019s past, and what we can learn from it today.Like most children of the 1980s, I can\u2019t remember a time when I wasn\u2019t hearing about AIDS. I was in my early teens during the height of the epidemic, and it permeated almost everything in my young consciousness: school, culture, sports and the evening news. This was when the Indiana teenager Ryan White was dying, basketball star Magic Johnson announced he\u2019d contracted H.I.V., Tom Hanks won the Oscar for playing an infected gay man in 1993\u2019s \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d and the disease became the leading cause of death among Americans aged 25 to 44. At school, the AIDS lexicon was drilled into our heads. We knew by then that you couldn\u2019t get it from a toilet seat or a kiss. But we were constantly reminded how we could get it: \u201cUnprotected sex\u201d and \u201cdirty needles\u201d would fill in the blanks on many a health class pop-quiz about \u201crisk behaviors.\u201dI recently talked to the reporter who wrote that article, my colleague Lawrence K. Altman, a physician with training in epidemiology, who told me what a hindrance it was in those first years of AIDS that people struggled to find the right language. This was true, he said, not just for the government officials and doctors talking about the disease on television and in print, but also for the journalists who had to explain it. In doing so, they often employed the same euphemisms, like \u201cbodily fluids,\u201d to substitute for words like semen, leaving the impression that saliva from a kiss might infect you.AIDS has always been scary to me. But this shed light on a different kind of fear that I hadn\u2019t quite contemplated, the kind that gay men before me must have felt as they watched this plague kill their friends and were left wondering whether they would be next. For my generation, it was the known that was so terrifying. We knew that if you somehow caught the disease it might be a death sentence. But we also knew how you caught it and therefore how to avoid it. The fear of the unknown, it dawned on me, would have been far worse.The flier, sleek and disarming, showed up one day on newsroom bulletin boards in the summer of 1992. It was an invitation in search of a guest list.It was the first time that gay people working at The New York Times had publicly advertised one of their pride parties, which had been happening for six years. \u201cThe idea that a bunch of gay people from The Times would get together and have a party was remarkable, after so many years of hiding,\u201d said Richard J. Meislin, a former reporter and editor, who kept his sexuality secret until the 1980s, when other queer people at the newspaper started to come out. It wasn\u2019t easy to be gay at The Times when Meislin started in 1975 as a copy boy. Many employees felt that A.M. \u201cAbe\u201d Rosenthal, the paper\u2019s editor, was homophobic. And the publisher at the time, Arthur \u201cPunch\u201d Sulzberger, had his own blind spots, according to his son. \u201cAbe was part of the challenge. It was one of the issues my father struggled with as well,\u201d said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher since 1992, who recently handed over the reins to his son, A.G. \u201cThe way [gay people] were being treated by being forced to be hidden was antithetical to the values of the company and the values of journalism.\u201dMeislin, for instance, never had control of his own story: He was outed by AIDS, even though he didn\u2019t have the disease. After arriving in Mexico City as a correspondent in 1983, he got sick with a mysterious ailment that made his joints ache. The paper sent an editor to check on him, because some people thought he\u2019d contracted H.I.V. He hadn\u2019t, and though Meislin recovered within weeks, word of his sexuality reportedly got to Rosenthal\u2019s desk. Two and a half years later, Meislin was called back to New York City, cutting short his prestigious stint abroad. \u201cThe perception in the newsroom was that I was brought back because I was gay,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one that I shared.\u201dCartwright, who started at the Times in 1977, said that episode was one of many reasons she didn\u2019t come to terms with her gender identity sooner. \u201cIf you lived openly as a gay person you were sticking your neck out.\u201dRosenthal, who died in 2006, denied that Meislin\u2019s move had anything to do with his sexuality in an interview with Michelangelo Signorile for The Advocate 26 years ago. \u201cPeople who are used to being discriminated against will sometimes take certain acts as being discriminatory when they\u2019re not,\u201d he told the magazine.Nancy Lee, who eventually became the paper\u2019s picture editor, didn\u2019t dare put a photo of her girlfriend at her desk when she arrived in 1980. \u201cThat was to risk everything,\u201d said Lee, who is now the executive editor of The New York Times News Service & Syndicate.To me, those stories are unavoidably personal. I started at The Times as a clerk to a columnist in 2012, while I was figuring out that I was a lesbian. I never came out to him, because I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted him to know. After I left and returned as a reporter three years later, I put a photo of my girlfriend at the time next to my computer. The path to my comfort, I now know, was paved by people like Lee, who decided to show up to New York\u2019s pride parade in the late 1980s with other closeted Times staffers. \u201cWe weren\u2019t wearing any New York Times gear, but we knew we were at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were photographing it. You could end up on the news.\u201d They had their first pride party in 1987. Sulzberger Jr., then an editor, had started meeting with his gay colleagues several years earlier. \u201cHe would take us to lunch and say \u2018I know you\u2019re gay and don\u2019t worry about it, you\u2019re going to be fine,\u2019\u201d Dunlap said.Progress happened quickly after the caucus revved up, thanks partly to Sulzberger Jr.\u2019s determination to get The Times out in front of the issue. The company began offering spousal benefits to gay couples in 1994. And in 1998, Cartwright judged the newsroom ready to handle her own coming out, typed and printed on yellow paper and tacked onto more than a dozen bulletin boards throughout the building. \u201cI have decided to resolve a longstanding conflict in my life by beginning to live full time as a woman,\u201d the letter said. Cartwright, a former copy editor, remembers hurrying back to her desk after posting the last copy and walking by the clump of people reading what she\u2019d written. Someone looked at her, and smiled. She started showing up to work as Donna six weeks later.\u201cThe only part that was difficult was getting people to stop calling me \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018him,\u2019\u201d she said. She told someone in human resources, who reminded staff of Cartwright\u2019s pronouns, but it just kept happening. One day she realized that she was just being too polite: \u201cOne time when someone referred to me as \u2018he\u2019 I got visibly angry about it, and that worked, so I did it a couple of times.\u201d She didn\u2019t have many problems after that.The Times gave Cartwright a key to a bathroom on the 11th floor of the building. After she had gender reassignment surgery, she began to use the ladies\u2019 room.When I told her that The Times still doesn\u2019t have gender neutral bathrooms, she caught her breath. \u201cThey may have decided that I was a unicorn,\u201d she said. She suggested quietly letting the paper\u2019s leaders know that \u201cThe Times is kind of behind the times on this.\u201d If asking nicely doesn\u2019t work, Cartwright said, we could always get visibly angry. It worked for her.The front page of The Times has long held a sacred place in the media. Back then, seven or eight stories, filed from Washington and around the world, would set the day\u2019s agenda. For decades, TV morning-news producers have used the front page as a guide to mapping out top stories. And yet roughly 700 editions of the paper had come and gone before AIDS, quickly turning into a full-fledged crisis, had earned a spot on Page One. It was never lost on AIDS activists just how vital the paper was \u2014 and for how long it did not pay serious attention to the disease.\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d emailed Larry Kramer, the activist and writer. \u201cThe front page of The New York Times is the most important real estate in the world for getting any issue out. As The Times goes, so will every other news outlet all over the globe.\u201dSo why was The Times seemingly indifferent to the story for so long?The paper\u2019s Science desk, which was responsible for reporting on outbreaks at the time, was overtaxed in the early 1980s, and it did not help that identifying the cause of AIDS was a slow burn. \u201cScience news was running as fast and freely as Trump is today,\u201d said Lawrence K. Altman, the Times reporter who wrote the rare cancer story and still works at the paper. He cited stories the desk covered about President Reagan and Pope John Paul II getting shot, along with advances being made with the artificial heart.If the burden was then on other sections at the paper, top editors were less than enthusiastic about surfacing the story. \u201cThere were strong messages that you got that were not written on any whiteboard,\u201d said David W. Dunlap, a reporter in the Metro section at the time. \u201cYou knew to avoid it. It was a self-reinforcing edict: Don\u2019t write about queers.\u201dAnd then there was Kramer\u2019s perspective: \u201cEvery friend I had from those days is now dead because it was no secret that Abe Rosenthal hated homosexuals,\u201d he said, referring to the paper\u2019s executive editor at the time. \u201cThis is the chief reason why I hate The New York Times.\u201dMax Frankel, the former editorial page editor at the paper, which operated separately from the newsroom, said this was in keeping with the paper\u2019s ethos at the time: \u201cThey were being squeamish for some reason,\u201d Frankel said, speaking of the newsroom. \u201cTheir squeamishness was actually damaging to the public understanding of what was going on.\u201dFrankel, who would take over the newsroom in 1986 as executive editor, said the editorial department was quicker than the news columns to describe \u201canal intercourse\u201d as a means of spreading the disease. \u201cWhatever their rules were down there, we said we\u2019re going to do it our way,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the approach.\u201dBy that point, the death toll was fast approaching 600 people.Newspapers can be funny places. Writers know. Take the premium placed on brevity, concision and economy. Saying more with less, it\u2019s called. Good advice. Maddening rigorousness. Depends on the day. But sometimes it hits a snag. In order to say \u201cSYTYCD,\u201d for instance, it\u2019s probably helpful to use \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance?\u201d first. The show needs a proper name before a concise one. For three decades, though, newspapers \u2014 this newspaper \u2014 made an exception. There\u2019s nothing more concise than AIDS. It names a larger disease: acquired immune deficiency syndrome. But, really, \u201cAIDS\u201d gets the job done. Only, it was an improper name. And so it often went unused, since it named an impropriety.Medically, it\u2019s not really AIDS that kills you. AIDS acts as a doorjamb for other diseases to traipse in and ravage a body. But the average obituary noted what traipsed but omitted what made the traipsing possible. \u201cAIDS-related\u201d rarely appeared \u2014 nor did coverage of the deaths of black people and Latinos.Newspapers can be funny places. So can people. The omission of AIDS wasn\u2019t necessarily an editorial judgment. It\u2019s often up to the families and friends and physicians of the deceased to state how they died. In a real power move, the dying could name their cause of death. To see Roy Cohn die in \u201cAngels in America\u201d is to know that. Liver cancer was his preferred cause of death, not the complications from AIDS that actually killed him. That was for homosexuals, a label he swore he was too good for. AIDS killed people. But it also threatened to kill pride. Families, friends and co-workers died of embarrassment. No one wanted to go to an AIDS funeral. Hence the euphemisms and the workarounds. There was only so much they could cover up, of course, since lots of people went to too many AIDS funerals.It was a world that thrived in the shadows of New York \u2014 late at night, hidden on dark streets behind barely-marked doorways, typically guarded by a man sitting on a stool under a light bulb. What took place inside ranged from questionable to outright illicit: the full-service bar that kept serving drinks after 4 a.m., the open use of cocaine and marijuana and, in many cases, the anonymous and often marathon sexual encounters among gay men. Sex clubs, bathhouses, back rooms, movie theaters, after-hours bars, dance clubs \u2014 places like Alex in Wonderland and the Mine Shaft and the New St. Marks Baths, all part of New York in the 1970s and early 1980s. This was a culture that was known to some of gay New York, but arguably not most of it. And it certainly was not known to most of straight New York.The AIDS epidemic changed all that. Almost overnight, as panic spread and Governor Mario M. Cuomo issued regulations in late 1985 to close down establishments where unsafe sexual activity took place, this underground world came crashing to the surface. A battery of city inspectors, police officers and reporters went in undercover to see for themselves what was going on behind those doors \u2014 and shared their findings with the public. \u201cThe Case for Closing Bathhouses: Night Visit by Post Reporter Reveals Shocking Evidence,\u201d read a New York Post headline over a 1985 story that described, in considerable detail, what the reporter saw and heard as he moved through the dark warren of a bathhouse. It was part of stream of columns and editorials \u2014 not to mention grainy video from local news cameras that had been secreted into the clubs \u2014 that was turning up the pressure on public officials.It was challenging for news organizations as well, drawn to the story for legitimate reasons (a health crisis) and perhaps less noble reasons (sensationalism) as they struggled with just how explicitly detailed the reports needed to be. And no less discomfited were many in the city\u2019s gay and lesbian community, concerned that raising the curtain on a world that most people did not know existed could threaten the gay rights movement after a decade of progress. Some gay leaders decried the city crackdown as an assault on privacy. \u201cConsensual sexual activity by adults out of public view should always be beyond the eye and the arm of government,\u201d said Thomas B. Stoddard, the executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, in 1988. Others considered it a legitimate response to a health emergency. \u201cIs compulsive sexuality freedom?\u2019\u201d Jim Fouratt, one of the city\u2019s earliest gay activists, said a few weeks before the city cracked down. \u201cI would argue it\u2019s not. All we got was a lot more alienated sexually, and a lot more disease.\u201dCuomo, whom I covered at the time as a Daily News reporter based in Albany, would seem at times astonished \u2014 even ashen-faced \u2014 as he learned about this side of New York from inspectors and aides struggling to advise the governor about which kind of sexual practices the state might regulate. Down in the city, Mayor Edward I. Koch was already facing criticism that he was slow to act in combating the epidemic; gay political leaders contended that it was because the mayor, who never married and lived in Greenwich Village, was gay. (At various points in his life, Koch said he was not, or would not answer the question.)As the mayor and governor were at odds about what to do (sound familiar?), Cuomo\u2019s health advisers, after much debate, recommended shutting down establishments that permitted unsafe-sex practices. City Hall pushed back, as many of Koch\u2019s aides argued that a crackdown would simply push this kind of behavior into darker corners, making it harder to regulate. Cuomo finally moved, essentially ignoring the mayor as he issued state regulations that would close clubs that permitted these kinds of activities, and leaving it to cities to enforce. Koch resisted at first, contending the order was poorly drafted and difficult to implement: He was obviously aware of how many gay activists viewed this as a civil rights issue, a setback at a time when gay rights seemed to be on the advance.But that wasn\u2019t always the case.The problem was, there was no definitive evidence to support that claim, only the opinions of public health officials who, when asked, were quick to poke holes in the story. They invoked the word \u201cspeculation\u201d three times. A hospital supervisor in Brooklyn was even quoted saying the opposite: \u201cWe are continuing to see tremendous amounts of sexual activity among adolescents.\u201dSo why was this piece published in the first place? One could argue that The Times, which proudly bills itself as a family newspaper, is puritanical to a fault. But it also has to do with simple arithmetic: In 1983, there were few, if any, openly gay reporters on staff, and hardly anyone to challenge stereotypes about gay people. It would take until the next decade before the floodgates would open at The Times, and openly gay men and women would assume positions of leadership in the newsroom. But even that, more than two decades later, hasn\u2019t stopped many gay people from debating what, exactly, Styles \u2014 and the rest of the Times \u2014 gets right about their lives.Read more:New York City, 1981-1983: 36 Months That Changed the CultureFour Geniuses, Gone to AIDS, as They Might Be TodayWhat New York Was Like in the Early \u201980s \u2014 Hour by HourAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Richard J.

{"Headline": "Why American Pragmatists Saved Postwar Europe", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land,\u201d President Trump declared on Jan. 20, 2017. \u201cFrom this moment on, it\u2019s going to be America first.\u201d As Benn Steil makes clear in his trenchant and timely new book, \u201cThe Marshall Plan: Dawn of the Cold War,\u201d the architects of America\u2019s global engagement after World War II would have been appalled that future generations \u2014 let alone a future president \u2014 might think they had been acting in anything but the national interest.At its core the Marshall Plan was a pragmatic approach to a tough problem. The winter of 1947 was the hardest to hit Europe in a generation. The continent was in ruins, its people were starving and its economies were out of balance. Italy\u2019s and France\u2019s inflation rates were 62.1 and 49.2 percent respectively. In the face of this bleak situation, American policymakers concluded that the key to restoring the prewar European standard of living was restarting the German economy. And this could only be achieved by priming the German pump, and those of the other continental economies, with American dollars. While pragmatic, this proposition was, to put it mildly in the political context of the time, very controversial. Hitler had been dead only two years. Germany was divided into four sectors. Its people were widely loathed and two of its conquering powers, the Soviet Union and France, were counting on reparations from their former Nazi enemy to help rebuild their own economies. Meanwhile, most Americans were done with foreign entanglements. As future Secretary of State Dean Acheson, then a subordinate at the State Department, later recalled, two slogans neatly summed up the popular view of foreign policy: \u201cBring the boys home\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be a Santa Claus.\u201dBehind this American pragmatism \u2014 which would ultimately translate into $14.3 billion of assistance between 1948 and 1952 (approximately $130 billion in 2017) \u2014 was neither philanthropy nor dreams of hegemony. Secretary of State George Marshall and the powerful thinkers at the department of that era \u2014 Will Clayton, George Kennan and Charles \u201cChip\u201d Bohlen in addition to Acheson \u2014 were looking for a way to stabilize the continent without long-term American economic and security commitments. Although anticommunism and the Keynesian approach to capitalism animated the effort, the Marshall Plan was nonetheless not some clever attempt to sell American surpluses to broken economies. As Steil notes, to help Western Europeans get back on their feet the Truman administration \u201corchestrated a shift in policy at home away from protectionism and toward encouragement of imports.\u201dThe Marshall Plan was successful, though, as Steil, the senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, demonstrates, American intervention in postwar Europe did not quite work out as expected. While the Marshall Plan helped restart Europe\u2019s economy, it did not provide a glide path for the United States to avoid a long-term security entanglement.The American initiative provoked Stalin and led to a series of Kremlin overreactions and misjudgments, including the Berlin blockade of 1948-49. Stalin, who had no interest in reviving Germany\u2019s economy let alone European trade, was the captive of conspiracy theories that seamlessly linked the Marshall Plan to a capitalist plot to resurrect the anti-Soviet Wehrmacht. Meanwhile, although Western Europeans worried about Stalin \u2014 especially after he tightened his control over Eastern Europe in response to widespread enthusiasm for Marshall Plan funds \u2014 they were just as concerned about the ghost of Hitler. In a way that Harry Truman and George Marshall did not predict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was the price that London and Paris expected the United States to pay for their full participation in what they saw as the risky endeavor of resuscitating the western part of Germany. In the words of Lord Hastings Ismay, NATO\u2019s first secretary general, the Atlantic alliance existed to keep \u201cthe Soviet Union out, the Americans in and the Germans down.\u201dSteil has written an ambitious, deeply researched narrative that not only delineates the interlocking gears of international politics and economics in early postwar Europe but also introduces a large cast of statesmen, spies and economists that perhaps only Dickens could have corralled with ease. Slow going at first, the book builds intellectual excitement as the characters act and react to one another. NATO is not the only unexpected child of American pragmatism. So, too, in a way, is the drive for European unity. As the American vision for reconstruction takes hold, the British and, especially, the French come to embrace economic coordination not out of a commitment to liberalism but out of a desire to contain the German economic power that Washington is determined to unleash. This pragmatic European turn is dramatized by the conversion of the influential French statesman Jean Monnet. Immediately after the war, Monnet was an economic nationalist, advocating for French control of the German Ruhr to ensure French domination of postwar European steel production. He then became a champion of European unity. Steil\u2019s focus on the debate over the future of Europe\u2019s economy provides a fresh perspective on the coming Cold War. Although he sidesteps the arguably sterile question of which national policymaker bears the greatest blame for starting the Cold War, he shows both that Truman and Marshall understood that the plan would challenge the Soviet approach to postwar Europe and that Stalin would never tolerate a powerful German economy unless the Soviet Union were the primary beneficiary. At the heart of the Cold War was an irresolvable superpower disagreement over what to do with Germany. Four decades later, Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s acceptance of George H. W. Bush\u2019s vision (also the vision of the West German chancellor Helmut Kohl) of a unified Germany in NATO effectively signaled the end of the Cold War.There is one other element of Steil\u2019s important narrative that allows events years later to come into clearer focus. George Marshall, in a June 1947 speech at Harvard laying out the rationale for rehabilitating the European economy, cautioned that enlightened self-interest in foreign affairs is not an easy sell to the American people. \u201cThe very mass of facts presented to the public by press and radio,\u201d Marshall, who had interacted with so many Americans over the course of a long military career, explained, \u201cmake it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation.\u201d He understood that his fellow citizens were especially vulnerable to demagogues who appealed to narrow, selfish nationalism. In asking Americans \u201cto face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placed upon our country,\u201d Marshall pleaded that \u201cpolitical passion and prejudice should have no part.\u201d Ultimately, to Marshall\u2019s chagrin, Congress would rely less on reason and more on exaggerated fears of communism, stoked by Stalin\u2019s actions in Eastern Europe, to sell Americans on engagement with the world. \u201cThe very fate of civilization is at stake,\u201d said House Speaker Joseph Martin, a Republican, after the February 1948 Soviet coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Czechoslovakia.An impressive bipartisan coalition emerged, making possible the Marshall Plan and the pragmatic international commitment that it and NATO represented.

{"Headline": "Australia Shocked by Death of 2,400 Sheep on Ship to Qatar", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPERTH, Australia \u2014 The Australian government said Monday that it would investigate the mistreatment of animals after video recently emerged showing thousands of sheep dying from heat stress on board a ship traveling to the Middle East.David Littleproud, the agriculture minister, said he was \u201cshocked and gutted\u201d by the footage and promised that those responsible would be punished.The video was apparently taken in August 2017 on a converted car carrier owned by Emanuel Exports, a shipping company based in Perth. The ship, the Awassi Express, was sailing from Fremantle, a port in Western Australia, to Doha, Qatar.The footage, which was broadcast Sunday on Australia\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d news program, shows the sheep dying on the decks while rotting corpses are being tossed overboard. More than 2,400 sheep died of heat stress, according to the report.The video also included images of sheep dying in their own feces.About 1.4 million sheep raised in Western Australia are herded onto ships each year, and nearly 75 percent of Australia\u2019s annual live animal trade \u2014 worth about 1 billion Australian dollars, or about $766 million \u2014 comes from the state, according to David Slade, president of WAFarmers Livestock, a trade organization.Given the live animal trade\u2019s importance to the state, critics said the video was unlikely to result in real change.Live exports have been \u201can abject failure,\u201d said Josh Wilson, a member of Parliament from Fremantle and a member of the Labor Party.\u201cThere has been no independent supervision of these \u2018death ships,\u2019 and no penalties in relation to the mass death and suffering of sheep,\u201d said Mr. Wilson, who accused the governing Liberal Party of not adequately regulating the industry.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d he said, \u201cif the only serious change the exporter has made since this incident is to ban all staff from having smartphones on board.\u201dAnimal activists said the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was unlikely to call for restrictions on the live animal trade. A previous government was criticized for suspending cattle exports to Indonesia in 2011.\u201cUltimately we\u2019d like to see a total ban of live export to the Middle East, but that\u2019s probably not going to happen,\u201d said Katrina Love, a member of Stop Live Exports, which held a protest in Perth on Monday.However, she said, the government could ban live exports during the months of May to September.Others have proposed retooling the local economy, which relies heavily on the sheep industry, to focus on butchering animals.\u201cWe will also continue to look at how to encourage more onshore meat processing,\u201d said Alannah MacTiernan, Western Australia\u2019s agriculture minister and a critic of the Turnbull government. She said the switch to butchering would \u201cget more value out of our livestock and create more jobs in Western Australian abattoirs.\u201dBut for Western Australian farmers, a move away from animal exports toward meat production would be disastrous.\u201cI would go broke, because I totally rely on the live export industry,\u201d said Richard Brown, a sheep farmer in the Gascoyne region, approximately 600 miles north of Perth. \u201cIt\u2019s my whole business.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t like the video,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s an isolated incident.\u201d Mr. Brown said the state did not have enough slaughterhouses to support a shift to butchering.Emanuel Exports, the shipping company, has previously come under fire over its treatment of animals.More than 3,000 sheep died from heat stress in July 2016 while being shipped from Fremantle to Doha. The company\u2019s executives were not charged or fined.In a statement, Nicholas Daws, the director of Emanuel Exports, apologized.\u201cThe footage televised by \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is simply devastating,\u201d he said, \u201cand Emanuel Exports apologizes to farmers and the broader community for these absolutely unacceptable outcomes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Women Barred From Sumo Ring, Even to Save a Man\u2019s Life", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Sumo wrestling, one of Japan\u2019s oldest and most hallowed sports, has all kinds of inviolable rituals. The wrestlers must wear their hair in carefully coifed topknots. Before every match, they scatter grains of purifying salt. And women are never, ever, allowed in the ring.Even when a man\u2019s life is at stake.Sumo\u2019s discriminatory practices came under new scrutiny after a referee shooed women out of a ring at an exhibition match in Kyoto on Wednesday when they rushed to offer lifesaving measures to a politician who had collapsed while delivering a speech.\u201cBelieving that tradition is more important than human lives is like a cult that mistakes fundamentalism for tradition,\u201d Yoshinori Kobayashi, a popular comic book artist, wrote on his blog.\u201cWe are reminded that, ahh, there are some parts of Japan that still just don\u2019t get it,\u201d said Emma Dalton, a specialist in Japanese and a lecturer at the School of Global, Urban and Social Studies at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia.\u201cI think that both men and women in Japan are reluctant to change both the workplace and tradition,\u201d said Kumiko Nemoto, a professor of sociology at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies. \u201cAnd then they use the name of tradition in order not to change things.\u201dThe women called out of the ring at the sumo event included a nurse from the audience who rushed onto the dohyo, as the straw ring is known, to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation to the fallen politician.Ryozo Tatami, the mayor of Maizuru, a city of about 84,000 people in Kyoto prefecture, was giving a speech when he had a brain hemorrhage and collapsed.In the video, it appears that several male sumo staff members gathered around Mr. Tatami before the female nurse arrived to start CPR. Three other women also rushed to help. When the referee told them to leave, the women backed off, causing confusion and scuffling around the patient.It appeared from the video that a man took over CPR before male emergency workers from the Fire Department arrived. Mr. Tatami was taken to a hospital for surgery, where he remains in stable condition.Historians trace sumo\u2019s roots to harvest rituals associated with the Shinto religion. Various theories exist as to why women are barred from the ring. One theory suggests that sumo matches were originally put on to entertain the goddesses of the harvest, and farmers believed that women in the ring would invoke the jealousy and rage of the goddesses, who would spoil the harvest.Ceremonies resembling sumo matches were performed in the Japanese Imperial courts as far back as the eighth century, and during the Edo period, which ran from the 17th to mid-19th century, organizers began charging admission to sumo bouts.Today\u2019s tradition of barring women from the ring is as much a habit as anything else, said Lee Thompson, a professor of sports science at Waseda University who has researched sumo.\u201cThe people who are in charge now say that\u2019s the way it was as they remember it, and they just want to keep it the way it is,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.The tradition has been tested before. In 1990, Mayumi Moriyama, the first female chief cabinet secretary to a Japanese prime minister, was banned from giving a trophy at a Tokyo tournament, and in 2000, the sumo association prohibited Fusae Ota, the first female governor of Osaka \u2014 and throughout Japan \u2014 from awarding a trophy during a sumo tournament in the city.Both incidents drew controversy, but the tradition remained.After the outcry following Wednesday\u2019s incident, Nobuyoshi Hakkaku, the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, issued a statement thanking the woman who \u201cquickly provided emergency measures\u201d and apologizing for the referee who told her and the other women to leave the ring. \u201cIt was not an appropriate response,\u201d Mr. Hakkaku said.Women\u2019s advocates said they hoped this episode would ignite a debate about the tradition. \u201cSuch sexist conduct shouldn\u2019t be forgiven,\u201d said Mari Miura, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo.But the scandals have not dented enthusiasm for the sport, and analysts say the sumo association will have little incentive to change.\u201cThey need public pressure from the outside,\u201d said Yasuaki Muto, a professor of sports science at Waseda University. \u201cBecause so far they are quite successful despite various scandals and the seats are pretty much full in every tournament; there is no motivation for them to reform.\u201dHisako Ueno and Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Floats Possible Citizenship to Holders of H-1B Visas: What Are They?", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdated Jan. 11, 2019For years, skilled workers from abroad have been coming to the United States on temporary visas, known as H-1B visas, that allow companies to recruit employees overseas when the necessary talent might not be available at home.Hailed by proponents as vital to American innovation, the program has also been criticized for displacing United States workers with cheaper foreign labor. Critics also want to end special work permits issued to some spouses of workers on H-1B visas. President Trump has long been critical of the program.On Friday, the president said on Twitter that changes to the program might be coming \u2014 including the possibility that workers brought in under the program could be allowed to become American citizens.\u201cH1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cWe want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.\u201dIt is a temporary visa that employers use to hire foreigners in \u201cspecialty occupations\u201d for which there are not enough skilled American workers to fill available jobs. The workers must have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. It enables those employed to legally work in the United States for three years, with the possibility of extensions.Companies identify a worker they wish to hire and submit a petition on the candidate\u2019s behalf. The typical petition is a collection of forms and documents describing the job and the unique qualifications of the person chosen to fill it.Many are software engineers, computer programmers and other workers in the technology sector. However, H-1B recipients work in a variety of jobs. They can be architects, scientists, models and tattoo artists. Some are math and science teachers in rural school districts that have trouble recruiting American instructors.Congress established that 65,000 H-1B visas are available each year for workers with bachelor\u2019s degrees, and 20,000 more are earmarked for those with master\u2019s degrees or higher. Universities and research organizations are exempt from the cap.In the past several years, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has received more petitions than there are visas. If the maximum number of applications is reached during the first five business days of April, the agency holds a lottery to randomly select which petitions it will process.Very often they do. Companies can choose to sponsor an H-1B worker for permanent residence. The green card applications are often approved, though they can take years to be issued.India is the country of origin for more than 80 percent of H-1B recipients, with China a distant second. Next in line during the 2016 fiscal year were the Philippines, South Korea and Canada.Supporters of the visa program say they fill a critical need for talent that is not available in the United States, especially when the economy is strong and the labor market is tight. Employers must attest that an H-1B worker will not adversely impact the wages and working conditions of American workers.Critics say that employers often hire H-1B workers for lower salaries than they would pay Americans to do the same job. They point to Americans who have been displaced when companies have outsourced areas like technology maintenance to a company that brings in H-1B workers.As usual with immigration policy, it\u2019s complicated. More than 40,500 companies sponsored workers for H-1B visas in the 2017 fiscal year. Many employers specifically target a worker with hard-to-find expertise whom they wish to hire to do specialized work \u2014 obviously because they could not find someone in the United States to do the job. In many cases, H-1B workers have gone on to create start-ups and develop cutting-edge technology that keeps America competitive.But there are questions about who\u2019s benefiting, collectively. About 20 companies accounted for 32 percent of approved H-1B petitions, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute. Many of the employers are global outsourcing companies from India that supply entry-level workers to retailers, insurance companies and banks. Not all. Among them are also American firms who appear to be using the program to create a pool of cheap labor.\u201cBig household-name American companies are just as culpable as the outsourcing companies of abusing the program,\u201d said Norman Matloff, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies the H-1B program.Ultimately, though, it is up to Congress to change laws that govern the program, since in most cases, practices that workers may claim as abusive are not necessarily illegal as the law is written.At campaign rallies, Mr. Trump introduced laid-off Americans who had been asked to train their foreign successors, saying, \u201cWe won\u2019t let this happen anymore.\u201dFor one thing, United States Citizen and Immigration Services, the federal agency that reviews the petitions, has tightened its oversight. Between January and August of last year, it issued 45 percent more challenges or requests for more evidence. That has delayed the issuance of visas, and some immigration lawyers report an increase in denials.The administration has said from the beginning that it would end an Obama-era program that has allowed spouses of H-1B visa holders to work, as long as they had been approved and were waiting for a green card. Those work permits have been issued under a program known as H-4EAD.Federal authorities had also suggested they might change the selection process for H-1B visas to ensure that they are granted to the \u201cmost skilled or highest-paid\u201d job candidates.Finally, Trump has said he would like to scrap the lottery.But precisely what changes are being contemplated now is still unknown.More sweeping changes can occur only if Congress passes new laws or overhauls the immigration system. The Trump administration\u2019s call to end the lottery and raise wages for H-1B visa candidates as a means of recruiting qualified American workers has support among some Democrats and Republicans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Lashed Out at OPEC: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Wells Fargo takes another hit.\u2022 What AT&T\u2019s Randall Stephenson said on the stand.\u2022 What Takeda has to weigh in its pursuit of Shire.But why has President Trump made the international oil cartel his latest b\u00eate noire? One potential reason: It makes life more difficult for many Americans, weighing on the benefits of the Republican tax cuts.The context: OPEC and Russia agreed two years ago to cut \u2014 and maintain \u2014 oil production caps to bring prices back up in the wake of U.S. shale boom. So far, that strategy has worked:With oil above $73 now, even after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, fuel prices are at reaching two-year highs as the U.S. gets into the summer driving season. More importantly, Americans are preparing to spend more on fuel, eating into whatever savings they are expected to receive on average from the tax cuts.Americans are expected to spend an average of $400 per household more on fuel this year than in 2016, as the rebound in crude prices is reflected in the cost of petrol at the pump. By contrast, middle-income US households will on average gain $930 each from the tax cut bill passed at the end of last year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.And Michael Lynch of Strategic Energy & Economic Research had this to say to Bloomberg:\u201cNinety-eight percent of what politicians say about oil should just be disregarded immediately and this falls in there.\u201dIn February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said.Representatives for the Justice Department, AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A. declined to comment.\u2014 Cecilia KangShares of General Electric jumped nearly 4 percent Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and reaffirmed its guidance for the year.Though G.E. reported a first-quarter loss on Friday, there were also signs that the struggling industrial giant is beginning to stabilize its business.G.E.\u2019s big power-generator division continues to drag down the company\u2019s overall performance, and it is still burdened with financial liabilities that linger from the conglomerate\u2019s pared-back finance arm, GE Capital.But G.E.\u2019s other major industrial divisions, led by aviation and health care, delivered solid results in the quarter. That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines.Especially heartening for investors, G.E. reaffirmed its profit outlook for the year, predicting earnings per share of $1 to $1.07, though likely at the lower end of that range. Analysts had been skeptical that G.E. could do that well. The average analysts\u2019 forecast for the year was 95 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.To recap: Wells Fargo has already paid $185 million over its fake accounts scandal and set aside $4.25 billion for liabilities tied to other infractions. And the Fed has prevented the bank from expanding its balance sheet.Yes, the upcoming $1 billion fine is the most stringent bank penalty imposed by the Trump administration to date. (The C.F.P.B., under pressure from Mick Mulvaney to go easier on financial firms, is involved here.)But Mr. Stewart writes, \u201cAt this point it\u2019s hard to imagine what more Wells Fargo can do (or how much more it can spend) to make amends.\u201dThat\u2019s the contention of the reporter Jonathan Greenberg, who, as a Forbes reporter in 1984, spoke with \u201cJohn Barron\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s net worth. Mr. Barron \u2014 a now well-known alter ego of the real estate executive \u2014 contended that Mr. Trump had bought out most of his father\u2019s stake in their business.Over time I have learned that he should not have been on the first three Forbes 400 lists at all. In our first-ever list, in 1982, we included him at $100 million, but Trump was actually worth roughly $5 million \u2014 a paltry sum by the standards of his super-monied peers \u2014 as a spate of government reports and books showed only much later.Mr. Greenberg writes that the White House and the Trump Organization declined to comment.The Justice Department, which wants to block the deal, argued that AT&T is different because it\u2019s also a broadband internet provider, and that relations with Silicon Valley are chummier than Mr. Stephenson asserts.A big takeover would give Takeda more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint. But it would also be the company\u2019s biggest takeover by far, and perhaps too expensive.The Japanese drug maker said it intended to maintain its credit rating, which could be difficult if it bids too high \u2014 or is pressured to do so by yet another suitor.With its $16 trillion economy and reputation for tough negotiating, the E.U. could have been the immovable object in President Trump\u2019s trade fight. But that is looking less likely, Peter Eavis writes.Among the lessons if the E.U. concedes: The U.S.\u2019s large trade deficits can give it leverage.The sometimes controversial data consultant cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the C.I.A. Now it\u2019s hoping that its latest product will attract more commercial clients.The company needs to figure out how to be rewarded on Wall Street without creeping out Main Street. It might not be possible. For all of Palantir\u2019s professed concern for individuals\u2019 privacy, the single most important safeguard against abuse is the one it\u2019s trying desperately to reduce through automation: human judgment.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, told Michael that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. \u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dThe tech flyaroundThe only potential obstacle: Arturo Di Modica, the artist who made the bull, doesn\u2019t want it moved.An earlier version of this article, relying on information in a Bloomberg report, misstated the amount of Sumner Redstone\u2019s compensation that a court ruled CBS shareholders could challenge.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Role in Midterm Elections Roils Republicans", "Date": "2018-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is privately rejecting the growing consensus among Republican leaders that they may lose the House and possibly the Senate in November, leaving party officials and the president\u2019s advisers nervous that he does not grasp the gravity of the threat they face in the midterm elections.Congressional and party leaders and even some Trump aides are concerned that the president\u2019s boundless self-assurance about politics will cause him to ignore or undermine their midterm strategy. In battleground states like Arizona, Florida and Nevada, Mr. Trump\u2019s proclivity to be a loose cannon could endanger the Republican incumbents and challengers who are already facing ferocious Democratic headwinds.If Mr. McConnell\u2019s warning was not clear enough, Marc Short, the White House\u2019s legislative liaison, used the dinner to offer an even starker assessment. The G.O.P.\u2019s House majority is all but doomed, he said.But Mr. Trump was not moved. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said at different points during the evening, shrugging off the grim prognoses, according to multiple officials briefed on the conversation.The disconnect between the president \u2014 a political novice whose confidence in his instincts was grandly rewarded in 2016 \u2014 and more traditional party leaders demonstrates the depth of the Republicans\u2019 challenges in what is likely to be a punishing campaign year.Mr. Trump is as impulsive as ever, fixated on personal loyalty, cultivating a winner\u2019s image and privately prodding Republican candidates to demonstrate their affection for him \u2014 while complaining bitterly when he campaigns for those who lose. His preoccupation with the ongoing Russia investigation adds to the unpredictability, spurring Mr. Trump to fume aloud in ways that divide the G.O.P. and raising the prospect of legal confrontations amid the campaign. And despite projecting confidence, he polls nearly all those who enter the Oval Office about how they view the climate of the midterms.According to advisers, the president plans to hold a fund-raiser a week in the months to come and hopes to schedule regular rallies with candidates starting this summer. But there is not yet any coordinated effort about where to deploy Mr. Trump, and there are divisions within his ever-fractious circle of advisers about how to approach the elections.Among his close associates, a debate is raging about whether to focus on House races that could earn the president chits with Republican lawmakers who might ultimately vote on impeachment, or to dig in to defend the party\u2019s tenuous Senate majority.\u201cWe need to be unified, and I know this is a frustrating business that we\u2019re involved in, but rather than having circular firing squads, we need to be shooting outward,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said of the White House.At the same time, Republican leaders believe he is an essential force for savaging Senate Democrats and turning out voters on the right.Yet congressional leaders remain deeply frustrated about Mr. Trump\u2019s improvisational pronouncements. At the White House dinner, Mr. McConnell raised one such policy and expressed hope that Mr. Trump could resolve the matter of his proposed tariffs, which have instilled deep worry among farm-state Republicans.\u201cIf we can get trade resolved that would be exceptionally important,\u201d Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said when asked in an interview how the president could help in the midterms.\u201cHe\u2019s always defied political convention, but this is a political convention I think that we should adhere to,\u201d said Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, \u201cwhich is to focus on that which is important to people, which is their wallet.\u201dWhen House Speaker Paul D. Ryan hosted a meeting of major Republican donors in Austin, Tex., this month, the head of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the primary House G.O.P. super PAC, delivered a presentation with a plea that the party \u201cmust sell the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d to retain the House.Mr. Trump, though, has little appetite to carry a singular tax-cuts-and-the-economy argument and is grousing about what he sees as uninspired messaging by congressional leaders like Mr. Ryan.Appearing in West Virginia this month at an event meant to showcase the party\u2019s tax agenda, Mr. Trump discarded his prepared remarks \u2014 even describing them as \u201cboring\u201d \u2014 and turned to more incendiary issues like immigration.Eric Beach, a Republican strategist who leads a pro-Trump political committee, Great America PAC, said Mr. Trump was rightly suspicious of the political formula favored by conventional Republican leaders like Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s how you win elections because that\u2019s not how he won his election,\u201d Mr. Beach said. \u201cHe knows and understands that the core issues of today are illegal immigration \u2014 including building the wall \u2014 and trade inequity.\u201dCongressional leaders have left little doubt in private that they see Mr. Trump as a political millstone for many of the party\u2019s candidates. In recent weeks, Mr. McConnell has confided to associates that Republicans may lose the Senate because of the anti-Trump energy on the left.And at Mr. Ryan\u2019s retreat, a Republican pollster, Kristen Soltis Anderson, identified Mr. Trump as a major source of the party\u2019s woes, according to multiple attendees. Ms. Anderson noted that his job approval was markedly weaker than past presidents, including President Barack Obama in the months before Democrats lost 63 House seats in the 2010 elections.Mr. Trump, for his part, has complained to associates about having been deployed to campaign for relatively weak Republicans like Roy S. Moore, who lost last year\u2019s Senate race in Alabama, and Rick Saccone, who lost the special House election in Pennsylvania last month.He has taken the losses personally, particularly in Alabama, because the vacancy there was a result of his decision to make Jeff Sessions attorney general, an appointment he has since regretted. Mr. Trump has subsequently blamed others in the party for thrusting him into episodes of humiliating defeat.The president met this month with Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Republican appointee there and the favorite of the party establishment. Reflecting his fixation on personal loyalty, Mr. Trump quizzed Ms. Hyde-Smith on whether she had supported another candidate for president in 2016 before endorsing him. When Ms. Hyde-Smith said she had not, the president exclaimed that he needed more supporters like her in Washington, people briefed on the meeting said.But his staff pointedly told her not to request the president\u2019s endorsement at the meeting. White House officials have created a series of fund-raising and organizational benchmarks that they want to see the new senator reach before they make a decision \u2014 a sign of how wary they are of entangling a president sensitive to political setbacks in elections that Republicans are not guaranteed to win.Despite the lingering disputes with congressional Republicans, White House officials say the president is eager to return to the campaign trail.Although some Republicans in competitive states may not want to appear with Mr. Trump \u2014 Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, for example, has told associates he is unlikely to campaign with the president \u2014 there is no lack of lawmakers eager for his help.Representative Lee M. Zeldin, Republican of New York, said he would welcome Mr. Trump on the trail anytime.\u201cI would expect the president and vice president to be in congressional districts all across the country,\u201d Mr. Zeldin said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten nothing but positive feedback on the desire of the president\u2019s team to be as helpful as possible.\u201dWhat has stunned Republican veterans outside the White House is how, even 15 months into his presidency, Mr. Trump still lacks any unified political organization.John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff and a retired Marine general, has scant political acumen. And while the White House political staff has sought to bring a measure of order, curbing some of the president\u2019s knee-jerk endorsement tendencies, Mr. Trump does not necessarily view them as his primary political counselors.This vacuum has, as is often the case with this White House, triggered fierce internecine scrapping among those vying for Mr. Trump\u2019s ear.Mr. Parscale has rankled Trump advisers by giving the president a perpetually rosy assessment of his poll numbers. He often tells Mr. Trump his numbers have \u201cnever been higher,\u201d according to two advisers.Mr. Parscale has also irritated some Trump officials by attempting to take over the political portfolio, with his scheduling of meetings to devise an as-yet-unformed midterm strategy getting back to other factions.But his ascension marks only the newest power center in Mr. Trump\u2019s political orbit: There is his White House staff, his vice president, the Republican National Committee, his family, his campaign alumni, his super PAC, his congressional allies, his conservative media friends and now his re-election team.All are expected to want a voice in Republican strategy for Mr. Trump in the midterms, adding only more chaos, as one White House official phrased it, to an already unruly presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Bank Earnings Flash Any Warnings?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The big banks are getting ready to report first-quarter results.\u2022 Larry Fink believes robust global growth and earnings will support stocks.\u2022 There\u2019s a consensus that Facebook must be regulated. The question is, how?\u2022 What Paul Ryan\u2019s exit means for business.\u2022 Jack Ma argues that a trade war would hurt the U.S.Headwinds and tailwinds are blowing through the financial markets and the global economy.The strength of these crosscurrents can be gauged, in part, by examining the results of the big banks, three of which report their first-quarter earnings on Friday. They are JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which have large operations around the world and big Wall Street businesses, as well as Wells Fargo, which is more of a traditional lender focused on the United States.At the start of the year, the big banks had the wind in their backs. The global economy seemed to be on a clear growth path, the United States had just enacted large tax cuts and the Trump administration was expected to loosen bank regulations. But the threat of a trade war between the United States and China helped plunge the stock markets into correction during the first quarter. The banks\u2019 results, as well as comments from their senior executives, could signal whether the tumult is seeping into the real economy. Here are some things to watch out for:\u2014 Peter EavisAmid the steep drop in its stock price, perhaps it was only a matter of time before Micro Focus drew an activist investor. Elliott Management was a logical candidate. Now, as the $34 billion activist investor has taken a stake in the software maker, here\u2019s what it could push for:\u2022 Potentially go private altogether\u2022 Potentially sell off Suse Linux, a popular maker of the Linux operating system that Micro Focus acquired as part of its takeover of AttachmateOne possibility is that Elliott will push to be involved in a sale of some or all of the business through its private equity team, Evergreen Coast Capital.A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Micro Focus declined to comment.Despite one of more volatile quarters in recent years, the chief executive of BlackRock believes that robust global growth and stellar earnings results will be enough to keep the stock market from spiraling downward.But he concedes that worries over trade wars and increased political uncertainty \u2014 at home and abroad \u2014 has made for a riskier investing environment.\u201cMy optimism has abated somewhat,\u201d Mr. Fink said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cBut economically the world is in good shape.\u201dBut for all the turmoil and noise, the market is about flat for the year, he pointed out.The investment giant reported first-quarter earnings Thursday. Helped by continuing inflows into the firm's passive funds, better performance by its actively managed funds and a more favorable tax rate, earnings per share grew 28 percent compared with a year ago.\u201cThis quarter validates us institutionally,\u201d Mr. Fink said, making the point that BlackRock could attract money even when investors are in a jittery mood.Even though many investors yanked money out of the market over the past two months, BlackRock had $55 billion of net inflows for the quarter, with its fast-growing exchange-traded funds comprising $34 billion of that figure.Assets under management grew by 17 percent annually and now stand at a record high of $6.3 trillion.Critics\u2019 cornerIt would seem pretty serious.\u201cWillow initially not only hated the idea but put her foot down because she thought it would be highly destructive to our family and to our lives.\u201dThe idea kept nagging at him and his wife gave her reluctant permission.\u201cThe thought I had was coming from the patriot in me, growing up at a time when we respected our politicians not only for what they stood for but because of what they accomplished. I am horrified at the state of politics in America today, and I will throw stones in multiple directions. Dialogue has given way to disdain. I, maybe a bit naively, believed that there was a need for someone in high elected office to be more open-minded and willing to not only govern from the middle but to try to shame everyone else into going to the middle.\u201dAlso from the piece, Oprah Winfrey thought he would have been the ideal candidate.\u201cBob is one of the people I respect most in the world. That\u2019s a very short list. He is infinitely capable of multiple categories of expertise, and he has created an environment where you can disagree with him\u2014and that\u2019s not just because I\u2019m Oprah. I really, really pushed him to run for president, so much so that I said to him, \u2018Gee, if you ever decide to run for office, I will go door to door carrying leaflets. I will go sit and have tea with people.\u2019\u201d\u201cBerkshire\u2019s present intention is to vote against the four directors proposed by management,\u201d Mr. Buffett\u2019s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, said in an email.Two weeks ago USG rejected Knauf\u2019s $5.9 billion, or $42-a-share, offer. The rejection came despite Berkshire, which controls more than 30 percent of USG, saying it would take Knauf\u2019s offer if the German company agreed to buy the rest of USG for at least $42 a share.Knauf had called on USG shareholders to withhold support for USG\u2019s board nominees in an effort to bring USG to the table.Shares of USG rose 2.8 percent on the news.\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business.\u201dShe seems to be trying to dial back that threat: National Amusements, the Redstone family holding company that controls CBS and Viacom, said in a statement that it has \u201ctremendous respect\u201d for Mr. Moonves, \u201cand it has always been our intention that he run a combined company.\u201dBut in a deal process that is playing out unusually publicly, consider the gantlet thrown.Through its $100 billion Vision Fund, SoftBank has pushed into businesses as wide-ranging as augmented reality, online commerce and dog walking. But the rationale for an investment like this one appears more elusive, other than being a play for lucrative sports content.\u201cIt is safe to say it is one of the largest tax bills on earned income in history.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lynching\u2019s Long Shadow", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "FeatureElwood Higginbotham was murdered by a mob in 1935. For his descendants, a new historical inquiry into his death offers a chance to confront the past. Supported byBut one hot and clear afternoon in September, a day before the 82nd anniversary of her paternal grandfather\u2019s death, Washington sat in the back seat of her sister\u2019s car ready to crack open her family\u2019s painful history. Her father, E.W. Higginbottom, sat beside her in a white dress shirt and cuff links, and her sister and brother-in-law, Delois and Irven Wright, rode up front. Washington\u2019s children \u2014 Trinity, Bailee and Rico \u2014 squabbled quietly in the S.U.V.\u2019s third row.They had left the suburbs outside Memphis, Tenn., and were headed south, past deep green woods and an old railway line, toward Oxford, Miss., where Washington\u2019s grandfather lived and died. The family planned to meet there with staff members from the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation, a Mississippi nonprofit, and tour sites significant in her grandfather\u2019s lynching: the county courthouse, the killing grounds and two graveyards where he might be buried.Washington, who wore rectangular glasses and a sleek ponytail, teaches high school Spanish and possesses an educator\u2019s enthusiasm for history. She has visited Tuskegee University and George Washington Carver\u2019s birthplace. She has walked across the Selma bridge, where Alabama state troopers beat nonviolent voting rights activists in 1965, and traveled to Booker T. Washington\u2019s grave. The broad sweep of black history has come easily; her black family\u2019s experience remained frustratingly elusive. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of seen the house where my mama lived as a child,\u201d she said a few days earlier. \u201cIt was built over, but I kind of know where it is. I can go there. But I don\u2019t know any of my daddy\u2019s history.\u201dHigginbottom was 4 when the mob came for his father. He is now 87, with eyes set in a perpetual glaucoma squint and the strong voice of a younger man. He is the last remaining family member to have seen his father alive, and the thought of returning to Oxford was gnawing at him. The anxiety began when his daughters first proposed the trip, and it intensified that morning when he woke. And now Washington, the youngest of his six children, was peppering him with questions.\u201cSo, who is your daddy\u2019s mama?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know my grandmother on my daddy\u2019s side,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen did granddaddy and grandmama get married?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know when my parents got married.\u201dHigginbottom knew little because his mother and extended family fled Mississippi after the lynching. They raised E.W., the eldest, and his siblings, Flora and Willie Wade, in Forrest City, Ark., and later in Memphis. Higginbottom\u2019s mother told the children their father had been hanged but didn\u2019t share many details. And she almost never spoke of her dead husband\u2019s character, habits or looks \u2014 the stories of his life. Maybe grief kept her quiet. Or fear. Either way, Higginbottom knew better than to mention his daddy. Sometimes he asked his cousins Dorothy and Olivia about him, but they told him to leave it alone. Don\u2019t mess around in that, they said. You might get hurt.Higginbottom had occasionally returned to Oxford when he was younger, chaperoned by uncles who wanted to visit relatives or take in a service at the family\u2019s former church. But it had been a long time. He stared at the fields consumed by kudzu, the gravel drives, the hardwoods lush with summer growth, and saw only a foreign country. \u201cI was trying to see something I recognized around here, but I don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt don\u2019t look like I ever lived down here.\u201d As they sped closer to Oxford, he kept gazing out the window, scanning the landscape for even a spark of memory.Washington\u2019s grandfather was one of at least 4,100 African-Americans who were lynched between 1877 and 1950 in 12 states clustered along the curve from Virginia to Texas. Although racially motivated lynchings also took place in other states, they were far more common in the South. Black men accused of violent crimes \u2014 many of whom were very likely innocent \u2014 were frequent targets. But other black men, and women and even children, too, were lynched for insisting on their rights, or for minor violations of the racial caste system, like failing to step off a sidewalk to make way for a white person. On April 26, Stevenson\u2019s organization will open the country\u2019s first memorial to lynching victims, alongside a museum to racial injustice, in Montgomery.E.J.I.\u2019s National Memorial for Peace and Justice will feature 800 suspended columns \u2014 one for each county where documented lynchings occurred \u2014 engraved with victims\u2019 names. The design is intended to convey scope but also, more ambitiously, to reshape a Southern landscape awash in Confederate symbols by asking each of those 800 counties to claim a duplicate marker and erect the six-foot monolith on its home soil. \u201cIn Berlin, you can\u2019t go anywhere without seeing stones and markers dedicated to the Jewish and Roma residents who were forced from their homes and taken to the concentration camps,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cAnd that iconography creates a consciousness of what happened that I think is necessary for that society to recover. In the American South, we\u2019ve done the opposite. We\u2019ve actually created symbols designed to make us feel great about our history, about the 19th century, about the good old days of the early 20th century.\u201dStevenson has advocated fuller acknowledgment of the impact lynching had on African-Americans, both in terms of the trauma sustained and the concrete ways lynching disadvantaged communities. In some places, lynchings were accompanied by mob destruction of black business districts, adding economic devastation to sorrow. And African-Americans who migrated north or west to escape the threat of violence had to start over. Many left social networks, homes and businesses, making it extraordinarily difficult for families to build intergenerational wealth.E.J.I.\u2019s point of view stems from earlier scholarship and activism that tried to foster lasting conversations about lynching and puncture popular myths about the practice, like the notions that lynchings were isolated aberrations, pioneer justice or the work of social outsiders like the Ku Klux Klan. The unsettling \u201cWithout Sanctuary\u201d exhibit, for example, made its debut in New York in 2000 and featured graphic photos of burned and mutilated black bodies surrounded by jubilant white crowds, some of which swelled into the thousands. Among the most disturbing images were those of white children in the crowds, some with expressions of smug delight on their faces. \u201cIf you want to talk about what stands in that place of distrust between blacks and whites, that\u2019s part of it \u2014 not that there are just individuals, but hundreds or thousands of white witnesses who might stand beside and fail to stop this,\u201d said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the author of \u201cOn the Courthouse Lawn: Confronting the Legacy of Lynching in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d \u201cThis is powerful, to unpack the complicity of those who remained silent and stood by and watched. That always has to be reckoned with, and we have to deal with that today.\u201dThe gruesome nature of lynchings, Ifill noted, was the main point; they were meant to haunt and intimidate, and to thus ensure the continuation of white supremacy. Stevenson makes a point of calling them \u201cracial terror lynchings.\u201d The killings rippled beyond individual victims and their families to shroud entire communities in fear and shame. In some places, lynching memories suppressed black voter participation for decades. Even today, Ifill and Stevenson said, memories of racial violence can be so traumatic that survivors, witnesses and inheritors stay locked in silence \u2014 much like Higginbottom\u2019s mother, who took her husband\u2019s memory to her grave. \u201cThere are thousands of African-American families with histories of horrific victimization and racial oppression that have never openly talked because it hasn\u2019t felt safe or healthy to have those conversations,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cWe\u2019re just finding our voice, many of us, to insist on truth telling. And my view on truth and reconciliation is that it\u2019s sequential. You can\u2019t get to reconciliation until you first get to truth.\u201dThe trip to Oxford\u2019s Winter Institute, which was housed inside a Brutalist hulk of a building on the University of Mississippi campus, marked the culmination of a monthslong unraveling of their grandfather\u2019s story. Earlier in the year, a Northeastern University law student named Kyleen Burke emailed Washington\u2019s cousin Tyrone Higginbottom, who then put her in touch with the rest of the family. She told them that she had done extensive research on their grandfather\u2019s life and death as part of Northeastern\u2019s Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project, which investigates Jim Crow-era cold cases, and she shared some of what she learned so far. As Washington settled into the Winter Institute\u2019s high-ceilinged meeting room, she \u2014 and her sister, father, brother-in-law and children \u2014 were still processing Burke\u2019s avalanche of new information and wondering what else might be revealed.A few interested community members, black and white, trickled into the room to listen. Tyrone, a son of E.W.\u2019s brother, Willie Wade, who died in 2005, also joined them. Framed photographs of the civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer and the Memphis sanitation workers\u2019 strike hung on the walls, and the leaves of an enormous magnolia tree could be seen fluttering through a window. A tiny woman in her 40s introduced herself as April Grayson, the Winter Institute\u2019s community-building coordinator. Grayson, who is white, grew up in Rolling Fork, Miss., and has done reconciliation work in some of the state\u2019s most divided places, including Neshoba County, where she helped grass-roots activists who pushed to reopen the cases of the Freedom Summer volunteers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who were abducted and murdered in 1964. In 2005, a ringleader and former Klansman who had escaped justice, Edgar Ray Killen, was finally convicted and sentenced to 60 years for the crimes. Grayson read a poem by the Senegalese poet Birago Diop, \u201cThose Who Are Dead Are Never Gone,\u201d and then she invited the family members to introduce themselves.\u201cI\u2019m glad to be here, and so excited about learning information, having never met my grandfather,\u201d Wright began. Wright, who is 55, has a beautiful singing voice and an outgoing nature despite the grief she has experienced. Her first husband and her eldest son died young; the son was shot and killed before he turned 30. Sometimes she thinks about her grandfather and wonders if a curse hovers over the family\u2019s men. \u201cI\u2019m just ready to get some information so I can talk to my grandkids, because I have seven,\u201d she said.Burke was there, too, in the form of a disembodied voice emanating from a phone speaker. Grayson asked her to provide an overview of the lynching, and everyone turned to face a beige landline propped on a chair. Irven Wright aimed his cellphone camera at the room, so he could stream video for family members who couldn\u2019t be there. From his home in Killeen, Tex., David, a 56-year-old Army and Marine Corps veteran, watched and listened. He scrutinized his father, a man who dropped out of school in seventh grade and picked cotton so his mother and siblings could eat, who fought in the Korean War and who for decades worked backbreaking jobs to support Morline Lowe, the Arkansas beauty he married in 1955, and their children. The older man had removed his newsboy-style cap and sat apart from his daughters and grandchildren. \u201cI try to put myself in his shoes,\u201d David said. \u201cI try to be him. I thought, What would my heart feel right now?\u201d As Burke began to speak, David\u2019s father sat bolt upright in his chair, as if braced for a blow.In the 1930s, Oxford and the surrounding areas of Lafayette County remained, in many ways, hardly different from the time of Reconstruction. Cotton reigned as the dominant crop. The county\u2019s population was around 20,000. But change was afoot. Main streets gleamed with pavement rather than dirt. Men found work, even during the Great Depression, building a government-funded dormitory at the University of Mississippi campus, which remained segregated until James Meredith began attending in 1962 amid notoriously violent protests. The town\u2019s most famous literary son, William Faulkner, had already written \u201cThe Sound and the Fury,\u201d and he lived a short walk from the busy town square. Nearby, African-Americans nurtured a middle class in a vibrant Freedmen Town that offered taxis, grocery stores and a Rosenwald School; one former resident described the neighborhood as \u201ca black man\u2019s city in a white man\u2019s town.\u201dBut Oxford was still a white man\u2019s town, as Higginbotham would discover. Archival documents offer differing accounts of the killing, as is the case with many lynchings. Often newspapers document that a lynching occurred but otherwise prove unreliable. Reporters frequently omitted key facts or filed sensationalized tales of black criminality. Some explicitly sanctioned lynching, even going so far as to announce killings in advance. The Oxford Eagle delivered lackluster coverage of Higginbotham\u2019s death. As recorded in the papers of the civil rights worker Jessie Daniel Ames, an editor at The Eagle later explained to an anti-lynching investigator that \u201che had to live in Oxford and that he wanted to get along with the people there, and that the race situation made it practically impossible to carry the facts about the killing.\u201dThose facts began on the night of May 21, 1935, months before Higginbotham was killed, according to an investigation by the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, an anti-lynching organization founded in Atlanta in 1919. Higginbotham and his wife, the commission reported, were in their bedroom that spring evening when a white farmer and neighbor named Glen Roberts arrived. He had at least one other man, his brother, in tow, and according to other records, he was armed. The sharecropper and Roberts had quarreled earlier; Higginbotham had objected to Roberts\u2019s running cattle over his rented field. Now Roberts wanted to whip him for it. When Higginbotham refused to open the door, Roberts broke down an exterior shed room with an ax. Then he chopped his way into the hallway. Higginbotham, the investigators wrote, warned Roberts to stop. Roberts crashed into the bedroom next, at which point Higginbotham shot and killed him.The gravity of that moment must have registered with Higginbotham immediately. Roberts was a prominent member of the Oxford community: He enjoyed a reputation as a crack fox hunter, he played fiddle at local celebrations and he was white. Higginbotham fled, and the sheriff rallied hundreds of men to pursue him. They trailed bloodhounds across forests and fields, arrested another black man on suspicion of helping Higginbotham escape and severely beat one of Higginbotham\u2019s sisters. Higginbotham evaded them for two nights before the searchers found him submerged in a creek across the county line.The search parties might have lynched Higginbotham right then and there, but the Pontotoc County sheriff sent him to Jackson, Miss., 150 miles away, for safekeeping. A district attorney and the county attorney, who was Roberts\u2019s nephew, arrived at the Jackson jail the next day. They left, boasting of having obtained a written murder confession from Higginbotham despite the fact that, according to census records, he could neither read nor write. \u201cWe have a clear-cut case of coldblooded murder against the Negro,\u201d the district attorney told a reporter. \u201cThe Negro is a vindictive type.\u201d They sought the death penalty.Although he had supposedly confessed, Higginbotham pleaded not guilty when he returned to Oxford three months later for trial on Sept. 17. Melissa testified, an act that would have exposed her to possible retribution and that undoubtedly influenced her decision to leave. The hearing lasted a mere afternoon, but records suggest that some jurors doubted the prosecution\u2019s story. The judge issued careful instructions to the jury, advising them that if they believed that Roberts had entered the home in \u201ca rude, an angry manner, and then and there held a pistol pointing toward the defendant,\u201d that they should find Higginbotham not guilty. Hours later, the jury had yet to reach a verdict, and two jurors were rumored to be holding out for acquittal.What might have become a victory for Higginbotham and for the rule of law instead devolved into an extrajudicial killing. Not far from the white courthouse at the center of Oxford\u2019s square, a mob formed early in the evening outside the jail. Estimates put the crowd at as many as 150 men. Anyone walking to or from the heart of town would have witnessed the lynching party. They would have seen the killers enter the jail, where, through force or persuasion, they bypassed three sheriff\u2019s deputies and the jailer before pulling Higginbotham from his cell. They would have seen the men force Higginbotham into a car and begin driving up North Lamar Boulevard. The caravan swept by the grand homes of Oxford\u2019s wealthy, then past the edge of town and the lonely Three-Way intersection, before stopping in the woods off old Russell Road. Higginbotham, one newspaper reported, stayed quiet during the ride. The men took the sharecropper out of the car, hanged him from a tree and shot him.Washington, for her part, had already read Burke\u2019s written report and was more familiar with the story than her siblings. But there was one revelation she never tired of hearing about: that before his death, her grandfather might have been a labor activist. \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Burke said, \u201cvery possible, that Elwood Higginbotham was actually involved in union organizing within a Communist labor group, trying to build power among the local sharecroppers, particularly the black sharecroppers in the area.\u201d Lynchings to eliminate African-Americans who advocated political, social and economic reforms peaked in the early 20th century, and a union affiliation provided an additional motive for Higginbotham\u2019s lynching \u2014 perhaps he had been targeted before the argument with Roberts. But Washington cared more about what a labor role suggested about her granddaddy\u2019s character than what it said about his killers. The image of her grandfather as a labor organizer, a man fighting for his people, made her think of Cesar Chavez. \u201cHere he was, only 20-something years old,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be that brave and young in the South? Brave.\u201dBurke\u2019s research brought David Higginbottom great relief. His grandfather, it turned out, hadn\u2019t cheated on their grandmother, as in the tale his young mind had invented. \u201cYou sort of feel a little proud, in a crazy sort of sense,\u201d he said. \u201cProud that he\u2019s not the guy that you perceived that he had been.\u201d The chronology, horrible as it was, also helped David better understand his own father. E.W. Higginbottom\u2019s hatred of Mississippi was family legend, and that antipathy made sense now that the family was talking more openly about the killing. So did other things. As an adolescent, David spent what felt like every waking moment at his father\u2019s side, traversing Memphis in a red 1964 Malibu, going from one lawn-mowing job to the next. He hated it; he felt smothered. But the more he thought about his grandfather\u2019s death, the more he saw his father\u2019s behaviors \u2014 the angry flashes and the hovering \u2014 as fear for a black son in a hostile world: \u201cHis thoughts were, If I can keep you around me working, I don\u2019t worry.\u201dWright asked Burke about her family tree. \u201cKyleen, you said his family was big? How many?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m wondering how many siblings my grandfather had.\u201d Burke read nine names: Dela, Hosey, Rella, Jumilla, Walter, Bee, Hulette, Queen and Evelena. She also knew the name of Wright\u2019s great-grandparents: Robert and Katie.Conversation flowed toward the future. Lafayette County has two Confederate soldier statues, erected in 1906 and 1907, standing in prominent locations. One faces south behind the courthouse. The other statue \u2014 whose creators conceived it as a monument to \u201cheroes not forgotten\u201d \u2014 looms above a grassy circle on the University of Mississippi campus. It\u2019s now accompanied by a \u201ccontextualization plaque\u201d installed in 2016 at the insistence of student activists and faculty, who observed that the statue\u2019s creators wanted not merely to remember the dead but to extol white Southern nationalism and reframe the Civil War as a defense of states\u2019 rights. Not long before the Higginbottoms\u2019 visit, the Lafayette County board of supervisors heard public comments about the Confederate statue on the square, some of which called for removal. \u201cThere is a growing movement of people in the state who seem very committed to bringing this up,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cAs we\u2019re in conversation about Civil War memorials, Confederate memorials, how do we broaden that discussion to memorializing people like Elwood Higginbotham?\u201dThere\u2019s no marker to him or to the six other men who were lynched in the county, one of whom remains unidentified. John Ashworth, the project manager for the Lynching Sites Project of Memphis, which is trying to partner with E.J.I. to erect markers to 37 lynching victims in Shelby County, said that remembering men like Higginbotham is delicate work. He has researched cases in which family members had no idea their relative was lynched or didn\u2019t wish to revisit the traumatic story, and he has seen others in which the killing grounds have been obliterated by parking lots or office buildings. But for descendants who can and do participate in memorialization efforts, he said, the process can be healing. \u201cIt is a validation of their humanity,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cAt least somebody cares about what happened.\u201dWashington was thinking about hearing those family names \u2014 Robert and Katie \u2014 for the first time. \u201cThat\u2019s my great-grandparents,\u201d Washington said. She and her family followed Grayson downstairs to a rear parking lot and climbed into a rented blue van. Another cousin, a brother of Tyrone\u2019s, had arrived late, which brought the total of Elwood Higginbotham\u2019s gathered children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren to eight. They represented just a fraction of Higginbotham\u2019s direct descendants, and in the months to come, Washington and Wright would describe for many of the others \u2014 their four siblings who couldn\u2019t attend that day, as well as children and grandchildren, nieces and nephews and cousins \u2014 the places they were about to see.It\u2019s tempting to level blame entirely at the 12 states where lynching ran rampant, but the practice persisted only because the rest of the country averted its gaze. Sullivan could brag because he knew there was virtually no chance he\u2019d be charged or prosecuted by local or state authorities. Nor did he need to fear that the federal government would intervene on behalf of its black citizens. Congress failed to pass nearly 200 federal anti-lynching bills during the first half of the 20th century and spurned requests for action from seven presidents. Ignorance wasn\u2019t a factor. African-American activists, including Ida B. Wells, who was born into slavery not far from Oxford, in Holly Springs, Miss., had thoroughly exposed lynching as a brutal tool of racial subjugation before the turn of the century. Wells published \u201cSouthern Horrors\u201d in 1892, a work she hoped would \u201carouse the conscience of the American people.\u201dHigginbotham\u2019s death, as it happens, figured somewhat prominently in this little-known struggle for reform, and today it serves as a case study in how federal indifference contributed to the brutal killings of thousands of black Americans. Higginbotham died shortly after the failure of the Costigan-Wagner Act, which would have provided compensation to victims\u2019 families and brought federal charges against any law-enforcement officer who aided lynching parties or turned a blind eye during killings. The N.A.A.C.P. made lynching a key focus in 1912 and later pushed Costigan-Wagner with a petition that included the signatures of nine governors and ex-governors, 27 mayors, 58 clergy members and more than 150 lawyers, editors, jurists and academics. Franklin Roosevelt, however, offered only lukewarm support for the bill. Southern conservatives then, as one historian put it, tried to simply \u201ctalk it to death,\u201d filibustering and deflecting by pointing to social ills in Northern and Western states, like gang murders and the deaths of miners in labor disputes. Southern lawmakers traditionally prevailed by arguing against federal interference in local affairs, by positing that anti-lynching laws would be unconstitutional and by playing on racial fears with rhetoric about black rapists, a favorite boogeyman of lynching apologists. In the case of Costigan-Wagner, the Southern bloc delayed until its opponents, who were eager to pass other legislation, recessed in April 1935. The bill fell off the calendar without a vote.When Higginbotham died later that year, the outraged N.A.A.C.P. telegraphed the president: \u201cAction of mob in seizing victim in open daylight as jury deliberated ... is anarchy and nothing else. It is certain nothing will be done by Mississippi authorities to punish lynchers. This clearly proves filibusters against Costigan-Wagner bill during last session of Congress lied and knew they were lying when they claimed states could and would prevent lynchings and punish lynchers.\u201dDespite congressional inaction, the N.A.A.C.P. was nonetheless winning in the court of public opinion by the 1930s. Some Southern newspapers came out against lynching not on moral grounds but because the practice imperiled the region\u2019s economy and image. A glimpse of that shifting public sentiment \u2014 the tiniest sliver of shame \u2014 can be found at the end of a newspaper article about Higginbotham\u2019s death, in which a reporter observed that \u201cthere is much apprehension on the part of whites\u201d over how the killing might affect enrollment at the University of Mississippi.When the Senate finally apologized to African-Americans in 2005 for its near-century of intransigence, it acknowledged that \u201cprotection from lynching was the minimum and most basic of federal responsibilities\u201d toward its citizens. The resolution declared lynching the \u201cultimate expression of racism\u201d and accepted responsibility for repeatedly rejecting anti-lynching legislation despite requests from people like Arthur Raper, a sociologist and field secretary for the mostly white Commission on Interracial Cooperation, which investigated Higginbotham\u2019s killing. Raper, who studied more than 100 lynchings, implored the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1940 to consider anti-lynching legislation yet again, noting that the ever-present threat of lynching operated to keep African-Americans \u201cin their places, to rob them of the opportunity to exercise their basic human rights.\u201d He recounted Higginbotham\u2019s story as an illustration of the futility of allowing Southern states to police themselves. \u201cWhat happened to the parties who did the lynching?\u201d a Wisconsin senator asked him. Raper replied: \u201cNothing in the world. Nobody was ever punished.\u201dGrayson drove Higginbottom and his family to the courthouse first, which looks much as it did in 1935, and which Washington\u2019s 7-year-old son, Rico, declared \u201cjust like the White House.\u201d But the surrounding square, once full of car dealerships and theaters, has given way to boutiques, restaurants and fitness studios \u2014 the markers of a prosperous New South. Because it was Saturday, the courthouse doors were locked. Washington stood outside and posed for a photo, her arms flung wide and her face lit by a broad smile. It was a tourist\u2019s gesture of pleasure, an outward expression of the enlightenment she felt. She also wanted photos to show her students. She had already shocked them by telling them about her granddaddy\u2019s lynching. Some didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. \u201cThey asked me, \u2018What is \u201clynched\u201d?\u2019\u2009\u201d Washington said, shaking her head. \u201cAfrican-Americans. I have African-American and Hispanic kids in my class.\u201dFrom the courthouse, Grayson then traced the route of Higginbotham\u2019s kidnappers to the Three-Way, an intersection that\u2019s now a four-way \u2014 flanked by gas stations and an auto mechanic, a forgettable gateway to and from town. David Higginbottom originally planned to come to Oxford, too, to join his family in that van as they considered his grandfather\u2019s last moments, but he changed his mind; it was too hard to think about how someone could hang and shoot another human being. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to open nothing in my heart that I can\u2019t close,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to think people are the same. I just wasn\u2019t ready for it.\u201dGrayson swung the van onto a short street that was formerly known, she believed, as old Russell Road. She parked beside a little white house with a For Sale sign planted in the front yard. The family climbed out of the van, and Higginbottom almost immediately gestured to an oak. \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s the tree, right there?\u201d he said. They didn\u2019t know, of course, but from then on the suggestion seemed to linger in the air around it. Higginbottom\u2019s nephew Tyrone looked at its branches and searched the trunk for bullet holes. Higginbottom thought of his father\u2019s final moments, of his agony. Elwood Higginbotham reportedly struggled mightily at the end, biting a length of the noose so tightly that his killers pried his mouth open with a tire iron in order to hang him. \u201cHe was trying to protect us,\u201d Higginbottom said. \u201cI know that.\u201dWashington hustled her kids back into the van after just a few minutes. They sat in the sweltering interior while their relatives traced aimless circles on the grass. Washington\u2019s feelings about the trip to Oxford were hard to express, even months afterward. She wasn\u2019t exactly sad. How could she be? She didn\u2019t know her grandfather. Yet standing in front of the courthouse and at the approximate spot where he died gave her a sense of closeness; those were places, she said, \u201cwhere we know he was at.\u201d In January, a kitchen fire would scorch the rented house Washington shared with her husband, children and father, and she would find herself thinking and talking more about Elwood Higginbotham. \u201cNow I feel like he may have been more interesting to have known,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like he may have been a stronger person than we know. I think if he had been alive, there might have been more stability in the family, our lives might have been different.\u201dThey left the oak as the afternoon light began to soften. Burke had narrowed Higginbotham\u2019s burial site to two possibilities. At the first, she parked alongside a rural highway, perpendicular to a pasture and wooden fence. The cemetery lay on private property that was for sale; a real estate agent had told Grayson that the site contained only seven graves with marked headstones, none of which read Higginbotham. Because they couldn\u2019t enter the property, no one bothered to get out of the van, and they paused for only a few minutes before Grayson set a course southward, skirting suburban-style subdivisions before plunging into rural territory again. Higginbottom sat beside her, and they chatted about muscadines, the South\u2019s bittersweet wild grapes.The second cemetery was also on private land, upslope behind a house fronted by roses and a shiny pickup truck. The owner, Randy McCluskey, wanted to help, and he greeted the Higginbottoms in his driveway. He had prematurely gray hair and wore shorts and a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cRebels,\u201d the name of the University of Mississippi athletic teams. He guided Higginbottom into a camouflage A.T.V. so that the older man wouldn\u2019t have to limp uphill. Rico, Bailee and Trinity, eager for a diversion, clamored into the cargo bed behind them. \u201cHold on,\u201d Washington shouted as the little vehicle puttered off. \u201cHold on.\u201dShe and the rest of the family picked their way up the grassy field to reach the border of woods thick with cedars and oaks. In the shade of the trees, the air felt like a wet blanket, and mosquitoes homed in on open flesh. When McCluskey bought the 35-acre property six years ago, the graveyard was largely hidden by vegetation and crawling with ticks. He cleared brush to reveal markers, some bearing names and others mere stones, and tried to learn about the plot\u2019s history. One neighbor told him that blacks and whites lay here together, so maybe this was the right place.The family fanned out among the trees. They were overdressed \u2014 Higginbottom in his suspenders and Wright in red gladiator sandals \u2014 and uncomfortable. Higginbottom talked about how young his mother was, just 22, when she was forced to remake their lives. Rico drifted into the field below and found McCluskey\u2019s son and a friend. The boys horsed around with a sapling, pulling on its branches and laughing in the sunlight. The adults stared at the ground but found no proof that their relative was interred there. In the dark woods, amid the crumbling gravestones, Elwood Higginbotham\u2019s life and death remained, to a great degree, beyond the limits of understanding.Vanessa Gregory is a writer and a professor in Oxford, Miss.

That a populist \u2014 or a populist cause like Brexit in Britain \u2014 can succeed in countries that are wealthy and seemingly stable suggests that deeply polarized societies are also vulnerable to extreme partisanship, and so to populist bombast. The great challenge for liberal democracy is to counter the populists without resorting to their tactics.In the end, the legitimacy accorded by the vote is both the autocrat\u2019s entree to power and potentially his (they are all men) downfall. Autocracy breeds corruption and cronyism, and leaders who wallow in the swamp they pledged to drain cannot forever fool their base. For all his evident popularity, Mr. Putin still felt compelled to block any effective opposition to his recent re-election; Mr. Erdogan\u2019s speeches are beginning to bore some people; and however strong Mr. Orban\u2019s chances appear, he has campaigned with an intensity that betrays a touch of insecurity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Huawei and ZTE Hit Hard as U.S. Moves Against Chinese Tech Firms", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States undercut China\u2019s technology ambitions on Tuesday, advancing a new rule that would limit the ability of Chinese telecommunications companies to sell their products in this country.The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to move forward with a plan that would prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to American national security. The decision takes direct aim at Huawei, which makes telecommunications network equipment and smartphones, and its main Chinese rival, ZTE, sending a message that the government doesn\u2019t trust them.The moves intensify an already testy fight between China and the United States for high-tech supremacy. Although tensions have simmered for years, the two economic powerhouses are threatening a global trade war as they look to protect their most advanced industries.Long bedeviled by political concerns about its ties to the Chinese government, Huawei (pronounced \u201cHWA-way\u201d) has spent the better part of the last decade trying to sell its equipment and phones in the United States.Since then, Huawei has signaled that its political battles in Washington may be all but lost. The company has been dialing back on government outreach in the United States, including lobbying, and last week it cut key staff there, according to people familiar with the matter. The new F.C.C. rule, which would become final with a second vote, could kill off what little equipment business Huawei has in the United States.These are uncertain times for tech companies, whether American or Chinese, that are trying to do business across the Pacific. The two nations are playing an aggressive game of one-upsmanship, both to support their own companies and guard against threats to national security. Last month, the Trump administration accused Beijing of stealing American know-how as part of its ambitions to transform the Chinese economy, prompting tit-for-tat tariffs.The latest moves against Huawei and ZTE mean that American companies like Apple and Qualcomm could soon be caught in the crossfire \u2014 and they have a lot to lose. Apple, for example, sold $46.5 billion worth of iPhones and other products in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong last year. That was about 20 percent of its total sales.Wealthy Chinese consumers have gravitated toward Apple, and President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party still aim to keep the public happy. But there are limits to Apple\u2019s leverage in the country.\u201cBeijing will not sit idly by,\u201d said Paul Triolo, who leads global technology policy analysis at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consultancy. \u201cChinese officials will likely pause to digest this move, and the series of other trade and investment moves coming at them in waves, before deciding how best to respond. It is likely to get ugly before it gets better.\u201dBeijing could use its broad cybersecurity laws to steal the core computer code of American companies operating in China, said Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group that represents the largest American tech companies. The Chinese government also could walk back recent commitments to allow more financial and electronic payments services from Mastercard, Visa and JPMorgan Chase. Or it could simply restrict American companies\u2019 ability to do business in China, he said.For ZTE, this week\u2019s sanctions are a nightmare come true. The company\u2019s smartphones and network gear rely on American microchips and software, which means it could need to redesign as much as 90 percent of its product line.ZTE and Google, which supplies the Android operating system in the Chinese company\u2019s phones, are concerned that the ban may prevent ZTE from licensing the software, according to a person familiar with the discussions but not permitted to speak publicly on the matter. No conclusion has been reached yet, the person said.Huawei is a global telecommunications equipment powerhouse, with $93 billion in revenue last year. It has spent millions trying to pry its way into the United States but found few takers \u2014 save for smaller, rural telecom companies that receive federal subsidies and would likely be barred from working with it by the F.C.C. rule.Huawei\u2019s troubles in the United States have been mounting since 2012, when a congressional report warned that its gear could be used to spy on Americans or to destabilize American telecom networks. The company spent $1.2 million on lobbying that year. Last year, it spent $60,000.Major American carriers such as Verizon and AT&T have since shunned Huawei. The Commerce and Treasury Departments have subpoenaed it over possible violations of American sanctions on Iran and North Korea. And bills are before Congress to stop government agencies and contractors from buying Huawei products.In January, researchers discovered security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world\u2019s computers. A Senate committee wrote to Huawei\u2019s founder to ask what the company knew about the vulnerabilities, and how it had been affected by them. Huawei decided not to respond.Then, last week, Huawei laid off five American employees, including William B. Plummer, the executive who was the face of its Sisyphean efforts to win over Washington.The company has said repeatedly that its products pose no security risk and that it complies with the law everywhere it operates. Still, the layoffs appear to be an acknowledgment by Huawei that it has failed to clear the political cloud around it.\u201cSome things cannot change their course according to our wishes,\u201d Eric Xu, Huawei\u2019s deputy chairman, said at the company\u2019s annual meeting with analysts on Tuesday in its home city, Shenzhen. \u201cWith some things, when you let them go, you actually feel more at ease.\u201dMr. Plummer, who was Huawei\u2019s vice president of external affairs, had been with the company for almost eight years. He was the most senior member of Huawei\u2019s American policy team who was not a Chinese citizen.It is not clear whether he will be replaced. The company\u2019s policy operations in the United States are led by a relatively recent arrival, Zhang Ruijun, who took the post nine months ago after working for the company in Mexico and Russia.A Huawei spokesman said in a statement that any layoffs simply reflected an effort to better align resources with \u201cbusiness strategy and objectives.\u201d\u201cAny changes to staffing size or structure are simply a reflection of standard business organization,\u201d he said.In the United States, Huawei customers that would be affected by the F.C.C.\u2019s proposed rule \u2014 small cellular carriers, largely in rural areas \u2014 may soon need to find new equipment suppliers.These carriers love Huawei gear, said Carri Bennet, general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association, an industry group for American telecom companies with fewer than 100,000 subscribers.The association\u2019s members have even elected a Huawei executive, William Levy, to their board.Ms. Bennet said that rather than blacklisting specific manufacturers, Washington should be creating a system for testing telecom gear for security vulnerabilities.\u201cThese companies who are reliant on this support, they don\u2019t have the funds to overhaul their whole network,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic safety, getting 911 services, broadband \u2014 it all just starts falling apart.\u201dDaisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Orban Campaigns on Fear, With Hungary\u2019s Democracy at Stake", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySZEKESFEHERVAR, Hungary \u2014 On thousands of billboards and posters, Viktor Orban\u2019s campaign for a fourth term as Hungary\u2019s leader in elections on Sunday uses a photo showing a long line of migrants hiking through the countryside.On the image is one simple message, a red sign: \u201cSTOP.\u201dIt hardly seems to matter that the migration crisis has largely passed and that there are now more posters in Hungary about the danger of immigrants and refugees than actual refugees and immigrants let into the country this past year.The poster is in keeping with a campaign that has been rife with dirty tricks, false news stories, vicious personal attacks, conspiracy theories and perceived enemies all around.It is all fear and loathing in this battle for the political soul of this central European country of 10 million people that sits at the crossroads between the East and the West.The greatest fear is among Mr. Orban\u2019s opponents: That his victory will mean not just their loss, but the loss of Hungary\u2019s democracy.Mr. Orban is widely thought to be cruising to victory as prime minister \u2014 the question seems to be how large his win will be \u2014 carried on increasingly apocalyptic language.A defeat for his party, Fidesz, would spell doom for the whole nation, he argues, and open the door wider to immigrants, the European Union, civic organizations and a favorite target, the billionaire financier George Soros.On the eve of the election, speaking in Szekesfehervar, the ancient city where he spent his youth and the cradle of the country\u2019s Catholic roots, Mr. Orban portrayed himself as the defender of the nation against both invading immigrants and hostile Western forces.\u201cEuropean leaders and a speculator billionaire are joining hands to let immigrants in,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThere are two futures. One is offered by Soros candidates, the other is offered by Fidesz.\u201d\u201cMassive migration goes together with the increased terrorist threat,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen there is large migration, women are under threat of violent attacks.\u201dIt is a theme Mr. Orban never seems to tire of. \u201cAfrica wants to kick down our door, and Brussels is not defending us,\u201d he told the crowds outside the Hungarian Parliament three weeks ago. \u201cEurope is under invasion already, and they are watching with their hands in the air.\u201dSuch appeals have placed Mr. Orban in the vanguard of populist leaders, building what he calls an \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d one of majoritarian rule and winner-take-all politics.It is a style that has found imitators and admirers from Warsaw to the White House.While more than half the country did not back Fidesz in the last election, those that support Mr. Orban do so with passion and without reservation.Laslo Palovics, 56, an engineer from Budapest, said that Mr. Orban and Fidesz were the only ones willing to speak politically incorrect truths. \u201cThe opposition is weak and not capable of anything,\u201d he said as he handed out lighters and bottle openers at a Fidesz rally Thursday evening.The memories of tens of thousands of migrants flowing through the country, jamming railway stations and setting off clashes with police, have been kept fresh by constant government warnings. With each terrorist attack in Europe \u2014 from Paris to Brussels \u2014 the message is reinforced: Islam is dangerous.He has also created a work program targeting often neglected communities in the countryside, where the promised benefits of capitalism have yet to be fully realized. At the same time, the economy remains strong, with the World Bank projecting the country\u2019s gross domestic product to grow 3.9 percent this year.Political opponents and Western critics say it could lead to the end of a state built on the rule of law, a free press, civil society and a vibrant political discourse.\u201cWhat is at stake is whether this country will find its way back to the family of democratic nations or whether we will continue on the current path,\u201d said Marton Gyongyosi, a leader in Jobbik, the second-largest opposition party in Parliament. \u201cThat path will take us from a soft dictatorship to a full dictatorship.\u201dHe pointed to Mr. Orban\u2019s own words during a March rally, when he promised to take revenge on all those who did not support Fidesz.\u201cWe will seek moral, legal and political recourse after the elections,\u201d Mr. Orban told supporters.The government dismisses critics. \u201cDemocracy has many faces,\u201d said the government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs.Voters there rallied around a single opposition candidate in order to propel him to victory.With stiff penalties for parties that withdraw candidates, many opposition party officials have been unwilling the make the kind of sacrifices necessary to repeat the strategy in Sunday\u2019s election.However, in their place, a robust grass-roots effort has arisen to help voters determined to defeat Fidesz pick the strongest challenger.At least seven websites have been created to collate all the latest polling, allowing voters to find out who stands the best chance of winning in their electoral district.The desire to defeat Orban at all costs has made for some strange alliances.In its early days, much of the lure of Jobbik rested on the party\u2019s xenophobic appeals \u2014 the same kind of blood and soil rhetoric now used by Fidesz.In 2014, as the movement grew into a more mature political party, it tried to purge the most extreme members.Adam Schonberger, the executive director a Jewish community group, Marom, said he does not trust the party\u2019s transformation, but if he had to, he would vote for Jobbik just to defeat Orban.\u201cJobbik is very dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can support them.\u201dAt the moment, he said, concerns about the rise of the far-right and populist movements were a secondary question.\u201cThe issue is whether we will lose our democracy,\u201d he said.As the leader of a Jewish organization, he has watched with concern as the ruling party has made George Soros, the American financier and philanthropist, the embodiment of all things evil.Mr. Orban has tirelessly worked to convince voters that behind every one of the country\u2019s ills, there is some Soros plot.\u201cWe are fighting an enemy that is different from us,\u201d he said in March. \u201cNot open, but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the whole world.\u201dOn bus stops and telephone booths across Budapest, Mr. Soros has been photoshopped into a photo so as to appear to be embracing opposition candidates.Widely criticized as a thinly veiled anti-Semitic appeal, Mr. Schonberger thought the whole effort was dangerous, helping to create anti-Semites.\u201cFidesz is using these things to stir anti-Semitic feelings \u2014 the same way they do against gays or lesbians or Islam,\u201d he said.The ruling party has used every resource at its disposal to drive home its message \u2014 including direct mailing paid for by the state under the guise of a national consultation on the immigration issue.The survey asked questions like whether people \u201csupport George Soros influencing Brussels in resettling at least a million immigrants a year from Africa and the Middle East in Europe.\u201d It was widely viewed as a preamble to the campaign.Csaba Toth, an analyst at Republikon Institute, said that the political calculation is obvious.\u201cSupport for the anti-immigration issue is higher then support for Fidesz itself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can win an election here purely with the support of your base because of the electoral system and the division of the opposition.\u201dVoters cast two votes in the election. One is for a national list of candidates, the results of which make up 93 seats in Parliament. They also cast votes in local elections, filling the remaining 106 seats.Mr. Orban\u2019s party is currently two votes short of the two-thirds majority he needs to push through constitutional changes.\u201cIf he wins a two-thirds majority, it will lead to the complete collapse of the opposition and a very dangerous scenario for the future of Hungary,\u201d Mr. Toth said.Helene Bienvenu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Facebook\u2019s two-day rise of more than 5 percent added over $24 billion to its market capitalization, according to Bloomberg data.\u201cZuckerberg appears willing to work with lawmakers on possible regulations, which may create a barrier to entry in the social network space and help Facebook maintain its market leadership.\u201d\u2014 Matt PhillipsMark Zuckerberg is back on Capitol Hill for a second day of congressional testimony.Here are some highlights :\u2022 Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, kicked off the hearing by declaring that \u201cwhile Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it has not matured.\u201d Mr. Walden floated the prospect of regulation, saying that \u201cI think it is time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Walden also asked: \u201cWhat exactly is Facebook?\u201d The definitions matter. If Facebook is viewed as a telecommunications service that is more like a utility, it may be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. If lawmakers define Facebook as a publisher, it could also fall under regulations at that agency. \u201cI consider us to be a technology company,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThe primary thing we do is have engineers that write code and build services for other people.\u201d\u2022 Representative Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would agree or refuse to change Facebook\u2019s default settings to minimize collection and use of users\u2019 data. \u201cThis is a complex issue that deserves more than a one-word answer,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg answered. \u201cThat\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Mr. Pallone responded.\u2022 California Democrat Anna Eshoo put it more bluntly, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cAre you willing to change your business model to protect users\u2019 privacy?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg was noncommittal, saying: \u201cCongresswoman, I\u2019m not sure what that means.\u201d\u2022 Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg on why Facebook has been allegedly censoring content from conservative organizations and Trump supporters such as Diamond and Silk. Mr. Barton also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if he would agree that Facebook would work to ensure it is \u201ca neutral public platform.\u201d \u201cI do agree that we should give people a voice,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u2022 Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat, and Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, pressed Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s promise to give users worldwide the same privacy controls required by a tough new data protection law which will go into effect in the European Union next month. Mr. Green also asked Mr. Zuckerberg if Facebook planned to comply with the provision in the European law that allows individuals to obtain a copy of the data companies hold about them.\u2022 A number of lawmakers have tried to draw a comparison between the Obama campaign\u2019s use of a Facebook app to scrape data from users and their friends in 2012 and Cambridge Analytica. Those lawmakers have failed to mention one very important distinction between the Obama campaign\u2019s app and Cambridge Analytica\u2019s app: The Obama app was actually on Facebook itself, and it was very clear about who and what the data would be used for. The app used to scrape data for Cambridge Analytica was accessed through a personality questionnaire hosted on a site outside of Facebook, and it appeared to users to be for academic research, not for a political data company owned by a wealthy Republican donor and dedicated to reshaping the American electorate.Mr. Musk told co-host Gayle King:\u201cI think whenever something is \u2013 whenever there\u2019s something that affects the public good then there does need to be some form of public oversight. \u2026 I do think there should be some regulations on AI. I think there should be regulations on social media to the degree that it negatively affects the public good. We can\u2019t have like willy-nilly proliferation of fake news, that\u2019s crazy. You can\u2019t have more types of fake news than real news. That\u2019s allowing public deception to go unchecked. That\u2019s crazy.\u201dAndrew writes: These were the most important words from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s five-hour testimony: \u201cI agree we are responsible for the content.\u201d They may come back to haunt him, given his previous rejection of calling Facebook a publisher. He later backtracked and called his business a tech company, but his acknowledgment may fundamentally shift the conversation \u2014 and how the company operates. (All in all, Mr. Zuckerberg did better than anyone had expected.)Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed Facebook as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating Facebook, asking Mr. Zuckerberg: \u201cBut you as a company welcome regulation?\u201dAnd Facebook may now only be one big scandal away from a more stringent government response.Critics\u2019 corner\u201cUnder a symbiotic U.S.-China relationship, America became a preeminent technology leader, and its brands are today the envy of the world. China improved the standard of living of its citizens with a tenfold increase in per capita gross domestic product over the past 20 years.\u201dBut that relationship will change over the next two decades, Mr. Ma said:\u201cChina is shifting its economy from the world\u2019s largest exporter to the world\u2019s largest consumer. Chinese citizens now have the wealth and income to pursue discretionary spending. They want to buy high-quality imported food, cosmetics, fashions and health and wellness products for themselves and their children.\u201dMr. Ma goes on to write:\u201cIt is therefore ironic that the U.S. administration is waging a trade war at a time when the largest potential consumer market in the world is open for business. Is America going to forfeit this opportunity?Instigating a trade war is the wrong solution because it will only provoke retaliation. The Chinese government responded to U.S. tariff threats with its own tariffs on American agricultural products, such as soybeans. China is the largest export market for American soybeans, worth $14 billion annually and accounting for 65 percent of all U.S. soybean exports.The U.S. has been a consistent defender of free and open markets, but this time it is resorting to protectionism that will not improve American competitiveness.

{"Headline": "Teachers in Arizona and Colorado Walk Out Over Education Funding", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Thousands of teachers in Arizona and Colorado walked out of their classrooms on Thursday to demand more funding for public schools, the latest surge of a teacher protest movement that has already swept through three states and is spreading quickly to others.Hundreds of public schools were shut down in Arizona because of the walkouts, which turned the streets of Downtown Phoenix into seas of crimson as educators and their supporters marched to the State Capitol wearing red T-shirts and chanting \u201cRed for Ed,\u201d as the movement is known here.Widespread teacher protests have in recent months upended daily routines in the conservative-leaning states West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky. But the sight of public workers protesting en masse in the Arizona capital, one of the largest Republican strongholds in the country, and demanding tax increases for more school funding, spoke to the enduring strength of the movement and signaled shifts in political winds ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections.\u201cI\u2019ll be voting for anyone who supports public education,\u201d said Jamie Woodward, a curriculum coordinator from Cottonwood, Ariz. \u201cWe have impoverished teachers living in camper trailers.\u201d Ms. Woodward, 40, was a registered Republican for 17 years, she said, but recently became an independent.Teachers and their supporters began gathering on Thursday morning around Chase Field, a baseball stadium in Phoenix. From there, they marched to the Capitol to hold a rally calling for restoring education funding to pre-Recession levels, raising their pay, and halting tax cuts until per-pupil funding reaches the national average.The march unfolded peacefully, with many teachers walking with their children and other supporters; nearly everyone was wearing the red shirts symbolizing their movement. Their signs read: \u201cThis Republican family supports #RedforEd,\u201d \u201cHistory is Watching,\u201d and \u201cArizona\u2019s top exports: Citrus, Copper, Teachers.\u201dMuch of the protesters\u2019 ire was directed at Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, who has resisted demands to end tax cuts to bolster public education spending. Teachers pressed ahead with the walkout despite a promise by the governor to increase their salaries 20 percent by 2020. Betting that a growing economy will bolster revenue, Mr. Ducey said he could provide the raises and reinforce school budgets without tax increases, a proposal that many teachers and lawmakers doubted.\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a political issue but a moral issue as well,\u201d said Patience Sharp, 43, a writing teacher at a public middle school in Phoenix. Ms. Sharp, who has three children, said she earned about $40,000 a year and had filed for bankruptcy protection two weeks ago.\u201cMy 17-year-old daughter recently told me she also wants to be a teacher,\u201d Ms. Sharp said. \u201cAnd I just cried.\u201dJoe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, said that the starting salary for teachers in Arizona was about $35,000, which for many in the profession made paying off student loans or starting a family difficult. The organizers of the walkout, Mr. Thomas said, sought to show political leaders how much educators were hurting financially in Arizona, where Republicans control the State Legislature and years of tax cuts have drained education budgets.\u201cA teaching certification used to secure landing in the middle class,\u201d Mr. Thomas added. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case anymore in Arizona, and we need to do something about it now.\u201dIt remains to be seen how Arizona\u2019s leaders will respond to the teachers\u2019 movement, and how long it could last. Teachers in Oklahoma picketed the Capitol for nine days, calling for funding that largely did not materialize, though they did get a $6,000 raise. The statewide teachers\u2019 strike in West Virginia shut down schools for almost two weeks.Anna Petersen, a special-education teacher from suburban Denver, was once a staunch Republican who attended Tea Party rallies and other conservative events. But Ms. Petersen, 28, said her experiences in the classroom in Jefferson County, west of Denver, had helped nudge her political leanings away from the Republican Party.She spoke of living on take-home pay of about $24,000 a year, furnishing classrooms and failing to persuade her school to provide $300 for new calculators for students.\u201cI make less than kids at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Petersen said. \u201cI have a bachelor\u2019s degree and I\u2019m halfway through my master\u2019s.\u201dColorado, which has a Democratic governor and voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, is more socially liberal than West Virginia, Oklahoma and other Republican-dominated states where teacher protests have erupted. But the state has a long anti-tax history. Voters enshrined strict limits on taxes and spending in the State Constitution in the 1990s, and four years ago, they roundly rejected a $1 billion proposal to raise income taxes to pay for all-day kindergarten and other education priorities.On Thursday, as protesters waved signs declaring that \u201cTeachers Make America Great!\u201d and marched around the Capitol, some said they hoped the teachers\u2019 movement would chip away at that history of fiscal austerity.Stephanie Pierce, the parent of a third grader, a preschooler and a high school sophomore, did not vote when the $1 billion education bill came on the ballot in 2013. Because Colorado does not fund full-day kindergarten, Ms. Pierce said her family will have to pay $310 a month for her son to attend kindergarten next year. As she stood on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday, she said she now saw school funding as a top political priority.\u201cI don\u2019t have specific political beliefs, but I do know the teachers need more,\u201d she said.Colorado\u2019s economy is booming, but the state teachers\u2019 union, the Colorado Education Association, says the state has shorted the education system $6.6 billion since 2009.\u201cWe are collectively fed up after years of doing more with less and being promised it will get better in the future,\u201d Ms. Dallman said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait anymore. The students in Colorado can\u2019t afford to wait any longer.\u201dSimon Romero reported from Phoenix, and Jack Healy and Julie Turkewitz from Denver.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vladimir Putin, the Most Influential Man in the World", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistWho is the most influential human being on the planet? My vote goes to Vladimir Putin.Putin has established himself as one pole in the great global debate of the era, the debate between authoritarianism and democracy. He has a coherent strategy to promote his authoritarian side of that debate. He\u2019s able to humiliate and disrupt his democratic rivals at will and get away with it. He\u2019s become a cultural hero to populist conservatives everywhere \u2014 in France, Italy, the Philippines and the Oval Office.People are always saying that Putin is merely good at playing a weak hand. Everybody expects him to ultimately falter because Russia\u2019s economy is so creaky. But his hand isn\u2019t that weak. That\u2019s because his power base is not economic; it\u2019s cultural and ideological.Social catastrophe followed. Russia\u2019s average life expectancy fell below that of Bangladesh. The government went bankrupt. Members of the old Communist nomenklatura plundered the nation\u2019s resources. Successive American administrations humiliated Russia on the world stage.Moreover, in the years ahead Putinist authoritarians will have several key advantages in the war of ideas.In the first place, liberal democracy is built on the idea that power should be dispersed across a system of relationships and institutions.Putin stands for the idea that authority should be centralized, with one leader at the top and iron lines of authority flowing downward. He stands for the idea that liberal democracy descends into chaos when there is no social trust, that it is a fraud that allows the well-connected to plunder everyone else.In times of anxiety and distrust, it\u2019s much easier to argue for clear centralized authority than dispersed, amorphous authority.Second, liberal democracy\u2019s ultimate loyalty is to an abstraction \u2014 to a constitution, a creed and a set of democratic norms. We in the democratic camp are always alarmed when we see a Putin or a Donald Trump or a Xi Jinping trashing norms to amass personal power.In times of anxiety and distrust, it\u2019s much easier to rally people around a person than an abstraction.Third, liberal democracy is built on a faith, a faith in the capacities of individual citizens. Faith, as you know, is confidence in things hoped for and evidence of things not seen. We democrats put faith in the idea that people know best how to run their own lives and that these individual choices can be woven into a common fabric.Putinism, like Trumpism, is based on a cynicism. It\u2019s based on the idea that one should have no illusions, be wise to the ways of the world. People are, as Machiavelli put it, ungrateful and deceitful, timid of danger and avid for profit. Rivalry is inevitable. Everything is partisan. Anybody or any institution that claims to be objective and above the fray is a liar.In this world, everything is public relations, and the more shameless the charade the better because people will believe whatever is in their interest to believe.In times of anxiety and distrust, it\u2019s much easier to sell cynicism than idealism.Finally, liberal democracy is built on the idea that people who are nothing like you are still worthy of respect and attention, that politics is about striking compromises with people you can barely stand to be in the same room with.Putinism is based on the idea that people who are unlike you are sowing cultural chaos; they are undermining your way of life. Putin is continually railing against gays, Muslims, atheists, the \u201cinfertile and genderless\u201d West.In times of anxiety and distrust, it\u2019s a lot easier to sell us/them distinctions than tolerance for cultural diversity.In short, never underestimate this man or his cause. All over the world political regimes are adjusting, becoming either a little more authoritarian or a little more democratic. Right now, the momentum is clearly in the authoritarian direction. That\u2019s in part because that side has a brilliant and reckless figure at its head. It\u2019s also because when you pause to ask who is the global leader of the liberal democratic camp, you come up with no name at all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Leads a \u2018War\u2019 on California, Who Will Lead California?", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 At a moment of extraordinary tension between California and President Trump, this state is moving to elect a governor in a changing of the guard that will test its outsize power as a national leader for Democrats in its fight against the White House.Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat retiring after nearly half a century in public life, has been at the forefront of the fight, particularly on climate change. No one in the crowded field of candidates seeking to replace him enjoys Mr. Brown\u2019s level of national prominence; it remains to be seen if any has the political skills Mr. Brown has honed over his long career to take on this kind of complicated battle.The contest is taking place against a backdrop of escalating hostilities, signaling what will most likely be years of legal and political fights between the Trump White House and California. On Monday alone, the administration moved to roll back California\u2019s landmark auto emissions reduction program and challenged a state law intended to curb the sale of federal lands.As has become increasingly clear in recent days, Mr. Brown\u2019s successor will face a thicket of high-stakes challenges. The federal government is suing to overturn so-called sanctuary laws in California intended to hamper federal immigration officials. It has moved to permit offshore drilling in states including California.For his part, Mr. Brown said Washington was \u201cbasically going to war against the state of California.\u201dPolls suggest that the two leading contenders to succeed Mr. Brown are Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and a former mayor of San Francisco, and Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the former two-term mayor of Los Angeles and Assembly speaker, both Democrats. The two are known as effective public speakers with extensive political experience that could prove important in navigating the fight against Washington.Of the two, Mr. Newsom has assumed the more aggressive stance in taking on the Trump administration, drawing strong support from liberal Democrats in the process. He has also called for the impeachment of Mr. Trump. A centerpiece of his campaign is a pledge to adopt a government-run, single-payer health care system, a direct challenge to the free-market vision embraced by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans.\u201cThis is more than a political campaign,\u201d Mr. Newsom told cheering delegates at the state Democratic convention here this year. \u201cIt\u2019s about Democrats acting like Democrats in a battle for America\u2019s soul against a president without one.\u201d\u201cSome of the defeatist Democrats are saying we just want to defend against the status quo,\u201d he told another audience that day. \u201cHow can you just defend against the status quo? We need to do more than just push back against their agenda to wreak more havoc.\u201dMr. Villaraigosa has struck a more restrained note, saying it was too early to talk about impeachment and dismissing Mr. Newsom\u2019s promise to have California go it alone with its own health care system as a \u201cpie in the sky\u201d promise he was making to ride anti-Trump sentiment. In tone, Mr. Villaraigosa is closer to Mr. Brown in positioning himself against the president.\u201cGavin likes to talk about the resistance \u2014 I don\u2019t use that word,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said over green tea during a break from campaigning in downtown Los Angeles. \u201cI tell people the best way to resist is not to text and tweet, scream and yell at Donald Trump. The best way to resist is for us to chart a different path here in this state.\u201d\u201cWe are going to push back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of our attention, most of our efforts need to be focused on improving the human condition here.\u201dRobert Shrum, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, said the divisions on health care and impeachment reflected discussions Democrats were having nationally as they debated the best way to defeat Mr. Trump. Mr. Villaraigosa\u2019s stance reflects the calculation that while California is overwhelmingly Democratic in its voting habits, many voters are independent by registration, and thus might be less receptive to an overly confrontational position against Mr. Trump.\u201cNewsom is endorsing all of those things on the Democratic wish list,\u201d Mr. Shrum said. \u201cVillaraigosa is saying, \u2018I like those things, but we actually can\u2019t do them.\u2019\u201cOne position speaks to the anger in the base,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other speaks to what I think Democratic leadership in Congress prefers.\u201dUnder California\u2019s election system, 27 candidates will appear on a primary ballot on June 5, regardless of party. A runoff in November will be held between the top two finishers.And Delaine Eastin, a Democrat and the former state superintendent of public education, has drawn vocal support from the left with her own call for single-payer health care and the impeachment of Mr. Trump.If the November election ends up being between Mr. Villaraigosa and Mr. Newsom, it will be a classic north-versus-south contest. Candidates from Northern California tend to win those, because of heavier turnout in the Bay Area; Mr. Newsom enjoys a big advantage in fund-raising and leads in most statewide polls.But Mr. Villaraigosa would be the first Latino governor elected in modern times. He is running when the ever-growing Latino community accounts for nearly 40 percent of the population and when California is battling with the administration over restrictive immigration policies.Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, and his pledge to continue doing so, mean that health care will most likely be another challenge for the next governor, whether or not California carries out single-payer.\u201cIf our health care system is thrown into absolute chaos because of what happens in Washington, the voters in California are going to expect the Democrats who control California to deal with it,\u201d said Garry South, a longtime Democratic consultant who advises the nurses\u2019 union.If Mr. Newsom won and made good on that campaign promise, he would open a up a whole new area of contention with Mr. Trump. Single-payer health care is likely to require waivers from the Trump administration in order to apply Medicare payments to financing a potentially $400 billion program, along with substantial tax increases.Mr. Villaraigosa, 65, said he supported the concept of single-payer health care, but dismissed Mr. Newsom\u2019s promise as unrealistic.\u201cHe\u2019s arguing with bold leadership we\u2019re going to do it \u2014 even though he knows you need Trump\u2019s waivers to do it,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said. \u201cThey are not going to give us the waivers for that. Think about this: You ready to double your taxes? Nobody is going to do that. Everyone is for it until they realize \u2014 whoa. The cost. \u201dMr. Chiang said he, too, supported a state health care system. \u201cI just think Gavin Newsom should be forthcoming on how they are going to pay for it,\u201d he said.Mr. Newsom dismissed his critics as \u201cdefeatist Democrats.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a jaw-dropping thing: to say you support something but it can\u2019t be done,\u201d Mr. Newsom said in an interview a few blocks from his office in Sacramento. \u201cWho the hell is interested in \u2018it can\u2019t be done\u2019? We wouldn\u2019t have marriage equality if I had listened to \u2018it can\u2019t be done.\u2019\u201dAsked what his plan was to pay for it, Mr. Newsom responded: \u201cThe one that works is the one I support. I\u2019m not an ideologue.\u201dStill, the biggest question may well be whether anyone will be able to replace Mr. Brown as California\u2019s counterpoint to Mr. Trump \u2014 and whether the state\u2019s stature as a national leader in this fight will diminish when Mr. Brown retires to his ranch next January.\u201cCalifornia is usually the leading edge,\u201d said Ms. Eastin, one of the Democrats seeking to replace him. \u201cIt\u2019s the sixth-largest economy in the world. I think California will get attention.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Question for Markets: Is There a Kudlow or Powell \u2018Put\u2019? ", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors are looking for evidence that the White House economic adviser or Federal Reserve chairman can act as an insurance policy against a trade war.These are unsettled times in financial markets.Stock prices rose or fell by more than 1 percent in four of five days last week, and if anything those closing numbers masked even larger swings within each trading session. A common measure of expected stock market volatility is about to double its level from early January.The proximate cause is pretty obvious: President Trump is threatening a trade war with China and perhaps other trading partners. But beneath those daily headlines are two more fundamental questions: Is there a Kudlow Put? And is there a Powell Put?More specifically, will the White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow (and his free-trader allies within the administration) be able to rein in the Trump administration\u2019s trade stance if markets keep falling? And will the Federal Reserve\u2019s chairman, Jerome Powell, be ready to take action, such as by delaying interest rate increases or even cutting rates, if markets tumble further?A \u201cput\u201d is an option contract that offers its buyer protection against losses. If you own a stock worth $100 and buy a put with a strike price of $80, you are ensuring the ability to sell for that price if you wish, so you can\u2019t lose more than 20 percent of your money.Back in the 1990s, traders started referring to the \u201cGreenspan Put,\u201d the notion that the stock market as a whole had the equivalent of a giant put option in the form of the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan. Amid an emerging markets debt crisis in 1998, the Fed cut interest rates to try to guard the United States against economic fallout, which helped the stock market gain a whopping 29 percent that year despite the global troubles.This notion that the Fed is always ready to act when the stock markets start to dip has almost become a piece of conventional wisdom in market circles over the years \u2014 often said with a bit of snark and implicit criticism of the Fed for supposedly bailing out investors whenever the going gets tough. Fed officials themselves hate the idea, and argue that they\u2019re looking out for the economy, not markets.Nonetheless, in the popular discourse the Greenspan Put gave way to the (Ben) Bernanke Put, and to the (Janet) Yellen Put, as Mr. Greenspan\u2019s successors engaged in multiple rounds of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d in recent years.Which brings us to the 2018 equivalents.Early last week, the stock market was losing ground as the Trump administration rolled out plans for punitive tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports, and the Chinese government said it would retaliate with comparable tariffs on American goods.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index ended that day up 1.2 percent.But the question is whether that dynamic is changing, with the departure of more internationalist voices within the administration like Mr. Kudlow\u2019s predecessor, Gary Cohn, and the former secretary of state Rex Tillerson.Then there is Mr. Powell, who is in his second month as Federal Reserve chairman. He delivered a speech Friday that threw into doubt whether the Powell Put exists \u2014 at least with respect to potential economic disruption from a trade war.He mentioned that business contacts had told Fed officials they were worried that trade tensions could spill into broader economic distress. But he did not go the next step of giving any hint that this might lead the Fed to reconsider its plans to raise interest rates gradually in the year ahead.There\u2019s good reason for that. If the trade skirmish escalates into a trade war, it will harm economic growth, but it will also be inflationary. Prices would rise for American consumers in the near term because of the new tariffs, and would rise in the medium term as production of goods moved to less economically advantageous locations.It is an economic problem that the Fed\u2019s tools would be particularly ill suited to solve; the Fed can help address weak demand in the economy but can\u2019t do much about a negative supply shock, which is what a trade war would be.So it\u2019s understandable that Mr. Powell would be quiet on the subject, and disinclined to float the possibility that Fed interest rate policy could or would prevent damage from a trade war. But if things continue to escalate, expect markets to hang on his every word even more in search of evidence that the Powell Put is real.The way to think of fluctuations in the stock market, both last week and in the months ahead, is as a continuing effort to determine whether the Kudlow Put and the Powell Put exist, and if so, how powerful they may be.But given President Trump\u2019s newfound willingness to chart his own aggressive path on trade policy, and the limits of the Fed\u2019s tools in the event of a trade war, these may not be options contracts you want to rely on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Slaps Tariffs on 128 U.S. Products, Including Wine, Pork and Pipes", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese government hit back Monday at President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum by acting on a threat to put tariffs as high as 25 percent on imports of 128 American-made products, including pork and seamless steel pipes.The Chinese retaliation was no surprise. But Beijing appeared to go a step beyond its initial threat last month to counter the United States\u2019 tariffs on steel and aluminum.But the latest announcement said the tariffs taking effect on Monday covered all 128 products, including the 25 percent charge on pork.The ministry said it had Chinese public opinion on its side after asking for views about the trade measures. Over recent weeks, China\u2019s state-run news media has condemned the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist steps and presented China as the innocent defender of open trade. In fact, China imposes relatively high barriers on many imports and on foreign investment in many sectors.\u201cMany members of the public voiced their support for the measures and the product list through telephone calls, emails and other means,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cAfter an assessment, it was decided to implement the measures described on 128 products imported from the United States.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on $60 billion worth of other Chinese-made products are likely to prompt more retaliation from China, which could single out more valuable American exports such as soybeans and hurt Apple and other companies that rely heavily on Chinese consumers.But Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has been visiting Beijing, said on Saturday that Chinese officials she met, including Mr. Liu, \u201chave not deviated from their talking points\u201d about the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs.\u201cAmerica is waking up to the loss of its technological advantage through China\u2019s restrictions on access to its internal markets,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThat is now a place where policy is beginning to change.\u201dSteven Lee Myers contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sprint and T-Mobile Try Again, but Antitrust Hurdles Remain the Same", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookSeveral years ago, Sprint\u2019s largest shareholder, SoftBank, quietly approached two of the nation\u2019s top regulators with a question: If Sprint were to merge with T-Mobile, would the government approve it?The answer was an emphatic no.No matter how much hyperbole Sprint and T-Mobile expend trying to sell the deal, it is hard to see how this merger won\u2019t turn into a battle with regulators. The transaction would reduce the number of wireless carriers from four to three and, importantly, eliminate competition from Sprint, which has held prices down across the industry by operating as the lowest-cost carrier. To some analysts and market experts, it is a textbook example of a merger that would normally be blocked.Just look at the share prices of AT&T and Verizon after the deal was announced: They hardly moved. If investors truly believed that a combined T-Mobile-Sprint would be a competitive threat and drive down prices, shares in AT&T and Verizon would have fallen significantly.Of course, Sprint and T-Mobile are doing everything they can to shape the narrative and suggest that the marketplace is much larger.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a case of going from four to three wireless companies \u2014 there are now at least seven or eight big competitors in this converging market,\u201d John Legere, T-Mobile\u2019s chief executive, who would become the combined company\u2019s leader, said in a statement. He said that the industry is in a mash-up with cable players like Charter and Comcast that are trying to get into wireless, and that AT&T is now the largest TV provider in the country.It is true that the wireless and cable industries are likely to continue to transform over the next decade, but it is far from clear how the market will be divided. The efforts by the cable companies to get into the wireless game are nascent and, at least so far, unproved.For better or worse, regulators generally make their assessments based on the current marketplace; they are not prophets.Part of T-Mobile-Sprint\u2019s argument is that the combined company could rapidly deploy the next generation of wireless technology, known as 5G, and that its progress in that area would force AT&T and Verizon to move faster.\u201cOnly the combined company will have the network capacity required to quickly create a broad and deep 5G nationwide network in the critical first years of the 5G innovation cycle \u2014 the years that will determine if American firms lead or follow in the 5G digital economy,\u201d the companies said in a statement.They also suggest, perhaps trying to align themselves with President Trump\u2019s jobs agenda, that the merger would create more, not fewer, jobs.But many analysts are not convinced.\u201cI don\u2019t think that is credible,\u201d Craig Moffett, a veteran telecommunications analyst from the firm MoffettNathanson, said of the claim about jobs. \u201cAnd AT&T and Verizon are going to do 5G anyway.\u201dMr. Moffett said he put 50-50 odds on the deal\u2019s being approved. \u201cIt comes down to whether the D.O.J. decides to use the traditional lens of consumer welfare as measured by consumer prices,\u201d he said, \u201cor whether they use an unconventional lens about access to new technologies.\u201dHe speculated that Sprint could privately take a different approach with regulators behind closed doors, arguing that it \u201cis a failing firm absent this merger and that there is no real path to sustainability without T-Mobile.\u201dThat might generate some sympathy from regulators given the hemorrhaging of cash at Sprint and the additional funds it will need to build out a 5G network. But if history is any guide, it wouldn\u2019t help the deal\u2019s chances of being approved.Back in 2011, AT&T tried to buy T-Mobile, and one of the arguments for the deal then was that T-Mobile needed a lifeline. The government blocked the merger.\u201cT-Mobile has not just survived but thrived,\u201d Mr. Moffett said, noting that regulators \u201care still taking victory laps\u201d for the competition that ensued after it blocked that transaction.Even if Sprint were to fall into bankruptcy several years from now, it isn\u2019t as if it would disappear. It would most likely go through a restructuring and would probably be snatched up by a cable operator, creating even more competition.Would it be fair for Sprint to have to go it alone? Maybe not. The company is clearly the laggard in the industry and desperately needs to gain scale. But our antitrust laws were not created simply to help struggling companies; they were constructed, ultimately, to benefit customers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Craft Distillers, Facing Lower Taxes, Invest in Themselves", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySmall craft distillers across the country have been on a spending spree since the turn of the new year.The reason for all the spending isn\u2019t a sales spurt or newly opened markets. It\u2019s the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, an amendment that quietly found its way into the omnibus tax bill that President Trump signed into law in December. The measure lowers the federal excise tax that producers pay to $2.70 per proof gallon (a gallon of spirits that is 50 percent alcohol), from $13.50, for the first 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits produced or imported annually.That\u2019s a reduction of 80 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s a windfall for every single distiller,\u201d said Lance Winters, master distiller of St. George Spirits.But the tax cut is having its biggest impact with small craft distillers, most of which turn out less than 100,000 gallons a year and struggle to compete with larger companies. And it is evidence of their growing political clout as distilling becomes a significant source of jobs and tax revenue in every state.The backing for the move attested to that geographical and political reach. By the time the amendment \u2014 introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers from Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon and Wisconsin \u2014 was adopted in a final version by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, it had collected 304 co-sponsors in the House and 56 in the Senate.The victory was not achieved without a great deal of legwork. Dozens of distillers joined in a multiyear effort to win over Congress members to the idea. The Distilled Spirits Council estimated it organized thousands of visits to the Hill.\u201cWe encouraged our members small and large to invite their local officials at all levels of government to take a tour,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cMany have done so, in the process learning about how spirits are made, how they fit into the agricultural economy.\u201dIn two visits to Washington, Christian Krogstad, the founder of House Spirits, spoke with several lawmakers during appointments and what he called \u201cdrop-ins.\u201d\u201cI was surprised by how accessible senators and congressmen are,\u201d he said.The bill brings federal taxes on spirits into line with those for the wine and beer businesses, which won similar reductions. To achieve that, the three industries \u2014 normally rivals \u2014 combined their lobbying forces.\u201cThis was an unprecedented collaboration by spirits, wine and beer producers,\u201d said Mark Gorman, a senior vice president of the Distilled Spirits Council.Allen Katz, a founder, wanted to get Perry\u2019s Tot, its \u201cNavy strength\u201d gin, into more bars and consumers\u2019 homes. The tax cut allowed him to reduce the wholesale price, per bottle, to $18 from $29. With by-the-case discounts, the wholesale price drops further, to $14, and some merchants have cut retail prices to as low as $23.\u201cI would say the reaction from our industry peers has been jaw-dropping,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201c \u2018You\u2019re offering it at what price?\u2019 \u201d In March, sales of Perry\u2019s Tot doubled. (The company has also hired its first full-time salesman.)The excise-tax break for spirits is set to expire after two years. Because it may not be renewed, few distillers have gone so far as to lower prices. \u201cI think that\u2019s reckless,\u201d Mr. Winters said. \u201cIf the tax break goes away, than the price break goes away.\u201dMr. Katz doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cThe driving force will be increased sales,\u201d he said, \u201cand from that revenue, we will further invest in equipment and other aspects in our business.\u201dThere is a chance, however, that the break will be made permanent. In May, the lobbying campaign will begin anew, with distillers flooding Capitol Hill once more.\u201cWe\u2019re going to go to D.C. to show them all the good stuff we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Paul Hletko, the founder of Few Spirits.Advertisement"}

I also joined a 5-kilometer night run in full abaya with Riyadh Urban Runners, the city\u2019s first female running club, to encouraging cheers from passers-by. I visited Sama\u2019s Creative Hub, an art gallery and store focused on drawing together local creatives via art and design lessons and Saudi artist exhibitions. And I ate a traditional Saudi meal of jeerish and saleeg, best described as variations on savory rice pudding, with pickled lemons and slow-cooked meats, as part of a mixed-gender lunch on Al Bujairi Square with Prince Saud bin Sultan, who spoke with hopeful enthusiasm on the impending issue of tourist visas, a step that might finally open up a country whose borders have long been impenetrable to much of the outside world.\u201cThere is so much to see in Saudi Arabia, so much to explore, but few foreigners have been able to visit here beyond Muslims headed to Mecca on pilgrimage.

Although the fashion week proved somewhat chaotic, the sense of delight and achievement was plain.But toward the end of the assignment I also had to read between the lines.

Bush, for the Fed\u2019s second-ranking job.Mr. Clarida, a Columbia University economist, is a scholar in monetary policy whose expertise would complement the background of the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, who is not an academically trained economist.The Fed\u2019s seven-seat Board of Governors is currently functioning with three members, and the vacancies give Mr. Trump the opportunity to put his own stamp on monetary policy.His nomination won quick applause from Fed watchers and some economists, who cast him as a serious thinker unlikely to radically pull the central bank away from its gradual approach to raising interest rates as the economy continues to heal from the financial crisis.\u201cRich Clarida is an outstanding monetary economist whose knowledge of monetary policy and international finance will add greatly to the Fed in this most interesting time,\u201d said R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia\u2019s business school and a former chairman of the second President Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIn addition, Rich\u2019s knowledge of and experience in financial markets will make him a valuable colleague for Chairman Powell.\u201dTim Duy, a University of Oregon economist and the writer of the Fed Watch blog, said in an email that Mr. Clarida was \u201ca solid pick \u2014 a respected academic economist plus market experience via Pimco plus government experience.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think every position needs to be filled by a trained macroeconomist, but given the nature of the job, I think there needs to be a heavy dominance of trained macroeconomists,\u201d Mr. Duy said. \u201cI think he fits within the current consensus as well so, like the elevation of Williams, represents largely a maintenance of the status quo, at least for now.\u201dTony Fratto, a former colleague of Mr. Clarida\u2019s at the Treasury Department, said the nominee\u2019s positions were always driven by data.\u201cHe\u2019s a traditional conservative Republican economist,\u201d Mr. Fratto said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find a lot of controversial positions from him. You\u2019re not going to find him saying things that are particularly ideological. He\u2019s just a strong policy guy.\u201dOne thing his nomination will not do is bring diversity to the Fed\u2019s leadership team, which is all-male and all-white \u2014 a complaint liberal groups made about the New York Fed\u2019s selection of Mr. Williams. But the reaction to Mr. Clarida\u2019s selection among Fed critics was reserved.\u201cLike all nominees, Clarida should be vetted thoroughly for his commitment to the full-employment mandate and to regulating banks to avoid another financial crash,\u201d said Shawn Sebastian, the director of the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of labor and other liberal groups that have pushed the Fed to keep interest rates low to aid job creation.Like Mr. Clarida, Ms. Bowman is a veteran of the second Bush administration, where she worked for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Before returning to her native Kansas in 2010, she led a government and public affairs consulting company in London.Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said he looked forward to hearing more from the nominees, but suggested that he would want assurances that neither would participate in the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of financial regulations established after the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cI hope Mr. Clarida and Ms. Bowman don\u2019t have the same collective amnesia that plagues many in this administration,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don Blankenship Is a West Virginia Senate Candidate. He Lives in Nevada.", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKEYSER, W.Va. \u2014 Don Blankenship is running for the United States Senate as a proud West Virginian with Appalachian roots, but his primary residence is a $2.4 million villa with palm trees and an infinity pool near Las Vegas.Mr. Blankenship, a Republican loyalist of President Trump, is running an America First-style campaign and calls himself an \u201cAmerican competitionist,\u201d but he admires China\u2019s state-controlled economy and has expressed interest in gaining Chinese citizenship.The former coal mining executive is widely known for spending a year in prison for his role in a mining explosion that claimed 29 lives. Yet ahead of the May 8 primary election, he is running as a champion of miners and has bought TV ads that challenge settled facts about his role in the disaster.And even as Mr. Blankenship seeks to join the Republican majority in Washington, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d linked to the party establishment is attacking him as a \u201cconvicted criminal\u201d and a hypocrite.He is one of three leading Republican contenders heading into the primary, even though he is lugging around enough political baggage to disqualify a candidate most anywhere else.That Mr. Blankenship retains a political hope is a consequence of West Virginia\u2019s sharp shift to the right, driven by seething hostility to the Obama presidency, both its social changes and its perceived \u201cwar\u201d on coal. The emergence of a former coal boss with a criminal record as a potential Senate nominee seems partly an expression of many West Virginia voters\u2019 desire to poke a thumb in the eye of the Washington establishment, Republicans very much included.Mr. Blankenship offers no apology for his many contradictions and personal and business decisions, some of them previously undisclosed. Though he lives a baronial lifestyle thanks to a fortune built on coal scratched from West Virginia\u2019s mountains, he says the size and origins of his wealth are no one\u2019s business. He is the only candidate in either party in the Senate race who has not disclosed his personal finances as required by law to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. There isn\u2019t \u201cmuch of a penalty\u201d for flouting the law, he explained in an interview, justifying his refusal.\u201cI don\u2019t personally think anybody should have to disclose private information,\u201d he said while awaiting the start of a \u201cmeet the candidates\u201d event last week in Cabin Creek, W.Va.National Republican leaders are alarmed that Mr. Blankenship could emerge as the winner of the primary, which they fear would cost them a winnable seat in November against Senator Joe Manchin, a vulnerable Democrat.\u201cI read in books that people think he\u2019s soft on China,\u201d he said of Mr. McConnell.Family members of the 29 Upper Big Branch victims said it was crushing to watch those ads, in which Mr. Blankenship portrays himself as a champion of safety and refuses responsibility for the loss of life.\u201cI want Mr. Blankenship to say he\u2019s sorry, I want him to feel contrition, I want him to feel compassion,\u201d said Dr. Judy Jones Petersen, whose brother Dean Jones died in the explosion. \u201cPeople have to understand that Mr. Blankenship is a bad man. Your character doesn\u2019t change.\u201dIn his campaign, Mr. Blankenship positions himself as a West Virginia populist, an \u201cAmerican competitionist\u201d who stands for unfettered capitalism. The heart of the government\u2019s case against him at trial was that he rapaciously sought profit while ignoring mine safety.\u201cI\u2019m actually considering moving to China or somewhere and being more like George Washington if I can get citizenship,\u201d he said. \u201cI can probably get citizenship in India. I\u2019d rather be in China.\u201dIn the interview, he repeated this sentiment and freely discussed his financial history in China, though he said foreign citizenship was no longer a priority for him \u2014 perhaps dual citizenship would be useful, he mused.He expressed admiration for how Beijing exercises central control over its economy.\u201cAmericans confuse the words communism and dictatorship,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese are running a dictatorial capitalism and it\u2019s very effective. That\u2019s the way corporations are run. Corporations are not a democracy.\u201dBefore his foreign travel was restricted after his arrest in 2014, Mr. Blankenship was a frequent enough visitor to China that he opened a bank account there. \u201cWhen I go over there I don\u2019t have to carry a lot of money with me,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cIf you go over there and you spend some time, you can easily spend a good bit of money.\u201dMs. Hobbs and Mr. Blankenship formed a business together in 2012, Generator World, to import home generators made in China. According to records from Panjiva, which tracks global trade, a shipment of 386 items was sent from Fuzhou, China, the next year to Ms. Hobbs\u2019s company, Amerasia International.\u201cThey arrived and we did sell them, but we didn\u2019t grow the business or continue it,\u201d Mr. Blankenship said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a position to do that.\u201d It was a dry reference to his trial, sentence and one-year parole, which will end the day after the May 8 primary.In the absence of much public polling, the clearest sign that Mr. Blankenship is a threat in the race is the hefty advertising budget of national Republicans who seek to disqualify him with voters.Otherwise, signs of his support can be elusive. He draws sparse crowds to his events, and when he appears at multicandidate gatherings, he shows little knack for political skills. Rather than working a room, he keeps to himself, as he did at the Mineral County Lincoln Day dinner on Friday in Keyser.\u201cI don\u2019t think someone who\u2019s on parole at this moment in time should be running for office,\u201d Jessica Imes, a voter at the dinner, said.Mr. Morrisey, the attorney general, moved easily among the party activists dining on stuffed chicken breast and mashed potatoes beneath a giant stuffed moose head at the local Order of Moose hall. His campaign has spent little time attacking Mr. Blankenship, in the belief that primary voters recognize that Republicans should not run a convicted criminal in the general election.\u201cThe hypocrisy runs deep in this race,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s a Nevada resident. He abandoned West Virginia when we really needed people to stand up to Barack Obama.\u201dAlthough Mr. Blankenship maintained in numerous court proceedings that his principal residence was Nevada, he still owns a home in West Virginia, in Mingo County not far from where he was raised. He said he paid property taxes in West Virginia but not income taxes.There is nothing legally barring him from seeking a Senate seat from the state if he declares a primary residence elsewhere.He scoffed at the notion that voters might regard him as an outsider, even a carpetbagger, because he lives mostly in Nevada.\u201cMany people have two homes,\u201d he said. \u201cMost coal miners now have one in Tennessee and one in West Virginia.\u201dTrip Gabriel reported from West Virginia and Stephanie Saul from New York.

{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Extra! Extra! News Beyond Facebook!", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsIt\u2019s hard to imagine now, but at one point, long ago, Facebook did not monopolize the entire tech news cycle \u2014 a heady and innocent era when you could read an entire day\u2019s news without encountering the words \u201cCambridge Analytica\u201d or \u201cthird-party developers.\u201dI confess that, like many of you, I have been obsessed with the fallout from Facebook\u2019s latest privacy scandal, to the point that I had a stress dream that I overslept and missed covering Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill next week. (Related: I need to get out more, and possibly take up yoga.)But despite the wall-to-wall news of the past few weeks, lots of important things are happening in the tech world that don\u2019t involve Facebook. So let\u2019s run down a few of them?Second, the Google-Pentagon incident is a revealing story about the leverage that Silicon Valley engineers have over their companies. Because the labor market for engineers in the Bay Area is so tight, and because companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain talent, these employees have much more say in how a company like Google governs itself than, say, regulators or outside activists. If an antiwar group protests outside Google\u2019s headquarters, it\u2019s an annoyance. But if 3,000 engineers walk out, it\u2019s a crisis. And as the tech industry goes through its moral reckoning, executives of these companies should bear in mind that their biggest risk isn\u2019t regulation, it\u2019s rebellion from within.It\u2019s a tragic reminder that social platforms aren\u2019t just websites anymore. They\u2019re powerful economies unto themselves, and even seemingly minor policy decisions can alter the lives of millions of people, a few of whom might be disturbed enough to act on their darkest impulses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If the World Economy Is Looking So Great, Why Are Global Policymakers So Gloomy?", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs officials gather for the I.M.F. and World Bank meetings in Washington, worries about trade and debt are on the rise.By a lot of measures, these are very good times for the global economy. Nearly every major region of the planet is enjoying solid growth and prosperity simultaneously for the first time in a decade.\u201cThe present good times will not last for long,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, as he released the fund\u2019s latest projections, which foresee a solid 3.9 percent expansion of the global economy in 2018.The pessimism among policymakers \u2014 who are attending spring meetings of the I.M.F. and World Bank in Washington this week \u2014 contrasts with financial markets. Despite a bumpy couple of months, stocks and most other financial assets are still priced at levels that suggest growth will continue apace for some time to come.\u201cEconomists are paid to worry,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve. \u201cWe\u2019re paid to find problems and challenges. I think the markets, on the other hand, are pretty good at living in the moment.\u201dWhat are these policymakers so worried about? Is this just a bunch of economists living up to their field\u2019s reputation as the dismal science \u2014 or worse, letting their own policy preferences shape their forecasts? Or is the world economy, for all its apparent prosperity, actually in peril?Let\u2019s look at the interrelated threats the economists see.For now, this remains more a theoretical risk than a cause of major disruption to economic expansion.Essentially the Trump administration pattern so far has been to pair belligerent language with comparatively restrained action. Trading partners have worked to find resolutions rather than let a full-scale trade war erupt. There is a tentative deal to renegotiate the United States\u2019 trade agreement with South Korea, for example, and Nafta negotiations are continuing.Global policymakers are worried about more than conflict over trade. They also see an emerging series of financial imbalances and risks that could cause, or worsen, the next downturn.For years, for example, some countries \u2014 Germany, Japan and China prominent among them \u2014 have persistently run current account surpluses, meaning they export more than they import and essentially export capital to the rest of the world. Others, including the United States and Britain, have run persistent current account deficits.Over time, these patterns can create vulnerability to financial shocks; they helped fuel both the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2010 eurozone crisis. And the I.M.F. projects that they will worsen in the next couple of years, despite steady economic growth.The tools to prevent those shifts are within each country\u2019s purview. Germany could spend more on domestic investment, and the United States could reduce its budget deficit, which might start to reduce those imbalances. Neither has much evident political appetite to do so.At the same time, years of efforts by central banks to fuel economic recovery have left interest rates low worldwide and prices in financial markets relatively high.So, for example, if inflation starts to perk up and the world\u2019s central banks raise rates to try to prevent it from taking root, there could be a cascading series of disruptions to financial markets that have become accustomed to cheap money.Another worry: While the major economies look relatively strong right now, they may also prove brittle when the next shock arises.Rather than using this period of stability and prosperity to pay down debts, some major economies are moving in the other direction \u2014 including with rising public debt levels in the United States and high private debt levels in China.\u201cIn the United States, the fiscal impulse is important, but that is something that at some point doesn\u2019t give you any more mileage in terms of growth,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements and former governor of the Bank of Mexico, in an interview Wednesday. \u201cAnd China need to continue improving the quality of growth from the point of view of the dependency on credit.\u201dThat dependency on debt means that whenever the next economic downturn arrives, governments may have less leeway to deal with it by opening the floodgates of public spending.And with interest rates still low across the entire advanced world, one of the normal tools for dealing with a recession still has limited power. For example, the Federal Reserve entered the last downturn with its short-term interest rate at 5.25 percent, before cutting to nearly zero by December 2008. Currently, that target rate is between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent.The European Central Bank has even less room to maneuver, with its policy rates still near zero.In effect, a decade after the financial crisis, if another recession were to arise, both central banks and fiscal authorities may find themselves short of ammunition to fight it. There is surely an anthropological dimension to the kind of worrying that is emerging from conference halls in Washington this week.The people who end up as central bankers or finance ministers or I.M.F. officials tend to worry a lot about what could go wrong. They also tend to place greater value than most on the kinds of international institutions that underpin the global trade system, of which the Trump administration is deeply skeptical.But there\u2019s also no doubt that the largely good economic news of the moment comes with some warnings worth listening to. Even when enjoying sunny weather, it never hurts to know what you\u2019ll do if it starts to rain. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hungary Election Gives Orban Big Majority, and Control of Constitution", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, who has set about transforming this former Soviet bloc member from a vibrant democracy into a semi-autocratic state under one political party\u2019s control, appeared to have won a sweeping victory in national elections on Sunday, with 93 percent of the vote counted.By securing two-thirds of the seats in Parliament, Mr. Orban\u2019s party, Fidesz \u2014 along with its ally, the Christian Democrats \u2014 now has the power to change the Constitution and further bend the nation to his will.\u201cHungary won a big victory,\u201d Mr. Orban told a crowd of supporters gathered on the bank of the Danube just before midnight. He added that there was still \u201ca big fight ahead\u201d but that the parliamentary majority would allow him to continue to protect Hungary.Gabor Vona, the leader of Jobbik, the largest opposition party, conceded defeat while lamenting the tenor of the election, which he called \u201cthe hate campaign.\u201d\u201cIt was not easy to campaign with so many lies and attacks,\u201d Mr. Vona said. \u201cWe failed,\u201d he added. \u201cFidesz will keep ruling the country.\u201dMr. Orban\u2019s victory is likely to embolden other leaders who have used a similar playbook, including those in nearby Poland, where the governing party has openly emulated his tactics.Still, Hungary is a member of the European Union and deeply reliant on the funds the bloc provides, especially for projects like building roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.On Sunday, it was the voters who got their chance to have their say.Under a brilliant blue sky on warm spring day, more than 70 percent of voters flocked to polling stations across Budapest, the grand capital city, with its stately boulevards lined with architectural treasures.Across the country, it was a similar story, with thousands of voters waiting in line hours after the scheduled 7 p.m. end of polling to cast their two ballots \u2014 one for a national list of candidates and one for a local list.Immigration was a major focus of the election, and throughout the day, state television replayed some of the most dramatic images from 2015, when the crisis of refugees and immigrants flooding into Europe from the Middle East and Africa was at its peak.For Attila Boda, 48, an army reservist and dishwasher, the perceived threat to his country was persuasive. He cast his two ballots for Fidesz.\u201cWe don\u2019t want migrants to come to Hungary,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are unwilling to integrate and they respect only their own laws. They want a war; they are brought to Europe by ISIS.\u201dOthers expressed concern over the long-term consequences of Sunday\u2019s vote.Istvan Hegedus, the chairman of the Hungarian Europe Society, a research institute, was an early member of Fidesz, at a time when Mr. Orban was a firebrand champion of democracy after three decades of Communist rule.\u201cAt each step on this path, the European politicians have proven ineffective,\u201d Mr. Hegedus said. \u201cI think the mistake they made was they viewed him as an enfant terrible, but someone they could deal with. They convinced themselves that we know this man and that there is really nothing at stake.\u201dSunday\u2019s election, he said, was the best \u2014 and perhaps, last \u2014 chance for Hungary to change course.\u201cThe whole institutional system is swayed to one party,\u201d Mr. Martin said. From the state-controlled news media to the gerrymandering of electoral districts to favor Fidesz, an already fragmented opposition found it hard to compete, he said.The rest are filled by the winners of local elections. This is where Fidesz holds the strongest advantage. In the 2014 election, Fidesz candidates were often able to win with as little as 40 percent of the vote because the opposition was split.Nonetheless, in the closing days of this campaign, a grass-roots effort arose to promote \u201cstrategic voting.\u201dUsing websites to help voters figure out which candidate had the best chance to defeat Fidesz, voters were encouraged to put their political loyalties aside to defeat the governing party.Gergely Karacsony, the mayor of a district in Budapest and a leading opposition contender for prime minister, was placed at the head of an alliance between two left-wing groups \u2014 the Socialist Party and a Green party \u2014 in a partnership based more on need than political affinity.Mr. Karacsony said that Mr. Orban had already largely \u201cdestroyed the constitutional order\u201d and, in an interview before the election, he said he feared what an Orban victory would mean for the country.Mr. Orban has cast himself as the only person capable of defending Hungary from threats seen and unseen. He has also tapped nationalistic sentiments by portraying officials in Brussels as meddling bureaucrats who are a threat to Hungary\u2019s sovereignty.As the election neared, his already caustic rhetoric took an even darker turn, vowing revenge on political enemies and demonizing immigrants.\u201cWe do not want to be a multicolored country,\u201d he said during a speech in February. If his point was not clear enough, he said that he did not want Hungarians to interact with immigrants \u201cin such a way that our color is mixed with others\u2019 colors.\u201d\u201cThe security state is back and fundamental freedoms are in retreat in every region of the world,\u201d Mr. Hussein said in a statement. \u201cShame is also in retreat. Xenophobes and racists in Europe are casting off any sense of embarrassment \u2014 like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban.\u201dMs. Zgut said that Mr. Orban\u2019s attacks on Mr. Soros, and on the European Union and the United Nations, served a dual purpose: to channel the frustration of anti-establishment voters toward leaders in Brussels and to drive home his contention that migration is the driving factor behind Western accusations that his government was weakening the rule of law even as corruption spreads.\u201cIf he portrays Brussels and the E.U. as the enemy of the state, his voters might consider the E.U.\u2019s criticisms of the government as part of a broader conspiracy that questions the sovereign decisions of Hungarians,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why he keeps repeating that this clash between Brussels and Hungary is all about migration.\u201dIn the weeks leading up to the election, however, it was not concern about the erosion of the rule of law that most galvanized opposition voters. It was corruption, with several high-profile associates and government officials entangled in a variety of scandals involving the alleged looting of state resources.In addition to local press reports, the European Union\u2019s anticorruption agency, OLAF, released a report in January alleging that a company controlled by Mr. Orban\u2019s son-in-law regularly received huge sums of EU development funds.Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesman, dismissed groups like Transparency International as tools of those determined to bring down the government.\u201cCorruption allegations are the only tool the opposition has,\u201d he said.That economic growth, however, did not deter Ilona Kovacs, 73, a retired English teacher, from voting against Mr. Orban.\u201cI don\u2019t like the local candidate I voted for, but I had to, I had no choice,\u201d she said, noting she cast her ballot for the only candidate with a chance of defeating the local Fidesz politician.\u201cI want to stop the corruption,\u201d she said, adding that Mr. Orban\u2019s \u201canti-migrant and anti-Soros speech is unbearable.\u201dAn Orban victory, she feared, would mean that \u201cthey will continue to destroy our democratic institutions, everything will be theirs.\u201d\u201cI had dreamed, that in my old age, there would be better days ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now I feel like my soul is on fire.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article, using information from Reuters, referred incorrectly to the source of a billboard with a stop sign on it. It was erected by the government, not by Fidesz, the prime minister\u2019s party.Helene Bienvenu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Calling Car Pollution Standards \u2018Too High,\u2019 E.P.A. Sets Up Fight With California", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Environmental Protection Agency on Monday took steps to challenge California\u2019s decades-old right to set its own air pollution rules, setting up a showdown between the federal government and a state that has emerged as a bulwark against the Trump administration\u2019s policies.The E.P.A. statement was part of the agency\u2019s widely expected decision to reconsider, and most likely roll back, Obama-era rules requiring automakers to hit ambitious emissions and mileage standards by 2025. The statement, though, was notable for the forcefulness of its language suggesting that the Trump administration would take on California\u2019s authority to set its own rules.Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, signaled that he aimed to make California fall in line. The Obama administration, he said, \u201cmade assumptions about the standards that didn\u2019t comport with reality, and set the standards too high.\u201d California\u2019s history of setting its own emissions rules \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that one state can dictate standards for the rest of the country,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said.A rollback of the rules, which are designed to cut back on emissions of greenhouse gases, would reverse one of the single biggest steps any government has taken to tackle climate change. California has said it will stick with the tougher, Obama-era regulations, a decision that could effectively split the United States into two auto markets: one requiring cars to be more efficient and less polluting than the other.California has long possessed the unique authority under the 1970 Clean Air Act to write its own air pollution rules. Traditionally, a dozen other states follow California\u2019s air pollution rules and together they represent one-third of the nation\u2019s auto market. That puts California in an extraordinary position to stage a regulatory revolt, with much of the country\u2019s car market in tow.State officials indicated they would fight the Trump administration. \u201cThis is a politically motivated effort to weaken clean vehicle standards,\u201d said Mary Nichols, California\u2019s top air pollution regulator. California, she said, \u201cwill vigorously defend the existing clean vehicle standards.\u201dXavier Becerra, the state\u2019s attorney general, said the state was \u201cready to file suit.\u201dAdopted in 2012, the standards up for revision would have required automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks, to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. If fully implemented, the rules would have cut oil consumption by about 12 billion barrels over the lifetime of all the cars affected by the regulations and reduced carbon dioxide pollution by about six billion tons.The E.P.A. on Monday \u2014 announcing its official decision to reverse the rules \u2014 said that those standards were too expensive for automakers to meet and would ultimately hurt car owners by making vehicles costlier. The agency said that low oil prices meant savings at the pump would be less than forecast, and alluded to concerns that expensive fuel-saving technology could come at the cost of investments in auto safety.The E.P.A. did not say how far the rules should be rolled back, only that it would start a new rule-making process to set \u201cmore appropriate\u201d standards.The Trump Administration\u2019s action on Monday marked the latest in a series of tensions between California and the federal government. The E.P.A.\u2019s aim to revise the climate change regulations were announced the same day the Justice Department moved to block a California law that regulates the transfer of federal land.The Justice Department has also filed suit to overturn a California law intended to limit the power of the federal immigration authorities to act against people suspected of being illegal immigrants, and the federal government is seeking to make it easier to drill for oil and gas off the coast of California and other states. Furthermore, the tax overhaul law passed by Congress last year is projected to be particularly damaging for California, because it limits deductions for mortgage interest and state and local taxes, which are particularly high in the state.Mr. Trump recently flew across the country to visit prototypes for a wall he would like to see built between California and Mexico, using the trip to describe California as \u201cout of control.\u201d And over the weekend, Mr. Trump attacked this state\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, in a tweet for pardoning five immigrants facing the threat of deportation.But the fight over auto emissions standards is contentious and unprecedented, said Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law at U.C.L.A. No administration, Democratic or Republican, has challenged California\u2019s waiver under the Clean Air Act to set its own air quality rules.\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d she said. \u201cCalifornia has a long history of leading on auto emissions in a way that has been very productive for the country. California gets out in front and sees if regulations will work before the rest of the country adopts it,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe administration is challenging that.\u201dLeading Democrats condemned the move. \u201cAs usual, the administration sides with big, powerful special interests over the interests of average American families, who will pay the price for lower miles per gallon and dirtier air,\u201d said Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic Leader, in a statement.In its defense of the Obama-era rules, California was joined Monday by a coalition of at least seven state attorneys general, including Eric Schneiderman of New York, as well as more than 30 mayors, who said they would \u201cvigorously resist\u201d any effort by the Trump administration to prevent states and cities from enforcing emissions standards. \u201cWe are committed to using our market power and our regulatory authority to ensure that the vehicle fleets deployed in our jurisdictions fully meet or exceed the promises made by the auto industry in 2012,\u201d the coalition said.If the Trump administration were to seek a permanent revocation of California\u2019s authority to set its own rules, legal scholars say, it would require the Clean Air Act legislation to be amended, which only Congress could do. However, the Trump administration is more likely to revoke the more limited, specific waiver granted to California to set is own tailpipe emissions rules until 2025 \u2014 something it could try to settle in court.Automakers on Monday welcomed the E.P.A.\u2019s move. The Association of Global Automakers, which represents the world\u2019s biggest automakers, \u201cappreciates\u201d the agency\u2019s decision that adjustments to the standards are needed, said John Bozzella, the industry group\u2019s chief executive.It is unclear how the industry would respond to a fractured American auto market if that were the result of the standoff with California. One possibility is that they sell substantially different car designs in the two markets. But they could also decide to adhere to the stricter California standards nationwide, muting the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of federal rules.There have been some signs of discord within the auto industry over the Trump administration\u2019s plans.Mr. Pruitt had been expected to publicly announce the effort on Tuesday at a Chevrolet dealership in suburban Virginia. But those plans were complicated by an angry pushback from some Chevy dealerships who were reluctant to see the brand associated with the announcement, according to two Chevy dealers who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing their relationship with General Motors. Late on Monday, the Virginia dealership, Pohanka Chevrolet in Chantilly, said the E.P.A. event it had planned to host had been canceled.\u201cThey don\u2019t want the E.P.A. to highlight Chevy,\u201d said Adam Lee, chairman of Lee Auto Malls, which runs Nissan, Honda and Chrysler dealerships in Maine, and who said he was familiar with dealers\u2019 thinking. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be the bad guys.\u201d\u201cTrump has been saying these standards are crushing the auto industry. But we\u2019ve had record years for the past four or five years, in terms of sales and profit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt almost makes you think he doesn\u2019t have the facts.\u201dAdam Nagourney in Los Angeles and Katie Benner in Washington contributed reporting.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "The clarion call for businesses to rethink their approaches to protecting customer data is being heeded by the European Union\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation (G.D.P.R.), a set of guidelines that establishes a means for individuals to control their private data. Set to take effect on May 25, 2018, the rules specify data privacy rights, such as the right to have a company forget your data, and the right to export and move personal information from one company to another. Violators face stiff fines \u2014 up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher. \u201cG.D.P.R. is about the change of the culture of processing data,\u201d said Eva Skornickova, a G.D.P.R. compliance consultant based in Prague. \u201cCompanies think all your personal data belongs to them. But it belongs to us as individuals. It is a part of our personal life. We should decide who is going to license our data and what they are going to do with it.\u201dIt may seem to some that the European Union reforms \u2014 and other data privacy protections popping up worldwide \u2014 are yet another regulatory burden for which companies must absorb the cost. But that doesn\u2019t have to be the case. Data privacy compliance can provide a distinct competitive advantage and business opportunity, Skornickova and other experts say.By choosing the right tools to protect customer privacy, companies can reshape their data practices in ways that reap cascading benefits. Compliance provides a way to win customer trust. And tackling inventory and discovery in a strategic manner can improve firms\u2019 agility and efficiency.Customers who understand how their data is being used will reward firms with trust and loyalty.\u201cG.D.P.R. compliance is not about the big, costly exercise,\u201d Skornickova said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your reputation. Microsoft, for instance, is investing heavily to ensure Microsoft 365 and its cloud tools are compliant with G.D.P.R., because this is a huge business advantage. That\u2019s being competitive.\u201dPricewaterhouseCoopers recently surveyed its clients and found that 64 percent plan to deploy Internet of Things-based solutions and 63 percent will roll out advanced predictive analytics over the next year. Data privacy and trust are critical to customers\u2019 acceptance of these new technologies, said Jay Cline, a privacy leader with PwC who helps clients comply with data privacy and security regulations.\u201cIf your predictive analytics is too accurate, if things are predicting my next move too much, the word people use is \u2018creepy,\u2019\u201d Cline said. \u201cIoT includes things like connected cars and smart homes, smart appliances, things that talk to each other. There\u2019s a group of people who think this is cool. They\u2019re going to buy those no matter what. But there are just as many people skeptical of where all this data goes, and they\u2019re concerned and want to know more about how their data is going to be safe.\u201dCustomers also want to know when their data is shared, if it\u2019s retained for an appropriate period of time and that it\u2019s secured throughout its use, Cline said. \u201cConsumers trust that the collection of their data is proportionate to the promise of its use,\u201d he said. Companies that demonstrate value so that customers opt in will have an advantage as technology evolves.In the post-G.D.P.R. world, companies that don\u2019t work to maintain a clear 360-degree view of consumer data will get left behind.In 2016, the Harvard Business Review reported that poor data quality cost the United States economy $3.1 trillion per year, mostly in misspent marketing dollars and wasted staff time. Among British executives surveyed in February 2017, 91 percent described their organization as \u201cplagued with data quality issues.\u201d The same report estimated that British businesses lost 20 percent of customers annually because of poor data.And security is equally important. A survey conducted by independent technology market research specialist Vanson Bourne found that more than three quarters of Americans said they would avoid companies with a number of data breaches. Globally, the average data breach now costs a firm $3.62 million; in the U.S., the figure is over $7 million, according to research by IBM and the Ponemon Institute.Compliance with G.D.P.R. and other data privacy regulations will require most firms to engage in long-overdue data cleansing. Businesses will have to gain a much clearer understanding of the data they collect and its purpose. \u201cThen you have to identify the data which you really don\u2019t need,\u201d Skornickova said. \u201cThe principle of data minimization will be simple, and regulatory authorities will go after that. They want to see you are only processing data you need for the activities you are doing.\u201dG.D.P.R.\u2019s right to be forgotten, for example, elevates the importance of high data quality. Because (with limited exceptions) companies will be required to delete certain personal data on demand of a data subject, they must achieve a clear view of the personal data they process or store on behalf of their customers.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen surveys that indicate one-third of U.K. customers plan to exercise their right to be forgotten as soon as G.D.P.R. goes live in May,\u201d said Cline.Suppose a company has 10 customers named Joe Smith, Cline said.

{"Headline": "Australian Government Acknowledges Immigrants Are Boon to Economy", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe report, first published on Tuesday by Fairfax Media after journalists submitted multiple Freedom of Information requests, concluded that reducing immigration would cost the national budget billions of dollars and reduce job growth.One of every two Australians is an immigrant, or the child of an immigrant. About a quarter of Australia\u2019s population is foreign born, roughly twice the rate of the United States.But immigration is a hotly contested issue, especially as Australia\u2019s cities have been growing rapidly without the infrastructure to match, and the far-right contingent of the Liberal Party has been pushing to reduce immigration levels by tens of thousands of immigrants per year.Here are the four key takeaways from the report.Immigrants help increase the country\u2019s overall gross domestic product, but they also are responsible for increasing the per capita G.D.P.That is to say, immigrants have a net positive impact on the Australian economy because they typically contribute more in tax revenue than the amount they consume in government services.Seventy percent of migrants to Australia are skilled and of working age, a crucial antidote to the country\u2019s aging population.\u201cBy slowing the aging of the population, migration allows the economy and society time to adjust,\u201d the report said.Moreover, the document explains, higher levels of migration are also associated with less spending per person on social services like health care and education.Mr. Abbott said early this year that limiting immigration was necessary because of the country\u2019s \u201cstagnant wages.\u201dThe report, however, found that neither wages nor the unemployment rate was affected by migration.\u201cThis is likely explained by the fact that migrants are generally seen as complements to the Australian-born labor force,\u201d the document said.Australia has had 26 consecutive years of economic growth, and avoided the financial crisis that rattled so many of the world\u2019s economies in 2008.\u201cThere is considerable evidence pointing to the role of migrants in sustaining or fostering strong economic growth over the longer term,\u201d the report said.\u201cThis suggests that migration helped the economy successfully weather the Global Financial Crisis and the slow global growth and poor economic conditions that followed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In His Haste to Roll Back Rules, Scott Pruitt, E.P.A. Chief, Risks His Agenda", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As ethical questions threaten the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, President Trump has defended him with a persuasive conservative argument: Mr. Pruitt is doing a great job at what he was hired to do, roll back regulations.But legal experts and White House officials say that in Mr. Pruitt\u2019s haste to undo government rules and in his eagerness to hold high-profile political events promoting his agenda, he has often been less than rigorous in following important procedures, leading to poorly crafted legal efforts that risk being struck down in court.The result, they say, is that the rollbacks, intended to fulfill one of the president\u2019s central campaign pledges, may ultimately be undercut or reversed.\u201cIn their rush to get things done, they\u2019re failing to dot their i\u2019s and cross their t\u2019s. And they\u2019re starting to stumble over a lot of trip wires,\u201d said Richard Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard. \u201cThey\u2019re producing a lot of short, poorly crafted rulemakings that are not likely to hold up in court.\u201dSix of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s efforts to delay or roll back Obama-era regulations \u2014 on issues including pesticides, lead paint and renewable-fuel requirements \u2014 have been struck down by the courts. Mr. Pruitt also backed down on a proposal to delay implementing smog regulations and another to withdraw a regulation on mercury pollution.In an interview on Friday, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that Mr. Trump felt that Mr. Pruitt had done a satisfactory job at the EPA. Her comments suggested that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s work checking off items on the president\u2019s agenda \u2014 including rolling back a large number of environmental protections \u2014 may weigh heavily as a counterbalance to the ethics questions related to his travel expenses, management practices and his rental of a living space from the wife of a prominent lobbyist.Describing Mr. Trump\u2019s view of Mr. Pruitt, she said: \u201cHe likes the work product.\u201dLiz Bowman, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, disputed the criticisms of the agency\u2019s work. \u201cE.P.A. does its due diligence, consults with O.M.B. and other federal agencies to ensure that its work is legally defensible,\u201d she said in an email, referring to the Office of Management and Budget, the office that coordinates and evaluates policy across the executive branch.One of the chief examples cited by Mr. Pruitt\u2019s critics came this week when the E.P.A. filed its legal justification for what is arguably the largest rollback of an environmental rule in the Trump administration: the proposed undoing of an Obama-era regulation aimed at cutting pollution of planet-warming greenhouse gases from vehicle tailpipes.Mr. Pruitt made his case for the rollback in a 38-page document filed on Tuesday that, experts say, was devoid of the kind of supporting legal, scientific and technical data that courts have shown they expect to see when considering challenges to regulatory changes.\u201cThere\u2019s an incredible lack of numbers,\u201d said James McCargar, a former senior policy analyst at the E.P.A. who worked on vehicle emissions programs and remains in close touch with career staffers who work on those programs. \u201cIf this gets challenged in court, I just don\u2019t see how they provide anything that gives a technical justification to undo the rule.\u201dThe rules Mr. Pruitt is targeting would require automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of passenger vehicles to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Automakers have argued the rule is onerous, forcing them to invest heavily in building hybrid and electric vehicles.As part of the process, Mr. Pruitt filed the 38-page document, which is meant to supply the government\u2019s legal justification for rolling back the rule. About half the document consists of quotations from automakers laying out their objections to the rule. By comparison, the Obama administration\u2019s 1,217-page document justifying its implementation of the regulation included technical, scientific and economic analyses justifying the rule.Experts in environmental policy said the lack of analytical arguments in this week\u2019s E.P.A. filing surprised them. \u201cThis document is unprecedented,\u201d said Mr. McCargar, the former E.P.A. senior policy analyst. \u201cThe E.P.A. has just never done anything like this.\u201dJohn M. DeCicco, a professor of engineering and public policy at the University of Michigan Energy Institute, said the filing was a departure from the practices of previous Republican and Democratic administrations.\u201cA president or an administrator or somebody can\u2019t just say, \u2018I\u2019m going to change the rule,\u2019 without justifying it very, very carefully,\u201d Mr. DeCicco said. \u201cAs a scientist who\u2019s worked on these issues, I\u2019m saying, where are the numbers? Where\u2019s the data?\u201dMost of the document consists of arguments quoting directly from public comments made by automaker lobbyists, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Global Automakers, that the pollution rules will be unduly burdensome on the auto industry, as well as public comments from Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz and Mitsubishi.While it does include arguments opposing the regulatory rollback from groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists and the state of California, it does not contain what environmental experts say is the critical element of a legally strong justification for changing an E.P.A. regulation: Technical analysis of both sides of the argument leading to a conclusion aimed at persuading a judge that the change is defensible.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Seth Michaels, a spokesman for the Union of Concerned Scientists, suggested that, in its reuse of arguments by the automakers\u2019 lobby, the emissions-rollback document echoed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s modus operandi when he was the Oklahoma Attorney General.\u201cIt\u2019s reminiscent of the 2011 letter Scott Pruitt sent as Oklahoma AG to the E.P.A., in which he took a letter drafted by lawyers for Devon Energy and stuck his name on it with minimal edits,\u201d Mr. Michaels said.Between 2011 and 2017, Mr. Pruitt filed suit against the E.P.A. 14 times, and lost almost all of the cases.Most were filed in conjunction with the Republican attorneys general of a dozen or more other states, making it difficult to know precisely which legal arguments his office contributed, legal experts said. Mr. Pruitt frequently took a lead role in the cases.In the end, \u201ca lot of those arguments were losers,\u201d said Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University.In particular, Mr. Revesz noted a case brought by the group against President Obama\u2019s signature climate change regulation, the Clean Power Plan, which Mr. Pruitt is now working to overturn from within the E.P.A. The lawsuit challenged a draft proposal of the regulation, which was an unprecedented move that a federal court quickly struck down, saying that they could not legally challenge a draft.While the attorneys general, including Mr. Pruitt, garnered media attention for the case, \u201cThe argument they had was ludicrous,\u201d Mr. Revesz said.The group did, however, score one major victory: After the Obama administration issued its final version of the Clean Power Plan, it successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to temporarily halt implementation of the rule.Since taking the helm of E.P.A., Mr. Pruitt has barnstormed the country, meeting with farmers, coal miners and local leaders and promising an end to his predecessor\u2019s regulatory approach. He also has favored closed-door policy speeches to conservative think tanks, like the Heritage Foundation, to roll out policy initiatives.Environmental groups have welcomed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s court losses. Joanne Spalding, chief climate counsel for the Sierra Club, said she was pleased by what she called \u201csloppy\u201d and \u201ccareless\u201d E.P.A. legal work. \u201cIt\u2019s fine with us,\u201d she said. \u201cDo a bad job repealing these things, because then we get to go to court and win.\u201dThomas J. Pyle, a supporter of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s and the president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that promotes fossil fuels, described that as spin. \u201cThe environmental left portrays Scott Pruitt as a devil incarnate in their fund-raising solicitations, yet brag about how ineffective he is in dismantling Obama\u2019s climate rules,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is it?\u201dStill, some conservatives said they were worried that Mr. Pruitt was more interested in media attention than policy and feared more legal losses. \u201cIf the goal is to generate temporary relief and to make a splash, then what they\u2019re doing is terrifically fine,\u201d said Jonathan H. Adler, director of the Center for Business Law & Regulation at Case Western Reserve University School of Law.But if the Trump administration wants to permanently change the regulatory environment for business, he said, the E.P.A. cannot take such a \u201cquick and dirty approach\u201d to unraveling regulations. \u201cI\u2019m suspicious that two, three years down the road there\u2019s going to be much to show for all the fireworks we\u2019re getting now,\u201d Mr. Adler said.Katie Rogers contributed reporting.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Economy Grows, and Its Trade Gap With the U.S. Widens", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s economy grew at a healthy pace in the first three months of this year, propelled by strong household spending and heavy government investment in infrastructure.It was also helped \u2014 albeit much more modestly \u2014 by a factor that could exacerbate the country\u2019s tense relations with Washington: China is selling a lot more to the United States, and its purchases from America aren\u2019t keeping up.Data released on Tuesday indicated that growth might have been cooling by the end of the quarter. Industrial production rose 6 percent in March, less than most economists had expected. Urban fixed-asset investment also rose less than expected.The central bank announced a measure Tuesday evening that would make it easier for commercial banks to keep lending, a move that would tend to support continued economic growth and that could indicate concern on the bank\u2019s part. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said that it was reducing by a full percentage point the reserves that commercial banks are required to deposit with it, freeing up more cash for commercial banks to lend to businesses and households.Another measure experts look to for insight into China\u2019s economy is trade, which at one time was a major driver of Chinese growth. Over the last decade, however, it has been far eclipsed in importance by Chinese investment and household spending.The latest figures show exports to the United States are growing considerably faster than China\u2019s purchases of American goods. That could provoke more ire from President Trump, who had threatened to impose $150 billion in tariffs on Chinese products.The trade figures present a mixed picture of how painful those tariffs could be for China. Over all, trade is not as important to China\u2019s economy as it was a decade ago, suggesting the country could better weather a trade fight. But the data also suggests China\u2019s exports to the United States, specifically, have become more valuable to China\u2019s economy as it increasingly makes most \u2014 or even all \u2014 of the parts that go inside what it sells abroad.Mr. Trump has focused on China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States, or the difference between what it sells to America and what it buys. And in the first three months of the year, the trade surplus for goods hit a new high of $58 billion, according to Chinese data. Trade in services, in which the United States is stronger, is tiny compared with the trade in goods, and offsets only about a tenth of the deficit in goods.China\u2019s surplus on goods with the United States last year totaled $375 billion, according to Washington, or $276 billion, according to Beijing. The United States includes Chinese goods shipped by way of Hong Kong, a Chinese city that operates under its own laws, while Beijing\u2019s statistics do not. Either way, China\u2019s surplus has been rising.Mr. Trump wants China\u2019s annual trade surplus to shrink by $100 billion \u2014 a reversal that could lower China\u2019s entire economic output by nearly a full percentage point if the Chinese factories producing those goods simply shut down.Xing Zhihong, the spokesman for China\u2019s statistics bureau, said on Tuesday that China did not try to have a trade surplus with the rest of the world, and noted that it was narrowing overall. He also dismissed the idea that trade frictions with the United State could stymie growth.\u201cSino-American trade frictions cannot cause a slowdown in the Chinese economy, nor change the good momentum in China\u2019s economic development,\u201d Mr. Xing said.Strictly by the numbers, China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States helps Chinese economic growth figures, though the reality of the relationship between the countries is more complex. Many American consumers and companies benefit from Chinese-made goods, and a number of economists doubt that Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on lowering the trade surplus with a single country will help the United States.On their face, the numbers suggest that American businesses have become dependent on China. And in fact, China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States is growing even as its surplus with the rest of the world has shrunk.But something else is going on: China is depending more on itself.China was once famous for assembling goods made from parts that had been bought elsewhere. A smartphone that is made in China, for example, might have a screen from Japan, memory chips from South Korea and a main processor from the United States. In fact, those parts and components long accounted for a sizable chunk of what China bought from the United States.Today, China can do all that entirely within its own borders, making everything from advanced electronic components to car parts and assembling the final product.\u201cIn the last 10 years, you\u2019ve seen China become considerably more developed and sophisticated in terms of its own supply chains,\u201d said Gordon Styles, the founder and president of Star Rapid, a company in Zhongshan, China, that does rapid prototypes and low-volume test manufacturing runs for everything from auto parts to medical equipment.\u201cIt is now easier than it ever was before to produce the entire product here,\u201d he said.Global automakers and other multinational companies have moved much of their supply chains to China to avoid Chinese tariffs, tap the country\u2019s vast work force and move closer to a big new market.Brad Setser, a Council on Foreign Relations economist, calculated that imports of manufactured goods from the United States are becoming steadily less important to the Chinese economy. He estimated that China now produces within its borders up to four-fifths of the value of each dollar of exports. That share had been as little as two-thirds in 2011.Nadim Ahmad, the head of the trade and competitiveness statistics division at the O.E.C.D., said that China has been expanding in areas like research, design and development that had previously been done overseas. \u201cYou\u2019re basically creating a lot more in the economy\u201d as goods are manufactured, he said.That means China gets more bang from its buck from its exports to the United States \u2014 and suggests American tariffs could be more painful than trade\u2019s shrinking share of the economy suggests.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korean News Outlets Fawn Over Kim but Offer Few Clues on Nuclear Plan", "Date": "2018-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 In gushing coverage, North Korea\u2019s main newspaper devoted four of its six pages on Saturday to the summit meeting the day before between Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s leader, and Moon Jae-in, the South\u2019s. It brightened its usually drab pages with 62 color photographs from the historic event.It even printed the leaders\u2019 joint declaration professing a goal of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.But, like other state-run North Korean news media, the newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, gave no hint to its readers whether Mr. Kim would genuinely consider giving up his nuclear weapons, or what he might demand in return.Rather, it focused on Mr. Kim\u2019s new diplomatic turn. \u201cWith his boundlessly noble love for the nation and with his sophisticated political skills, he has laid the groundwork for a turning point in North-South Korean relations,\u201d the propaganda-filled Rodong said.The coverage highlighted what the inter-Korean meeting glaringly lacked. However positive the goals described in the three-page agreement the leaders signed, the critical question remained: Does Mr. Kim intend to bargain away his nuclear weapons, or are his recent head-spinning diplomatic overtures aimed only at softening his image and easing sanctions against his impoverished country?Mr. Kim will almost certainly be pressed to answer that more clearly when he meets President Trump in late May or early June.The North Korean news media listed denuclearization as the last of three major agenda items from the summit meeting at the border village of Panmunjom \u2014 unlike the South Korean government, which cited it first. The North\u2019s coverage described extensively how Mr. Kim was spearheading efforts to open \u201can era of national reconciliation and solidarity, and peace and prosperity\u201d on the divided peninsula.Still, its coverage of the summit meeting reconfirmed North Korea\u2019s dramatic shift from raising tensions through weapons tests to creating a reconciliatory mood through high-profile meetings that would have been unthinkable just several months ago.Skeptics say Mr. Kim\u2019s goal remains to be accepted as a nuclear power. He is merely trying to improve ties with South Korea to steer it further from the United States and to escape sanctions that are increasingly hurting the North\u2019s economy, they say.But if Mr. Kim intends to win diplomatic recognition, a peace treaty and economic aid from Washington and its allies, as South Korean officials hope he does, trading away his nuclear arsenal is his only bargaining chip. He cannot reveal his hand too soon, they say.South Korean officials say they have heard directly from Mr. Kim a willingness to denuclearize.After signing their agreement, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon stood before cameras, Mr. Kim\u2019s first debut to outside news media and his first internationally broadcast news conference.Mr. Moon said he and Mr. Kim had agreed to \u201cclosely cooperate for complete denuclearization.\u201d But Mr. Kim said only that the two sides had agreed to \u201cpractical steps\u201d so that all Koreans could live in \u201ca peaceful land without war.\u201dMr. Kim repeatedly complained on Friday that previous deals with South Korea and the United States had all collapsed. Such an attempt to convey his wariness could mean protracted negotiations with Washington, which seeks a quick dismantlement, analysts said.Alexander Vershbow, a former American ambassador to Seoul, expressed some caution.\u201cIt remains to be seen what Kim Jong-un\u2019s commitment to denuclearization means in concrete terms: whether it foreshadows agreement to President Trump\u2019s demand for the rapid and verifiable elimination of the North\u2019s nuclear weapons, delivery systems and infrastructure, or whether the North envisages a drawn-out process tied to potentially unacceptable demands that the United States withdraw its forces from the South or provide immediate sanctions relief, while the North\u2019s nuclear threat remains in place,\u201d he said by email.The prospects of carrying out the inter-Korean agreement \u2014 which also called for the easing of military tensions along the Korean border and large South Korean investments to improve the North\u2019s road and train systems \u2014 will depend on whether Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump can reach a deal to dismantle North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons, said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior North Korea specialist at the Sejong Institute in Seongnam, South Korea.\u201cThe coming summit between North Korea and the United States is likely to decide the future of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Mr. Cheong said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kim Says He\u2019d End North Korea Nuclear Pursuit for U.S. Truce", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Keeping diplomatic developments coming at a head-snapping pace, the South Korean government said on Sunday that North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, had told President Moon Jae-in that he would abandon his nuclear weapons if the United States agreed to formally end the Korean War and promise not to invade his country.In a confidence-building gesture ahead of a proposed summit meeting with President Trump, a suddenly loquacious and conciliatory Mr. Kim also said he would invite experts and journalists from South Korea and the United States to watch the shutdown next month of his country\u2019s only known underground nuclear test site.In Washington, Trump officials spoke cautiously about the chances of reaching a deal and laid out a plan for the dismantling of the North\u2019s nuclear program, perhaps over a two-year period.That would be accompanied by a \u201cfull, complete, total disclosure of everything related to their nuclear program with a full international verification,\u201d said John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s new national security adviser.The apparent concessions from the youthful leader were widely welcomed as promising signs of ending the standoff on the Korean Peninsula, frozen in place since fighting in the Korean War ended 65 years ago.But skeptics warned that North Korea previously made similar pledges of denuclearization on numerous occasions, with little or no intention of abiding by them. Mr. Kim\u2019s friendly gestures, they said, could turn out to be nothing more than empty promises aimed at lifting sanctions on his isolated country.\u201cI know the Americans are inherently disposed against us, but when they talk with us, they will see that I am not the kind of person who would shoot nuclear weapons to the south, over the Pacific or at the United States,\u201d Mr. Kim told Mr. Moon, according to Mr. Yoon\u2019s account.It was another in a series of startling statements by Mr. Kim, whose country threatened to do exactly those things during the height of nuclear tensions last year.Mr. Kim\u2019s apparent willingness to negotiate away his nuclear arsenal was revealed just as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke for the first time about a \u201cgood conversation\u201d he had with Mr. Kim during his secret visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, over Easter weekend.\u201cWe had an extensive conversation on the hardest issues that face our two countries,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cI had a clear mission statement from President Trump. When I left, Kim Jong-un understood the mission exactly as I described it today.\u201dBut Mr. Bolton, a longtime critic of past diplomacy with North Korea, expressed skepticism on Sunday, recalling past moments that looked hopeful. Those would include a commitment by Pyongyang in the 1990s to give up its nuclear program and the destruction of a nuclear power cooling tower in 2008 as part of a similar promise.\u201cWe want to see real commitment,\u201d he said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see propaganda from North Korea. We\u2019ve seen words. We\u2019ve seen words so far.\u201dAsked about North Korea\u2019s insistence on a promise by the United States not to invade, Mr. Bolton noted that was an old demand that had been rolled out on other occasions. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard this before,\u201d he said. \u201cThe North Korean propaganda playbook is an infinitely rich resource.\u201dMr. Trump sees the potential for a historic deal with Mr. Kim, \u201ca breakthrough nobody would have imagined a few months ago,\u201d Mr. Bolton told Fox News on Sunday, but his administration is not \u201cstarry eyed about what may happen here.\u201d\u201cI think it is going to happen; the dates and the places are still under discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the president is eager to do it as soon as possible.\u201dEven in the additional details released on Sunday by South Korean officials, Mr. Kim appeared to hedge his bets, indicating that denuclearizing his country could be a long process that required multiple rounds of negotiations and steps to build trust. But he laid out a vague idea of what his impoverished country would demand in return for giving up its nuclear weapons.\u201cIf we meet often and build trust with the United States, and if an end to the war and nonaggression are promised, why would we live in difficulty with nuclear weapons?\u201d Mr. Kim was quoted as saying by South Korean officials.Mr. Moon briefed Mr. Trump on the meeting during a call on Saturday, telling him that Mr. Kim had said that he and Mr. Trump could \u201cget along well,\u201d to which Mr. Trump responded that he \u201clooked forward\u201d to their meeting.On Sunday, Mr. Moon also spoke with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to relay Mr. Kim\u2019s willingness to open dialogue with Tokyo, which is threatened by the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile development.The peacemaking comments stand in stark contrast to previous remarks and actions by Mr. Kim, who drove the Peninsula close to the brink of war last year by undertaking a series of missile and nuclear tests.In the meeting on Friday, Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon also agreed to start talks this year with Washington to negotiate a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, one of the key security guarantees that the North has long demanded.But North Korea has so far offered no timeline for dismantling its nuclear weapons and facilities. Nor has it clarified how it defines a \u201cnuclear-free Korean Peninsula,\u201d and especially whether that means a withdrawal or significant reconfiguration of American troops based in South Korea, as it has demanded before.Even before Mr. Moon met with Mr. Kim, South Korean officials said any joint statement was bound to be vague on the terms of denuclearization because Mr. Kim would try to settle critical issues directly with Washington.If Mr. Kim intends to win a peace treaty, diplomatic recognition and billions of dollars in economic aid from Washington and its allies, as South Korean officials hope he does, trading away his nuclear arsenal is his biggest bargaining chip. He cannot reveal his hand too soon, South Korean officials said.Skeptics fear that Mr. Kim does not really intend to give up his nuclear weapons and is merely trying to soften his image, escape sanctions and make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to continue to threaten military action. But South Korean officials argue that Mr. Kim is sincere in trading his nuclear weapons for a promise to end hostilities and get Washington\u2019s help to improve his country\u2019s economy.North Korea\u2019s promise to invite outsiders to Punggye-ri reflected \u201cMr. Kim\u2019s determination to actively and pre-emptively deal with the process of verifying denuclearization,\u201d Mr. Yoon said.In another conciliatory gesture toward South Korea, Mr. Kim made his own pledge of nonaggression toward the South.\u201cI am determined not to repeat the painful history of the Korean War. As the same nation living on the same land, we should never shed blood again,\u201d he told Mr. Moon, according to Mr. Yoon.Mr. Kim even vowed to readjust his country\u2019s clock to match the time zone in South Korea, which with the rest of the region runs 30 minutes ahead of the North\u2019s.\u201cWhen I was sitting in the waiting room, I saw two clocks on the wall, one of the Seoul time and the other of the Pyongyang time, and I felt bad about it,\u201d Mr. Kim was quoted as telling Mr. Moon. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we reunify our clocks first?\u201dPeter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

Mr. Ramaphosa announced plans to raise $100 billion in foreign investment over the next five years.In a speech at the summit meeting, Mr. Ramaphosa said his country had entered \u201ca new era of confidence and hope,\u201d and he named four envoys, including two well-respected former Finance Ministry officials, to campaign for investments.While in London, Mr. Ramaphosa addressed investors\u2019 anxiety about possible land reform in South Africa while acknowledging some constituents\u2019 demand for radical change. He tried to allay fears of a violent land grab as had happened in Zimbabwe.When the A.N.C. took power, it wanted to address the issue of land ownership in South Africa, but \u201cit has not quite worked as we had intended it to work,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said in the television interview.Another gargantuan task Mr. Ramaphosa faces is to deliver on his promise of a \u201cnew dawn\u201d following public outrage over corruption and of an Indian business family\u2019s influence on the previous administration. Endemic corruption has engulfed South Africa and eroded virtually every institution in the country, including state enterprises.While the police and prosecutors are investigating multiple cases of corruption and plan to recover more than $4 billion lost from state coffers, they have done little to prosecute political leaders who enabled malfeasance across many sectors of the economy.The president\u2019s recent appointments to his cabinet have also cast doubt on his promises of reform. After he became party leader by a razor-thin margin, Mr. Ramaphosa appointed several officials who had been accused of corruption in the past.Earlier this week, South Africa\u2019s public ombudsman announced an investigation into two high-ranking members of the A.N.C. after $21 million of public funds, meant to help struggling black farmers, went to politically connected companies and individuals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury\u2019s Tax Law Architect, Justin Muzinich, Is Tapped as Deputy Secretary", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ascendance of Mr. Muzinich comes as Mr. Trump reshuffles his economic team, most notably replacing Gary D. Cohn with Larry Kudlow as the director of the National Economic Council. Far from a flamethrower, Mr. Muzinich, who spent most of his career on Wall Street, will add a more moderate voice with traditional conservative economic ideas to the table.Mr. Muzinich, 40, has been serving as Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s tax counselor and played a central role in crafting and negotiating the terms of the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that Congress passed late last year. He was previously under consideration to be promoted to under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, but now is in line to be Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s No. 2.\u201cI am delighted by the president\u2019s decision to nominate Justin to serve as deputy secretary of the Treasury,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement. \u201cJustin has established himself as a leader in the department, and played a key role in the passage of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.\u201dHe added: \u201cHe brings significant experience in financial services and in public policy and has become a reliable and trusted adviser on a number of important issues.\u201dA relative newcomer to Washington, Mr. Muzinich has brought a mix of financial and political experience to the Treasury Department. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he served as policy director for Jeb Bush and helped to craft Mr. Bush\u2019s tax plan. He also previously taught at Columbia Business School and has published essays on foreign aid and the role of the Federal Reserve.Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, has also worked as a banker at Morgan Stanley and was the president of Muzinich & Company, an international investment firm founded by his father.During the development of the tax legislation last year, Mr. Muzinich was frequently by Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s side or negotiating on behalf of the Treasury Department during meetings with congressional staff members. Tax policy staff members on Capitol Hill often noted that Mr. Muzinich was a good listener and fast learner considering that he was not steeped in the arcana of the tax code.Those abilities will be crucial as deputy secretary, as Mr. Muzinich will have a much wider mandate. While the tax law has been passed, the carrying out of such a major piece of legislation will be a consuming task for an understaffed Internal Revenue Service, which is part of the Treasury Department. The department is also responsible for developing and executing economic sanctions on terrorist groups and on countries such as North Korea and Russia. And the department is at the center of Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to prevent China from capturing intellectual property through corporate mergers and acquisitions.\u201cIt has been mystifying to me that they could go so long without a deputy at Treasury,\u201d said Sarah Bloom Raskin, who served as Treasury\u2019s deputy secretary during the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy role to keep vacant. It seems to have taken Treasury off the field in several major policy battles.\u201dJosh Bolten, a former chief of staff for President George W. Bush who got to know Mr. Muzinich during Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign, said that Mr. Muzinich\u2019s range of experiences would serve him well in a position that will require him to frequently speak on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s behalf.\u201cHe\u2019s a high-quality person who, I think, will in the most civil of ways always speak up when he thinks something is wrong and will always, again in a very civil way, give a good, reasoned judgment,\u201d Mr. Bolten said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.P.A. Readies Plan to Weaken Rules That Require Cars to Be Cleaner", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration has drafted a new set of regulations on planet-warming emissions from cars and light trucks that would dramatically weaken Obama-era standards. The proposal, if implemented, would also set up a legal clash between the federal government and California by challenging the state\u2019s authority to set its own, stricter, air pollution rules.Details of the proposal, which is being jointly drafted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department and is expected to be sent to the White House for approval in coming days, were described to The New York Times by a federal official who had seen them but was not authorized to discuss the matter.The E.P.A. declined to comment on the emissions proposal, which could still change before being made public.The proposal also challenges California\u2019s authority to impose its own vehicle standards.Stanley Young, a spokesman for the state\u2019s clean air regulator, the California Air Resources Board, said the agency was not aware of any official proposal. But if true, \u201cthis would harm people\u2019s health, boost greenhouse gas pollution and force drivers to pay more money at the pump for years.\u201d\u201cIt would also severely disrupt the U.S. auto industry, compromising its ability to succeed in a highly competitive global market that increasingly values innovative and efficient technologies,\u201d Mr. Young said. A rollback of the rules, which were designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, would blunt one of the single biggest steps any government has taken to tackle climate change.But under the draft proposal\u2019s preferred outcome, fuel economy standards would be frozen after 2020, keeping the fuel economy target closer to 40 miles a gallon through 2025.Other possible approaches in the draft proposal involve progressively increasing fuel economy by between 0.5 percent and 2 percent a year for cars, and from 0.5 percent to 3 percent for light trucks.The E.P.A. and Transportation Department are expected to send their proposal to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget in the coming days for review. Once the proposal is reviewed and published in the federal register, it will have to undergo a public comment period and may see further changes before being finalized.Because automakers already have the technology in place for their 2020 models, freezing those standards would be tantamount to ceasing to regulate fuel economy improvements altogether, said Ann E. Carlson, a professor of environmental law at the University of California, Los Angeles.\u201cThis is essentially saying to automakers: Keep doing what you\u2019ve already been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying: We are not going to regulate you anymore. You\u2019re already geared up to meet the standards and we\u2019re finished.\u201dHiroko Tabuchi reported from New York, and Brad Plumer and Coral Davenport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Idyllic Philippine Resort Island of Boracay Is Closed to Tourists", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBORACAY, Philippines \u2014 A Philippine island that became famous for the white sand beaches and coral reefs that made it a haven for travelers, and then for the rapid development and pollution that threatened its idyllic shores, has been ordered closed to tourists for six months.President Rodrigo Duterte \u2014 who has said that inadequate sewage treatment on the island, Boracay, has turned its beaches into a \u201ccesspool\u201d \u2014 directed that it be closed to tourism starting on April 26, his spokesman, Harry Roque, said Wednesday.That decision threatens the livelihoods of thousands of people on Boracay, a speck of an island in the central Philippines that has become a travel destination to rival Phuket, in Thailand, and Bali, in Indonesia.Mr. Duterte has said that Boracay must be cleaned up, but officials have given no indication that there is a plan to do so. Yet last month, the government signed an agreement with Galaxy Entertainment, a Macau-based casino operator, and a Philippine partner to begin construction next year on a $500 million beachfront casino that would add to the burdens on the island\u2019s infrastructure.\u201cMaybe the timing was just coincidence, but I can say that it is very odd,\u201d said Nenette Graf, president of an alliance of Boracay\u2019s hotels, restaurants and other businesses. \u201cYou want to close the island, but at the same time allow a casino operator in?\u201dEnvironment Secretary Roy Cimatu, who recently met with Boracay business owners, acknowledged the contradiction, a local newspaper reported, but noted that the new casino would need to secure an environmental clearance certificate from his agency before opening.Most of the roughly 40,000 residents of the four-square-mile island are dependent on tourism, and even before Mr. Duterte\u2019s order, some were struggling.\u201cRight now, there should be twice the number of tourists here,\u201d said Alfred Abuloc, 29, who works in a tiny restaurant. He wondered aloud whether the president\u2019s harsh words about the island \u201chave caused others to cancel.\u201dThe race for tourist dollars fueled rapid development. Bamboo huts and modest, wood-framed inns gave way to modern hotels, primarily along the four-mile-long White Beach on the island\u2019s western side. A mall features American chains like Starbucks, KFC and McDonald\u2019s, and Caticlan Airport, 15 minutes away by ferry, recently expanded to handle the flow of tourists.The boom brought jobs and money, but overtaxed the island\u2019s water and garbage disposal systems and, crucially, its sewers and storm drains.Resort owners say the government promised a system that would treat waste and runoff, and pump it far out to sea. What they got instead, they say, was an inadequate treatment system, with many properties illegally tapped into it, that dumps wastewater just off the island\u2019s eastern shore, at Bulabog Beach, an area famed for its wind- and kite-surfing.Saying the water \u201csmells,\u201d and employing other, more colorful words, Mr. Duterte ordered officials in the environment, tourism and interior departments to undertake a cleanup. So far, the government has not signaled what it will do to fix the problem, or when.\u201cWe want the government to help us,\u201d said Ms. Graf, who operates the Boracay Beach Resort on the western side of the island. But closing the island, she said, \u201cis another matter altogether. We don\u2019t want that.\u201d\u201cClosure means the end of jobs,\u201d she said, asking how local workers were \u201cgoing to eat in the next six months.\u201d She predicted that it would have ripple effects across the entire Philippine economy.\u201cYou close us down, and we will likely not recover from it,\u201d she added. \u201cTourism in Asia is very competitive.\u201dBoracay\u2019s Chamber of Commerce and Industry has asked Mr. Duterte to reconsider, arguing that not all businesses are violators, and that those found to be polluting should instead be cut off from the water supply.The proposed casino site is on the less developed, eastern side of the island, and to make way for the project, local landowners say they were forced to sell their property at below-market prices. Some of the houses there have already been torn down, and a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign warns away visitors.Many local people moved to Boracay from the country\u2019s crowded cities to find work, including Mr. Abuloc, the restaurant worker, who arrived five years ago from Manila, the capital. He and his wife, whom he met while they both worked their way up in the tourism industry, now have a 2-year-old boy.\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll move elsewhere and go work as a construction laborer,\u201d he said.The closing of the island, while drastic, is not the first time that a government in the region has sacrificed tourist revenue in the name of environmental protection. More than a decade ago, the Malaysian island of Sipadan, famed for its diving, was closed to tourists to allow its reefs to rehabilitate.Jaana Laht, 44, of Estonia, who visited Boracay recently with her husband, Aadu, said she understood the logic.\u201cThis is such a beautiful island, it\u2019s a shame to close it down to tourists,\u201d Ms. Laht said as she posed for pictures on White Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, but if it is to save the environment, maybe it will be worth it in the long run.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Ryan Upends Republican Hopes and Plans for Midterm Elections", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Fifteen months after Republicans took full control of Washington, the man long seen as central to the party\u2019s future is abandoning one of the most powerful jobs in the capital, imperiling the G.O.P. grip on the House and signaling that the political convulsions of the Trump era are taking a grave toll on the right months before Election Day.And for a White House bracing for a potential Democratic impeachment inquiry, the ominous impact of Mr. Ryan\u2019s retirement was unmistakable. He has made it more difficult to stave off Democrats\u2019 taking control of the House, where Republicans currently hold a 23-seat majority.As many as 50 House Republican seats are at risk in competitive races this year. Private polling indicates that Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating is well below 40 percent in some of those tossup districts, the sort of low political standing that often dooms candidates of the president\u2019s party.\u201cThis is the nightmare scenario,\u201d said former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican. \u201cEverybody figured he\u2019d just hang in there till after the election.\u201dAlready, some veteran Republicans are suggesting that the party shift its focus from the House to protecting its one-seat Senate majority.\u201cIt seems clear now that the fight is to hold the Senate,\u201d said Billy Piper, a lobbyist and former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. \u201cThe first thing a Democrat House majority would do is begin impeachment proceedings. The second would be to undo tax reform. A G.O.P. Senate will stop both of those things and continue to put conservatives on the bench at a record pace.\u201dAnd Mr. Ryan has been the most important voice on the right calling for an upbeat and inclusive message and a campaign focused on the economy and taxes, rather than the hard-right culture war issues Mr. Trump delights in stoking.Now, some in the party are suggesting that the speaker\u2019s departure will free Republicans to run a more hard-edge campaign that better reflects the politics of the man in the Oval Office.\u201cPaul is relentlessly positive and wanted to run an ideas-oriented campaign,\u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. \u201cBut I guarantee you that would not have worked this fall.\u201dBut any campaign-trail embrace of angry grievance politics \u2014 of the sort that Mr. Trump ran on in 2016 \u2014 alarms other Republicans who fear it will only exacerbate their difficulties in the suburbs and create long-term difficulties.\u201cThis is a huge moment of truth,\u201d said Representative Tom Rooney of Florida. \u201cI don\u2019t think that campaigning or governing by fear is ever going to work or ever going to be a lasting message. You can only scare people so much. And if we try that, we\u2019re not going to be in power much longer.\u201dMr. Ryan indicated to advisers that he knows retiring will create political difficulties for the party but that he felt he could not in good conscience commit to another full two-year term, according to two Republicans familiar with the conversations.Yet his explanation that he wanted to spend more time with his three teenage children, as expressed at a news conference Wednesday, is of little comfort to Republicans on the ballot who were expecting Mr. Ryan to raise millions for and campaign with lawmakers across the country. Even though he vowed to colleagues that he would keep fulfilling those political responsibilities, he will not be nearly as big a draw at fund-raisers now that he is a lame duck.Former Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, who sits on the board of a Republican outside-spending group tied to the speaker, said that Mr. Ryan had effectively scrambled the party\u2019s fund-raising machinery.\u201cIt will be a difficult task for Paul to hold his strong, vibrant fund-raising,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a lame duck, it changes those dynamics.\u201dAnd with the candidate filing period still open in 19 states, Mr. Ryan has lost any real power to convince other wavering Republicans that they must run again.More than three dozen other Republicans are leaving the House to retire or seek other offices, and several more have resigned in personal scandals or for private-sector jobs.As recently as last week, Mr. Ryan gathered his top political donors in Austin, Tex., to lay out the party\u2019s strategy for the election and seek their financial support. While Mr. Ryan was noncommittal there about his plans for seeking re-election, he did not indicate his exit was imminent.Trying to reassure his startled colleagues on Wednesday morning, Mr. Ryan told Republicans that he would \u201crun through the tape\u201d with them in the 2018 elections.A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.But it is unlikely Mr. Ryan will be able to perform his core leadership duties with the same force he has wielded up to this point. Some party strategists had already grumbled after the Texas gathering that his unwillingness to commit to running again was offering an excuse to major donors to not provide substantial contributions to House campaign efforts.Mr. Davis said the party must now swiftly press its agenda, warning that Republicans cannot simply promote the recent tax overhaul in the face of the steady drip of news from the Russia investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\u201cThey can\u2019t wait for Mueller and be reactive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have gavels, they ought to be out there passing an infrastructure bill, doing something. You can\u2019t just do four corners.\u201dIf there is a silver lining to Mr. Ryan\u2019s departure, it was voiced by one House Republican in a competitive district who \u2014 speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to offend the speaker \u2014 said that Democrats were now deprived of a shiny object they delighted in targeting in campaign ads. And other Republican lawmakers said they had long ago assumed that Mr. Ryan would not be around much longer.Mr. Ryan\u2019s announced exit also threatens to divide the rest of the Republican leadership team in the House: The second- and-third-ranking House Republicans, Kevin McCarthy of California and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, are competing to succeed Mr. Ryan.Mr. Gingrich said the heirs to Mr. Ryan must quickly seize control or else doom the party.\u201cThere will be a period of depression and confusion lasting anywhere from two to six weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then McCarthy and Scalise will realize the burden is on them to save the majority.\u201d\u201cBut if they go run a scared, timid and confused campaign, they\u2019re going to lose the House and be lucky to keep the Senate,\u201d he said.In a sign that Republican retirements are likely to continue, Representative Dennis A. Ross of Florida, who holds a conservative-leaning but not safe seat, announced on Wednesday morning that he would leave at the end of his current term. He said on CNN that the negative atmosphere in Washington was \u201ca factor\u201d in his decision and urged his soon-to-be-former colleagues to brandish a Ryan-like message in the fall.More junior lawmakers, too, may take Mr. Ryan\u2019s exit as a bracing reminder of the political environment.Representative Peter T. King of New York, a long-serving Republican, said Mr. Ryan had played down the impact of his decision and predicted that no one would \u201cwin or lose an election based on whether Paul Ryan is the speaker.\u201dBut newer members, who may never have served under a speaker other than Mr. Ryan, had grown to see him as a kind of political security blanket, Mr. King said. There was a reassurance in trusting that Mr. Ryan \u201cwould be there if they needed campaign contributions,\u201d he added.\u201cIt was just a comfort zone, knowing that Paul Ryan was there, for a lot of these people,\u201d Mr. King said, warning: \u201cThey\u2019ll have to really learn how to run a real race.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robots Ride to the Rescue Where Workers Can\u2019t Be Found", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFast-growing economies in Eastern Europe have led to severe labor shortages, so companies are calling in the machines.Raising wages didn\u2019t help. Nor did offers to subsidize housing.So he turned to the robots.Such talk usually conjures visions of a future where employees are no longer needed. In many major economies, companies are experimenting with replacing factory workers, truck drivers and even lawyers with artificial intelligence, raising the specter of a mass displacement of jobs.Few are riding higher than the Czech Republic, where plants roll out cars for the likes of Toyota and consumer electronics for Dell, while smaller companies produce specialty goods to sell around the world. A roaring economy has slashed the jobless rate to just 2.4 percent, the lowest in the European Union.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a brake on growth,\u201d said Jaroslav Hanak, the organization\u2019s president. \u201cIf businesses don\u2019t increase robotization and artificial intelligence, they\u2019ll disappear.\u201d\u201cIf we didn\u2019t invest early in automation, we\u2019d be dead by now,\u201d he said.For the Czech Republic and its neighbors, the calculus is one of survival. A new generation of robots is needed not just to confront the labor squeeze, but also to increase flexibility and output as consumers demand a wider range of products.\u201cCompanies aren\u2019t able to produce more, so their competitiveness is falling,\u201d said Jaromir Zeleny, Rittal\u2019s managing director. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be so dependent on people.\u201dBusinesses say letting in more foreign workers would help. But the conservative government has pledged to limit immigration, and recently set strict caps on foreign work visas.\u201cA labor shortage will continue for years,\u201d said Bohdan Dovhanic, a Prague-based business director at Schneider Electric, a French industrial company. \u201cWe must be prepared to find more human employees, or find a way to substitute for them.\u201dThe risk, critics say, is that when future recessions hit, workers will suffer. \u201cYou won\u2019t switch off the robots and bring back people,\u201d said Michal Pechoucek, head of the Artificial Intelligence Center at the Czech Technical University in Prague.Czech unions echo those warnings. \u201cUnless business leaders, politicians and trade unions react well in advance and responsibly to the upcoming industrial revolution,\u201d said Josef Stredula, president of the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions, \u201ceven more jobs may be under threat.\u201dFor now, companies here insist that robotization will create new work.At Linet, the hospital bed manufacturer, most welding, cutting, painting and molding functions were automated a decade ago. Thirty industrial robots do the work of up to 200 people. But that doesn\u2019t offset the need for humans, who program machines and perform complex custom work on the assembly line that robots can\u2019t do.Like other employers, Mr. Frolik was caught off guard when joblessness fell swiftly. Virtually every part of the Czech economy has been affected. In the industrial countryside north of the capital where his factories are, unemployment is below 2 percent. And in Prague, even the trams have run less frequently this year for want of drivers.To keep up with a surge in orders driven by the global recovery, he needs more people. He raised wages 12 percent last year and tried to poach employees from other factories, but it wasn\u2019t enough, and he didn\u2019t have the production capacity to bid on major government contracts. \u201cWe could be growing much more,\u201d Mr. Frolik said.So he put in an \u20ac8 million order last month for superfast robotic lasers and plastic molding machines to replace older models. The new devices will let him move six workers to the custom assembly line. But with other Czech companies also scrambling to upgrade, he\u2019ll have to wait for delivery of the machines.Mr. Frolik stopped before a hulking industrial laser that would eventually be replaced by a faster, smarter machine. The two employees operating it would be educated for other work at the factory inside the old cow barn, which has been converted into a training center.\u201cWe\u2019ll still need people,\u201d Mr. Frolik said. \u201cBut robots are more reliable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protests Erupt Anew in Armenia Amid Political Deadlock", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe resumption of public protests and the deployment of the police around the headquarters of the ruling Republican Party threatened to shift the tenor of what has so far been a peaceful movement for change in the small, southern Caucasus nation of about three million people.Although Mr. Pashinyan lacks a party and an established constituency, he has won widespread support, mainly among young Armenians who are fed up with corruption and nepotism in the elite group of pro-Russia politicians and their allies who have long commanded the government and the economy.Street demonstrations began on April 13 after Mr. Sargsyan, having reached his two-term limit after a decade as president, was abruptly named prime minister by a Parliament dominated by his Republican Party. In 2015, the Constitution was changed to transfer most presidential powers to the prime minister and the Parliament.Mr. Sargsyan conceded on Monday that he had made a mistake, saying in a statement that he was bowing to public opinion and stepping down.Various political factions are now locked in tense standoff over how to proceed. While there is a consensus that snap parliamentary elections are likely, opposition leaders are adamant that they should not be run by Republican Party officials, whom they deeply distrust.The acting prime minister, Karen Karapetyan, said that he had asked Armen Sarkissian, the new president, to organize a meeting of all political factions to discuss the next steps. Mr. Sarkissian issued a statement saying he would begin consulting with political leaders on Wednesday.Mr. Karapetyan, a Sargsyan ally, was scheduled to meet with Mr. Pashinyan on Wednesday but canceled late Tuesday, saying in a statement that he would not accept unspecified preconditions that the opposition had demanded. He also acknowledged that new elections were likely.\u201cIf Pashinyan is the people\u2019s choice, the people can elect him,\u201d said Mr. Karapetyan, who had previously been prime minister, after working as an executive for Gazprom, the Russian energy giant.Mr. Pashinyan, who has said he is ready to be prime minister, rejected the idea of holding elections under the supervision of the Republican Party, which controls 58 of the 105 seats in Parliament. It pushed through the change from president to prime minister for Mr. Sargsyan. The opposition parties are small and prone to bickering, however.\u201cThe Republican Party is thinking about exploiting Serzh Sargsyan\u2019s resignation and wants to keep power,\u201d Mr. Pashinyan said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cWe cannot agree on the appointment of this party\u2019s representative as prime minister, and we cannot allow this corrupted system to continue to exist.\u201d\u201cThere will be more of us here with every day until we take power,\u201d he was quoted as saying by local news outlets.Armenia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 but has remained a close partner with Moscow. Russia, which maintains a military base in Armenia, has indicated that it will not intervene and has called for a peaceful transition of power. It has said the demonstrations were an internal affair, and has not accused Western powers of fomenting them, as it did in Ukraine.But on Wednesday, a court in Moscow fined 29 protesters who had gathered outside the Armenian cathedral in the Russian capital in support of the demonstrations in Yerevan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Weighs Return to Trans-Pacific Partnership. Not So Fast, Say Members.", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 As trade tensions with China escalate, President Trump has found new appeal in a regional trade pact he once called a \u201crape of our country.\u201dThe pact\u2019s members \u2014 including some of America\u2019s most stalwart allies \u2014 might not make it so easy to come back.Comparing the multicountry trade agreement to \u201ca glasswork,\u201d Yoshihide Suga, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, cautioned against any efforts to change it to accommodate Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to bring part of the pact and renegotiate it,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201cwell-balanced pact\u201d that carefully addressed the needs of the current 11 member nations.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal\u201d already, said Steven Ciobo, Australia\u2019s trade minister, who added, \u201cI can\u2019t see that all being thrown open to appease the United States.\u201dMr. Trump faces a growing domestic backlash from corporations, farmers and others over fears that he is igniting a trade war with China, the United States\u2019 largest single trading partner. Mr. Trump has warned that he could levy tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to threaten retaliatory measures aimed at American soybeans, airplanes and other products.Negotiating a new pact could take years. Still, rekindling negotiations could make it hard for China to play off the United States against its allies by promising to shift business from one to another if a trade war breaks out. It could be a way to assuage American farmers and businesses hurt by Chinese tariffs by assuring robust markets for American products in countries that signed onto the deal, like Japan, Australia and South Korea. It would give the pact a great deal more heft and help position it as an economic counterweight to China, which increasingly dominates the Asia-Pacific region.More broadly, it signals to the region that the United States is not giving up on trade, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s sometimes harsh words. Even as officials in other countries expressed skepticism on Friday, they said they would like to hear what Washington has to offer. \u201cJapan would like to listen to the U.S.\u2019s view,\u201d said Mr. Suga, the Japanese official.On his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.For its part, the Trump administration worries that the partnership will become a zero-tariff backdoor for Chinese goods into the American market. It worries that companies that have moved much of their supply chains to China could make components there, ship them to a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership for assembly, then sell them in the United States tariff-free. It wants to toughen requirements for how much of the product is made within a participating country, which could make the goods less competitive.Their worries focus largely on Vietnam, a member of the current version of the pact. It has a large population, and a few big American companies, like Intel, have already invested heavily in setting up factories there that make products practically from scratch. But many other companies that are exporting goods from Vietnam rely heavily on imports from China. Vietnam\u2019s huge garment industry, for example, relies greatly on fabric and accessories imported from China, according to garment manufacturing executives.Vietnamese officials did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. Frederick Burke, managing partner for Vietnam at the American law firm Baker McKenzie, said that the Vietnamese government is \u201cvery aware of and focused on the issue of circumvention\u201d in trade.Renegotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership may not be quick. Mr. Trump\u2019s trade negotiators already have their hands full this spring trying to complete changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. They need to decide whether to extend temporary exemptions from the president\u2019s new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Above all, they are locked in a series of increasingly acrimonious trade spats with China.China is making its own outreach efforts in the meantime. Wang Yi, its foreign minister, will travel to Tokyo on Sunday. China has played up free trade talks with Japan and with South Korea, which is not a member of the partnership.The Trump administration \u201ccould walk right back in with the exact same deal from last year that they walked out of, and claim victory,\u201d said Ms. Smith, who noted that the government of Mr. Abe \u201chas been continuously and quietly encouraging the U.S. administration to take another look\u201d at the pact.One lingering question would be how China would react. The pact\u2019s rules were designed in part to challenge China by encouraging members to loosen state support of their economies and relax trade rules \u2014 steps Beijing would have to take if it hoped to someday join the pact and enjoy its lower trade barriers.China is not likely to be troubled by a United States move to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership as long as the Trump administration is doing so for strictly trade reasons, said He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official and trade specialist who is now a senior fellow at the influential Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.But the Chinese government is likely to be dismayed if the United States is reconsidering it as part of any revival of the Obama administration\u2019s geopolitical pivot to Asia, or as part of any attempt to isolate China, Mr. He cautioned.\u201cThat\u2019s what we should be careful about,\u201d he said.Some current members of the pact greeted Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Thursday warmly. A spokeswoman for Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Trade and Industry said it welcomed the American interest. \u201cThe TPP was designed to be an inclusive agreement, which is open to like-minded countries willing and able to meet its high standards,\u201d the spokeswoman said.Still, even American allies suggest a long road ahead if Mr. Trump moves forward.Reporting was contributed by Hisako Ueno from Tokyo; Motoko Rich from Gotsu, Japan; Mike Ives from Hong Kong; and Jacqueline Williams from Sydney, Australia.Advertisement"}

But he did not do so on Monday, instead appearing to try to justify its spirit by noting that many countries in Africa are riddled with problems.\u201cYou do have some countries that are in very bad shape and very tough places to live in,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a news conference with Mr. Buhari in the Rose Garden, asked by a reporter about his use of vulgarity to describe Africa. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t discuss it because the president knows me, and he knows where I\u2019m coming from, and I appreciate that.\u201dMr. Buhari, for his part, said he was not certain whether to believe the reports about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.\u201cI\u2019m very careful with what the press says,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about the validity, or whether that allegation against the president was true or not, so the best thing for me is to keep quiet.\u201dMr. Trump has since tried to make amends. He wrote a letter to African nations saying that he \u201cdeeply respects\u201d the people of Africa, and that he would dispatch Rex W. Tillerson, then his secretary of state, for an extended visit to the continent in March. The letter prompted the African Union to refrain from issuing a resolution criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s remark and demanding an apology.On Monday, Mr. Trump and Mr. Buhari emphasized areas of agreement, and went out of their way to praise each other.\u201cI have great respect for the president,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Buhari. Nigeria, he said, was a \u201cvalued partner and a good friend,\u201d later adding that \u201cthere\u2019s no country more beautiful.\u201dThe two spoke of their cooperation and coordination on security matters, including counterterrorism efforts against the Islamic State and Boko Haram, and Mr. Trump said he was pleased to be selling a dozen A-29 Super Tucano warplanes to Nigeria. The sale of the planes, long sought by the Nigerians, had been held up by the Obama administration amid concerns about human rights abuses by Nigeria\u2019s military.Mr. Buhari, for his part, congratulated Mr. Trump for the \u201cimpressive\u201d performance of the American economy, and credited him for playing a \u201cstatesmanly role\u201d with North Korea that has led to discussions on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.The friendly exchange may have masked the bitterness that lingers among Nigerians and other Africans about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, said John Campbell, a former United States ambassador to Nigeria and a senior fellow for Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cThey found it deeply offensive, and whenever I meet with Africans now, they always mention it,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. However, he added, Mr. Buhari arrived at the White House on Monday as a supplicant with important security challenges that he needs American help to confront.\u201cLooking at it from the perspective of President Buhari, what on earth can he say at this stage about these comments, which the president at times denies having said at all?\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cIt might make you feel better, but practically, it doesn\u2019t accomplish anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Falling Dollar Means Investors Should Look Abroad \u2014 Carefully", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the start of last year, the dollar has lost more than 12 percent of its value against a basket of foreign currencies. During that same stretch, stock funds that invest abroad have gone from being laggards to leaders.\u201cForeign investments tend to do better when the dollar is weak,\u201d said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer for Cresset Wealth Advisors. That\u2019s because \u201cwhen you invest in foreign stocks, you\u2019re actually buying two things \u2014 the foreign equities, but also the foreign currencies needed to buy them,\u201d he said.And as those foreign currencies strengthen against a weak dollar, the returns on foreign investments held by Americans get a lift.Over the last year, European equities have largely been flat when measured in their local currencies. But when translated into dollars, European equities have returned nearly 18 percent over the last 12 months for Americans.Many market observers think the dollar could weaken further, especially as inflationary fears build in the United States. \u201cThe dollar is still fundamentally overvalued against a number of currencies, particularly in the emerging markets,\u201d said Thomas Clarke, a portfolio manager of the William Blair Macro Allocation Fund.Does that mean investors should continue to look overseas? The short answer is yes, market strategists say. But it\u2019s complicated.The falling dollar is a double-edged sword for Americans investing abroad, said Harry W. Hartford, president of Causeway Capital Management.\u201cOn the one hand, if the dollar is weakening versus the euro or the yen or the Swiss franc, the value of your foreign investments is going to go up just on the currency alone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s another impact you cannot ignore.\u201dWhile the foreign funds held by American investors benefit from a currency tailwind, the international companies held within those funds face headwinds as they try to compete against United States businesses whose goods are cheaper because they\u2019re priced in dollars.Mr. Hartford notes that companies in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia and Far East Index (known as the MSCI EAFE) generate roughly 15 percent of their revenue in the United States and an additional 10 percent in emerging markets, where many currencies are at least partially linked to the dollar.\u201cThe benefits investors will have seen from the decline in the U.S. dollar could be offset by the translation effect on company revenues,\u201d he said.This doesn\u2019t imply that American stock investors should avoid foreign exposure, however.Regardless of how the dollar trades from here, shares of foreign companies are more attractively priced, on average, than domestic stocks.Domestic blue-chip equities, for example, are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 32, based on 10 years of averaged profits. That\u2019s twice as expensive as they\u2019ve historically been, according to Research Affiliates.By contrast, shares of foreign stocks based in developed economies such as Europe and Japan have a P/E of 17.5, which is a 30 percent discount from their historic median. Emerging market stocks are trading at a P/E of 15.\u201cI look on Europe as a bargain and the emerging markets as a bargain,\u201d said Robert D. Arnott, chairman and chief executive of Research Affiliates. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly happy about nondollar investments because they are cheap and the U.S. stock and bond markets are not.\u201dStill, to benefit from the gains a weak dollar produces while avoiding potential problems, investors may want to focus on specific types of companies \u2014 those domiciled abroad but whose profits are not going to be affected by any further decline in the currency.\u201cOne place to look is international small caps,\u201d said Mr. Ablin said, referring to shares of small companies domiciled abroad with a market value of around $3 billion or less. \u201cThese companies are denominated in foreign currencies. But because they are smaller, they tend to transact most of their business in their home markets.\u201dLast year, 93 percent of the health care company\u2019s revenue was generated in the eurozone and 99 percent in Western Europe, with a majority of sales based in its home country of France.Beyond smaller names, investors can also turn to foreign companies with commodity-based businesses.One important factor is inflation, which has bolstered commodity prices and is a big part of the explanation for the dollar\u2019s fall in the first place, said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.Mr. Paulsen points out that the dollar fell last year even though the Federal Reserve had been raising rates. Higher rates typically tend to attract more cash flows and lift a currency\u2019s value, but rising \u201cinflation destroys the value of the U.S. dollar,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said.Commodities, as well as other \u201creal assets\u201d like real estate, are viewed as an inflation hedge and tend to outperform in periods of dollar weakness. \u201cThey\u2019re joined at the hip,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said.One good example of a foreign commodity play: Royal Dutch Shell, the multinational oil and energy giant.Though headquartered in the Netherlands and incorporated in the United Kingdom, Royal Dutch Shell reports its earnings in dollars, because oil is priced in that currency.If the dollar is falling because inflation is picking up in the United States earlier than in other parts of the world, then emerging market stocks ought to benefit. Many parts of the emerging world \u2014 such as Latin America \u2014 are dependent on commodities. Moreover, emerging economies are more tied to manufacturing than consumption compared with the developed world, and rising inflation often squeezes consumer companies first.Since the dollar began to sink in January 2017, emerging market equity funds are up 37 percent, nearly twice the gains of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index during that time. And in an earlier stretch in which the dollar was weak \u2014 from 2002 to 2008 \u2014 emerging market funds trounced those focused on the United States by nearly 20 percentage points a year for six years.\u201cA weaker dollar is beneficial to international investments relative to the U.S.,\u201d said Mr. Paulsen. \u201cAnd that\u2019s more true for the emerging markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tired of Your Cubicle? Try a Trade", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter Hannah Grey of Pittsburgh earned an undergraduate degree in interior design, she spent several years working for an architectural firm as a commercial interior designer. \u201cI enjoyed it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it was definitely more of a desk job.\u201dThen she participated in a workshop for architects and designers. \u201cThe basis of the program was to show us how the blueprints we design actually translate to real life,\u201d said Ms. Grey, 38. It kicked in her memories of growing up in Bedford, Mass., in a mansard-style house built in 1840 and learning from her father how to repair and restore woodwork.\u201cIt was a fun thing I did with him, working with my hands and helping him fix things,\u201d she said.Switching from a white-collar position to learning a trade is a path that is getting more traction these days. \u201cI have met a lot of people in the program who have college degrees, worked in office jobs and have decided to do this,\u201d Ms. Grey said.Mr. Nobers said that he was seeing more people who had graduated from college and started a white-collar career moving into the trades. \u201cThey got out and worked for a few years and determined they didn\u2019t like what they were doing, or realized there was no real upside future,\u201d he said.Most transitioning workers learn the trade through an apprenticeship. These programs generally run from three to five years, based on a 2,000-hour year. That breaks down to 10 percent in the classroom, or 200 hours a year, where apprentices learn specific trade skills along with local building codes, blueprint reading, mathematics and more. The bulk of their time, 1,800 hours, is on the job, Mr. Nobers said.\u201cThese manufacturing apprenticeships are no longer blue-collar work,\u201d Mr. Kamm said, \u201cbut require highly technically advanced skills that include a great command of mathematics, physics, hydraulics, robotics and information technology.\u201dBy 2025, nearly three and a half million manufacturing jobs will likely need to be filled and the skills gap is expected to result in two million of those jobs going unfilled, according to the analysis. Factors contributing to the gap: baby boomer retirements and economic expansion.There is not a lot of hard data to suggest a big shift from white-collar workers into blue-collar jobs, but there is a strong push to recruit them.\u201cIf you talk to manufacturers, they will tell you they are working hard to change the image of manufacturing jobs from dirty, dangerous jobs to being quasi-white collar,\u201d said Paul Osterman, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-director of the M.I.T. Sloan Institute for Work and Employment Research. \u201cAnd today many of these workers need to be skilled with computers and statistical quality control processes. In some sense, manufacturing looks a lot more white-collar-ish than it used to.\u201dAnthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, said there was not a clear pathway to go from white collar to blue collar. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have some transferability between the skills you did in one job that transfer to the next job,\u201d Mr. Carnevale said. \u201cFor most people, there is very little transfer between white-collar work, and say, plumbing. There is some transferability, but it\u2019s rare.\u201dScott Lacerra, 37, of Rockford, Ill., is another rare one. He has a bachelor of science degree from Drake University, where he majored in finance. After college he worked as a credit analyst, but he said he was miserable crunching numbers on a spreadsheet all day and sitting in a cubicle.Three and a half years ago, he walked into a local manufacturing shop looking for new opportunities.Mr. Lacerra started as a part-time operator running a computer numeric controlled heavy machine. Soon he was driving a fork lift, making steel deliveries and training apprentices. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any experience, but I showed up every day and after a couple of weeks, I realized I really enjoyed it,\u201d he said.In May, he will complete his apprenticeship and be awarded a journeyman certificate as a C.N.C. precision machinist. \u201cWe pay for the classes and the books, which run $650 a class for 10 classes,\u201d said Ed Schroeder, the owner of RG Manufacturing and Machining. \u201cHe already had a college education, and people who have that can see the value in it and of striving to do more.\u201dMs. Grey said that as a college graduate and someone who had a job at an architecture firm, she was now very proud to tell people that this is what a woman in construction looks like. \u201cIt\u2019s not Bob the Builder,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Earth, Wind and Liars", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistThe point of his quip was that while we\u2019ve found ever more clever ways of pushing around bits of information, we are still living in a material world \u2014 and our command of that material world has advanced much less than most people expected a few decades ago. Where are the technologies transforming the way we deal with physical reality?Well, there is one area of physical technology, renewable energy, in which we really are seeing that kind of progress \u2014 progress that can both change the world and save it. Unfortunately, the people Thiel supports are trying to stop that progress from happening.Not that long ago, calls for a move to wind and solar power were widely perceived as impractical if not hippie-dippy silly. Some of that contempt lingers; my sense is that many politicians and some businesspeople still think of renewable energy as marginal, still imagine that real men burn stuff and serious people focus on good old-fashioned fossil fuels.But the truth is nearly the opposite, certainly when it comes to electricity generation. Believers in the primacy of fossil fuels, coal in particular, are now technological dead-enders; they, not foolish leftists, are our modern Luddites. Unfortunately, they can still do a lot of damage.And that\u2019s what businesses are learning to do, via a series of incremental improvements \u2014 better design, better materials, better locations (offshore is where it\u2019s at). So what we\u2019ll be seeing in a few years will be 850-foot turbines that totally outcompete fossil fuels on cost.To paraphrase the science-fiction writer William Gibson, the renewable energy future is already pretty much here; it\u2019s just not very evenly distributed.True, there are issues of intermittency remaining \u2014 the wind doesn\u2019t always blow, the sun doesn\u2019t always shine \u2014 although batteries and other energy storage technologies are also making rapid progress. There are also some energy uses, especially transportation, where fossil fuels retain a significant advantage in cost and convenience. And exactly how we\u2019re going to have carbon-neutral air travel is still, well, up in the air.For now, however, the problem isn\u2019t technology \u2014 it\u2019s politics.In the long run, these tactics probably won\u2019t stop the transition to renewable energy, and even the villains of this story probably realize that. Their goal is, instead, to slow things down, so they can extract as much profit as possible from their existing investments.Unfortunately, this really is a case of \u201cin the long run we are all dead.\u201d Every year that we delay the clean-energy transition will sicken or kill thousands while increasing the risk of climate catastrophe.The point is that Trump and company aren\u2019t just trying to move us backward on social issues; they\u2019re also trying to block technological progress.

That could increase the risk that the Fed will lift rates too quickly, choking off the recovery.\u201cThere\u2019s an immediate, knee-jerk reaction to tighten policy more,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley.The trade upheaval threatens to undermine an American economy that is at its strongest point since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. Employers have added jobs for 90 consecutive months, by far the longest streak on record; the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000.\u201cThe labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee expect it to remain strong,\u201d Mr. Powell said on Friday, referring to the Fed\u2019s policy group.Wage growth, weak for much of the recovery, ticked up in March, and Mr. Powell said he expected the gains to continue in the months ahead. And while workers would, without a doubt, like to see their pay rise more quickly, the gradual pace is comforting for some investors, who have been watching for any hints that the economy is overheating.In his speech, Mr. Powell said the Fed saw \u201cother signs of economic strength,\u201d citing \u201csteady income gains, rising household wealth and elevated consumer confidence,\u201d which he said would continue to support consumer spending.Other economists agreed, saying that the recently passed tax and spending measures give the economy added momentum. A full-blown trade war might be enough to short-circuit the recovery, they said, but isolated tariffs \u2014 even large ones \u2014 most likely are not.Certain categories are more vulnerable. Among the retaliatory moves announced by China are new tariffs on soybeans, which could hurt American farmers already struggling with low prices for their crops.Just the prospect of tariffs \u2014 even before they begin to take a direct bite \u2014 could hurt the economy if it makes corporate executives reluctant to invest.Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup, a staffing firm, said she was already hearing from clients that they are more hesitant to commit to major projects, at least until they see whether this week\u2019s skirmishes develop into an all-out trade war.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing the impact directly of tariffs yet, but we would say there\u2019s pretty broad conservatism as a result,\u201d she said.Mr. Powell said Fed policymakers, too, were conscious of concerns from corporate executives.\u201cWe did hear from a number of business leaders around the country that changes in trade policy had become a bit of a risk to the medium-term outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said in the question-and-answer session.Continued turmoil in financial markets could begin to hurt spending, especially among higher earners, who are more likely to own stocks. Ms. Zentner said surveys suggested that some high-income consumers had already become more pessimistic as markets have become more volatile.\u201cIt\u2019s starting to affect those groups, whose spending is more tied to the stock market,\u201d Ms. Zentner said. \u201cIf they simply pause their spending or become more prudent in their spending because of market volatility, it drags down consumer spending in the aggregate.\u201dMr. Powell, like his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, cast that gradual series of increases as a carefully planned strategy to ensure that the Fed will not need to raise rates abruptly in the event of a steep rise in inflation. But he also cautioned that policymakers could change course if necessary.\u201cOur views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIf the outlook changes, so will monetary policy. Our overarching objective will remain the same: fostering a strong economy for all Americans \u2014 one that provides plentiful jobs and low and stable inflation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Tries to Tamp Down Trade War Fears as China Retaliates", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 White House officials moved quickly on Wednesday to calm fears of a potential trade war with China, saying the administration\u2019s proposed tariffs were a \u201cthreat\u201d that would ultimately help, not hurt, the United States economy, hours after China said it would punish American products with similar levies.White House officials reiterated on Wednesday that China must stop the \u201cunfair\u201d trading practices President Trump believes have disadvantaged American companies and workers, but they held out the possibility that tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods outlined on Tuesday might never go into effect.Behind the scenes, however, top officials remained split over the administration\u2019s approach as the United States and China move into a period of high-stakes negotiations. That includes how far to go in punishing China and the types of concessions the White House should accept to avoid a protracted and damaging trade war.People familiar with the negotiations say Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, have at times argued for more dialogue with the Chinese and quicker concessions that would help diminish the trade deficit \u2014 the gap between what China ships to the United States and what America ships in the other direction. Other top trade advisers, including longtime China critics like Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, have taken a tougher stance, arguing that these changes would do little to address the mercantilist and protectionist trade policies China has adopted for decades.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers said the president remains resolute and views the pugilistic approach as the only way to force China to end two decades of industrial policies that have hollowed out American manufacturing and resulted in a ballooning trade deficit.\u201cWe are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S.,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!\u201dIt remains unclear whether China will bend to the pressure and make significant changes to its economy \u2014 or whether the White House strategy will instead tip the two nations into a trade war that could harm both countries. Producers of American goods like soybeans, pork, automobiles and semiconductors depend on access to the Chinese market both for exports and production and say they are fearful about a conflict.\u201cCompanies are definitely caught in the middle of this,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.Economists predict that the direct effects of the tariffs will be relatively small for both China and the United States, since they apply to only a fraction of each country\u2019s economic output.While tariffs would affect a small part of the overall United States economy, they impinge on a relatively large share of American exports to China. If China places tariffs on $50 billion of goods from the United States, as promised, that would be more than one-third of American exports to China. In contrast, American tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods would affect only one-tenth of China\u2019s vast exports to the United States.\u201cChina has many ways it can make life exceedingly uncomfortable for a large number of American businesses, both those that are hoping for access to China\u2019s fast-expanding market, and those that use China as an important part of their supply chains,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University.The Trump administration contends that if it does not challenge Beijing now, the Chinese government will heavily subsidize its companies to become dominant producers of cutting-edge industries from robotics to electric cars. That could imperil the United States\u2019 ability to create good-paying jobs for future generations, relegating the country to producing food, fossil fuels and financial services, while China extends its lead as the world\u2019s largest manufacturer.But the administration\u2019s strategy for halting China\u2019s rise has been hard to discern, with some advisers insisting that China must remake its economy, while others say the priority is to reduce the trade deficit, prioritize market access for American companies or end China\u2019s infringement on American intellectual property. Some top officials have indicated the tariffs may never be implemented.On Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, refused to say whether the tariffs would ultimately go into effect, adding, \u201cI would anticipate that if there are no changes to the behavior of China and they don\u2019t stop the unfair trade practices, then we would move forward.\u201dIn the meantime, American officials including Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Lighthizer have been in talks with the Chinese about ways to resolve their differences. Yet conversations have so far focused on concessions like China reducing tariffs on American cars, opening up its market for financial services and purchasing more semiconductors or natural gas \u2014 minor wins that are unlikely to satisfy Mr. Navarro and Mr. Lighthizer, who are pushing for significant and sweeping changes to China\u2019s market, according to people familiar with the negotiations.China experts say an inconsistent message and approach could undermine America\u2019s ability to successfully negotiate.\u201cWe\u2019re all over the map,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe Chinese are trying to take advantage of this lack of consensus and get the United States to take a quick deal that leaves China\u2019s industrial policy machine intact.\u201dBeijing is also eager to show other trading partners that it will not be bullied into changing its policies.\u201cI\u2019m not very positive about large concessions or changes that are going to come from China,\u201d said Heiwai Tang, an assistant professor of international economics at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. China\u2019s current government is more assertive than recent ones, he said, and the country is heavily dependent on technology transfers from advanced economies as it tries to transform its own.For the Chinese to successfully negotiate, analysts said, they have to be able to present the deal to their own people as a win. But the United States has refused to give concessions and has painted the confrontation as one in which China must ultimately lose.\u201cTariffs are seen as a direct slap in the face, and it will be very difficult for the Chinese government to sit back and take those blows without retaliating,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.On Wednesday, Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, said China preferred to resolve the conflict through talks but would keep its options open.\u201cNegotiation would still be our preference, but it takes two to tango,\u201d Mr. Cui said. \u201cWe will see what the U.S. will do.\u201dJim Tankersley and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a study in American decline.Bush did his duty in World War II as the Navy\u2019s youngest pilot and was shot down over the Pacific. Donald Trump shirked his duty in Vietnam, and we already know he doesn\u2019t like guys who were shot down.Bush zipped through Yale in two and a half years and was elected Phi Beta Kappa. Trump is \u201clike, really smart.\u201dBush married his teenage sweetheart at 20 and stayed married to her for 73 years. Trump stayed married to his first wife for 13 years, his second for five, and his current one (if you can call it a marriage) for 13, with all the assorted lecheries and abuses during and in between.Bush was the only G.O.P. congressman to see off Lyndon Johnson as the 36th president departed Washington in January 1969, a humane gesture for a broken man from the opposing party. Trump couldn\u2019t bring himself to invite a single congressional Democrat to his state dinner with Macron.Bush presided adroitly over a high-water mark of American power and influence, a remarkable four-year stretch that included the collapse of the Soviet Union, the creation of Nafta, lightning victory in the Gulf War and the rescue of the Kurds. Trump is all that in reverse: the looming collapse of Nafta, the resurgence of Russia, an incoherent policy in the Middle East and prospective abandonment of the Kurds.Bush believes in the virtues of bipartisanship in substance. Trump believes in it only for show. Bush husbanded and enhanced American credibility on the world stage. Trump squanders it. Bush is a respecter of civic institutions. Trump is a destroyer of them.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]These contrasts don\u2019t mean that Bush was without blemish: As Meacham notes, there were political misjudgments and calculated concessions to ambition on the long path to power. Nor does it mean that Trump doesn\u2019t have his own kind of strengths, not the least of which is his loudly declared indifference to elite opinion.The Bush model was about proving one\u2019s worth and paying one\u2019s dues. The Trump model is about the vain boast and the savage put-down. It\u2019s either Hadrian or Caligula: Whose regime would you rather live under?The intense interest in Barbara Bush\u2019s funeral, as well as the concern for President Bush\u2019s health, no doubt reflects the ordinary human sympathy for a couple that has been such an enduring part of our common political landscape. But it reflects something else, too: They \u2014 that \u2014 was what we once were, too, at least at our striving best. In the age of Trump it\u2019s a reason for mourning and nostalgia, along with a prayer for resurrection.Advertisement"}

This is only possible if emissions peak by 2020 and decline rapidly thereafter. Every industrial sector, as well as country, must play its part in reaching the goal. And international shipping is the last big sector regulated by the United Nations to act.Unfortunately, some countries that advocate the merits of climate action elsewhere are not singing from the same song sheet at the I.M.O., where talks are already underway.The Marshall Islands first proposed an industrywide target to curb shipping\u2019s rising emissions in the lead-up to the 2015 Paris climate conference. The Marshall Islands may be a tiny, climate-vulnerable nation of low-lying islands and atolls threatened by rising seas, but it also hosts the world\u2019s second-largest shipping registry and is almost entirely reliant on sea transportation for food and other crucial supplies. Given all this, perhaps no country is better placed to highlight the need to act, and to do so in a way that is economically sustainable.In Paris, the Marshall Islands went on to form a High Ambition Coalition of progressive countries that was pivotal to securing the final agreement. That coalition is mobilizing once again, with the Pacific Island nations, the Caribbean, Latin American countries, Europe and others already working together to ensure a similarly strong outcome next week. While the Marshall Islands may be one of the countries most at risk from climate change, no country will be safe.Countries truly committed to climate action will not accept anything less than a strong deal next week. But despite efforts by the I.M.O.\u2019s secretary general, Kitack Lim, tackling shipping emissions still remains far down in the political in-tray of too many countries.To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change across the globe, we cannot forget about international shipping.

How about you?The strike really was classic Trump: A show of force mainly for the sake of show, without any strategy behind it. Iran has entrenched itself in Syria alongside Russia, while Israel is quietly preparing for war on its northern front. The administration looks likely to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal next month, but little thought seems to have been given to what comes after. In all, just another reminder that the Trump disaster is global.Now, let\u2019s be cowards and talk about domestic issues. Can we start with Paul Ryan? You wrote a wonderful column about what a weenie he\u2019s being by bailing out at this crucial moment. But I think we still disagree about his overall career.

Seems to be a pattern.I agree that if Ryan had control of \u2026 the world \u2026 he would pass a balanced budget with low taxes and slashed entitlements. But the reason he can\u2019t do that isn\u2019t just the Democrats. It\u2019s all his own party members, who are well aware their constituents would go bonkers if they tried to cut Social Security or Medicare. Pretending that\u2019s going to happen is just faking.It would probably be good for our politics in general if we just owned up to the fact that we aren\u2019t going to get our fiscal virginity back and have a real argument about spending priorities rather than a fake one about budgetary virtue. We\u2019re not going to pay down the debt in our lifetimes. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have a thriving economy to make sure we\u2019re able to finance it.So that\u2019s my pro-Comey thought. On the other hand, I came of age during the J. Edgar Hoover period, when the idea of a we-rule-the-world F.B.I. was very scary. And Comey is a self-centric dude who is not the ideal person to run an agency that has so much power.My third thought is that whenever I mull the Clinton-Comey story, I return to the fact that Anthony Weiner changed the course of American history. Yipes.I was never a Comey fan: I wrote a long editorial for The Wall Street Journal opposing his nomination as F.B.I. director back when Barack Obama appointed him in 2013. Comey\u2019s behavior in 2016 was a long series of legal misjudgments and political blunders that wound up costing Hillary Clinton the election.That said, I fear that Comey is damaging himself \u2014 and the credible case he makes against the president \u2014 by putting his obvious distaste for Trump into the service of selling his book.

{"Headline": "Finland Has Second Thoughts About Giving Free Money to Jobless People", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 For more than a year, Finland has been testing the proposition that the best way to lift economic fortunes may be the simplest: Hand out money without rules or restrictions on how people use it.Now, the experiment is ending. The Finnish government has opted not to continue financing it past this year, a reflection of public discomfort with the idea of dispensing government largess free of requirements that its recipients seek work.Finland has actually reversed course on that front this year, adopting rules that threaten to cut benefits for jobless people unless they actively look for work or engage in job training.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that it will end like this,\u201d said Olli Kangas, who oversees research at Kela, a Finnish government agency that administers many social welfare programs and has played a leading role in the basic-income experiment. \u201cThe government has chosen to try a totally different path. Basic income is unconditional. Now, they are pursuing conditionality.\u201dIn much of the world, the concept of basic income retains appeal as a potential way to more justly spread the bounty of global capitalism while cushioning workers against the threat of robots and artificial intelligence taking their jobs.But the Finnish government\u2019s decision to halt the experiment at the end of 2018 highlights a challenge to basic income\u2019s very conception. Many people in Finland \u2014 and in other lands \u2014 chafe at the idea of handing out cash without requiring that people work.\u201cThere is a problem with young people lacking secondary education, and reports of those guys not seeking work,\u201d said Heikki Hiilamo, a professor of social policy at the University of Helsinki. \u201cThere is a fear that with basic income they would just stay at home and play computer games.\u201dFor centuries, thinkers across the ideological spectrum have embraced the notion of basic income. It has gained favor with the social philosopher Thomas More, the laissez faire economist Milton Friedman and the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., an unusual diversity of support that has enhanced the appeal of the idea as a modern-day solution to economic anxiety in much of the world.Silicon Valley technologists have suggested that basic income could enable humanity to exploit the labor-saving promise of robots absent the fear of mass joblessness.Labor advocates have focused on basic income as a means of increasing bargaining power among workers, limiting the pressure for people to accept poverty wages at dead-end jobs.Other people have advanced basic income as a way of enabling parents to spend more time with their children.Finland\u2019s goals have been modest and pragmatic. The government hoped that basic income would send more people into the job market to revive a weak economy.Under Finland\u2019s traditional unemployment program, those lacking jobs are effectively discouraged from accepting temporary positions or starting businesses, because extra income risks the loss of their benefits.The basic income trial, which started at the beginning of 2017 and will continue until the end of this year, has given monthly stipends of 560 euros ($685) to a random sample of 2,000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58. Recipients have been free to do as they wished \u2014 create start-ups, pursue alternate jobs, take classes \u2014 secure in the knowledge that the stipends would continue regardless.The Finnish government was keen to see what people would do under such circumstances. The data is expected to be released next year, giving academics a chance to analyze what has come of the experiment.In the meantime, Finland has already moved on to consider a broader revamping of its social service programs. It is studying a new form of social welfare policy now in effect in Britain: so-called universal credit, which rolls existing government aid programs into one monthly lump sum payment.\u201cThe social security system is fragmented and has a lot of bureaucracy,\u201d said Liisa Heinamaki,who is overseeing a project exploring ways to reorganize that system. \u201cDiscussion about basic income is not over, but it is a part of the larger discussion now.\u201dIn Britain, the shift to universal credit has poor people reeling, depriving many of them of government support while their cases shift from the old system. Benefits have increased for some people, but many recipients have wound up with less.In Finland, where the social safety net is famously generous, a structure like Britain\u2019s could yield the very thing basic income is supposed to deliver: a guarantee that every member of society can be assured of sustenance and shelter.This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant.Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth.\u201cIn a sense,\u201d said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, \u201cFinland already has basic income.\u201dMari-Leena Kuosa contributed reporting from Helsinki.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steven Mnuchin Will Head to China as Trade Tensions Mount", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he was optimistic that the United States could reach a deal with China. But he warned that if the Asian nation did not live up to its promises to open its markets, his administration would proceed with the tariffs he has threatened to impose on as much as $150 billion worth of Chinese products.\u201cI think China is very serious, and we\u2019re very serious,\u201d Mr. Trump said between meetings with President Emmanuel Macron of France. \u201cWe have no choice but to be very serious.\u201dMr. Trump said that the United States delegation was making the trip at China\u2019s request and that he was heartened by recent remarks by its president, Xi Jinping, suggesting that he was prepared to open his country\u2019s economy to more foreign investment and ease restrictions on imports of American cars.The two economic giants have been locked in a tit-for-tat battle over tariffs, with the United States threatening to tax Chinese products like TVs and medical devices and the Chinese retaliating with tariffs on pork and threatening to impose additional penalties on soybeans and other American goods.The Chinese view Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Kudlow, who both previously worked on Wall Street, as potentially more moderate voices who would be more reluctant to start a trade conflict that could damage American businesses and cause stock markets to plunge. They hope the two men will be more sympathetic to offers to open up China\u2019s financial market and reduce its trade surplus by making purchases of American natural gas and other products, people briefed on the deliberations said.Mr. Navarro and Mr. Lighthizer, meanwhile, have criticized China\u2019s offerings and insisted that the Chinese make more sweeping changes to its economy, including removing industrial subsidies and rolling back government intervention in the economy.Next month, the Treasury Department is expected to release a plan to further restrict Chinese investment in American companies, including industries such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence that are sensitive for national security reasons. The rules could also restrict American partnerships with Chinese companies abroad.But Mr. Xi has also signaled that he is open to negotiating with Mr. Trump. He said this month that China would reduce its tariffs on autos, which Mr. Mnuchin called \u201ca big step in the right direction.\u201dWhile some trade experts warned that China has failed to deliver on such promises before, Mr. Trump insisted on Tuesday that he was encouraged about the possibility of a deal.\u201cPresident Xi made a speech four days ago where he said that China is going to be opened up,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not opened up right now. They trade with us. We can\u2019t trade with them.\u201dSome China analysts were not so impressed by Mr. Xi\u2019s speech. \u201cI thought it was a bunch of warmed-over repetition of things we had heard before,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cFor me, the concern is that the level of mixed messaging that we\u2019re sending the Chinese makes them expect that they can get through this with a very limited offer.\u201dEdward Mills, a public policy analyst at Raymond James Financial, said he still viewed negotiations that averted tariffs as the most likely outcome. That could include, for example, China promising to reduce tariffs on American cars, open up its financial sector and drop rules that require American companies to partner with Chinese firms in many industries. But the negotiations could drag out for months, damaging business relations.Mr. Trump \u201chasn\u2019t actually identified what he wants as the end game\u201d of the negotiations, Mr. Mills said. \u201cI think that is something that gives a lot of flexibility to Mnuchin and the president to declare a number of things as a victory.\u201dSome veterans of trade talks with China caution that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach could backfire.\u201cI think that it\u2019s very dangerous to get into a tit-for-tat war in trade, because even if your goal is to be moderate and proportional in response, one thing can lead to another and it can get out of control,\u201d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, told CNBC last week.However, Paul H. O\u2019Neill, who was President George W. Bush\u2019s first Treasury secretary and traveled to China for talks in 2001, said it was a good sign that the American delegation was making the trip. Negotiations with Chinese officials tend to be well choreographed, he said, so it is likely that the dimensions of a trade agreement are starting to take shape.\u201cThere\u2019s already been endless conversations, and tweets, from our side,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said in an interview. \u201cThey are shadow dancing with each other, but behind the scenes where we can\u2019t see what is going on, apparently they are making some progress.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Trade War, China Might Boycott U.S. Goods. That Could Backfire.", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAICANG, China \u2014 If China calls for a boycott of American goods, Chinese workers like David Xu could be in trouble.Mr. Xu is one of thousands of residents of this port town who cash paychecks from American companies. He works as a technician at a Procter & Gamble manufacturing and distribution center here, one of the company\u2019s biggest in China. Across town, Nike has opened a huge distribution center, its largest in Asia.In all, more than 40 other American companies have set up shop here, making chemicals, lighters and a broad range of other products for a Chinese market eager for American goods.\u201cThere is no deep hatred for American companies,\u201d said Mr. Xu, who has worked for Procter & Gamble for 13 years. \u201cThe impact of this trade conflict shouldn\u2019t be big. After all, American companies bring so many conveniences to the lives of Chinese people.\u201dA Boycott America plan could be much tougher to pull off.While competition from Chinese-made smartphones is rising, iPhones remain popular. Shopping mall developers, eager for the extra cachet, clamor for Starbucks to open stores. Nike dominates the sportswear market in China. Chevrolet is one of the country\u2019s most popular brands.And notably, many of those products are made by Chinese workers. Factories in China assemble iPhones, stitch up Nike apparel and footwear and make Chevrolets and Fords. It isn\u2019t clear how many jobs this creates, but the American Chamber of Commerce in China said that more than one-third of its 800-plus member companies have more than 1,000 employees in the country.\u201cChina needs the U.S., the U.S. needs China,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China. \u201cWe are joined at the hip economically.\u201dThe United States has also supplied much of the investment underpinning China\u2019s economic growth. Between 1990 and 2017, America pumped more than $250 billion into China, according to a report by the Rhodium Group and the National Committee on United States-China Relations.\u201cThe U.S. multinationals have been playing a very critical part of China\u2019s development story, providing investment, technology, brands,\u201d said Erlend Ek, trade research manager of China Policy, a Beijing-based advisory firm. \u201cThey have a very good relationship with each other.\u201dThere\u2019s another reason that Beijing may be reluctant to try a boycott: American multinationals are aiding the Chinese government in some important projects. IBM and Walmart, for example, are collaborating with the e-commerce company JD.com and Tsinghua University to improve food safety in China, a priority for Beijing.That isn\u2019t to say that the idea is off the table.\u201cThe patriotism and collectivism of the Chinese people will likely play a role,\u201d the newspaper said in an editorial last month. \u201cAnd the slogans to boycott American cars and other big commodities may ring through the Chinese internet and get a response.\u201dStill, China has other ways to strike back without involving consumers.Tu Xinquan, the dean of the China Institute for W.T.O. Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, warned that the possibility of a consumer boycott on American goods \u201ccannot be ruled out.\u201d\u201cBut perhaps once the battle begins, it\u2019s possible that we wouldn\u2019t even need the people to wage the boycott, because the government\u2019s measures could be powerful enough,\u201d Mr. Tu said.Consumers in China can be a potent force. In 2012, Chinese nationalists wrecked Japanese stores and car dealerships and boycotted Japanese cars because of a territorial dispute, hurting sales for years. In 2016, online vendors stopped selling dried mangoes from the Philippines after a United Nations tribunal ruled in favor of Manila in another territorial dispute.\u201cBecause of the structure of the government and the political power of the party, they can call for a boycott and get a pretty good response,\u201d Mr. Zarit said. \u201cSo that concerns me.\u201dTaicang, a 90-minute drive from Shanghai, underscores how interdependent the two economies are.Some of the biggest names in corporate America, like Honeywell and Exxon Mobil, have converged on this city of close to a million people. Its economy is growing faster than the country\u2019s as a whole. It is richer than Shanghai on a per-capita basis. Last year, Taicang topped a list of China\u2019s 10 happiest \u201ccounty-level cities\u201d for the second year in a row.In a sprawling factory, Procter & Gamble makes its Head & Shoulders, Pantene and Vidal Sassoon shampoos and then distributes them along with other cosmetics and skin care products. When the factory opened, the company said it would provide 1,500 jobs for Chinese workers. Across town is a 200,000-square-meter Nike logistics center, which that company has also said would employ 1,500 people.In total, 42 American factories are in the Taicang economic development zone, with a total annual output value of about $4.7 billion, the government of the much larger city of Suzhou, which administers Taicang, said in February.The influx of money can be seen in the relative affluence of the Procter & Gamble employees, most of whom drive Japanese-made cars to work. One female employee, surnamed Li, said workers were confident that what they made in the factory would appeal to Chinese consumers, who she said were rational about what they bought.\u201cDue to the integration of the economies, whatever China does to the U.S. will end up hurting itself,\u201d Ms. Cui said.Elsie Chen contributed research.Advertisement"}

An English-language channel affiliated with China Central Television, the state broadcaster, reported on Twitter that the bus had fallen from a bridge.

{"Headline": "Convict History Matters in Australia. But What Else?", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 55______Our guides gave us clues more than conclusions. They pointed to the garden for guards\u2019 families, set up to resemble an English country estate. They told us about punishment. They shared tales of individual prisoners and the British commandants who ran the place.But it was the cemetery just off the coast that lingered in my mind.Port Arthur\u2019s upper-class overseers called it Isle of the Dead or Isle de Mort, and they were buried with headstones on the island\u2019s highest point.The convicts just called it Dead Island. Their remains landed in unmarked graves near the water so their watchmen, our guide told us, \u201ccould look down on them in death as in life.\u201dSome of the convicts probably deserved it. But walking among Port Arthur\u2019s dead, it was hard to escape the sanctimonious rigidity of the English class system, made even more extreme by the culture of 19th-century incarceration.I found myself imagining a prisoner who had arrived young, grinding out a 10-year sentence under the harsh condescension of British soldiers. He\u2019d depart with a skill \u2014 Port Arthur was basically an industrial labor camp \u2014 but how could he not also leave with a deep disgust for class distinctions and authority?Here, I thought, lie the roots of Australia\u2019s egalitarian ethos, traced back to a visceral rejection of the hierarchy that defined prison settlements like Port Arthur.This, after all, was the place for castoffs. Delinquent boys as young as 9 and troubled men with wives and children (not to mention a few meddlesome Irish and American activists) were all shipped off in former slave ships and put to work here in a country that was not easy to tame.The challenges of the land required camaraderie. The British system enforced divisions, putting a small elite above a mass of rebels and rogues. No wonder that those who stayed in Australia preferred to see themselves as \u201cmates\u201d more than gentlemen.Nick Dyrenfurth, a historian who wrote \u201cMateship: A Very Australian History,\u201d has argued that convicts were the first to embrace the concept.American culture bears a similar imprint. We like to see ourselves as revolutionaries who defeated British pomp and monarchy with guerrilla war tactics and demands for equality.But, of course, history is a forever struggle. What we choose to promote and overlook often changes, and reveals more than we may intend.Tasmania\u2019s convict past was also sidestepped for decades, with Port Arthur left in ruins before becoming what it is today: an impressive apparatus for remembering, complete with a ferry, interactive exhibit for children and well-trained guides.But seeing Port Arthur transformed raises additional questions. (The mass shooting that happened here in 1996 is a subject for another day.)His critique was not with remembering the Great War\u2019s heroes, but rather with the lack of investment in other elements of the country\u2019s past \u2014 one glaring blind spot in particular.\u201cWe could ask why \u2014 if we were actually genuine about remembering patriots who have died for this country \u2014 why would we not first spend $100 million on a museum honoring the at least 65,000 estimated Indigenous dead who so tragically lost their lives defending their country here in Australia in the frontier wars of the 1800s?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is there nowhere in Australia telling the stories of the massacres, the dispossession and the courageous resistance of these patriots?\u201dHis full argument goes beyond questions and critique (though there are plenty of both). He also offers a path forward and a measure of hope even for those who disagree with him.And it\u2019s rooted in what I observed on Dead Island, in the way that the rigidity of one era had given birth to something more fluid, more equal and new.\u201cWe pretend that our national identity is a fixed, frozen thing,\u201d Richard said. \u201cBut Australia is a molten idea.\u201dIn other words, history matters not just because it never disappears, but also because it does not dictate. It can prompt change.The question is: How?I\u2019d love to hear about your views on that \u2014 and about your experiences with Australian history.When did you connect with the past in a way that felt real and revealing? Or when have you thought the process of remembering needed to evolve?Now for some of my favorite stories this week, and a recommendation we know you\u2019ll love.______Does the past hold too much sway for all of us, or just those who romanticize a rugged cruel occupation?__________________Time to mix it up: Here are a few things I\u2019ve been reading beyond The New York Times \u2026______\u201cA Quiet Place\u201d seems to be a local and international favorite.Advertisement"}

Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, over his attempt to unmask a whistle-blower within the bank.The bank, however, said it would continue to stand by its top executive, who has been tasked with bringing stability to the three-centuries-old institution after years of management turmoil.Barclays said that two British regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, had fined Mr. Staley, though it did not disclose the amount. The regulators also required Barclays to submit reports on parts of its whistle-blowing program, the bank said, though it added that the regulators did not take any action against Barclays itself.But Barclays said the regulators did not demand that he resign, nor that he acted with a lack of integrity or was not fit to remain the bank\u2019s chief executive.The two regulators said in a brief statement that they had concluded their investigations and had issued \u201cdraft warning notices in respect to the C.E.O.,\u201d but did not provide further details.Barclays stood by its hiring.

Many people don\u2019t even know these scandals exist \u2014 they generally don\u2019t lead in Sean Hannity\u2019s or Tucker Carlson\u2019s world.Sure, there is a little rumbling about the increased deficit, but not much. Besides, it\u2019s the fault of Congress, in particular the Democrats.But people here \u2014 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 are paying great attention to what President Trump is doing economically, especially since he started in on tariffs. We have a strong manufacturing base in our county; when tariffs on aluminum and steel were announced, local manufacturing leaders tried to be diplomatic, praising the Trump tax cuts but saying the steel and aluminum tariffs would hurt their businesses by driving costs up.One smaller manufacturer \u2014 a Trump voter \u2014 told me that his costs to produce his product nearly doubled overnight, and that his business has already been hurt by the tariffs. Prices didn\u2019t rise only after the tariffs were announced; they started rising when Mr. Trump floated the idea.Mr. Trump has waffled on the renewable fuel standard before \u2014 ethanol is big around here \u2014 and Iowa\u2019s entire congressional delegation and the governor\u2019s office pressured him to renew it. We know he will waffle again, and potentially end it.I\u2019m focusing on the area I know, rural Iowa, but if the president stays on course with the tariffs, the impacts will hit many rural areas all over America, what I call Trumplandia.\u201cIt gives Democrats a generational opportunity to do the political work with farmers they haven\u2019t done since the 1980s farm crisis,\u201d said Matt Russell, a rural sociologist and farmer in Iowa. \u201cDemocrats do farm policy really well but are terrible at farm politics. Republicans do farm politics really well but have a history of doing terrible farm policy.\u201dHarvest will be coming in when members of Congress, in recess, return to Iowa to campaign. They will be getting earfuls from rural constituents about the economic impacts of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs.The president\u2019s position is actually quite precarious. He\u2019s already at a historic low approval rating. With the multiple scandals, rampant corruption and the Mueller investigation, the only thing keeping him near 40 percent approval \u2014 and most important, approval among most Republicans \u2014 is a strong economy. That, and Fox cheerleading. But if he tanks the rural economy, he and his legacy are in deep trouble.Furthermore, if the rural economy turns sour, much of rural America will abandon Mr. Trump, and Fox may have no choice but to follow.Then it\u2019s just a matter of time before they will turn with the hope that a Trump impeachment and a Pence presidency will save the economy, the conservative gains that have been made under Trump, and the Republican Party.

{"Headline": "Why Laundromats Are the Hot New Place to Hang Out in Hong Kong", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHong Kong JournalHONG KONG \u2014 On a bustling Hong Kong street lined with dried seafood stores, where baskets of sea cucumber vie for space with scallops and abalone, one shop stands out. Amid the pungent smells of dried fish and shrimp, the scents of brewed coffee and freshly laundered clothes come wafting out of the aptly named Coffee & Laundry.The shop \u2014 half laundromat and half cafe \u2014 offers customers a variety of drinks and pastries along with 10 self-service washing machines and dryers.Washing their own clothes at a laundromat is a new experience for Hong Kong residents. The first self-service laundromat is believed to have opened only in 2014. Since then, the number has taken off; more than 180 laundromats had appeared by the beginning of this year, according to one estimate.For a long time, the answer was high above Hong Kong\u2019s bustling city streets. Laundry hung out to dry on poles sticking out from the sides of buildings was so ubiquitous that it was jokingly called Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cnational flag.\u201dThat began to change in the 1980s, when washing machines and dryers became affordable as Hong Kong got wealthier, buoyed by the opening up of China\u2019s economy and the city\u2019s establishment as a major financial center.Walk around Hong Kong\u2019s public housing blocks and old tenement buildings today, and it quickly becomes clear that many residents still hang their clothes outside to dry. But rising incomes have allowed much of Hong Kong\u2019s population to move into sleek, glass apartment towers, without all the visible hanging laundry.Now, as housing prices grow ever more expensive per square foot, the challenge is no longer affording the washing and drying machines themselves, but finding the space to put them.One result was a surge in demand for drop-off service at commercial laundries, which have long been common in Hong Kong. That led to such a backlog at some laundries that some customers faced days-long waits just to get their clothes back.Enter self-service laundromats.On a recent evening after work, Michael Bolger, 27, sat reading a dog-eared book while waiting for his clothes at Coffee & Laundry.Mr. Bolger, a native of Ireland who works at a bitcoin exchange, said that when he first moved to Hong Kong in 2016, his flat was too small to fit a dryer, and the humidity prevented his clothes from drying properly on a line. For a while he used a drop-off laundry, but his clothes would sometimes come back with tears and stains.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to just sit and read in a place that\u2019s not your apartment,\u201d he said of Coffee & Laundry. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of therapeutic, sitting here and watching the washing machines.\u201dNot far from Coffee & Laundry is a branch of LaundrYup, a local chain of self-service laundromats. The shop, steps away from a street full of antique stores, is tiny and strictly functional, with shiny white floor tiles, bright fluorescent lights and a single red bench. Instead of a cafe, there are lockers rented out to SF Express, a logistics company sometimes referred to as China\u2019s FedEx.Patten Mak, the chain\u2019s operations manager, said the combination of high demand and low maintenance and labor costs made it possible for even a tiny laundromat to earn the equivalent of thousands of dollars per month, enough to entice new chains to enter the market.Across the harbor, in the working-class neighborhood of Tai Kok Tsui, a woman tapped away at a game of mah-jongg on her phone while waiting for her sheets to dry at a branch of Water Laundry, another local chain. Nearly every inch of the wall in the small laundromat was covered with machines.\u201cUs working class, we don\u2019t have the money to buy a washing machine, and there\u2019s no space to dry clothes at home,\u201d said the 40-year-old housewife, who gave her name as Ms. Lo. She said she lived in a cramped 90-square-foot subdivided flat with her husband.\u201cThis is an economic problem,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t use this kind of laundromat if you have money.\u201dThe spread of laundromats has begun to alter the social fabric of the city as laundry, which was once conducted in private, has been forced into the public realm, said Jianxiang Huang, a professor in the Department of Urban Planning and Design at the University of Hong Kong.\u201cThis is essentially changing the way people socialize, the way people live their lives, changing their mind-sets,\u201d Mr. Huang said.That is exactly the goal of Mr. Lo, the co-founder of Coffee & Laundry, who said he wanted his shop to be as much a neighborhood hangout as a place to wash clothes. To this end, he has put tables on the sidewalk and scheduled events like an exhibition of a local comic book artist.On a recent evening, there was a steady trickle of customers going in and out of Coffee & Laundry. Some milled around in slippers and pajama pants, counting down the last few minutes of the dryer cycle. Others said they had come for the coffee and ambience.\u201cNow in Hong Kong, people aren\u2019t always very neighborly,\u201d Mr. Lo said. Since opening Coffee & Laundry, however, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know my neighbors and the owners of dried seafood shops nearby,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It will also give Mexico greater access to an advanced consumer market, as negotiations with the Trump administration over the modernization of the North American Free Trade Agreement still appear to be on uncertain ground.And it sends a message to Mr. Trump that some of America\u2019s closest trading partners are moving ahead with deals of their own \u2014 potentially leaving American exporters on the losing end in foreign markets.In its announcement, Mexico said the agreement would help modernize its existing commercial relationship.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said in a statement that \u201ctrade can and should be a win-win process and today\u2019s agreement shows just that.\u201d He added, \u201cWith this agreement, Mexico joins Canada, Japan and Singapore in the growing list of partners willing to work with the E.U. in defending open, fair and rules-based trade.\u201dThe European Union and Mexico said they had reached an agreement in principle on the most important elements of the agreement, with some technical details yet to be resolved. They are aiming to finalize it by year\u2019s end, after which it must be ratified by the European Parliament and the Mexican Senate.The original trade pact, signed in 1997, was relatively narrow, mainly eliminating tariffs on cars and machinery. The deal came into force in 2000 and was the first free trade pact between Europe and a Latin American country.Since then, the European Union has added 13 members, and the internet has dramatically changed global business. In May 2016, the countries started negotiations to update the pact. The revised deal adds in a variety of new rules governing agricultural goods, telecommunications, digital trade, intellectual property, climate change, anti-corruption measures, finance and energy.The deal is particularly notable for giving Mexico access to another wealthy market similar to the United States. The European Union is Mexico\u2019s second-biggest export market after the United States. Yet it is a distant second to the United States, where roughly 80 percent of Mexican exports go.\u201cThe E.U. has for at least 10 years been knocking on the door of Mexico to upgrade the trade agreement, and it is only very recently that they have come along,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly obvious that what has prompted them to change their minds is Donald Trump.\u201dBoth Europe and Mexico have actively been pushing forward with new trade deals amid a global resurgence of skepticism about the benefits of free trade.Mexico remains part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal that President Trump criticized and withdrew from on his fourth day in office. The remaining members, including Canada, Japan, Australia and Chile, signed a deal without the United States in March. Mexico is also negotiating with Argentina and Brazil, and has sought out potential alternatives to purchases of American grain and meat if Nafta were to fall apart.Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Milan Schreuer from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Democracy Became the Enemy", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "OpinionIn Hungary and Poland, the liberal West used to be the promised land. Not anymore.Supported byMr. Cohen is an opinion columnist.\u00a0He wrote this\u00a0article after a recent visit to Poland and Hungary.Hungary had a horrendous 20th century of lost territory and freedom, but Budapest, a handsome city set on a broad sweep of the Danube, suggests its wounds have healed. Trams hum along boulevards lined with elegant cafes and clogged with the cars German companies manufacture here. The country has escaped what Milan Kundera, the Czech writer, called the \u201ckidnapped West,\u201d the great swath of Europe yielded to the Soviet empire after World War II, and has returned to the Western family.Or so it seems, until you notice the posters of a smiling Hungarian-American Jew, his arms around opposition politicians who brandish wire-cutters and have cut through a fence.The man in question is George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist. He\u2019s not on any ballot, but his international renown and funding of liberal causes has made him the chosen symbol, for Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his right-wing Fidesz party, of all they loathe: international speculators, sappers of nation and Christendom, facilitators of mass migration.As a young man, Orban fought against Bolshevism. Western liberal democracy was the Promised Land. Now it has morphed into the enemy. The West is the site of European cultural suicide, the place where family, church, nation and traditional notions of marriage and gender go to die.\u201cThe danger is threatening us from the West,\u201d Orban, who has been in power for eight years and is seemingly headed for re-election Sunday, said in February. \u201cThis danger to us comes from politicians in Brussels, Berlin and Paris.\u201dTo counter it, the Hungarian prime minister has established a template: Neutralize an independent judiciary. Subjugate much of the media. Demonize migrants. Create loyal new elites through crony capitalism. Energize a national narrative of victimhood and heroism through the manipulation of historical memory. Claim the \u201cpeople\u2019s will\u201d overrides constitutional checks and balances.And, lo, the new Promised Land: competitive authoritarianism, a form of European single-party rule that retains a veneer of democracy while skewing the contest sufficiently to ensure it is likely to yield only one result.There\u2019s no totalitarian secret police. Nobody disappears in the night. Foreign capital is welcome. Hungary is not unfree but it\u2019s not free either. It\u2019s the new semi-closed hybrid of Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the shadowy leader of the conservative governing Law and Justice Party in Poland, both of whom fought as youths for the liberty the West embodied.[To read more about the threat of authoritarianism around the world, read Madeleine Albright on Donald Trump.]Donald Trump\u2019s election was part of a worldwide nationalist and autocratic lurch. A vigorous counterrevolution against the liberal-democratic orthodoxy of diversity and multiculturalism is underway. The fact that Trump reflects, and reinforces, this broad movement, exactly a half-century after the heady flowering of every liberty in 1968, suggests he will be much harder to dislodge than many liberals imagine. Orban was the first European leader to back Trump during his campaign and celebrated his victory as the end of \u201cliberal non-democracy.\u201d Trump called Orban \u201cstrong and brave\u201d in a meeting with the Hungarian ambassador, according to the Hungarian magazine Figyelo.The European nations most enamored of freedom \u2014 those released three decades ago from the withering grip of the Soviet empire \u2014 have transformed into those most skeptical that liberal democracy provides it. It\u2019s an extraordinary turn. The Brussels-based European Union (of which Hungary has been a member and financial beneficiary since 2004) and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany are viewed in Hungary with greater suspicion than Vladimir Putin. Poland, the most populous Central European state, has so embraced the Hungarian model that Kaczynski calls it the \u201cexample.\u201d The Czech Republic may not be far behind.Orban, who attended Oxford as a young man on a Soros-funded scholarship, has hailed \u201ca new era\u201d reflecting a popular desire for democracies that are not open. Adam Bodnar, Poland\u2019s embattled ombudsman in Warsaw, suggested to me that \u201cHungary has shown there\u2019s no need to introduce a typical authoritarian system. You can control what happens without it.\u201dOne of the politicians embraced by Soros in the election posters around Budapest is Bernadett Szel, a co-leader of the Green Party. She told me she has never met Soros. The image is a fake. According to Laura Silber, the spokeswoman for Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, it has been \u201cdoctored to make Soros\u2019s nose longer \u2014 right out of the Goebbels playbook.\u201dSzel, who is trying to unite Hungary\u2019s chronically splintered opposition against Fidesz, said Orban \u201cis poisoning Hungary day by day.\u201d A member of the Parliament\u2019s National Security Committee, she faces a smear campaign from Fidesz politicians determined to oust her. She fears for her country. \u201cOrban,\u201d she told me, \u201cis becoming a pharaoh who wants to adopt the Russian, Turkish or Chinese model.\u201dFor such a project, Orban needs enemies. Thousands of migrants, many fleeing the war in Syria, straggling through Hungary in the late summer of 2015, encamped for weeks at Budapest\u2019s main railway station, provided them. Merkel\u2019s decision to admit so many, made of German \u201cWillkommenskultur,\u201d or welcoming culture, the \u201csurrender\u201d Orban would define himself against. It was a pivotal European moment.No universal human right to dignity, invoked by kale-eating Western liberals racked by colonial or war guilt, would be used to destroy Hungarian or Polish culture!\u201cHungary First\u201d is Orban\u2019s election slogan. His relentless anti-immigrant campaign, including claims from a cabinet minister that migrants and refugees would force Hungarians to eat insects, has produced a startling level of fear. Csaba Toth, a political scientist, told me that \u201cchildren in kindergarten have drawn Soros as the devil and migrants as evil figures who will take you away if you are not good.\u201dOne gray afternoon, I went out to Orban\u2019s home village of Felcsut, population 1,800, about an hour\u2019s drive west of Budapest. His simple white house has a cross on its gabled roof. Opposite the house, a spaceship has landed. It takes the form of a giant soccer stadium, complete with turrets and vaulted wooden beams that can accommodate more than twice the population of the village.Orban is passionate about soccer \u2014 and rewarding his cronies. Lorinc Meszaros, the mayor of the village and a former pipe fitter, has virtually overnight become one of Hungary\u2019s richest men, the owner of several regional newspapers. In and around the stadium, where a couple of hundred people, including the prime minister, were watching a desultory match, I heard how Orban brings jobs, how Hungary does not need immigrants who \u201crob and murder,\u201d how \u201c1,000 percent he will win the election.\u201d Later, at the Mediterranean Cafe, I met Andras Vigh, a childhood friend of Orban, who confessed to me that \u201cwe\u2019ve never seen a migrant in our lives.\u201d No matter: \u201cI watch TV and I know. I don\u2019t want any immigrants. Only an idiot would allow them in.\u201dThe other face of fear is venom. In homogeneous societies like Hungary and Poland, it has proved easy to stoke fury against the unknown \u201cother.\u201d In October 2015, the month after the train station ordeal, Kaczynski\u2019s Law and Justice Party swept to victory in Poland with an absolute majority. His blueprint would be the one Orban has developed since taking office in 2010.I visited Poland and Hungary regularly in the early 1990s to chronicle their extraordinary post-Communist transformation. Nowhere was the passion for the liberty and security the West seemed to offer stronger than in Poland, heroic vanguard of the liberation of Europe in 1989 through the Solidarity movement of workers and intellectuals. Nowhere today is the turn against Western liberal democracy more startling or seemingly perverse.European Union funds \u2014 some $90 billion between 2012 and 2016 alone \u2014 have fast-forwarded Polish modernization. (Hungary, with about a quarter of Poland\u2019s population of 38 million, received close to $33 billion in the same period.) After traveling from Hungary to Poland, I boarded the high-speed train from the capital, Warsaw, to Krakow. Gazing out, I was confronted with a tableau of rapid change: orange-vested laborers, boxcars painted a reassuring blue, new suburbs, a church spire above drab five-story Communist-era apartment blocks, poplars and willows, storks\u2019 nests suspended in wintry branches, crumbling farm buildings.Poland: obliterated from the map for more than a century; restored and transformed; killing field par excellence of the Nazis; home to a burning Catholic faith, the \u201cChrist of nations\u201d in a collective subconscious brimming with persecution mania.Membership of NATO and the European Union, attained like Hungary in 1999 and 2004, was supposed to confer normality and security. A market economy and the rule of law were intended to cement them. These objectives, through painful transformation, were reached.So why, with the prize in hand, this nationalist, xenophobic stiffening, across Central Europe? The Polish economy, like the Hungarian, has been expanding briskly, attaining 4.6 percent growth last year, a rate Western Europe can only dream of.Of course, growing inequality, perceptions of impunity, the arrogance of liberal elites and the disruptions of globalization have played a role, just as they have in the United States and Britain. But something more is at work. Perhaps, I thought, the tumultuous kaleidoscope seen through the train window provided a clue.For three decades, Poland, like Hungary, has been going somewhere: The destinations were NATO, the European Union and a free market. Now that they are attained, a question arises: Was all the sacrifice, in this nation whose self-image is of heroes and martyrs, just for shopping malls and German cars? A burned-out generation has transformation fatigue. The point of comparison used to be Communist gray. Now it\u2019s prosperous London and Berlin.Kaczynski declares that immigrants carry \u201cparasites and protozoa.\u201d He turns the 2010 death in a plane crash in Smolensk, Russia, of his twin brother, the former president Lech Kaczynski, into a Russian plot, condoned by the centrist, pro-European Civic Platform party that was then in power. He promises a \u201cFourth Republic,\u201d with a new Constitution, rid of Brussels and the lingering hand of Communists co-opted by Civic Platform. It\u2019s not always clear what he means, but his conspiracy theories get the blood up. He has a project!\u201cIn 1989, we all emigrated to the West,\u201d Karolina Wigura, a sociologist based in Warsaw, told me. \u201cWe were all going somewhere in our souls, and, as you know, emigration is not an easy process. And then, when we finally thought we\u2019d done it, we saw all these new people coming into Europe, and we couldn\u2019t take the idea of immigrants, because that\u2019s what we felt we\u2019d been.\u201dCapitalism, in other words, was another country. The rallying cry throughout Central Europe in the early 1990s was \u201cfree-market democracy.\u201d Get the all-controlling state out; let the market in. Nobody stopped to ask whether the market and liberal democracy were necessarily eternal twins. Turns out they\u2019re not.The \u201cmarket\u201d equaled globalization, good for the hyperconnected metropolis, less so for the hinterland. Poland and Hungary, too, have their Wisconsin and Ohio. Adam Bielan, a senator who is close to Kaczynski, told me that the difference in wages between his constituency in the provincial town of Radom and in Warsaw had doubled over the past dozen years.The policy of Civic Platform, in power from 2007 to 2015, was \u201cto concentrate European Union funds in the big cities,\u201d Bielan argued. The result: \u201cA huge part of Poland was forgotten.\u201d These forgotten Poles voted overwhelmingly for Kaczynski, who has since rewarded them with a $150 monthly handout to all families with two or more children. If you don\u2019t want immigrants, the only way you can offset an aging population in Poland or Hungary is with babies.Kaczynski has set about undermining democracy guaranteed by constitutional checks and balances, the very thing Poland craved after 1989 as insurance against tyranny. In the name of the people\u2019s will, using a false democratic mantle, he has taken relentless aim at what he once called \u201clegal impossibilism\u201d \u2014 the counterbalancing power vested in an independent constitutional judiciary. His ruling party has in effect commandeered the Constitutional Tribunal and the Supreme Court in a way that has led the Venice Commission, a panel of constitutional law experts, to declare that Polish judicial independence is \u201cat serious risk.\u201dMarcin Matczak, a prominent Warsaw law professor, asked me: \u201cWhat does this say about political transitions? It\u2019s the Supreme Court that rules if an election is valid or not. This feels like some kind of preparatory stage for worse.\u201dBolshevism, the cradle in which Orban and Kaczynski were rocked, was an ideology bent on force-marching society toward some higher ideal. In fact, the reality, as the Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert put it, was that it \u201cpoisons wells, destroys the structures of the mind, covers bread with mold.\u201d Something of this urge, it seems, remained in the two men. It was not enough for them to succumb to the permissiveness of the West. They needed a mission. They have decided to save Christendom, no less \u2014 and to heck with open societies.Witold Waszczykowski, the former Polish foreign minister, has said Poland must be cured of the onslaught of those who believe history is headed inevitably toward \u201ca new mixture of cultures and races, a world made up of cyclists and vegetarians, who only use renewable energy and who battle all signs of religion.\u201d He\u2019s Trump\u2019s kind of guy.Of course, in this worldview, Muslims in Europe are a problem. Bielan, the senator close to Kaczynski, told me: \u201cIntegration has failed. I worked in Brussels and there were no-go zones. Poles don\u2019t want the social problems of France or Belgium. Why would we be more successful than France in this?\u201dOn that basis, Poland has refused to take the 7,000 asylum seekers it agreed to absorb under a decision taken by European Union member states during the refugee crisis of 2015. Hungary and the Czech Republic have also refused. They have shown contempt for European solidarity in the name of racial and religious purity.A mood of high nationalist righteousness has taken hold. Poland recently passed an absurd \u201cDeath Camp\u201d law that makes it a crime to accuse \u201cthe Polish nation\u201d of complicity in any \u201cNazi crimes committed by the Third Reich.\u201d Poles saved Jews; they also denounced and, in villages like Jedwabne, killed them. This by now is well known. It has become a crime in Poland to speak the truth.Hungary and Poland are turning the clock back to Europe\u2019s darkest hours. Today they are all about erecting borders \u2014 real and imagined \u2014 against Islam, migrants and refugees, Jews, the European Union, the United Nations, Soros and what they portray as a pluralistic international conspiracy. Hungary erected an actual barrier on its southern border following the refugee crisis of 2015, the fence Orban portrays the opposition as wanting to cut.It was precisely the measures taken to construct and preserve a homogeneous society that lay at the core of the most heinous crimes of the last century. The illiberal trend represents a rejection of the core postwar insight that borders should be dismantled to save Europe from its repetitive suicides. Ever-closer union meant ever-expanding peace.Taken to its end point, the new Hungarian and Polish authoritarianism means danger. It is more dangerous because Trump\u2019s despot-coddling America has disappeared as a countervailing force. The president has ceased upholding the values that advance liberty.In Warsaw last summer, Trump declared, \u201cThe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.\u201d He continued, \u201cDo we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders?\u201dThere was no criticism of Kaczynski or his illiberal steps. I was told the Polish government feels empowered by Trump.Nor have Poland or Hungary felt remotely threatened by the European Union, whose censure of the countries\u2019 turn against liberal democracy has been prudent to the point of feebleness. The billions of dollars still going to Warsaw and Budapest from Brussels should be diverted elsewhere for now. The union rests, by treaty, on the principles of \u201cdemocracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.\u201dThe democratic West needs to awaken from its slumber. The forgotten people of the post-1989 decades have spoken. They have embraced disruption at any cost, declaring \u201cEnough!\u201d to the economic prescriptions (mainly austerity) and the smug impunity of globalizing elites. Europe cannot open its doors to everyone. It needs a shared immigration policy that works, economic policies that offset rather than accentuate inequality and a Brussels bureaucracy that delivers tangible results to a half-billion Europeans.The worst is not inevitable. Orban could yet lose (Fidesz suffered a surprising local election defeat recently), but that is a long shot. Poland lags behind Hungary in the descent into authoritarianism. It is bigger, more diverse and more hostile to Putin\u2019s Russia for historical reasons. It has a stronger civil society and retains a more vigorous independent media. These are important distinctions. They provide some hope.But Europe\u2019s drift is ominous. \u201cI have the weird sense this is the future \u2014 it feels like the transition to something new,\u201d Michael Ignatieff, the president of the Budapest-based and Soros-funded Central European University, told me of Orban\u2019s ascendant illiberalism. The university, a symbol of academic freedom conceived to anchor Central Europe in the West by providing a liberal education, is under threat of closing by Orban.When I asked Zoltan Kovacs, Orban\u2019s spokesman, why the government uses anti-Semitic riffs against Soros, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re not riffing on his Jewishness. We\u2019re riffing on what he does as a speculator, spending dubious money for his cosmopolitan conception of the globe.\u201dThis is the new-old language of Europe today. Marcin Matczak, the law professor I met in Poland, told me: \u201cThe young take liberty for granted. They never had to fight for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I plucked the Listermint from the shelf, took it to the cashier and gave her my phone number and a $10 bill. The 38 and 1/16th-inch-long receipt had just what I was hoping for: a coupon for $5 off a purchase of $15 or more, expiration date three days later.I headed straight for the vitamin section, where the economy-size house-brand red yeast rice was on sale \u2014 buy one for $22.99, get one free. I brought my two containers to the same cashier, who took the coupon and unjudgingly charged me $17.99. But wait, there\u2019s more. I\u2019d get the equivalent of 2 percent of that price back in CVS Rewards bonuses for future purchases, and 1.75 percent in cash via my credit card rewards program, a total of 67 more cents to my name.Am I pitiful or what? Don\u2019t answer that question.Or at least don\u2019t answer it till you hear me out. My CVS behavior is just one data point suggesting that I\u2019m the precise person for whom the marketing strategy of \u201cgamification\u201d is intended. That is, saving some money on vitamin supplements is nice, but that\u2019s not really what brought me to the drugstore. I was there for the buzz, the shots of happy I got when the cash register spit out a receipt the length of a 4-year-old. It\u2019s all in the game.I\u2019ve long been aware of these tendencies of mine but didn\u2019t realize just how many of them there are, and how much they affect what I do, until I did an inventory recently.The gaming actually starts first thing in the morning, when I shamble over to the scale and get a digital readout of my \u201cscore.\u201d Down is a win, up is a loss \u2014 but I can hedge against the latter in the afternoon, when I climb on the elliptical machine and score over 400 (calories, that is). Which reminds me that the Fitbit Charge 2 on my wrist not only displays my heart rate at any given moment but also keeps track daily of hours slept, calories burned, steps taken and stairs climbed.I monitor cumulative miles per gallon on my Ford C-Max Hybrid, 43.5 at the moment. Further, every time I brake to a stop, I get a score based on how much energy I allowed to fritter away by too-slammy braking; coming to a very gradual stop elicits a 100 and hearty \u201cCongratulations!\u201d on the dashboard.With my intricate credit-card protocol, however, I edge from borderline pathetic but ecologically friendly into, I fear, pathological. I have already mentioned the 1.75 percent cash-back bank card. But depending on the circumstances, I\u2019ll use one of six other cards, which provide me with benefits ranging from a 5 percent discount (Target purchases with a Target card) to 2 percent cash back (restaurant purchases with my second bank card).The catch: All the benefits except the Target discount have to be claimed, which I don\u2019t always do, meaning I\u2019m giving \u201cbreakage\u201d back to the companies.The books also helped me understand the particular kind of game that animates this trend, and my behavior. It\u2019s not a zero-sum, winners-and-losers sort of game, like Monopoly or cage fighting, but rather one that continues as long as you want to play and one that, in a sense, you can\u2019t win.Ms. McGonigal calls this an \u201cinfinite\u201d rather than \u201cfinite\u201d game and gives the example of Tetris. You will flail around and be crushed eventually, but you can attain small triumphs along the way, maybe even achieve a personal best, and in any case you can always embark on a new game, no quarter required. The only computer game I play, the bubble-bursting Bubble Bazinga, has exactly this model.In the same way, I can\u2019t \u201cbeat\u201d the credit card companies, but merely continue to accumulate modest savings from moment to moment. Then I die.My gamified life may be nutty and sad, but it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone. At least that\u2019s what I thought until a few months ago, when my new car insurance company, Liberty Mutual, invited me to join a program its website describes this way: \u201cUsing a small device that observes your driving habits, we\u2019ll notice the safe choices you\u2019re making on the road and reward you for them.\u201d The company promised a rate reduction of at least 5 percent and up to 30 percent, based on driving performance over a three-month period. Best of all, an app would let me track the size of my discount in real time.If you\u2019ve read this far, you know what my answer was.I quickly learned that the key \u201cdriving habits,\u201d as far as Liberty Mutual was concerned, were jack-rabbit starts and sudden stops. Eliminating the starts proved easy, but braking was a problem. When a car pulled in front of me, I slowed down gradually enough for my C-Max to register approval. But when I got home, I saw the app had dinged me for it, dropping my discount by a percentage point.It got in my head. Subsequently, I found myself laying off the brake and drifting perilously close to vehicles, all with the goal of keeping my discount percentage up. It had come down to this: safety versus the game.Clearly, things had gone too far. I told myself that saving a couple of hundred dollars on car insurance wasn\u2019t worth losing my life, and I started going to the brake more assiduously.My apparent eagerness to risk life and limb to save a couple of bucks a month had led me to reflect further. Had I essentially let my rat-like impulse for buzzes turn me into a Mario Brother?Well, yes. But I told myself the Liberty Mutual experience had taught me a lesson, or at least a goal: I control the game, the game doesn\u2019t control me. With that in mind, I think I\u2019m past the point of no return. For me, the ungamified life is not worth living.Ben Yagoda is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe B Side: The Death of Tin Pan Alley and the Rebirth of the Great American Song.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Forgotten Anger of \u2018Our Bodies, Ourselves\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Gumport is an editor at n+1.The second edition of \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves,\u201d published in 1976 by Simon & Schuster, featured on Page 229 something I\u2019d never seen before, and I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen it anywhere else since: a photograph of a woman having an abortion.The caption, like the inclusion of the photograph itself, is matter-of-fact, informative and free from sentiment: \u201cVacuum suction abortion at Preterm Institute in Washington, D.C. Note that the woman getting the abortion is wearing her street clothing.\u201dThe first essay, which begins with a quotation from the Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse, is titled \u201cWomen, Medicine and Capitalism.\u201d That final word is one that is rarely invoked even by many progressive health organizations nowadays, but for the authors of the early editions of \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves,\u201d it was crucial: Political economy \u2014 and the recognition that physical health is inseparable from it \u2014 helped unlock these women\u2019s understanding of their social and political circumstances, their relationships to medical professionals, and ultimately their own bodies.The insistence on a connection between politics and health remained a priority. In the 1976 edition, the chapter on women and health care included a discussion of \u201cthe capitalist theory of disease causation,\u201d which detailed how the medical profession treated symptoms but failed to consider the social context of illness. It was an open challenge to established institutions and accredited actors: The authors questioned the benefits of a fee-for-service model of health care and discussed the power imbalances inherent in the doctor-patient relationship.One area of focus in the original edition was patient as victim; by the second edition, women were no longer characterized as victims of doctors \u2014 at least not so loudly. But they weren\u2019t their equals, either. In the early editions, women were medical subjects, objects of study. Learning to challenge institutional knowledge, and their treatment by those institutions, was as important as learning about their own bodies.Knowledge had been denied to the book\u2019s authors, these denials were themselves denied, and so the women who wrote \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves\u201d were angry. Their anger radiated from the page: It was explicit, not implicit, and it guided the book from its opening sections.Today, we think of \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves\u201d as primarily a book in which women can find candid discussions about masturbation or birth control, and it was indeed always that. But in those early editions, politics was given pride of place; the sections on anatomy and physiology appeared only later. In the second edition, the first chapter was titled \u201cOur Changing Sense of Self.\u201d Its subsections included \u201cChanging Our Internalized Sexist Values,\u201d \u201cRediscovering Activity\u201d and \u201cRediscovering Anger.\u201dI recently flipped through the most recent edition, published in 2011. As comprehensive as it was, I found myself missing the stridency of early versions. Marcuse is gone; in his place is the concrete medical information whose dissemination is, to judge by news coverage of its demise, the primary reason \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves\u201d is so celebrated.Although much that was missing from earlier editions had found a way in \u2014 information on trans health, colorism \u2014 something of the soul of those early editions had been lost. In this most recent, and ultimately final, edition, the politics of women\u2019s health was not elided, but it had been consolidated into its own section, toward the back of the book.\u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves\u201d is celebrated for making information about their own bodies accessible to millions of women. Such praise is deserved, its reputation earned \u2014 yet that ought not be the limit of its legacy. Its boldness and its value came not just from the information it contained, but the connections it made between our bodies and the world we inhabit.Much of today\u2019s wellness rhetoric omits the argument \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves\u201d placed front and center: that physical and economic health are not easily separated; that knowledge of our bodies demands knowledge of the social and political climate in which we live. There cannot be one without the other, and it is this lesson we must go on learning \u2014 if not from \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves,\u201d then at least, I hope, from one another, and from the model provided to us by the book and its creators.As they wrote in the introduction to that first, self-published packet: \u201cThe papers in and of themselves are not very important. They should be viewed as a tool which stimulates discussion and action, which allows for new ideas and for change.\u201d The material, they wrote, \u201chas been and should be used in ways other than a course. A course is only one way of spreading the word.\u201d A course is only one way; a book is another. May there be still more, and many.Elizabeth Gumport is an editor at n+1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Though Deadly, Gaza Protests Draw Attention and Enthusiasm", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWS ANALYSISJERUSALEM \u2014 The \u201cFriday of Tires\u201d protest ended with another nine Palestinians killed along the fence hemming in Gaza despite a smokescreen of burning rubber and a second round of international criticism over Israel\u2019s use of lethal force.Now, young Gazans are talking about staging a \u201cFlower Friday,\u201d a \u201cCoffin Friday,\u201d and even a \u201cShoes Friday\u201d at which demonstrators would fling footwear at soldiers to protest Israel\u2019s longstanding blockade of the impoverished territory and its two million residents.Far from being discouraged by the smaller turnout on Friday compared to a week earlier, Palestinians seem energized and enthusiastic about sustaining a generally nonviolent form of protest \u2014 even if it is Israel\u2019s harsh response to it and the mounting Palestinian death toll that has put their conflict with Israel back on the international agenda.\u201cThe Arab leaders, especially in the Gulf, thought they could neglect the Palestinian cause,\u201d said Omar Shaban, director of PalThink for Strategic Studies, a Gaza think tank. \u201cThey thought it\u2019s a stable conflict. But it reminds them, the U.S., Israel, the Europeans \u2014 all of them \u2014 that the problem is still there, guys. Things might seem to be stable, but no. It\u2019s boiling.\u201dHamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza and seeks Israel\u2019s destruction, has always advocated armed struggle. So for Gazans, even a tentative experiment with nonviolent protest is a significant step.And they might be onto something. The Israelis, for a variety of reasons, have long been worried about such a shift. And they now find the world paying attention as they use disproportionate force to prevent what they believe could be a catastrophic breach in the Gaza fence.Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, likened attempts to cross Israel\u2019s fence to American civil rights marchers\u2019 attempts to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., more than 50 years ago. He said he saw the demonstrations as an opportunity for a strategic shift by Palestinians.\u201cThis is not a battle that protesters are coming to with guns,\u201d Mr. Munayyer said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming to it with their bodies and they\u2019re confronting very real policies of violent repression. The protesters paid with their lives to get people to question whether these policies are justifiable.\u201d\u201cFrankly, I think this is Israel\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel,\u201d he added, \u201cand it\u2019s very important in this moment for the international community to be supportive of the protesters. They\u2019ve always said, \u2018Abandon militancy, abandon violence.\u2019 If the international community allows the violent repression of these protests without any real condemnation or intervention to stop the killing, it\u2019s going to send a message that the world doesn\u2019t want any Palestinian resistance \u2014 not violent, not nonviolent, not anything in between.\u201dGazans are grappling with an economy in collapse. Hospitals are short on medicine and there is electricity only for a few hours at a time. The water is undrinkable and raw sewage is pumped into the sea. While Gaza was poor and crowded to begin with, the 11-year-old blockade by Israel and Egypt has driven it into crisis.The so-called Great Return March began on March 30 and is meant to continue every Friday for several weeks, culminating in a mass demonstration on May 15. That is Nakba Day, which commemorates the flight and expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the Israeli war for independence in 1948.On March 30, some 30,000 people attended the first Friday demonstration and 20 were killed by Israeli soldiers, according to Gaza health officials. Videos showed that some were shot while they had their backs turned to the fence.On Friday, the crowds were thinner, but nine more Palestinians were killed.Israel, endeavoring to explain its use of lethal force, released photos and video of a few Palestinians trying to penetrate the fence and said others had thrown firebombs at its soldiers in the latest round of protest. On Saturday, Israel\u2019s Kan Radio reported that at least eight attempts were made to plant explosives along the fence during this past week\u2019s demonstrations. The Israeli military also said it would investigate the death of a Palestinian cameraman, one of seven journalists reportedly shot.But while many protesters threw stones or rolled burning tires toward the fence, far more could be seen doing little more than standing around \u2014 chanting, singing and shouting.\u201cThese demonstrations have made the Palestinian people\u2019s voice heard, and made the world hear its scream,\u201d said Ahmed Abu Artema, a Gazan social-media activist who dreamed up the protest. \u201cThe aim of the siege is a fatal force targeting us. But we\u2019ve decided to turn this pain into a positive spirit.\u201dMany protesters approached the fence, venturing into a buffer zone that Israel had declared hundreds of feet into the Gaza side. And many of those were shot at by soldiers, according to Gaza health officials.For Israel, any opening in the fence risks that hundreds of protesters could rush through in a few minutes, said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel\u2019s National Security Council. The barrier fence was \u201cnot as strong and robust as people might think,\u201d he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in a position where we have to handle hundreds or thousands of people inside Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something we would not be able to contain. So the right way is to make sure nothing happens to the fence.\u201dBut that leaves its soldiers aiming rifles at unarmed people.\u201cWhat the Israelis are defending is not lives. They\u2019re defending a fence,\u201d Mr. Munayyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the standard when it comes to the use of lethal force \u2014 to just snipe at people from hundreds of feet away.\u201dAfter the second Friday of protests, the Palestinians appeared unified. Though Hamas effectively managed the demonstrations in many ways, those participating came from the range of Gaza political factions and for the most part displayed only one banner \u2014 the Palestinian national flag.Nathan Thrall, an analyst for International Crisis Group who closely watches Gaza, saw a \u201cmomentum building\u201d in the second week. \u201cYou had huge numbers going on their own initiative,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t feel they were at a protest, they felt they were at some kind of a celebration.\u201dBut Mr. Thrall \u2014 who noted that the Gaza demonstrators had burned the image of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia on Friday \u2014 said the demonstration\u2019s main goal is to signal to the Palestinians\u2019 Arab allies and to the United States that there will be a price to be paid if the Trump administration attempts to, in their view, eradicate the Palestinian issue.\u201cThis is coming at a time when the Palestinians feel totally marginalized from the world agenda and even from the regional agenda,\u201d he said. He pointed to an Saudi Arabian overflight agreement for Air India to fly to Israel, and the Arab states\u2019 attendance alongside Israel at a recent White House conference on Gaza \u2014 one the Palestinians boycotted.\u201cThey feel that the Arab states are not so much stabbing them in the back as in the face with their open embrace of Israel.\u201dMany Gazans have been talking about the demonstration\u2019s final day, on May 15, as a moment for masses of protesters to try to cross the fence into Israel. That remains a nightmare scenario for Israel, according to Mr. Eiland, the retired general.\u201cIf, and this has not happened yet, at the very same moment, thousands of people in different locations will assault the fence \u2014 among them children and women \u2014 this might create a real challenge to us because we do not want to shoot and kill dozens and hundreds of people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the same time we do not want them to cross into Israel, because we cannot tolerate it.\u201dIyad Abuheweila contributed reporting from Gaza City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cannabis Flowers Are Legal in Italy. You Just Can\u2019t Eat or Smoke Them.", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 For the past year, small jars of cannabis flowers have been flying off the shelves of Italian specialty shops: a phenomenon that\u2019s described as a \u201cgreen gold rush.\u201dThe hemp flowers \u2014 with names like K8, Chill Haus, Cannabismile White Pablo and Marley CBD \u2014 are sold under the tag \u201ccannabis light\u201d because their level of the psychoactive compound that makes people high is a tiny fraction of that typically found in cultivated marijuana.But there\u2019s a catch. The aromatic hemp flowers must not be smoked or eaten. Seeds, should there be any, must not be cultivated. As the jars\u2019 labels sternly specify, the products are for \u201ctechnical use\u201d only and \u201cnot for human consumption.\u201d Instead, they are sold \u2014 as countless salesclerks will explain with a nudge-nudge, wink-wink smile \u2014 as \u201ccollectors\u2019 items.\u201dSuch is the current, perplexing status of legal cannabis in Italy.The law was created for farmers growing industrial hemp, which has commercial uses like food, fabrics, clothing, biofuel, construction material and animal feed, but has minute levels of a psychoactive compound. But it did not regulate the use of cannabis flowers, also known as buds, and an entire economy emerged from the legislative void.Farmers\u2019 associations see wide-scale hemp production as one solution to Italy\u2019s agricultural slump.In the past century, marijuana and cannabis became associated with the word drug, effectively wiping out generations of tradition, said Gennaro Maulucci, the main organizer of a hemp-based trade fair in Rome. \u201cWe want to dismantle that defamatory reputation,\u201d he said.The level of tetrahydrocannabinol \u2014 or THC, the compound that makes people high \u2014 is under 0.2 percent in cannabis light, a small fraction of the 15 percent to 25 percent or more that is typically found in cultivated strains of marijuana, whose street-level quality can be significantly lower in Italy. It has varying levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, which proponents say has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, without the psychoactive effects.Some aficionados working for marijuana-promoting magazines have described the effects of cannabis light as a taking-the-edge-off kind of buzz, without actually getting stoned.Easyjoint\u2019s website specifies that its products must not be burned or eaten, and that they are not medicinal. But in an interview, Mr. Marola said cannabis light had properties that could be effective in various instances.\u201cFortunately, more people suffer from insomnia and panic attacks\u201d than Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, for which medical marijuana is often prescribed, he said, adding that medical marijuana should be reserved \u201cfor those who really need a product with high THC content.\u201dThe scientific community is still out about the medical properties of cannabis light. Medical marijuana, on the other hand, has been increasingly popular in Italy since it was approved in 2006, and demand now greatly dwarfs supply.Thousands of Italians use medical cannabis to assuage the symptoms of issues like post-chemotherapy nausea, muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, anorexia and anxiety, even if many doctors hesitate to propose the treatment out of concern for potential legal liabilities.But as it cannot keep up with demand, the government also imports from Holland and, as of January, from Canada.Colonel Medica said he thought demand could further quadruple. \u201cDoctors have begun to see the importance of medical cannabis,\u201d he said.In September, pharmacies throughout Italy ran out of medical marijuana, prompting many patients with prescriptions to turn to the black market.While anyone can drink hemp tea or eat hemp-based food (when it\u2019s available) at the cafe \u2014 whose legal status is also unclear \u2014 patients with a prescription can consume their own cannabis in a comfortable therapy room.The cafe was created so that people didn\u2019t have to medicate alone at home. \u201cThe problem is that the mentality is closed in Italy, and if you speak of cannabis as a cure, you\u2019re seen as a druggie,\u201d said Luigi Mantuano, the other owner of the cafe, which sells its own version of cannabis light. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want people to close themselves off.\u201dThough medical and light cannabis are legal, several cannabis users shared stories of being detained when found with the flowers.\u201cIf you\u2019re stopped by the police after buying medical cannabis, you have to be lucky enough that the officers have read the law and don\u2019t confuse it as a drug \u2014 otherwise it\u2019s probable that you\u2019ll spend the night in prison,\u201d said Andreana Sirhan, a Rome pharmacist who sells medical marijuana.The popularity of cannabis light has given fresh energy to marijuana legalization campaigns that have been simmering since the 1970s. A group of lawmakers from several political parties proposed a bill during the legislative session that ended last month, though it did not make its way through Parliament.There is no guarantee that the nebulous legal status of cannabis light will survive the legislative appetite of incoming lawmakers. The two parties most likely to govern Italy for the next five years, perhaps together, have differing views on marijuana use: The Five Star Movement is open to legalization, the far-right League party is against it.A spokesman for the association that represents licensed tobacco vendors noted that a ministerial decision was pending on whether cannabis light would be recognized as a tobacco substitute and be subject to taxes. That would mean cannabis light could be sold only through licensed tobacco vendors.He said he was concerned that the Italian cannabis light bubble could burst, but he was heartened by the growing number of states that have legalized marijuana in the United States.\u201cLegalization there has created jobs, reduced criminality and the contraband of poor-quality marijuana, and it\u2019s a big tax boon for governments,\u201d Mr. Molinari said. \u201cWhy remove a substance that creates income for the state?\u201dBesides, he added, \u201cpeople will use it anyway.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How\u2019s That Tax Cut Working Out?", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistSo far, Donald Trump and his allies in Congress have achieved one and only one major legislative victory: passing a large tax cut, mainly aimed at corporations and business owners. The tax cut\u2019s proponents promised that it would lead to a dramatic acceleration of economic growth and produce big gains in wages; they hoped that it would also yield big political dividends for the midterm elections.Let\u2019s talk about the economics here.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]Furthermore, any short-term boost will probably be quickly squelched by the Federal Reserve, which believes that we\u2019re at full employment and which is gradually raising interest rates to keep the economy from overheating. You can argue that the Fed is wrong, but the case for easier monetary policy has nothing to do with the Trump tax cut.No, the case for a corporate tax cut is the claim that in the long run it will raise wages. How is that supposed to work?It never made sense to believe that corporations would immediately share their tax-cut bounty with workers, and they haven\u2019t. Any news organizations that let themselves be bamboozled by cherry-picked stories of firms announcing worker bonuses after the tax bill passed should be ashamed of their credulity.The real logic behind corporate tax cuts is that they\u2019re supposed to lead to higher investment. This investment, in turn, would gradually increase the stock of capital, simultaneously driving down the pretax rate of return on investment and pushing up wages.In short, the effects of the Trump tax cut are already looking like the effects of the Brownback tax cut in Kansas, the Bush tax cut and every other much-hyped tax cut of the past three decades: big talk, big promises, but no results aside from a swollen budget deficit.You might think that the G.O.P. would eventually learn something from this experience, realize that tax cuts aren\u2019t magical, and come up with some different ideas. But I guess it\u2019s difficult for a man to understand something when his campaign contributions depend on his not understanding it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Live Nation Rules Music Ticketing, Some Say With Threats", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2010, when the Justice Department allowed the two most dominant companies in the live music business \u2014 Live Nation and Ticketmaster \u2014 to merge, many greeted the news with dread.Live Nation was already the world\u2019s biggest concert promoter. Ticketmaster had for years been the leading ticket provider. Critics warned that the merger would create an industry monolith, one capable of crippling competitors in the ticketing business.Federal officials tried to reassure the skeptics. They pointed to a consent decree, or legal settlement, they had negotiated as part of the merger approval. Its terms were strict, they said: It would boost competition and block monopolistic behavior by the new, larger Live Nation.\u201cThere will be enough air and sunlight in this space for strong competitors to take root, grow and thrive,\u201d said the country\u2019s top antitrust regulator, Assistant Attorney General Christine A. Varney. And she went further, suggesting that reduced ticket service fees, even lower ticket prices, might be on the horizon.Eight years after the merger, the ticketing business is still dominated by Live Nation and its operations extend into nearly every aspect of the concert world.Now Department of Justice officials are looking into serious accusations about Live Nation\u2019s behavior in the marketplace.In the Atlanta case, the complaint stems from a 2013 tour by the band Matchbox Twenty. Live Nation bypassed the Gwinnett Center, a popular arena outside the city, for another venue in town.Gwinnett\u2019s booking director, Dan Markham, worried his venue was being punished, according to emails he wrote at the time. The center had just replaced Ticketmaster with a service controlled by AEG.\u201cDon\u2019t abandon Gwinnett,\u201d he wrote to a Live Nation talent coordinator. \u201cIf there\u2019s an issue or issues let\u2019s address.\u201d\u201cIssue?\u201d the Live Nation coordinator wrote back. \u201cThree letters. Can you guess what they are?\u201dLive Nation says that, no matter what its employee wrote, the decision to bypass the center was not punitive. The other venue was managed by Live Nation and simply fit more people. But the following year, Live Nation cut the number of tours it brought to Gwinnett in half, from four to two.Live Nation described the drop as a routine fluctuation. But Mr. Markham later said in an email that he had expected the drop-off because Live Nation \u201cwarned us that they would put us in a literal boycott.\u201dAEG provided The New York Times with copies of those emails, and others, to support its account of threats.\u201cWhat happened in Atlanta is just one example of what has been occurring much more broadly,\u201d said Ted Fikre, the chief legal officer for AEG.Live Nation officials say they never threaten or retaliate. They dismissed the complaints as tactical, deliberate mischaracterizations by AEG.\u201cYou have a disgruntled competitor that is trying to explain their loss around the boogeyman that there were threats made that nobody can document,\u201d said Daniel M. Wall, Live Nation\u2019s antitrust lawyer.The bloodletting between Live Nation and AEG has grown fierce in recent years and rippled through the industry. Last month, another of Mr. Wall\u2019s clients, the heavy-metal icon Ozzy Osbourne, sued AEG on antitrust grounds, saying that it tried to bar him from playing its O2 arena in London, unless he played its Staples Center in Los Angeles.AEG said its policy was a response to Live Nation\u2019s steering concerts to its Los Angeles rival, the Forum.The Justice Department\u2019s inquiries into possible antitrust violations have gone beyond the bitter rivalry, with regulators in the past year looking into reports of Live Nation threats at venues that AEG does not manage: at the H-E-B Center outside Austin, Tex.; and at Boston\u2019s TD Garden, according to executives familiar with the federal review.Justice officials declined to comment on the status of their inquiries. Several of the venue owners have denied the accounts of threats reported by others.The inquiries come as Justice officials review two more proposed mergers of huge companies \u2014 AT&T with Time Warner, and the Walt Disney Company with 21st Century Fox. In discussing those proposals, the department\u2019s new antitrust chief has pointed to the Live Nation deal and several other mergers as problematic because, he said, they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a speech last November.Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, was blunter in assessing whether the government had done enough to ensure a vital ticketing marketplace.\u201cThe Consent Decree was supposed to prevent Live Nation from using its strength in live entertainment to foreclose competition in ticketing,\u201d said Mr. Buffier. \u201cBut it is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe live music business has long operated as an ecosystem where multiple parties work together to put on a show.Promoters front the money for a concert or tour and take on the greatest risk.Talent agents and managers negotiate artists\u2019 fees.Venues rent space and hire ticketing companies to handle their events.These were long separate fiefs. But Live Nation now operates in all of them, so it\u2019s the rare music fan who does not run into the company somewhere in any concert-going experience.It also draws more fire from music fans than any other company, in large part because it is blamed \u2014 unfairly in many respects \u2014 for skyrocketing ticket prices and the size of those much-maligned ticket service fees, both costs it only partly influences.Though the price of tickets has soared, that trajectory predates the merger and is driven by many factors, including artists\u2019 reliance on touring income as record sales have plummeted.Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics and public policy at Princeton University, said that fan demand was the primary force behind higher prices and the money was drawing a broader array of acts to the stage.Live Nation typically locks up much of the best talent by offering generous advances to artists and giving them a huge percentage of the ticket revenue from the door.Why? Because it can afford to. It has so many other related revenue streams on which to draw: sponsorships for the tour, concessions at venues, and, most of all, ticket fees. The fees supply about half of Live Nation\u2019s earnings, according to company reports.Ticketmaster said it no longer sets the final fee. It just negotiates a set per-ticket charge. The rest of the fee is added on by the venues and sometimes promoters too. Yet at many concerts Live Nation is not just the ticket seller, but also the promoter, the venue operator or even the artist\u2019s manager, with an opportunity to collect at every juncture.Take, for example, an April 2016 concert in Nashville where Ticketmaster added a $14.75 fee on top of a $36 ticket for a show in an amphitheater Live Nation owned. Even Michael Rapino, Live Nation\u2019s chief executive, called that fee \u201cnot defendable,\u201d according to an internal email.Holding onto venues is critical to a company that relies so much on ticket fees. Mr. Rapino has repeatedly boasted to Wall Street that the number of venues it tickets around the world \u2014 a statistic it does not release \u2014 is constantly growing.\u201cThe space is more competitive than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re working harder each and every year.\u201dAEG acknowledges that some part of its difficulty in securing contracts is rooted in its own missteps in developing a competitive ticketing system. And certainly, at the lower reaches of the market, Ticketmaster\u2019s share is not nearly so commanding.But it\u2019s clear that Ticketmaster, by whatever means, has kept its rivals from gaining a meaningful foothold in the market for major music venues.Preserving competition in the ticketing market was a chief concern for regulators when the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger was proposed in 2009. Live Nation, which had long stayed in its lane as a promoter and venue operator, had just begun to sell tickets and was taking on that role at some 110 venues.If the two companies merged, that competition \u2014 a healthy marketplace development, as regulators saw it \u2014 would disappear.So, as part of the consent decree, Justice officials ordered steps that they hoped would enable two new robust challengers. One measure required Ticketmaster to license its ticketing software \u2014 the proprietary system that allowed it to service swarms of customers when a popular concert went on sale \u2014 to its competitor AEG.It was also required to divest a ticketing subsidiary, Paciolan, to another competitor.But, as it turned out, AEG never licensed the Ticketmaster software because, it said, it did not view the technology as cutting edge. The company that Ticketmaster sold off, Paciolan, remained a niche player in the music end of the business.\u201cIt has now been eight years since the merger and the world does not look a lot different,\u201d said John E. Kwoka Jr., a professor of economics at Northeastern University and a longtime critic of the merger.Ms. Varney declined to comment on the effectiveness of the agreement she had shepherded. But the antitrust division\u2019s former chief counsel, Gene Kimmelman, said the Justice Department had been hampered in what it could do to create competition in an industry already so dominated by one company.\u201cThe people who came in to oversee this transaction were very interested in doing everything imaginable to create more competition in ticketing in the marketplace,\u201d he said, \u201cand were frustrated that the options were unbelievably limited.\u201dFew buildings in Louisville are as important to the local economy as the KFC Yum! Center, a 22,000-seat arena on the banks of the Ohio River that features a mix of events, from Louisville Cardinals basketball games to concerts by Garth Brooks.In 2012, Live Nation submitted a joint bid with another company for a contract to manage the arena. Three people who listened to Live Nation\u2019s pitch said in interviews that the company said some of its tours might skip the arena if it lost the deal.\u201cOne of their main selling points was the relationship with the talent that they had and their ability to determine where that talent chose to play,\u201d said Larry Hayes, who was then chairman of the Louisville Arena Authority, which oversees the venue.The arena picked AEG anyway.Mr. Fikre and other AEG officials say that two years later, when their company considered replacing Ticketmaster with their own ticketing service, AXS, Live Nation gave a warning.Over dinner on the night of a Miley Cyrus concert in August 2014, they said, a Live Nation executive told AEG\u2019s local venue manager that some Live Nation tours would likely bypass Louisville if AEG made good on its plan to replace Ticketmaster.This is one of the incidents that AEG complained about to the Justice Department, pointing out that the consent decree specifically forbids Live Nation from threatening to withhold shows from venues that do not hire Ticketmaster.The AEG account is supported by an internal email in which its employee reports being warned that the Yum! Center might lose \u201ctoss of the coin shows\u201d \u2014 the kind that could go to a nearby arena \u2014 if Ticketmaster was dumped.Mr. Hayes said in an interview that he had not been aware of a second warning. He had, in fact, endorsed retaining Ticketmaster, he said: It had served the arena well. But the letter of endorsement he wrote to AEG made plain that he understood there was a nexus between employing Ticketmaster and retaining access to Live Nation talent.\u201cDue to the relationship between Ticketmaster and Live Nation,\u201d Mr. Hayes wrote, \u201cand knowing how important content is to our financial stability, the Louisville Arena Authority is requesting that AEG receive a formal bid from Ticketmaster to retain its business at the KFC Yum! Center.\u201dAEG officials say they ultimately ditched the plan to replace Ticketmaster because they worried the venue might lose show revenue.Live Nation disputed the account of warnings and supplied data showing that since 2012 the number of tours it has sent to the KFC Yum! Center has only increased. (Even at the Gwinnett Center outside Atlanta, now known as the Infinite Energy Center, the number of Live Nation shows rebounded after dropping off in 2014.)There is little evidence, actually, of Live Nation retaliation. Competitors say that is because venues so rarely stray.Critics say enforcement of the consent decree has been complicated by what they call its ambiguous language. Though it forbids Live Nation from forcing a client to buy both its talent and ticketing, the agreement lets the company \u201cbundle\u201d its services \u201cin any combination.\u201d So Live Nation is barred from punishing an arena by, say, steering a star like Drake to appear at a rival stop down the road. But it\u2019s also allowed, under the agreement, to redirect a concert if it can defend the decision as sound business.Mr. Buffier, of the New York Attorney General\u2019s office, said the ambiguity creates \u201chigh burdens to prove violations in court.\u201dCompetitors assert that the bundling lets Live Nation pressure venues without ever uttering a threat.\u201cThey don\u2019t need to,\u201d said Marc Leibowitz, co-owner of One Percent Productions, an independent concert promoter in Omaha. \u201cIt\u2019s just implied.\u201dDavid Willis, a former ticketing executive who left Ticketmaster in 2014, said the company was always careful to instruct the sales staff to respect the rules as to how talent could be mentioned when pitching an arena for business.\u201cWe were not saying, certainly, \u2018If you don\u2019t go with us you are losing that,\u2019\u201d he said. But he acknowledged, \u201cI would imagine that that is what they assumed to be the case.\u201dLive Nation and AEG both have their headquarters in Los Angeles, and last summer the companies faced off in a contract dispute over a new Major League Soccer team there, the Los Angeles Football Club.Trouble began brewing when the team began looking for someone to ticket its new stadium downtown, due to open this month.Ticketmaster put in a bid. But the team insisted that Live Nation bring in some concerts as well. Live Nation balked \u2014 soccer stadiums, executives said, were a poor fit for concerts \u2014 but it struck a preliminary deal that included ticketing and a commitment to provide a few shows each year.Then the plan hit a snag. AEG owned another professional soccer team in Los Angeles \u2014 the Galaxy \u2014 and had an agreement with Major League Soccer: If another franchise from Los Angeles joined the league, AEG had the right to match any competitor\u2019s ticketing offer.Wielding that clause as leverage, AEG blocked the selection of Ticketmaster, and the contract instead went to SeatGeek, an upstart company that had deals with a number of M.L.S. teams.The Ticketmaster executives were furious and threatened to sue. They told the team owners that, if there was no Ticketmaster contract, they would not be getting the Live Nation shows. The team then complained to Major League Soccer that Live Nation had threatened to withhold talent, according to a statement by the league.Live Nation denied it had made any kind of threat and pointed out that the soccer league has a small equity stake in SeatGeek. It said the arena had simply pulled out of a package deal that covered both ticketing and concerts \u2014 just the sort of bundling, it said, the Justice Department settlement had allowed. Without ticketing, according to Live Nation officials, it simply made no economic sense to put concerts in a space built for soccer.But the consent decree, which expires in 2020, also says Live Nation cannot \u201ccondition or threaten to condition the provision of live entertainment events\u201d if a venue decides to use another company for ticketing.So is this a case of bullying, or just a business decision?\u201cLive Nation and Ticketmaster,\u201d the company said in a statement \u201cdo not \u2018condition\u2019 the placement of concerts at venues on becoming the venue\u2019s ticketing provider. Venues, on the other hand, often condition the ticketing contract on guaranteed content.\u201dAntitrust experts said this was the kind of thicket that Justice officials must navigate as they reviewed the antitrust complaints.Since the dust up, Live Nation has returned to the table and is discussing bringing acts to the stadium. The team declined to comment on the dispute. SeatGeek ended up holding onto the contract.But the perception that Live Nation might withhold talent is prevalent enough that SeatGeek now structures some bids to address the concerns of venues who fear losing big stars, and revenues.For example, last year, when SeatGeek tried to unseat Ticketmaster from its contract at the TD Garden in Boston, it included in its bid a promise to pay the arena $250,000 for every show that Live Nation pulled, according to a bid document reviewed by the Times and three people with knowledge of the negotiations.Ticketmaster still won. TD Garden officials said the contract was awarded on the merits, and they had not received threats.A SeatGeek spokesperson declined to discuss the negotiations. But Russ D\u2019Souza, a founder of the company, said he has seen evidence that competition in the market is less than open.\u201cWhen we sell to teams,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have heard fears about losing concerts if they choose us.\u201dColin Moynihan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "College for the Disadvantaged", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:I was saddened, but not surprised, by David Leonhardt\u2019s observation that college graduation rates for students from modest backgrounds are abysmal compared with rates for the wealthy.Those of us who teach in urban schools and community colleges know that we teach some of the most inspiring and deserving of students: Their diversity, honesty and richness of experience make them so. But we know, too, that obstacles get in the way. They have jobs to pay tuition bills; some have children or even parents they help support; some are unprepared for the discipline required of college courses.Mr. Leonhardt is right; we need to shift the focus from getting into college to efforts ensuring that all students, once they have paid that first tuition bill, have a fair shot at completing the course. But this will cost schools money, and too many colleges today are profit-driven, not student-centered.CATHY BERNARD, NEW YORKThe writer is an associate professor of English at the New York Institute of Technology.To the Editor:David Leonhardt rightly points out that colleges are beginning to take action to prioritize completion for low-income students and having success in eliminating graduation gaps between groups. Even with rapidly changing demographics, colleges are still built to serve a more affluent and white group of students, most of whom have parents who also went to college.There will always be varying degrees of preparation with which students enter college. The difference lies in what colleges do with students once they admit them, as evidenced by data that shows stark differences in graduation rates for academically similar students across socioeconomic and racial groups.Our colleges can take inspiration from the K-12 reforms that have resulted in record numbers of historically underrepresented students matriculating to college. A growing group of them are already doing this.The writer is managing director of the Partnership for College Completion.To the Editor:David Leonhardt calls for new approaches to support underrepresented students in completing college degrees. These approaches focus on what happens when a young person gets to a college campus. We should not overlook successful existing strategies that bring the college campus directly to young people, in their communities and without cutting corners.Early college \u2014 embedding as much as two years of tuition-free college during public high school \u2014 is one such strategy. In Bard College\u2019s network of public early colleges, more than 75 percent of first-generation students finish high school with Bard associate\u2019s degrees, tuition free. In these programs, the often-difficult transition from high school to college happens seamlessly and under one roof.This work is built on a simple premise: that institutions of higher education should adapt to students, not the other way around. Alarming inequities in college-degree completion compel us to rethink where and when college learning happens. We have found that early college in public high schools is a great place to start.STEPHEN TREMAINE, NEW YORKThe writer is vice president for early colleges at Bard College.To the Editor:The report proposes a range of sensible and concrete recommendations intended to remove the barriers to completion, including a greater emphasis on need-based financial aid programs, alternative financial management and repayment plans for low-income students, and the cost reductions associated with a timely progression to a degree.Addressing the completion issue is not impossible, but it does require a serious redesign of institutional processes informed by data, deep partnerships with other organizations, and a supportive state and federal environment.Our work also indicates that investing in higher college completion rates will lead to greater output and earnings in our national economy. More students graduating from college helps individuals but also strengthens our economy and our democracy.We face big challenges, but the reasons to act are real and compelling.The writer is president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.To the Editor:I\u2019m the president and chief executive of the national education nonprofit founded by Eugene Lang in 1981, the \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d Foundation, and we agree that the college completion gap is one of the biggest barriers to economic mobility in our country, and education the greatest equalizer. Programs like ours are increasingly critical in addressing growing educational inequity.Closing the college graduation gap takes long-term support. Providing young people with access to the resources they need to earn an education and build a better future for themselves and their families takes time; indeed, our programs work with each student for 15 years and sometimes more.EUGENA OH, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Among the \u201cmultiple reasons that the college-graduation gap is growing,\u201d as David Leonhardt writes, is the proliferation of credit recovery schemes that inflate high school graduation rates without college readiness.These strategies do not include the cheating scandals that have rocked multiple districts, but rather are legal end-runs around subject mastery that states allow districts to use in meeting diploma requirements.Credit recovery permits students to pass courses they have already failed, often by taking a simple quiz or by making up an assignment, either of which can be heavily coached. Often performed online through commercial vendors pitching high success rates, credit recovery shortchanges grads while the time and expense of remediation are passed along to colleges, unfairly increasing students\u2019 tuition burdens and straining higher education budgets.The writer is a professor of education leadership, law and policy at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center.To the Editor:David Leonhardt\u2019s excellent reporting on the growing gap in college success between low- and high-income families highlights an urgent issue: Far more low-income students are heading to college, but the number who actually earn degrees is flat.The writer is an education reporter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ghana Deserves This Cathedral. Don\u2019t Fight It.", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThis Accra commission is not just a recognition by his homeland of Mr. Adjaye\u2019s acclaim. It also signifies that Africa can build a major work by a leading architect at the top of his game. This is a remarkable thing: Ghana will get to brag about a globally recognized architectural landmark.Mr. Adjaye has proposed a monumental building with delicate timber elements on the concave facade, a reminder of the curved seats of Asante royal stools. And its staggered, high-pitched roofs are a welcome nod to traditional Akan architecture. While Mr. Adjaye is known for incorporating local designs into his buildings, the poetry of the cathedral\u2019s allusions to indigenous traditions raises the bar. To embellish the building\u2019s interior, he will collaborate with well-known Ghanaian and other African artists.Mr. Adjaye has designed a fabulous church, with chapels, a baptistery and a 5,000-seat auditorium where state religious events will take place. But I\u2019m thankful it\u2019s more than that; it also includes an art gallery, a music school and a bible museum.The wide expanse of steps leading to the building makes this a veritable public space, which major African cities like Accra have lacked for too long. When it\u2019s finished, it will be a place \u201cwhere religion, democracy and local tradition are seamlessly and symbolically intertwined,\u201d Mr. Adjaye\u2019s firm said. I hope it becomes a model for how art museums in Africa can also be multifunctional public institutions. And this is why the criticisms of the cathedral are misplaced.The project should not be a symbol of what is widely perceived as the profligacy and megapastor-mania of the new-age churches in Africa and the third world. Nor should it be confused with the big white elephants of past dictators, like the humongous Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, the \u201cBasilica in the Bush\u201d built by F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, then Ivory Coast\u2019s leader, in his hometown. Instead, the cathedral, as a religious and cultural institution, will be supported by diverse segments of the population, beyond just the church and the state.Also, there\u2019s something worrisome about the idea that until every home in Africa gets a mosquito net, every village a school, it should not build concrete dreams and inspiring structures. This mind-set has strange old bedfellows in the refusal of colonial governments to build universities in West Africa in the early 1900s (because what the colonized needed was basic education) and the defunding of higher-education institutions in many parts of the continent beginning in the 1980s (because poor countries could not afford them).To rise, Africa has to aim beyond basic needs. It must have infrastructure projects and superb schools that will also propel its growing economies. It must have also enduring and inspirational buildings and environments that unapologetically reflect its rich and complex histories, while also affirming the possibilities of a democratic and prosperous continent. The cathedral project is an emphatic example of necessary institutions, like public museums, that provide space for collective social, cultural and, yes, spiritual transactions.Ghana has been heading in this direction since the 1990s, after years of military coups, dictatorships and economic distress. In 1992, the National Theater in Accra, designed largely by two Chinese architects and paid for by China, opened. Now, tourists and locals marvel at its elegant design and flock to its dance and theater programs. In 2008, the presidential palace was rebuilt. Inspired, like the cathedral, by Asante royal stools, it greatly changed how that part of Accra looks.But these buildings were designed by foreign architects. This, too, has a history. During the age of exploration and the slave trade, Europeans built the massive forts and castles dotting the African coast, including the 17th-century Osu Castle, known as Fort Christianburg, which was the seat of Ghana\u2019s government until a few years ago.Most major buildings in colonial and independent Africa were designed by Europeans and Americans, including Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew from Britain, and the African-American architect J. Max Bond Jr., whom Mr. Adjaye considers a professional idol. African governments, it seemed, did not trust their own artists. Granted, inspired African architects were hard to find well into the late 20th century. But not anymore.Mr. Adjaye belongs to a generation of African architects that includes Di\u00e9b\u00e9do Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9, Kunl\u00e9 Adeyemi, Mphethi Morojele and Mokena Makeka, a generation poised to take on the ambitious projects that will define the architectural character and identities of rising Africa. Their works will be seen around the world as among the great structures of our era. We need more architects like them and far more projects like Mr. Adjaye\u2019s awesome cathedral.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oprah, Rupert Murdoch, Harvard: Saudi Prince\u2019s U.S. Tour", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 He talked about the movie business with Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Dwayne Johnson over dinner at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s house. He discussed space travel with Richard Branson in the California desert, and philanthropy with Bill Gates and technology with Jeff Bezos in Seattle. He visited Harvard and MIT, brokered arms deals with President Trump and sat down with Wall Street financiers. He even met with Oprah Winfrey.For nearly three weeks, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old heir to the Saudi throne, has crisscrossed the United States, on an ambitious, choreographed journey through modern American life, while under heavy guard because of his many enemies in the Middle East.The prince, who arrived in America with a reputation as an aggressive consolidator of power back home and a zealous interventionist abroad, is seeking to change the perception of Saudi Arabia from an opaque and conservative kingdom, where mosques promote extremist ideology and women are relegated to second-class status, to a modernist desert oasis.Prince Mohammed also has sought to attract American investors for industries going well beyond Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco petroleum giant. He is pressing what he has described as a transformative economic agenda, to wean the kingdom from reliance on oil and diversify its economy through public infrastructure investments and development of an entertainment industry \u2014 including theme parks along the lines of Six Flags and Disney.\u201cI think it\u2019s brilliant and I will tell you why,\u201d said Adam Aron, the chief executive of the movie theater chain AMC, who has met with the prince. \u201cThe crown prince is aware that Saudi Arabia has had a difficult image in the United States, because it\u2019s been such a conservative country for so many decades. He wants to transform Saudi society in ways that will be very appealing to Americans.\u201dMr. Aron spoke this week in a reception area of the Four Seasons in Los Angeles, as attendees of a Saudi conference on the entertainment business ate from a spread of Middle Eastern dishes \u2014 lamb kebabs, hummus, tabbouleh. They were entertained by an oud player. Officials spoke about plans to open up the country to concerts, jazz festivals and movies, all an attempt, in the words of one Saudi official, to \u201cdrive happiness\u201d in the kingdom, where 70 percent of the population is under 30, and many are glued to their smartphones.Mr. Aron said men and women would be able to attend films together, a revolutionary step in Saudi Arabia, where public space has long been strictly segregated by gender. He said Hollywood films would be censored in the same way they were in other places across the Middle East: sex out, violence in.\u201cEven then, the scope wasn\u2019t what you see today,\u201d said Mohammed K. Alyahya, a Saudi expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington. \u201cThis is really across the board. It signals that there is deep cooperation beyond just security for oil.\u201d\u201cFor the longest time the Saudis wouldn\u2019t explain themselves, and explain why things were happening in their country,\u201d Mr. Alyahya added. \u201cThat is changing dramatically.\u201dThe prince\u2019s American tour followed a similar visit to Britain, where he soaked in the royal treatment and dined with the queen. And as in the United States, local lobbying and public relations firms helped present an image of the prince as an economic and social reformer. In London, ads appeared on billboards and the sides of black cabs: \u201cHe is bringing change to Saudi Arabia.\u201d \u201cHe is empowering Saudi Arabian women.\u201d \u201cHe is opening Saudi Arabia to the world.\u201dFor decades, the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia could be distilled into one proposition: access to oil for the Americans, and a guarantee that the Americans would protect Saudi Arabia from enemies, especially its chief rival, Iran.Prince Mohammed\u2019s trip began in Washington, where he met with President Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who share the prince\u2019s antipathy for Iran and have deepened relations with the Saudis to counter Iran\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East.The trip ends this weekend in Texas, where the prince meets with oil executives and two former presidents, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush.Prince Mohammed also has been sharply criticized by human rights activists for waging a bombing campaign in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have been killed, and for cracking down on dissent by jailing bloggers. And in playing to an American audience the prince has faced longstanding concerns over the efforts of Saudi Arabian clerics to export extremist Islamist ideology, beliefs that underpin terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.Part of the prince\u2019s rebranding of his nation \u2014 and his attempt to address the issue of religious extremism for a country that was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 is a piece of revisionism, say analysts. The prince has argued, in interviews around his trip, that extremism in Saudi Arabia is traceable to the 1979 revolution in Shiite Iran, whose rivalry with Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia has inflamed sectarian tensions that divide the Middle East.\u201cIt\u2019s really a rewriting of Saudi history,\u201d said Karen E. Young, an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. Ms. Young said that conservative Muslim strains had always coursed through Saudi society, but that drawing a line between before 1979 and after \u201cplays into this rhetoric of the world against Iran.\u201dIt also plays to the sentiments of the Trump administration, which has taken a tougher line and has threatened to tear up the 2015 deal the Obama administration negotiated to curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear program.For the most part, human rights concerns have not overshadowed the prince\u2019s American journey. At the dinner at Mr. Murdoch\u2019s house, for instance, where guests \u2014 but not the prince himself \u2014 drank wine from the media mogul\u2019s vineyard, the prince spoke about empowering women in Saudi Arabia, where they will soon be able to drive for the first time in decades, and movie investments in the kingdom. He was not pressed on human rights issues, said one attendee, who described the evening as informal and the prince as \u201ccarefully candid.\u201dMayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles was one of the few Americans who met with Prince Mohammed and in public stressed human rights issues. In a statement, the mayor said he \u201curged the Crown Prince to continue his efforts to advance women\u2019s rights, and raised concerns about human rights and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen.\u201dIn Los Angeles, Prince Mohammed\u2019s visit drew a smattering of protests. \u201cHe\u2019s coming here under the guise that he\u2019s some great reformer and changing the country,\u201d said Michelle Modglin, 67, a retired nurse, demonstrating outside the Beverly Hills office of the William Morris Endeavor talent agency, which recently received a $400 million investment from Saudi Arabia. \u201cBut we know that\u2019s not true as long as he\u2019s bombing Yemen and killing innocent people.\u201dLater that evening, hundreds of Saudi students from nearby universities \u2014 many of whom receive educational scholarships from the Saudi government \u2014 packed a ballroom at the Beverly Hills Hotel for a TED-style event put on by the Misk Foundation, a nonprofit founded by Prince Mohammed. During the Misk Talk, successful Saudi men and women representing technology, entertainment and other industries sought to impart wisdom and inspiration to the young crowd.And on Tuesday night, Misk hosted an art exhibit in an industrial-style event space in the arts district of downtown Los Angeles, where women in miniskirts and leather pants mixed with young Saudi women in head scarves, while young Saudi men who live in Los Angeles worked as volunteer guides to Saudi art.Hala Alzuhayri, a Saudi woman at the University of San Diego who attended the Misk Talk, praised the prince for opening up the economy and said she was pleased about the new prospects for women, even as she worried about the pace of change. \u201cBut we are a Muslim society, so these kinds of big steps have to take time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shock society with big steps one after another. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\u201cIt was very disorganized,\u201d said Ms. Young, of the start of the trip. \u201cThere was a real lack of coordination.\u201dBut the operation soon stabilized, with a tightly controlled message managed by the Saudi Embassy in Washington with assistance from American lobbying and public relations firms. Almost daily, news releases were issued about the crown prince\u2019s dizzying schedule of meetings.\u201cIt sent a message that this could go very wrong,\u201d she said, of the early chaos. \u201cBut to their credit it\u2019s gone very well.\u201dReporting was contributed by Brooks Barnes and Louis Keene from Los Angeles, Nate Schweber from New York, Jack Nicas from San Francisco, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Fuels the Saudi Rivalry With Iran?", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs.\u00a0Rasheed is a historian of Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia\u2019s government officials, and particularly its powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, often talk about pushing back a dangerous Iranian threat. But the truth is, despite this talk, the foreign policy emanating from Riyadh is driven primarily by domestic politics. Prince Mohammed knows that a fearful enemy is a key to his own strength.The relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran has oscillated between indifference, hostility, rapprochement and tension over the decades. Prince Mohammad appears determined to intensify the rivalry with Iran as he continues to raise Riyadh\u2019s concerns over Iranian expansion in the Arab world and beyond.The roots for perpetuating this conflict lie in the domestic context. The crown prince has used the rivalry with Tehran to deflect attention from the complexity of his own domestic uncertainties. The same may be true of Iran.After the Iranian revolution in 1979, the country set out to export its brand of revolutionary Islam. As Iran became an Islamic republic, Sunni Islamists were not only jealous of the triumph of the Shia Islamism but became even more determined to establish their version of the Islamic state.Saudi Arabia exported Wahhabi Islam across Africa, Asia and even Europe. The two countries entered a fierce battle over the souls of Muslims with Saudi clerics augmenting their anti-Shiite rhetoric and the Iranian counterparts playing down their Shiism to appeal to Pan-Islamic, anti-imperial and anti-Western sentiments among Muslims.The unprecedented marginalization and humiliation of senior princes haunts the young crown prince and his numerous disgruntled brothers and cousins. It is uncertain what the fallout will be.Prince Mohammed\u2019s intense and populist anti-Iranian rhetoric and promises to roll back Iranian influence in Bahrain, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq are also aimed at creating a warlike situation in which internal dissent is silenced.Rivalry with Iran strengthens Saudi national solidarity. Saudis see the brutal war in Yemen, where the Houthi rebels are supported by Iran, as a necessary response in a battle for survival for the Saudi nation and the hegemony of Arabness over Persianization.The Kingdom seeks the shrinking, even the collapse, of the Iranian economy under sanctions. It will never allow any efforts at regional economic integration, which could lead to Iranian human resources and products being readily available in the Gulf region.Prince Mohammed\u2019s Vision 2030 \u2014 an ambitious transformation plan to wean his country off its dependence on oil \u2014 and other economic development plans exclude Iran while the Kingdom seeks greater regional integration with the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt and possibly Israel.During the Cold War, Saudi Arabia and Iran worked together with the United States against the Soviet Union. They accepted a division of labor: Iran provided military capabilities; Saudi Arabia provided theological ammunition and funding against the Soviet Union.For domestic reasons, Saudi Arabia is fundamentally trying to mitigate the possibility of the reintegration of Iran in the global community. The conflict between the two countries will dissipate only if the domestic uncertainties subside or fade away.Another world might be possible when the Kingdom feels internally secure and moves toward a representative government that solves domestic problems by consensus rather than blaming external enemies for its shortcomings.Madawi al-Rasheed, a visiting professor at London School of Economics, is the editor of \u201cSalman\u2019s Legacy: The Dilemmas of a New Era in Saudi Arabia.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Tannenbaum, chief economist of Northern Trust in Chicago. \u201cThe 2.3 percent figure is moderately encouraging.\u201d Economists had expected economic growth to ease in the quarter.\u201cThe rest of 2018 seems well assured given the substantial support that is going to come from government fiscal policy,\u201d Mr. Tannenbaum said, referring to the $1.5 trillion cost of the tax cuts.He noted, however, that \u201clonger term, the immediate benefits of tax reform will fade, and what we\u2019ll be left with is the bill.\u201dEconomists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy\u2019s upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two. The nation\u2019s debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.In the longer run, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.Holiday shopping in the final quarter of 2017 had revved up consumer spending \u2014 which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation\u2019s economic activity \u2014 to 4 percent. Businesses responded by replenishing depleted inventories. But the shopping surge receded when the new year started; consumer spending grew only 1.1 percent in the first quarter.\u201cI think the fact that we didn\u2019t see a big spurt in spending after the tax cut suggests it\u2019s either too early in the game or consumers are going to continue to be a bit cautious,\u201d said Kathy Bostjancic, chief United States financial economist at Oxford Economics. Nonetheless, she added, \u201cI think there is a legitimate question as to how much of the tax cuts get saved to pull down debt, and how much actually gets spent.\u201dAs for business spending, many of the tax incentives were aimed not at immediate investment decisions, but at those in the medium term. \u201cIt does take time for that to filter through,\u201d Ms. Bostjancic said. Some businesses may have also sped up their timetables for purchases at the end of 2017 in order to take advantage of bigger deductions before the tax changes went into effect.For several years, first-quarter growth rates have been weaker than the longer-term trends indicated, only to rebound in later months. This year, the result could reflect a falloff in spending after an unusual surge that followed the havoc wrought by late-summer hurricanes. Severe winter weather could have also slowed consumption. But some analysts wonder if data adjustments are part of the problem.Government economists try to account for seasonal changes, but the corrective measures may be only partially successful. \u201cThere\u2019s a little weakness in Q1 and then the other quarters are artificially inflated because of that,\u201d Ms. Bostjancic said.In any case, the gross domestic product estimate released Friday by the Commerce Department is not the final word on the first quarter. The estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months. In the past, the final number has been higher or lower by as much as a percentage point.The number of workers applying for jobless benefits last week fell to its lowest level in nearly 50 years. Salary and benefit costs to employers also increased, according to new figures released Friday.At the conclusion of the March meeting, Jerome H. Powell, the new Fed chairman, said, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take that middle ground.\u201dMichael Pearce, a senior economist at Capital Economics, said he did not expect the Fed\u2019s outlook to change much, regardless of Friday\u2019s report.Advertisement"}

If this morning\u2019s futures hold, the S&P 500 will be about 10.5 percent off its January peak, around 6 percent off its level when Gary Cohn, the last of the Trump \u201cglobalists,\u201d was pushed out.My question is, why such a large fall?One good answer is, that\u2019s a stupid question. The three rules you need to bear in mind when discussing the stock market are (1) the stock market is not the economy (2) the stock market is not the economy (3) the stock market is not the economy. And stocks move for all sorts of reasons, or no visible reason at all. As Paul Samuelson famously quipped, the market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.Another answer is that the trade war is a signal: Trump, Navarro et al are showing that they really are as unhinged and irresponsible as they seem, and markets are taking notice. Imagine how these people would handle a financial crisis.Still, I think it\u2019s worth noting that even if we are headed for a full-scale trade war, conventional estimates of the costs of such a war don\u2019t come anywhere near to 10 percent of GDP, or even 6 percent. In fact, it\u2019s one of the dirty little secrets of international economics that standard estimates of the cost of protectionism, while not trivial, aren\u2019t usually earthshaking either.Yet there is a reason why stock prices might overshoot the overall economic costs of a trade war. For a trade war that \u201cdeglobalized\u201d the U.S. economy would require a big reallocation of resources, including capital. Yet you go to trade war with the capital you have, not the capital you\u2019re eventually going to want \u2013 and stocks are claims on the capital we have now, not the capital we\u2019ll need if America goes all in on Trumponomics.First, about the costs of trade war. This is the wonkish part, so feel free to skim and don\u2019t worry if it seems incomprehensible, as long as you\u2019re willing to accept the bottom line for the sake of argument.And a trade war, by imposing artificial costs such as tariffs on international trade, undoes that productive specialization, making everyone less efficient.We can, with some heroic assumptions, put numbers to the kind of costs involved. Strictly speaking, we should do this using \u201cgeneral equilibrium\u201d \u2013 modeling the economy as a whole. But another dirty little secret of international economics \u2013 much littler than the previous one \u2013 is that you get pretty close with \u201cpartial equilibrium\u201d \u2013 just treating the market for imports as if it were the market for a single product that\u2019s a small part of the economy.If you imagine raising the tariff step by step, then, at each step we are imposing costs on the economy equal to the extra cost of the domestic product that replaces an import. The total costs of the tariff are represented by the area of the triangle: the reduction in imports caused by the tariff, multiplied by (roughly) half the tariff rate.(Somebody is going to ask, what about exports? They\u2019re implicitly included in this estimate. Trust me.)Obviously this is just an illustrative calculation; I\u2019ve tried to use reasonable-ish numbers, but you don\u2019t want to make too much of it. What it does suggest, however, is that even a trade war that drastically rolled back globalization wouldn\u2019t impose costs on the economy comparable to the kinds of movement we\u2019ve seen in stock prices.Since about 1990 corporate America has bet heavily on hyperglobalization \u2013 on the continuance of an open-market regime that has encouraged complex value chains that sprawl across borders. The notebook on which I\u2019m writing this was designed in California, but probably assembled in China, with many of the components coming from South Korea and Japan. Apple could produce it entirely in North America, and probably would in the face of 30 percent tariffs. But the factories it would take to do that don\u2019t (yet) exist.Meanwhile, the factories that do exist were built to serve globalized production \u2013 and many of them would be marginalized, maybe even made worthless, by tariffs that broke up those global value chains. That is, they would become stranded assets. Call it the anti-China shock.Still, my original question was why stocks are dropping so much more than the likely costs of trade war to the economy. And one answer, I\u2019d suggest, is disruption \u2013 which business leaders love to celebrate in their rhetoric, but hate when it happens to them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Koreans Set the Table for a Deal That Trump Will Try to Close", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBut disarmament experts who watched the Korean leaders meet in the DMZ agreed that Mr. Kim had been driving the events.Mr. Kim has learned the art of surprise as surely as his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, North Korea\u2019s founder and the younger Mr. Kim\u2019s role model, did. The elder Mr. Kim caught the world unawares by invading the South in June 1950.The Friday encounter did everything it was supposed to do to set up the next summit meeting, between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump. That is the moment, South Koreans say, for any nuclear deal to be struck, something that can only happen when an American president is in the room.The question is whether Mr. Kim is really ready to make that deal, or whether he is betting, as most experts think he is, that he can get help to normalize the North\u2019s economy while keeping at least parts of a fearsome arsenal that he believes has kept the Kim family in power.It sets a deadline of completing some kind of peace arrangement \u2014 not necessarily a treaty \u2014 by the end of this year. But it sets no schedule for denuclearization. That is a critical point, because until now the Trump administration\u2019s position has been that the North must surrender all its weapons first, and that any talk of treaties or trade, or sanctions relief, would come only when its weapons, its uranium and plutonium and its missiles are securely out of the country.President Moon\u2019s advisers insisted that the vagueness of the agreement published on Friday was a virtue, not a defect, and that it would be up to others to work out the details. But they also insist that \u201cChairman Kim,\u201d as they called the young leader, is driven by different imperatives than his father and grandfather were. \u201cThey want a Trump Tower and a McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Moon Chung-in, a special adviser to the South Korean president, insisted in an interview with Christiane Amanpour on CNN on Friday.Perhaps they do \u2014 the North\u2019s most famous hotel, in Pyongyang, the capital, leans so dangerously that it was never opened, and North Korea is not known for its fast-food chains. But ask the people who have seen past peace initiatives whether they think this one will work out any differently, and they have serious doubts that Mr. Kim will give up his nuclear program for any price.Among the skeptics is Mr. Trump\u2019s new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who made a secret visit to Pyongyang over Easter weekend to try to gauge Mr. Kim\u2019s sincerity. Last summer, it was Mr. Pompeo, then still the C.I.A. director, who argued that the only way to deal with North Korea was to separate Mr. Kim from his weapons, a comment some interpreted as advocating regime change.On Friday at NATO, on his first full day as secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo suggested for the first time that the North Korean leader was ready to deal. \u201cI did get a sense that he was serious,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe economic pressure that has been put in place by this global effort that President Trump has led has led him to believe that it\u2019s in his best interest to come to the table and talk about denuclearization.\u201dYet talking is different from denuclearizing. And talking about denuclearizing is hardly new. The North promised the same in a 1992 agreement, and many in Seoul, the South\u2019s capital, wondered then if the nightmare of living under the constant threat of artillery barrage was about to end. In fact, the agreement reached on Friday picks up language from the 1992 accord, and has similar provisions about reuniting families separated during the Korean War and nonaggression agreements. Little of it happened.There were two agreements with the George W. Bush administration, each described at the time as breakthroughs. Since then the North has amassed 20 to 60 nuclear weapons, up from zero when those commitments were made.No one knows those numbers better than Mr. Pompeo, who spent a lot of time with the C.I.A.\u2019s Korea Mission unit, assessing the scope and imminence of its nuclear capabilities. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history here, where promises have been made, hopes have been raised and then dashed,\u201d the new secretary of state told reporters.China, which is largely interested in maintaining the status quo, could also loosen the restrictions on oil and goods, as long as negotiations play out.All this suggests that Mr. Trump\u2019s challenge when he meets Mr. Kim, probably in early June, is growing. He must establish the process for the actual dismantlement of weapons, the removal of stockpiled uranium and plutonium bomb fuel from the country and a verification program that will be one of the most complex in history, given the vastness of North Korea\u2019s mountains.In short, Mr. Trump must do better than Mr. Obama did in the Iran deal, an agreement Mr. Trump believes is so flawed it should be abandoned.What no one knows yet is the kind of concessions Mr. Kim is hoping to demand in return. Han Sung-joo, a former South Korean foreign minister who negotiated with the North for much of his career, says he believes he knows where this is headed.\u201cIf Kim Jong-un indeed came up with the idea of the so-called peace momentum getting started, it was indeed a jackpot of an idea,\u201d Mr. Han said this week. Mr. Kim\u2019s goals, Mr. Han said, will be to \u201cweaken international sanctions,\u201d draw serious investment into the North and make the country\u2019s nuclear status \u201ca fait accompli.\u201dMr. Trump, in contrast, says he will solve the North Korea problem, once and for all. After Friday\u2019s meeting, he will now face the task of explaining how.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Guide to Getting Along in Putin\u2019s Russia", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Trudolyubov edits\u00a0The Russia File, a blog published by the Kennan Institute in Washington.MOSCOW \u2014 Last month, Vladimir V. Putin was re-elected as Russia\u2019s president in a plebiscite-like ceremony with all other candidates essentially decorating the ballot\u2019s margins. Years of aggressive campaigning, tinkering with electoral rules and eliminating competition had long prepared the field for an easy win.The tough part now, for Mr. Putin, is to deal with the consequences of 18 years of being able to do whatever he pleases. His fourth term (fifth if we count the four years of Dmitri Medvedev\u2019s presidency as what they were, a Putin regency) is off to a tumultuous start.Yet there is a sphere where progress has been steady throughout the Putin years \u2014 in spreading acceptance of the principles that underlie his rule. For years, Russia watchers, and Russians themselves, have asked to what extent the Kremlin is driven by an ideology, or at least by a consistent value system. Is it nationalism, isolationism, irredentism, judo?Far from any belief or ideology, the principles form an ethos, something you must \u201cget\u201d to make progress in the society. Russia\u2019s rulers no longer bow to any ideology. But they do follow some basic working rules.First: A disaster, natural or man-made, makes the state vulnerable. After an explosion, flood or fire, enemies of the state can try to hold the authorities accountable. How an emergency is covered in the news is as important as how it is resolved. This is why the Kremlin rushed to place all federal television channels under control immediately after the early disasters of the Putin era (the submarine Kursk sinking in 2000 and the 2002 terrorist siege at a Moscow theater). One consequence of this view is a conviction that all information disseminated through channels outside state control, including social media, is damaging and foreign-funded. A few days ago, the Russian government moved to block the popular messenger and social network Telegram after its owner refused to give the secret police access to the network\u2019s user data.Second: A threat originates only from an external or foreign source. That is why laws and rules regulating foreign companies, foreign-funded nongovernmental organizations and religions and ideologies considered \u201cfringe\u201d have proliferated. Wild hints that big foreign interests are behind a given problem is the first trope on state-run media after any disaster or potentially damaging episode. It follows that all grass-roots activism not authorized by the state has a foreign origin and is foreign-funded.Third: A civil servant is accountable only to his or her superior, not to the public. It follows that a subordinate can be held accountable but the superior standing at the very top can be seen only as a savior, not responsible for any wrong. You do not blame President Putin for anything; you only appeal to him for justice. From this, it also follows that, in Mr. Putin\u2019s view, there is no right to resist or to overthrow a government, no matter how terrible or murderous it is. That is why Bashar al-Assad of Syria stays in place.Those are the laws Mr. Putin has followed domestically and internationally during most of his rule.The destruction of real accountability, the never-say-sorry attitude and the rejection of grass-roots activism are widely accepted as realities in Russia, if not as universal truths.Whenever President Putin is touted as the world\u2019s most powerful or influential politician, I feel puzzled. The rules that Mr. Putin follows are technical. He is no philosopher of government; he is a skilled practitioner. These rules are simply ad hoc mechanisms for holding onto power in a dangerous environment. And the Kremlin political managers are skillful plumbers who deal with old leaky piping and loathe the idea of replacing it.Do other nations really have anything to learn from them?I would argue that perceived similarities between President Trump\u2019s thinking and Mr. Putin\u2019s do not necessarily mean that Mr. Trump has been learning from Russia\u2019s president. When your objective, like Mr. Trump\u2019s, is surviving in power, you arrive, on your own, at pragmatic rules that work for you. The extent to which President Trump values survival is unique among Western leaders. Mr. Putin has been fighting for survival for years, and he has become a grandmaster of that dark art.But playing this game has consequences. Just as the Kremlin has ad hoc rules, most Russians have some, too. They \u201cget\u201d what it takes to prosper in their system: Pretend you are loyal, tell the interviewer you approve of the president, mark the right box and there you go. Freedom!This doesn\u2019t sound heroic, but heroes are a rare breed. The Russian people and the Russian state cohabitate, each minding its own business.Disasters and tragedies are occasions when state and people meet. Sparks of conflict start to fly because both sides realize they\u2019ve been fooling each other. The Kremlin and its viceroys have pretended to manage, and the people on the ground have pretended to be loyal. There\u2019s a crisis of loyalty, if you will. It\u2019s not that loyalty is lacking; it\u2019s that there\u2019s too much loyalty, and it\u2019s all fake. And that brings a moment of truth, when everyone realizes that Russians would jump at any opportunity to turn their relationship with the state back on its feet.But all of that goes away quickly because it bumps up against precisely what the Kremlin is there for: to close down the pockets of normalcy. Any attempt at holding the president accountable is made so costly for the people, and the propaganda of the opposite view is so relentless, that Russians put up with all of this just to stay out of trouble and have a normal life.The principles recounted above are not the sort in which you choose to believe; they must be imposed. And by the time you recognize that a system like this is around you, it is probably too late to resist. You will have to learn the Putin creed or something similar.So, really, there is no rush to learn from him.An earlier version of this article misstated the the length of Dmitri Medvedev\u2019s tenure as president of Russia. He served four years, not eight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will U.S. Withdrawal from Unesco Affect Heritage Sites?", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEach country is responsible for maintaining its sites, but leaving the organization means not being on the committee that selects places for the list.The World Heritage program, which began in 1972, includes a list of 1,073 sites \u201cthat are of outstanding universal value to humanity,\u201d and should therefore \u201cbe protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy,\u201d according to Unesco\u2019s website. But in 2011 the United States stopped funding Unesco, standing with Israel when Palestine was admitted to the organization (legislation from the 1990s requires a cutoff of American funding to United Nations agencies that accept Palestine as a full member). Yet despite cuts in funding \u2014 United States contributions were 22 percent of Unesco\u2019s yearly budget or about $70 million before the 2011 funding cutoff \u2014 travelers would not experience a direct impact when visiting World Heritage sites, according to George Papagiannis, the chief of media services at Unesco headquarters in Paris. \u201cMaintenance and preservation of the sites is the responsibility of the host country,\u201d Mr. Papagiannis said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut we do hold countries accountable to maintaining their sites in accordance with the World Heritage Convention.\u201d Sites are monitored with conservation reports that all countries are required to file every six years. If the United States withdraws from Unesco, it would remain a state party, having signed and ratified the World Heritage Convention. \u201cThere is one consequence only,\u201d Mr. Papagiannis said about the United States withdrawal. \u201cThe U.S. cannot be elected to the World Heritage Committee,\u201d a managing committee made up of elected representatives from 21 countries. The committee is in charge of allocating financial assistance and determining what sites are included on, or removed from, the World Heritage List. Despite no longer being a paying member, the United States would be able to continue to submit sites for World Heritage List consideration. The World Heritage Committee will next meet in Bahrain from June 24 to July 4, 2018. \u201cThe leadership of the U.S. is crucial in this debate,\u201d said Dr. Simon. \u201cIts voice will be thoroughly missed at the table.\u201d There are several benefits for sites that are included on the World Heritage List. Unesco provides leadership on maintaining the health of the sites, including a focus on sustainable tourism. \u201cAn important component of what we do is providing guidance for managing tourism numbers in a sustainable way,\u201d Mr. Papagiannis said.Increases in tourism can also bring challenges to a site. \u201cTourism and development can cause both positive and negative consequences,\u201d said Dr. Simon. \u201cMany of the more than 1,000 World Heritage sites are struggling with keeping a balance between the economic benefits created by soaring tourism and development, and connected threats to the cultural significance which originally put them on the list.\u201dIn addition to the World Heritage program, Unesco works on a range of issues including journalistic freedom and access to information, education, equality for women, climate change, clean water and promoting women in science. \u201cUnesco focuses, in particular, on two global priorities: Africa and gender equality,\u201d Dr. Simon said. \u201cWith this, I think it is obvious that Unesco\u2019s mission is more than just valuable, it is essential.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Servants Are Losing Their Foothold in the Middle Class", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 The anxiety and seething anger that followed the disappearance of middle-income jobs in factory towns has helped reshape the American political map and topple longstanding policies on tariffs and immigration.But globalization and automation aren\u2019t the only forces responsible for the loss of those reliable paychecks. So is the steady erosion of the public sector.\u201cI was surprised to realize along the way I was no longer middle class,\u201d said Teresa Moore, who has spent 30 years investigating complaints of abused or neglected children, veterans and seniors in Oklahoma.She raised two daughters in Alex, a rural dot southwest of the capital, on her salary. But when she applied for a mortgage nine years ago, the loan officer casually described her as \u201clow income.\u201dAt 57, Ms. Moore now earns just over $43,000, which she supplements with a part-time job as a computer technician.Reducing state and local payrolls, of course, is a goal that has champions and detractors. Anti-tax crusaders, concerned about cost and overreach, have longed for a smaller government that delivers only the most limited services. Public-sector defenders worry that shortages of restaurant inspectors, rat exterminators, mental health counselors and the like will hurt neighborhoods. Pothole-studded roads and unreliable garbage pickup don\u2019t entice businesses, either.Yet whether one views a diminished public sector as vital to economic growth or a threat to health and safety, it is undeniable that it has led to a significant decline in middle-class employment opportunities.\u201cIt\u2019s a tough time to be working in government,\u201d said Neil Reichenberg, executive director of the International Public Management Association for Human Resources. Once there were several attractions to public employment in addition to the mission of making a difference in your community, he added, but incentives like good health insurance and retirement benefits have disappeared. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of cutbacks that have made government a less competitive employer,\u201d he said.From the late 1950s through 1980, the United States added 350,000 new state and local workers a year. The rate slowed in the mid-1980s through the early 2000s, but payrolls still grew annually by 300,000 workers.\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters,\u201d he added.Nonetheless, those combined payrolls dwarf those of the federal government, which employs about 2.8 million civilians, including postal workers. That number has shrunk slightly in recent years.The government employment pinch especially hurts in small and rural counties, where President Trump and other Republicans are popular. These areas tend to lack the number and diversity of private employers found in larger cities, and are therefore more dependent on government jobs.Oklahoma is one of several Republican-led states where persistent anti-tax sentiment and severe budget cuts have guided policymaking, particularly since 2010, when many candidates supported by Tea Party voters won local offices.Justin Fortney, 41, was one of 200 employees laid off by the state health department this year. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more difficult to be a public employee \u2014 whether that\u2019s a teacher or public health officer \u2014 and see yourself as part of a thriving middle class,\u201d he said.Mr. Fortney, who lives with his wife and son in Guthrie, 30 miles north of the capital, was forced to start job hunting. \u201cWe always made it work,\u201d said Mr. Fortney, who was employed by the state for 12 years and earned about $50,000 annually. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to choose to be a public servant, you have to have in mind that you will live in a small home and drive a sometimes unreliable vehicle.\u201dHe said he worried that talented workers will opt for the private sector. Staffing shortages are common in states across the country.Since 2009, staffing at the state mental health department in Oklahoma is down more than 20 percent, and at the Office of Juvenile Affairs by nearly a quarter. The state Office of Fire Marshal once employed 30 workers, but now has 18.Many government workers take a second job to make ends meet. Eldon Johnson, 40, who cares for children with cerebral palsy and autism at a group home in Norman, works from 2:45 to 10:45 p.m., earning $12.50 an hour, less than some clerks at 7-Eleven. He then drives directly to his better-paying second job at a private mental health center, where he works until 8 a.m.\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could make it without a second job, unless I lived in a box, and maybe had a moped,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who has worked for the state for 10 years.Advocates for disadvantaged groups like foster children or the disabled have trouble rallying broad support for budget and tax increases, but public school teachers have been able to recruit additional allies among families with school-age children.Parents from affluent Republican suburbs like Bixby and Jenks outside Tulsa, for instance, car-pooled for a 100-mile trip to the State Capitol last month to lobby lawmakers for more education funding and raises for teachers.\u201cMy adjusted gross income is $28,000,\u201d said Shala Marshall, a Spanish teacher at Jenks High School. A 17-year veteran with a master\u2019s degree and a finalist for Oklahoma teacher of the year, Ms. Marshall has two children. \u201cI can\u2019t support a family on that,\u201d she said.So she puts in another 30 hours or so a week tutoring students and selling online the luminescent pink LipSense gloss she wears. That pays for soccer cleats, camp and school pictures, as well as her children\u2019s health insurance.\u201cNo one wants to raise taxes, but we\u2019ve got to pay the bills,\u201d said Josh West, a freshman Republican from Grove, where his four children attend public school.He was one of several lawmakers to meet with Bixby and Jenks parents over box lunches from Chick-fil-A. An Army veteran, Mr. West said he had been criticized by conservative groups for refusing to sign a pledge to never to raise taxes.\u201cMy district just wants to fix the problem,\u201d Mr. West said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Republican or Democrat.\u201dThe recent budget also includes small pay raises for other state workers. Ms. Moore, for instance, who watches over vulnerable adults, is slated to get an additional $750 a year.But the Department of Human Services, where she works, won\u2019t be able to restore any of the 1,200 jobs eliminated over the past three years, leaving the agency with 6,109 full-time employees. Those figures don\u2019t include 800 vacancies that cannot be filled because the budget is overstretched.So Ms. Moore will still be responsible for roughly a third of the state, covering 25 counties, 19,000 square miles, and more than 100 long-term care institutions that care for older or disabled residents as well as those with dementia.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of windshield time,\u201d she said.Because of the cuts, the agency extended the deadline for maltreatment investigations at nursing homes. Rather than beginning within seven days of a complaint, they must now start within 30 days.Ms. Moore\u2019s friends and neighbors hold conflicting views of her taxpayer-funded job. \u201cThe minute they have someone in the nursing home they perceive to be mistreated, we\u2019re the first people they come to,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want us when they need us. And when they no longer need us again, they don\u2019t want us.\u201dSome are resentful that they are being asked to pay for benefits that they themselves struggle to afford.\u201cI asked my brother, \u2018How do you feel about this pay raise?\u2019\u201d Ms. Moore recalled. \u201cHe said: \u2018I want you to have it. You deserve it. But we don\u2019t feel like we should pay for it.\u2019\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cwho do you want to pay for it?\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTPatricia Cohen reported from Oklahoma City and Robert Gebeloff from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Melcher, Montana Democrat in House and Senate, Dies at 93", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis daughter, Joan Melcher, confirmed the death.A World War II combat veteran who was a large-animal veterinarian and got his start in politics as a small-town alderman, Dr. Melcher was 45 when he went to Washington in 1969. He was one of Montana\u2019s two United States representatives until January 1977, when he succeeded the retiring Mr. Mansfield, the longtime majority leader, and then served two full Senate terms until 1989.Propelled by a generation of independent Montana voters who favored Democrats and liberal social policies, but tended to be conservative on economic issues, Dr. Melcher supported affirmative action, organized labor, the preservation of public lands and protections for consumers, especially food safety and nutrition programs. He also promoted animal-welfare rights.He strongly defended farm subsidies and was known as a fighter for agriculture, particularly eastern Montana\u2019s wheat growers and cattle ranchers. He introduced bills to promote assistance for elderly Americans, including more access to long-term health care and improvements in cost-of-living formulas used to calculate Social Security benefits for retirees.Dr. Melcher, who was chairman of the Select Committee on Aging, once told the Senate that many poor elderly people did not take advantage of food stamps, Medicaid and other benefits to which they were entitled. \u201cOlder Americans really don\u2019t want to become identified with welfare,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of pride and dignity.\u201dJohn David Melcher was born in Sioux City, Iowa, on Sept. 6, 1924, one of three sons of Anthony Melcher and the former Nell Mentor. His parents were divorced when John was 8, and he and his brother, Robert, stayed with relatives when their father, a traveling salesman of farm pumps, went on the road. Another brother, Patrick, had died earlier.John grew up in Dubuque and Ashton, Iowa, and on a ranch 10 miles outside Oelrichs, S.D. Members of his family recalled that he rode a horse to and from Oelrichs High School, from which he graduated in 1942.On summer vacations, John sometimes accompanied his father on business trips, and on one journey to the West he fell in love with the prairies and mountains of Montana.He attended the University of Minnesota for a year, but left to join the Army in World War II. He served with the 76th Infantry Division in Europe and participated in the invasion of Normandy in 1944. Wounded near Trier, Germany, in 1945, he won the Purple Heart, the Combat Infantryman\u2019s Badge and the Bronze Star. He was discharged and hospitalized at Santa Barbara, Calif.After recuperating in late 1945, he married Ruth Klein, a former high school classmate. They had six children.Dr. Melcher earned a degree in veterinary medicine from Iowa State University at Ames in 1950. Drawn by memories of a childhood trip with his father, he moved with his family to Forsyth, a community of under 2,000 in eastern Montana. There he established his Yellowstone Veterinary Clinic and treated horses, cattle, pigs and sheep until his election to Congress in 1969.In 1953, he was elected to the Forsyth City Council. Finding a liking and a talent for public service, he won a string of elections, and served as Forsyth\u2019s mayor from 1955 to 1961, as a member of the Montana House of Representatives from Rosebud County from 1961 to 1963, and as a state senator in Helena, the capital, from 1963 to 1967.He then returned to the lower house for two years, but with encouragement from Democratic and legislative colleagues he had his sights set on the national stage. He was a square-jawed, down-to-earth politician whose interests in animals and agriculture grew out of long associations with farmers, ranchers and small-town people in sparsely populated eastern Montana.Dr. Melcher lost his initial race for a seat in Congress in 1966. But in 1969 he won a special election to replace Representative James F. Battin, a Republican who had resigned to take a federal judgeship.Dr. Melcher settled in Missoula after his years in Washington. He founded a lobbying and consulting firm and worked for the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges and for various veterinary medical groups for many years.In an interview for this obituary in 2017, Dr. Melcher recalled his 1984 amendment to the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, requiring that the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates be considered in research.\u201cIt was just something I could do,\u201d he said of his measure, which prohibited long periods of isolation in cages and other mental cruelties.Jane Goodall, the primatologist and authority on chimpanzees, hailed his amendment. She visited Dr. Melcher in Washington, gave him a copy of her book \u201cThe Chimpanzees of Gombe\u201d (1986) and wrote in an inscription: \u201cWhen this bill is well and truly implemented, the difference in the lives of hundreds of animals will truly be great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in the capital of ultraconservative Saudi Arabia, it was a watershed moment: the first opening of a commercial movie theater in more than 30 years.The invitation-only screening of the Hollywood blockbuster \u201cBlack Panther\u201d on Wednesday was part of a wider social opening in the kingdom championed by the 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Saudi officials hope that expanding entertainment options will not only allow citizens to have more fun, but also help the economy by keeping at home some of the millions of dollars that Saudis spend on entertainment abroad. They hope that the creation of a domestic entertainment sector will also generate much-needed jobs for young Saudis.While international companies have swooped into Saudi Arabia, signing deals to build and operate theaters, movies for the masses are not yet a reality, as Wednesday\u2019s event made clear.The movie theater itself, inside a largely vacant and only partially constructed financial district, had been hastily put together in a two-story concert hall that appeared better outfitted for symphonies.Two other halls in the same complex still lacked seats.But enthusiasm for the changes was tangible among the hundreds of V.I.P. guests, who included government ministers, social media stars and at least one princess.\u201cWe are very happy,\u201d said Fouz al-Thiyabi, 35, the vice principal of a girls\u2019 elementary school, who came with a girlfriend. \u201cThey should have done this a long time ago.\u201dShe said she and her friends used to go to the movies abroad, like many Saudis who would flock to neighboring Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates on weekends to see the latest flicks. Now, she said, she looked forward to seeing movies close to home.\u201cI like modern movies, action movies,\u201d she said. She knew little about \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d but said she would have come no matter what the movie had been.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the film; I came for the event,\u201d she said.Some observers have noted similarities between recent events in Saudi Arabia and the plot of \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d which tells the story of a prince who takes charge of his kingdom, struggles against a rival to the throne and chooses to lead his people in a new direction.Adam Aron, the president and chief executive of AMC Entertainment, which opened the theater, said he had brought his company to Saudi Arabia after meeting Prince Mohammed in his palace. But he declined to say if he saw similarities in the two stories.\u201cIt\u2019s a great movie, very popular with audiences, and we thought it would make everyone happy,\u201d said Mr. Aron, who was in town for the screening. \u201cWhat movie would you have picked?\u201dAMC plans to open at least 40 cinemas in 15 Saudi cities in the next three to five years, he said, and would like to open more than 100 in the next five to 10 years.\u201cWe have a big vision and a big dream for Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said.Tasneem Alsultan reported from Riyadh, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Tries to Pull Nafta Back From Brink as Deadlines Loom", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After months of fraught negotiations and stalled talks, the Trump administration is aiming to announce a preliminary deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement this month, moving to resolve one trading conflict as a separate clash with China looms.A final agreement is far from guaranteed, but the White House is revising some of its more aggressive demands, particularly related to automobiles, which had been a source of tension with Canada and Mexico. A new proposal would require an automobile to contain components made by workers earning a specific wage level to qualify for Nafta\u2019s preferential tariffs. The administration had previously demanded that vehicles contain a large percentage of auto parts produced in the United States.The new proposal is aimed at stopping United States automakers from shifting production to Mexico in search of cheap labor, according to people familiar with the plan.President Trump, who earlier this week called Nafta an \u201cembarrassment,\u201d said at an event in West Virginia on Thursday that a deal could be announced shortly. \u201cWe\u2019re working very hard on Nafta with Mexico and Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have something I think fairly soon.\u201dMr. Trump said that his aides were pushing to have something concrete finished before next week\u2019s Summit of the Americas in Peru but that a quick deal was not assured.\u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s have Nafta before.\u2019 I said, \u2018Don\u2019t rush it. We\u2019ll take it nice and easy, get it done right or we\u2019ll terminate it,\u201d the president said.The talks, which appeared to be on the brink of collapse just a few months ago, kicked back into gear in recent weeks as political and practical realities prompted a newfound urgency among American negotiators. For a revised Nafta to be approved by the current Republican-controlled congress, the Trump administration would probably have to finalize it before the end of May to allow time for congressional review given the House and Senate calendar.White House trade advisers are meeting with their Mexican and Canadian counterparts in Washington this week to try to hammer out areas of consensus on the most difficult issues of the talks. Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland of Canada and Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo of Mexico were expected to kick off trilateral talks on some of the pact\u2019s thorniest issues over dinner in Washington on Thursday night.\u201cWe are in a moment where we are moving forward in a significant way,,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cHopefully there will be some good news coming.\u201dHe is expected to attend the two-day Summit of the Americas in Peru next week, alongside Mr. Trump and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico.Yet hurdles remain, including how far the United States is willing to go in surrendering many of its negotiating goals, given Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent and vocal criticism of Nafta. Negotiating partners are still waiting to see whether the United States will compromise on the tough requests it has made over the past eight months of negotiations. Many of those demands, including those linked to American auto production, have angered business groups and lawmakers, who say such requirements would actually hurt companies and workers by shifting more manufacturing out of the United States.A quick resolution would necessitate concessions from the Trump administration, potentially resulting in a deal not significantly different from the one Mr. Trump has denounced as a travesty and embarrassment.\u201cUnless the United States is quite a bit more flexible, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible to have a quick agreement, even just an agreement in principle,\u201d said Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a senior vice president at the Albright Stonebridge Group and a former Mexican diplomat in the United States.Some concessions appear to be in the offing. The United States has now backed away from a proposal that would require half of the value of an automobile to be manufactured in the United States to qualify for Nafta\u2019s preferential tariffs. Instead, it is proposing a system that would require a certain proportion of auto parts to be made by workers earning certain wages.That proposal is likely to be more palatable to Canada and could also encourage Mexico to ultimately pay higher wages. And it could help Mr. Trump court the votes of congressional Democrats, who complain that Mexico\u2019s low wages are the reason companies have relocated auto production from the United States.Still, the proposal is likely to face opposition from Mexican negotiators, given that their current wage scales are too low to qualify. And some auto executives also criticized the new proposal, saying it would be nearly as difficult for companies to comply with as earlier ideas, and could ultimately push manufacturing out of North America to cheaper areas.Other key areas of dispute also remain: Negotiators have so far concluded work on only six of the trade agreement\u2019s roughly 30 chapters, and little progress has been made on contentious issues like mechanisms for settling trade disputes or rules for government purchases.Labor unions, which have backed Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to dramatically remake trade policy, were disappointed with that deal, which did not include changes to labor standards, investment rules or content requirements for automotive manufacturing.\u201cYou see what you get if your priority is speed over quality,\u201d said Celeste Drake, trade and globalization policy specialist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cA quick deal that\u2019s not a good deal \u2014 is that what the administration wants to sell in these next few months? Or is it really looking to take the time it needs to get a good deal?\u201dEven an agreement in principle would not rule out the possibility of months or years of wrangling over an eventual deal. Patrick Leblond, senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation, noted that Canada and Europe signed an agreement in principle for a trade pact in the fall of 2013, but that the final deal did not come into effect until September 2017, after almost being derailed.\u201cAs trade negotiators repeatedly point out, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,\u201d Mr. Leblond said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Likes Trump\u2019s Stance on China, but Hates His Methods", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Virtually no one in Europe wants President Trump to plunge headlong into a trade war with China. But nearly everyone thinks that it is time to stand up to China\u2019s closed markets and trade manipulation.The European Union may not like Mr. Trump or the way he is doing things \u2014 but that does not mean it dislikes his aims when it comes to trading with China.The way to make that happen, it believes, is challenging China through negotiations within the existing trading system, avoiding a degenerative tit-for-tat battle that could harm Europe\u2019s relatively vibrant economy.\u201cWhen Trump was elected, a lot of Europeans wondered whether there will be a point where we have to decide between the U.S. and China, and it seems that moment may be now,\u201d said Angela Stanzel, a China expert with the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.\u201cI don\u2019t think Europe will side with China \u2014 we have the same problems with China as the Americans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the E.U. does agree with the Chinese that Trump is doing it the wrong way and has been outspokenly critical about his methods. A trade war between the U.S. and China would really put Europe on the spot.\u201dThe U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.Beijing has good reason to be concerned about Europe and the United States ganging up against it over trade.Despite its unhappiness over Mr. Trump\u2019s methods, Europe is unlikely to side openly with China, given the importance of the trans-Atlantic security relationship and its own arguments with Beijing.Germany and France, in particular, have been increasingly annoyed by China\u2019s behavior, especially its closed markets and its lack of transparency about investments in Europe.\u201cThe Chinese are very, very worried about any kind of trans-Atlantic alliance or even discussions about the rise of China, what it\u2019s doing as an investor or geopolitically,\u201d said Philippe Le Corre, a China expert now at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cChinese officials are always asking about this.\u201dEurope has become tougher in its view of China, he said, with France, Germany and Italy urging the European Union to start screening investments in sensitive industries and sectors.China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, Mr. Le Corre said, \u201cand people think it\u2019s time China plays by the rules.\u201dChina has few real allies in the world of trade, he said, and there has rarely been a better opportunity \u201cfor the world to assess the presence of a huge player who is now involved in everything, takes advantage of open markets elsewhere and doesn\u2019t really open its own market to the West.\u201dMr. Trump campaigned on an economic platform that was anti-globalization, anti-Germany and anti-China. He promised, in particular, to get tough with China to benefit American workers, promising huge and unlikely blanket tariffs and taxes on Chinese imports.Some action was expected, and now it has come.But Ms. Stanzel and others believe that China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, just granted an end to term limits on his job, does not want a trade war that unites the wealthy, technology rich West against him, however reluctantly.\u201cThe Chinese seem willing to negotiate behind closed doors,\u201d she said, adding that the Chinese and the Europeans were both talking to the Trump administration \u201cabout finding a better way.\u201dJyrki Katainen, the European Commission\u2019s vice president in charge of jobs, growth and competitiveness, described Mr. Trump\u2019s methods as \u201cunconventional.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot of words, little implementation, which is good.\u201dBut Europe\u2019s exemption from the steel and aluminum tariffs will end on May 1, unless a deal is reached. And both Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump need to look strong and determined.Brussels feels vulnerable, said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian ambassador who is now a security consultant based in Brussels.The European stance so far, he said, is a mix of tactics, strategy and denial.But if the United States \u201cdeclares an all-out war on the W.T.O. and the international free trade system while China becomes its defender,\u201d Mr. Stefanini said, \u201cthe E.U. will inevitably be pushed on to China\u2019s side.\u201dNeutrality is difficult, he said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re already under attack,\u201d especially given that the binding essence of the European Union is free trade and the global rule-based order.The bloc is right to try to preserve the global trading system and to bring Washington and Beijing to the table, Mr. Wolff said. But Europe will also find itself under pressure if China starts redirecting its steel to Europe, as Russia is likely to do with its aluminum.\u201cWill lobby pressures become so great that the E.U. will also feel compelled to raise tariffs?\u201d he asked.Europe\u2019s best response, Mr. Wolff suggested, is to put greater focus on its domestic market in order to reduce its dependence on global trade. Europe should, he said, increase its domestic investment, promote innovation in the new digital economy currently dominated by the United States and China, and spend more on its own defense.\u201cThis strategy will not be easy,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. But reducing dependency, he added, is the best answer to \u201cthe formidable challenge that President Trump poses for our prosperity and security.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico Moves to Regulate Government Ads. Critics Say It\u2019s a Sham.", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a campaign that aired last year, for example, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was seen touring an aerospace factory, sharing barbecue with ranchers and talking with residents of a new housing project. Open almost any newspaper in Mexico, and full-page ads laud all the schools rebuilt after last year\u2019s earthquake.The heavy government spending on advertising, a longstanding practice at both the federal and state level in Mexico, has been heavily criticized for encouraging flattering coverage of officials and quieting their critics.Now, facing a court-ordered deadline, Mexico\u2019s Congress is ready to adopt legislation it says will regulate that spending for the first time. But opposition parties and citizen watchdog groups say the bill, backed by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s party, is a sham.Jorge Triana, a congressman from the opposition National Action Party, says the measure leaves intact an unwritten rule officials have long enforced with the news media: \u201cI don\u2019t pay you for you to attack me.\u201dMost news outlets in Mexico rely heavily on public advertising; few would survive without it. That dependence gives officials leverage to push their owners to run favorable stories and stop others from seeing the light of day. Editors and reporters say officials routinely shape the news, telling outlets what they should or should not report.\u201cThe government has its media darlings who act as spokespeople,\u201d said Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez, a congressman with the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution. \u201cThey reward them with substantial advertising contracts, and they asphyxiate and punish those critical voices who aren\u2019t replicating the official message.\u201dThe ads, while intended to inform people about government services, are often used to trumpet officials\u2019 own interests.The long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party pioneered the use of ad spending to co-opt the news media, but the practice continued after the National Action Party won the presidency in 2000. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto promised to control the ad spending when he first took office, but he has ended up outspending his predecessors.The bill pending in Congress is a response to a Supreme Court ruling last year that ordered lawmakers to regulate the flow of government money so that it is distributed in an unbiased way. The court sided with Article 19, a free-expression group that sued the government over its ad-spending practices, and told lawmakers to pass legislation by the end of this month.Congress may meet that deadline, but advocates say the measure would do nothing to fix the problem the court identified: Free expression suffers when the government can financially reward or punish news outlets.Under the bill, the interior secretary would evaluate federal advertising campaigns under the principles of \u201cefficiency, economy, transparency and honesty.\u201d Agencies would also report to the secretary on how their advertising budgets are spent.Critics say the bill is notable for what it lacks: specific regulations to promote equitable ad spending and spending limits, and enforcement powers to ensure the rules are followed. Instead, they argue, it institutionalizes discretionary public advertising.\u201cThe court was not asking for the formalizing of the status quo \u2014 they demanded a change,\u201d said Jan Jarab, the Mexico representative for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Instead, he said, the bill legalizes \u201cwhat the court itself called indirect restriction of free expression.\u201dSupporters of the legislation say it addresses the court\u2019s concerns while giving the government a means to promote its efforts. Setting a spending cap would be counterproductive, they say, because it would encourage agencies to spend up to the limit.\u201cThe government can and should spend less than any fixed percentage \u2014 that is why it\u2019s always better to have a flexible regime,\u201d Arturo Huicochea, a congressman with the Institutional Revolutionary Party, said last week.The Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration spent more than twice its budget in 2016 on public-service ads, according to Fundar, a transparency group that examines government data. Last year, the administration spent as much on advertising, about $500 million, as it did to support students in its main scholarship program for public universities.For all that spending, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s approval ratings are among the lowest since pollsters began taking the measure in the 1980s, a reflection of widespread disgust with official corruption. And as the July 1 presidential election approaches, his handpicked candidate, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, is in third place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The March Jobs Numbers Show the Economy Is Sound, but Far From Invincible", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe basic story of a strong labor market remains intact, but a disappointing report is a sign that the U.S. is not in some extraordinary boom.The March employment numbers were a disappointment, but only relative to extremely optimistic expectations. The basic story of a robust United States job market remains very much intact \u2014 though with an important asterisk.But the weak job creation number surely reflects some reversion to the mean after that extraordinary February number. The United States has added an average of 202,000 jobs a month in the first three months of 2018, which probably reflects the true underlying trend better than either February or March in isolation.Weather may be a factor \u2014 a mild February may have goosed that month\u2019s numbers while a more dismal (or even just normal) March depressed the most recent reading.The unemployment rate may not have fallen further, but 4.1 percent is a comfortably low level, and it may well be that future improvement in the job market will show up in the form of a rising labor force rather than shrinking unemployment. One plausible path for the job market would be for the jobless rate to stay roughly where it is while people who previously weren\u2019t even looking for a job decide to seek work \u2014 and find it quickly.And speaking of the labor force, the good news is that most of the extraordinary improvement in February was maintained. There was a gain of 806,000 Americans either working or looking for work in February; the March number gave back less than one-fifth of that.Relatedly, the ratio of the adult population that was employed soared from 60.1 percent in January to 60.4 percent in February, then held that level in March.So taken together, these numbers are fully consistent with the view that the United States labor market \u2014 and economy as a whole \u2014 are in sound shape, expanding steadily and putting more people to work despite an expansion nearing its nine-year anniversary.With average hourly earnings rising only 2.7 percent over the last year, there is not much evidence of the kind of inflationary pressure that might make the Federal Reserve more inclined to tap on the brakes. There is nothing in the March job numbers that is likely to make the Fed rethink its direction one way or the other.Which brings us to the asterisk.This report wasn\u2019t as bad as the headline numbers might suggest, but it does take a bit of the shine off the idea that the economy in 2018 is in some period of extraordinary growth. The soft numbers are evidence that the United States is not in some radically different economic position than it has been for the last several years.Rather, there has been gradual improvement underway for many years that continues apace.In a few weeks, the Commerce Department will release its first estimate of first-quarter growth in gross domestic product, and analysts are expecting it to be nothing special. Macroeconomic Advisers\u2019 most recent tracking estimate was 1.5 percent growth; the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s \u201cGDPNow\u201d forecasting model has it at 2.3 percent. Either of those numbers would look more like the expansion Americans have grown to know these last nine years than some new economic world.If job numbers like February\u2019s had become the norm, it would have had major political implications, in making the tax law passed at the end of 2017 look like an economic boon and suggesting the United States economy was in a boom that could enable it to weather whatever damage a trade war might incur.The March numbers are a reminder that while the economy is sound, this is hardly some unprecedented run of economic greatness. If nothing else, the new numbers are a reminder that no one involved in America\u2019s trade diplomacy should negotiate with a belief in the nation\u2019s economic invincibility. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Urges Dialogue, Not Confrontation, After Trump Seeks Tariffs", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOAO, China \u2014 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday portrayed China as committed to opening its economy as he presented an alternative vision to President Trump\u2019s calls for tariffs and restricting trade, urging \u201cdialogue rather than confrontation.\u201dSpeaking publicly for the first time since the beginning of an escalating trade dispute between his country and the United States, Mr. Xi implicitly took aim at the Trump administration.\u201cThe Cold War mentality and zero-sum game are increasingly obsolete,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cOnly by adhering to peaceful development and working together can we truly achieve win-win results.\u201dMr. Xi also pledged to rebuff efforts to impose barriers to world trade, saying that \u201cChina\u2019s door of opening up will not be closed and will only open up even wider.\u201dHe highlighted areas where China was willing to give, including pledging to ease restrictions on imported cars by the end of the year as well as repeating open-ended promises to give foreigners greater access to the country\u2019s financial markets \u2014 promises officials have made in the past. He also pledged to strengthen intellectual property rights, addressing one of Mr. Trump\u2019s main complaints.The speech also garnered an enthusiastic response from Mr. Trump, who pointed to the potential for negotiations. \u201cWe will make great progress together!\u201d he wrote in a Twitter post on Tuesday.But Mr. Xi\u2019s pitch runs counter to longstanding accusations that China violates trade rules and intellectual property rights. The Chinese president is also pushing a nationalistic agenda, as he tightens his grip on the country\u2019s political, social and economic life.Some were skeptical that China would follow through on its pledges of openness. \u201cPeople will say about the Boao speech: \u2018Show me.\u2019 We heard this in Davos last year,\u201d Joerg Wuttke, former president of the European Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, said in referring to Mr. Xi\u2019s 2017 speech at the World Economic Forum.In a briefing, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that the administration was encouraged by Mr. Xi\u2019s words but that it wanted to see concrete actions from China. In the meantime, she said it would keep moving forward with its plans to impose tariffs.On Tuesday, Mr. Xi appeared to have given Mr. Trump a concession by pledging to \u201csignificantly\u201d lower tariffs on imported automobiles by the end of the year. Just hours before, Mr. Trump had taken to Twitter to complain about China\u2019s 25 percent tax on imported automobiles.But Mr. Xi\u2019s pledges to open China\u2019s banking, auto and manufacturing sectors are not entirely new. Last November, China said it would ease and eventually remove limits on foreign ownership of banks and other financial firms, but financial firms have not received details about when and how that will happen.Even as trade disputes cast a shadow over the world\u2019s two biggest economies, Chinese officials see the increasingly strident tone from Washington as an opportunity. Since Mr. Trump was elected in 2016 and pursued an America First policy that has alienated some allies, Mr. Xi and other Chinese leaders have tried to fill the void left by America\u2019s declining presence on the world stage.At Boao, Chinese officials have promoted Mr. Xi\u2019s leadership as providing an opening to carry out ambitious plans to overhaul the country\u2019s economy and make it more open.On trade, government leaders and Chinese corporate chiefs have sought to strike a delicate balance: playing down worries about the effect on China of a protracted trade fight, while warning that the global economic system could be disrupted by a trade war and that the United States risks falling behind.\u201cIf a trade conflict becomes a trade war, the U.S. is more likely to be hurt worse by this than China,\u201d Dai Xianglong, a former governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, said on Monday at the opening of the forum.Other countries could be hit as well, said Fan Gang, director of China\u2019s National Economic Research Institute. China is just a piece of a complicated regional supply chain across Asia, he said, citing the example of the Apple iPhone.

But Japan\u2019s deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, ruled out that possibility in March, saying that such a negotiation would lead to unnecessary pain for Japan.Instead, Japan forged ahead with a deal among the accord\u2019s 11 remaining members, which they reached last month. Japan maintains that this agreement is still fragile, and that negotiating another pact with the United States could put its success at risk.Japan has said it would be willing to enter a one-on-one deal only if it would serve as a bridge to the United States\u2019 re-entering the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Other countries have also been cool to the idea of giving any ground to the United States after they spent months reworking the deal after Mr. Trump withdrew.But the stem-winding deliberations about the pact have added another dose of confusion to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy as anxiety grows that the Trump administration is on the verge of starting a global trade war.And Mr. Trump regularly muses about ending the North American Free Trade Agreement, even as his advisers say publicly that negotiations with Canada and Mexico are proceeding in a positive direction.The mixed signals have put the president\u2019s economic advisers in an awkward position and raised the hopes of many Republicans in Congress who have been optimistic that he would seek ways to ease trade tensions. Farmers and business groups have been fearful that retaliation from other countries on trade will stall the recent strength in the economy.\u201cThis whole trade thing has exploded,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said last week, explaining that he was pulling together a team to begin renegotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership.While rejoining the pact would please some Republicans, it would have been a significant breach of a campaign promise and an embrace of a policy that the president has described as a \u201crape of our country.\u201d For that reason, many of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest aides have been quietly playing down the prospects of re-entry.On Tuesday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that Mr. Trump made a \u201cbig announcement\u201d this year when he said he would consider rejoining the trade pact. However, he cautioned that the United States would only do so if it could cut a much better deal.Asked on CNBC about the chances of the United States rejoining the pact, Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\u201cI\u2019m not going to handicap it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Amazon\u2019s New Headquarters Could Mean for Rents", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWinning the contest could mean a steeper increase in local housing costs over the next decade, a study finds. Nashville is already contemplating the impact.To some locals, Amazon represented something else: more people, more traffic and, most of all, higher rents in a city where a rising share of residents were already struggling to afford a place to live.Other cities could also see big increases if Amazon picks them. Monthly rents in Boston and Los Angeles could jump by even larger amounts in dollar terms \u2014 albeit from a higher starting point \u2014 reflecting a shortfall in rental housing construction. Denver \u2014 like Nashville, a midsize city that has seen brisk population growth in recent years \u2014 could see its already rapid rate of rent increases hit nearly 6 percent per year, triple the overall rate of inflation.Some potential locations would be less severely affected. Atlanta and Chicago, big cities that have made it relatively easy to build new housing in recent decades, would see only a small rent increase if they won the Amazon project. And Indianapolis, where population growth has been slow and housing is plentiful, would see no effect on its rents at all, according to Zillow\u2019s model. Even in those cities, however, neighborhoods near the Amazon campus would most likely see significant rent increases. (The study did not look at the effect on prices of owner-occupied homes.)Zillow cautions that its estimates are rough, based on a simple model that looks at how rents in each city have responded to past influxes of workers. If the cities respond differently to Amazon\u2019s arrival \u2014 for example, by building more housing \u2014 the impact on rents could be smaller than Zillow\u2019s model estimates. But there are also reasons to think Zillow\u2019s analysis could understate Amazon\u2019s potential impact. The model looks only at the effect of the jobs that the new campus is expected to create directly. If Amazon\u2019s presence draws other businesses to the area, rents could rise even faster.That\u2019s what has happened in Seattle, where a mini-Silicon Valley has sprung up around Amazon\u2019s downtown campus. Facebook, Google and other internet giants have opened satellite offices nearby, and start-ups \u2014 including Zillow itself \u2014 have their headquarters there. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important is once a city is selected that they start to get ahead of the curve,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said.In Nashville, the debate over HQ2 has gotten caught up in a broader discussion of gentrification, race and the consequences of growth. Residents long described Nashville as a small town disguised as a big city. But over the last decade, the city\u2019s tourism industry has taken off, and some of those tourists liked Nashville enough to stay. For years, the Nashville metropolitan area grew by more than 100 residents per day, with many of them moving into newly built downtown apartment complexes.\u201cIf we\u2019re only addressing housing, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting to the root of the issue,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cWage growth is critical in this conversation.\u201d\u201cWe welcome technology, we welcome great jobs to the city, and I think people would even welcome Amazon, but it would have to be a trade-off there,\u201d Mr. Bedne said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to sign a suicide pact.\u201dAmazon, Ms. Schuetz added, should also take housing costs, traffic congestion and related issues into account. After all, she said, Amazon won\u2019t benefit if its workers can\u2019t find places to live, or if they are viewed by existing residents as a hostile force.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long-term relationship,\u201d Ms. Schuetz said. \u201cTo retain good workers over the long haul, you should care about what housing costs could be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 10-Year Baby Window That Is the Key to the Women\u2019s Pay Gap", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen who have their first child before 25 or after 35 eventually close the salary divide with their husbands. It\u2019s the years in between that are most problematic, research shows. Immediately after the first birth, the pay gap between spouses doubles, according to a recent study \u2014 entirely driven by a drop in the mother\u2019s pay. Men\u2019s wages keep rising. The same pattern shows up in a variety of research. The years between 25 to 35 happen to be both the prime career-building years and the years when most women have children. Women who have babies late typically have different career paths from those who have them early. Those who first give birth in their late 30s tend to be more educated with higher-earning jobs, while those who have babies in their early 20s have less education and lower earnings. Low earners have a smaller pay gap in general, and people who have babies in their late 30s could have a smaller pay gap because they are less likely to have more than one child. But the fact that both groups of women recover their earnings, relative to their husbands, suggests there\u2019s also something about having children outside the prime career-building years that hurts women\u2019s pay less, no matter the occupation. \u201cThis shows that the birth of a child is really when the gender earnings gap really grows,\u201d said Danielle H. Sandler, a senior economist at the Census Bureau and an author of the paper. The pay gap grows larger with each additional child. It does not begin to shrink until children are around 10. For most women, their pay never reaches that of their husbands. \u201cIt seems like there could be a middle ground,\u201d Ms. Sandler said, \u201cwhere you\u2019re given enough leave where you don\u2019t have to quit your employment, but not so much time that you have the incentive to be out of the labor force for a long time.\u201d Research has shown other policies that would help: programs to help women re-enter the labor force; flexibility in when and where work gets done; subsidized child care. It also helps if men take time off after children are born and spend more time on child care, studies show. The spousal pay gap was largest for those who had children in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the gap appeared to shrink. Mothers who had their first child then were still paid less than their husbands, but the gap started declining when the children were around 5, and recovered by the time they were 14. Yet in the 2000s, the pattern reversed. The spousal pay gap is still large when children enter high school, and women do not seem on track to recover their earnings relative to their husbands. It\u2019s unclear why. The pay gap is smaller for workers with lower earnings and less education. But the paper found that by the time children were 12, the less educated women had a gap similar to more educated ones, maybe because low-income women are more likely to stop working after having children. High-earning women, by contrast, have a bigger pay gap earlier in their children\u2019s lives because they have more income to lose. The group of women who had the biggest post-baby pay gap compared with their husbands was, paradoxically, women who earned more than their husbands before having children. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018How Long Can We Last?\u2019 Trump\u2019s Tariffs Hit Home in the U.S.", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "Economic SceneA Pennsylvania manufacturer that relies on Chinese steel pipe has few alternative sources \u2014 and now its Chinese rival may gain an advantage.Supported byCP Industries just got an expensive lesson in the unintended consequences of protectionism.Based in McKeesport, Pa., the company makes seamless vessels to store gases at high pressure \u2014 steel cylinders of up to six tons that it sells to the likes of the Navy, NASA and T. Boone Pickens\u2019s Clean Energy. It has received the first bill from the 25 percent tariff that President Trump placed on steel from China and a few other countries: $178,703.09 assessed on a steel-pipe shipment scheduled to arrive at the Port of Philadelphia on Thursday.That\u2019s equivalent to about two weeks\u2019 payroll. Over all, tariffs on steel pipe that the company has ordered from China \u2014 some already on its way across the Pacific \u2014 will add more than half a million dollars to raw-material costs over six months alone.\u201cHow long can we last?\u201d mused Michael Larsen, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We could go down relatively fast.\u201dThe tariff will add about 10 percent to the cost of CP Industries\u2019 cylinders, which can sell for up to $35,000. And foreign rivals are already swooping in to lure away some of the company\u2019s biggest clients. \u201cWe haven\u2019t lost a big one yet, but the discussion over who is going to pay for the tariffs has started,\u201d Mr. Larsen told me.What most sticks in the executive\u2019s craw is that he will probably end up losing business to the company\u2019s main rival in China, Enric Gas Equipment Company of Shijiazhuang, which also makes jumbo vessels. Noting that Enric\u2019s goods are imported under a classification not subject to the tariff, a CP Industries news release added, \u201cIt is impossible for CPI to compete with its Chinese competitor on this basis.\u201dThis is what economists mean when they warn about the costs of protectionist policies. A tariff to protect one industry amounts to a tax on all of its customers. The steel tariffs tax the nation\u2019s more high-tech manufacturing \u2014 carmakers, aerospace companies, makers of vessels to store hydrogen for use in fuel cells \u2014 to pay for a ring of protection around an aging industry that makes a raw material.In 1969, President Richard M. Nixon imposed \u201cvoluntary restraint\u201d agreements on exporters from Japan and Europe. About a decade later the Carter administration established a system that allowed some steel imports as long as they were sold above a certain price.President Ronald Reagan established a limited pool of imports that it apportioned among foreign producers. The first President George Bush renewed it. Mr. Clinton deployed diplomacy and antidumping measures to protect American steel makers. And in 2002 President George W. Bush put a new ring of \u201csafeguards\u201d around steel that lasted 20 months, until the World Trade Organization ruled them illegal.Almost 500 steel consumers responded to at least some of the questions asked by the commission. About half of respondents reported paying higher prices. And roughly half reported problems procuring steel of the quality and quantity they needed. Over a third reported delayed deliveries; 132 reported steel shortages. About one in six said these problems had reduced sales, and one in three said they had cut into its profitability. A total of 82 companies \u2014 including 11 makers of auto parts, nine welded-pipe producers and five makers of fasteners \u2014 said they had lost sales to foreign competitors because of the higher cost of steel.President Trump\u2019s tariffs against steel and aluminum imports, designed to protect blue-collar workers, could instead undermine their livelihood.Some steel consumers shifted from importing steel to importing assembled steel parts that were not subject to the new tariffs. York International \u2014 which makes air-conditioning systems, furnaces and the like \u2014 reported importing steel assemblies and complete products from overseas. The auto-part maker Metaldyne simply moved some of its operations to South Korea, where it could obtain cheaper steel.Mr. Larsen is sympathetic to the plight of American steel companies. Though it is owned today by Everest Kanto Cylinder based in Mumbai, India, CP Industries emerged as an independent company in a 1989 spinoff from U.S. Steel. And still, whatever old loyalties persist, it makes little sense to force the company to obtain its steel domestically. For starters, no company in the United States produces pipes big enough to make its trademark six-ton containers.The company estimated that it could get only a fifth of the steel pipe it needed domestically, from only one American firm. Domestic pipe is, moreover, delivered in random lengths and requires additional milling, cutting and testing, raising processing costs by about 16 percent. And Chinese pipes are much cheaper, the company added: Pipes from China delivered in Philadelphia cost $1,680 per metric ton, while U.S. Steel is charging $2,728 per metric ton at its works in Lorain, Ohio. A 25 percent tariff will not close the gap.CP Industries isn\u2019t simply going to let itself be pushed out of business. An option to consider is importing German steel \u2014 which so far has been exempted from the protectionist fusillade. But it will take time to shift suppliers. And German steel will be more expensive.Of course, there is lobbying. CP Industries has requested a waiver from the tariffs, and it is working to get Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional delegation on its side. Something else it could do is move part or all of the manufacturing process overseas to avoid the steel tariffs.\u201cWe have a whole list of ideas that we could execute,\u201d Mr. Larsen told me. \u201cBut nothing we do will be more efficient than what we are doing now. And it will mean less value added in the United States.\u201dHe would love to try that approach against his new Chinese competitors. But Mr. Trump nipped the strategy in the bud: Dumping \u2014 selling below cost in order to drive rivals out of business and gain market share \u2014 is not necessary when you are suddenly granted a 10 percent cost advantage. That\u2019s roughly the kind of edge that the steel tariffs gave the makers of high-pressure gas vessels in China.\u201cAs it stands today,\u201d Mr. Larsen lamented, \u201cthey cannot be overcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "7 Takeaways From the Airstrikes on Syria", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe strikes were the latest development in a long-running and complex conflict with consequences far beyond Syria itself \u2014 including in the United States, Iran, Russia and other parts of Europe.Here are seven takeaways from the airstrikes and their aftermath:The United States and its allies tried to walk a fine line with the airstrikes, sending a strong message to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria without provoking a military response from Russia and Iran, Mr. Assad\u2019s two strongest allies.American officials called the sites \u201cfundamental components\u201d of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program.\u201cRight now this is a one-time shot, and I believe it has sent a very strong message to dissuade him, to deter him from doing it again,\u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said of Mr. Assad, although Mr. Trump suggested there might be more to come. \u201cWe are prepared to sustain this response,\u201d he said, until Syria abandons its use of chemical weapons.The United States and its allies went ahead with the airstrikes in the face of several developments that suggested they could be delayed.At a news conference on Saturday morning, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain said that the strikes had been \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d in part for the \u201coperational security\u201d of those carrying them out.The airstrikes sent an unambiguous message to Mr. Assad, and it was not clear that it would change his thinking. He remained firmly in power thanks to the support of Russia and Iran.The events depicted could not be independently verified.\u201cThe Butcher of Damascus learned two lessons tonight the hard way,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said in a statement. \u201cWeapons of mass destruction won\u2019t create a military advantage once the United States is done with you and Russia cannot protect its clients from the United States.\u201dSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, complained that Mr. Trump had not sought permission from Congress. Proceeding with the strikes, he said, was \u201cillegal and \u2014 absent a broader strategy \u2014 it\u2019s reckless.\u201dRussia called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council and offered some harsh warnings before the attack. (At the meeting, the Security Council later rejected a Russian resolution condemning the missile strikes.) But the speed and the tone of the Russian reaction on Saturday, stressing that the attack had not resulted in a direct confrontation and was rather limited, suggested almost relief on the part of the Kremlin.According to Russian state news media, President Vladimir V. Putin condemned the missile strikes as an \u201cact of aggression against a sovereign state\u201d and against the United Nations Charter.Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of staff for the armed forces, had warned that Russia would \u201ctake retaliatory measures,\u201d but he included an important caveat: Russia would attack missiles and the platforms from which they were launched only in the event that Russian military personnel were placed in danger.The Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Parliament, stated that it would discuss the airstrikes \u201cnext week.\u201dMrs. May has said she believed there was a need to send a strong message about the use of chemical weapons, but she also had compelling diplomatic and political reasons to support the United States \u2014 and to carry out the strikes as soon as possible.One imperative was the desire to reciprocate the support London has received from the United States in the dispute with Russia over the poisoning of a former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia S. Skripal, on British soil.Mrs. May, who made an explicit connection between the airstrikes in Syria and the poisoning of the Skripals, benefited from the timing of the airstrikes, two days before lawmakers were to return from vacation. While not obligated to consult Parliament, she may have felt constrained to do so and could easily have lost a vote on a strike, as her predecessor David Cameron did in 2013.Britain also wants to prove its use as an ally to Mr. Trump at a time when its international influence is under question because of its withdrawal from the European Union, and when it hopes to strengthen trade ties with the United States.President Emmanuel Macron had prepared his nation for this moment: He had discussed the possibility of airstrikes and made clear early in his presidency that the use of chemical weapons was a red line.While pressing for a military response to the use of chemical weapons, Mr. Macron has also said he wants to work on a peace deal for the region, creating a dual-pronged strategy that has support in France. Mr. Macron has cultivated a closer relationship with Mr. Trump than other Western leaders, but he has also reached out to Mr. Putin.He will visit both presidents in the coming weeks: Mr. Trump at the end of April and Mr. Putin in May.Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London, Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow and Alissa J.

{"Headline": "With Eurozone Economy Wavering, E.C.B. Leaves Policy Unchanged", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The eurozone economy has been a puzzle lately. Some indicators are pointing up, some down and some sideways. It\u2019s hard to know whether growth is losing momentum or just pausing for breath.Even the eurozone\u2019s most influential economist, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, expressed uncertainty on Thursday about what had been going on \u2014 whether recent economic data pointed to \u201cthe beginning of a decline or simply a normalization following a period of very strong growth.\u201dThe central bank\u2019s Governing Council didn\u2019t even discuss monetary policy during a meeting earlier in the day, Mr. Draghi said, preferring not to tamper with the status quo until there was more information. \u201c\u2018A steady hand\u2019 were words used\u201d in the council\u2019s discussion, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference.If he had sounded worried that growth was sputtering, that could have meant that the bank would take longer than expected to wean the eurozone off monetary stimulus. But his expression of concern on Thursday was not strong enough to prompt analysts to recalculate their estimates of when the Governing Council, the bank\u2019s policy-setting committee, will end its de facto money-printing program.However, the euro fell against the dollar after Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks, a sign that they may have made traders more pessimistic about the outlook for the eurozone.The central bank has promised to continue the stimulus at least until September, and most analysts expect it to begin winding down the program soon after that. Many analysts now expect the central bank to provide a clearer picture of its intentions at its next meeting, in June.Among professional economists, there is no consensus about what is going on in the 19-nation eurozone. Every day seems to bring a new indicator that conflicts with one the day before.Amid so much uncertainty, Mr. Draghi\u2019s view of growth is critical. He has a large staff of experts and access to data not available to private sector economists, not to mention a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.And unlike the view of your average economist, Mr. Draghi\u2019s is partly self-fulfilling. If he displays confidence, banks will be more eager to lend, businesses may be more willing to invest in expansion and to hire more people and, lo, it will be so.For financial markets, the key question in the weeks to come is whether recent economic data will alter the European Central Bank\u2019s schedule for ending the measures it used to keep the eurozone together during an existential debt crisis. Chiefly, the bank bought hundreds of billions of euros in government and corporate bonds as a way of pumping money into the economy.September is expected to be the last month of the purchases, though the bank will continue to reinvest money it gets back when bonds mature. The aim is to gently bring monetary policy back to normal. Sometime late next year, or maybe not even until 2020, the European Central Bank will then probably begin raising its benchmark interest rates, currently at a historic low of zero, for the first time since 2011.Any indication by the Governing Council that it is revising its timetable would be big news. But the council takes the long view and has shown in recent months that it won\u2019t be thrown off course by a few unsettling economic indicators.One thing is virtually certain: The bank is not likely to signal any acceleration of its schedule for ending the stimulus.\u201cIt would take a bold central bank to tighten monetary conditions when the economy is contracting, or even just slowing,\u201d Carl Weinberg, chief international economist for High Frequency Economics in New York, said in a note to clients.Advertisement"}

If he were content with just feeding his people three meals a day, he would not give up his nuclear weapons.\u201dCheong Seong-chang, a senior North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute, a research think tank in South Korea, said Mr. Kim\u2019s announcement would further raise \u201chis people\u2019s expectation for economic improvement.\u201dBut North Korea has long said that its nuclear weapons are not bargaining chips, and Mr. Kim himself has called them \u201ca treasured sword of justice\u201d and \u201ca powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding\u201d his people\u2019s \u201crights to existence.\u201dLee Sung-yoon, a Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, called Mr. Kim\u2019s decision just a replay of an old North Korean tactic \u2014 trying to confuse enemies with dramatic gestures in an attempt to win concessions, without ever intending to give up nuclear weapons.\u201cHistory repeats itself as farce,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cKim Jong-un\u2019s ploys are unoriginal and rather lazy.\u201dAmerican officials say they have been repeatedly cheated by the North in previous talks on denuclearization. A deal in 1994 eventually collapsed when the United States accused the North of secretly enriching uranium. Another deal in 2005 fell apart in a dispute over how to verify a nuclear freeze. In 2012, the North launched a long-range rocket after agreeing to a moratorium on missile testing.Mr. Kim\u2019s decision to make the economy the nation\u2019s priority and suspend nuclear tests was unanimously adopted at a Workers\u2019 Party meeting on Friday. He also pledged to neither use nor proliferate nuclear weapons unless faced with a nuclear threat.Washington, Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo welcomed the move, although they cautioned that the suspension of tests was just one step toward denuclearization. The announcement made no mention of further steps.Mr. Kim did pledge to create an \u201cinternational environment favorable for the socialist economic construction.\u201d Analysts said that will give him political cover for negotiating reductions in his arsenal.\u201cThis reads more like an arms-control offer from a nuclear nation than an isolated regime coerced into disarmament,\u201d said Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. \u201cIt is a carefully circumscribed statement. It describes a partial cap of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs but not disarmament. Even under these restrictions, North Korea could continue to expand its capabilities significantly.\u201dBut Mr. Mount said that a suspension of testing is important because \u201cby most technical or military standards, North Korea has not completed an advanced nuclear arsenal.\u201d\u201cIt would be a significant accomplishment to halt their progress while we negotiate steps to roll back these programs,\u201d he added.In recent weeks, some officials and analysts in South Korea have argued that a much more fundamental shift might be underway in North Korea.He also has announced plans to open special economic zones in his country, where he hopes to attract foreign investors, a dream that can be realized only if international sanctions against North Korea are eased.Mr. Kim\u2019s father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, ruled North Korea with the songun, or \u201cmilitary first,\u201d policy, which focused resources on the military, favoring top generals with lucrative rights to export minerals and seafood. The military stood behind him as he led the country through a famine in the 1990s that killed more than two million people.In 2012, in his first public speech as North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un said he would not let his people \u201ctighten their belt again,\u201d a startling admission of failure by a member of a ruling family that is seen as godlike and faultless.If Mr. Kim is serious about economic growth, though, he will need the world\u2019s help, analysts say. They point to the example set in the 1980s by China\u2019s paramount leader at the time, Deng Xiaoping, whose opening to the West was critical to his country\u2019s boom.\u201cWhether Kim Jong-un will become the Deng Xiaoping of North Korea will depend on whether the international community, including the United States and South Korea, can provide security guarantees and opportunities for economic development so that it will denuclearize,\u201d Mr. Cheong said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Just Had Its First Fashion Week", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "Female-only audiences, no social media \u2014 but as one observer said, \u201cWomen here have been waiting for years for a time to shine.\u201dSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Fashion week in New York, Paris and Milan can often be a surreal experience, full of towering fantasy, inflated egos and sky-high stilettos. But last week, on the eve of the inaugural Arab Fashion Week Riyadh, the backdrop was very different: Sandstorms and thunderstorms loomed, and missiles fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen sailed overhead. The first official fashion week ever held in Saudi Arabia was, said Marriam Mossalli, a luxury consultant in Jeddah, \u201can amazing opportunity to shift the disconnect in the minds of outsiders about Saudi women, how they design and how they dress. Women here have been waiting for years for a time to shine.\u201d Yet it almost didn\u2019t happen, though perhaps not for the reasons you would assume. Three weeks later it was back on, with 16 shows scheduled, the high-profile guest designers Jean Paul Gaultier and Roberto Cavalli and attendees flown in from around the world. But on Wednesday evening, 45 minutes before the first model was due on the runway on opening night, the phone screens of dozens of fashionable women dressed in abayas milling in the palatial lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel began to flash bright. To their dismay, fashion week was now being delayed again by an additional 24 hours, according to a statement from the organizers on WhatsApp. The reason? The show tent, in the vast grounds of the luxury hotel, was apparently unfinished and unsafe for use, because of bad weather.\u201cI feel frustrated because this suggests that we are incompetent and unorganized, and we absolutely are not,\u201d Ms. Mossalli said, as she sipped a hot chocolate in the lobby and waited for an Uber to the airport. She said that disorganization as well as the bad weather cited by the Arab Fashion Council had led the Saudi government\u2019s General Entertainment Authority to take over production of the event, including the construction of the tent. Ticket sales to women in Riyadh had been low, perhaps because there had been little local marketing. Some brands had pulled out of the event thanks to the lack of communication, and this may have affected sales as well.\u201cThe organizers need to align their many story lines and just tell the truth,\u201d Ms. Mossalli said. \u201cIt totally sends out the wrong message at an important time for us, and that is disappointing given all the design talent we have amassed here this week.\u201d The high-profile, high-stakes plan for a first fashion week in Saudi Arabia, unthinkable even two years ago, comes at a time of ambitious plans for economic and social reform in the country, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler. Taking inspiration from the successes (and failures) of smaller Gulf neighbors like Dubai, Saudi Arabia is trying to shift away from a reliance on oil and gas revenues and is repositioning itself as a dynamic place for business, hospitality and leisure \u2014 and foreign investment and visitors. However, women here must still abide by so-called guardianship laws, which give male relatives the power to make many decisions integral to their daily lives.The country\u2019s fledgling fashion industry has also found its way into the spotlight. Although there have been designers in Saudi Arabia for years (and fashion shows \u2014 behind closed doors in palatial private residences), most brands have struggled with finding materials, studio staff and production facilities to scale their businesses, eventually opting to show their wares abroad. The social shifts can also be seen on the increasing number of women in Saudi cities who have been eschewing the traditional black abaya in favor of more colorful or patterned cloak designs (especially in the more liberal port town of Jeddah). Flashes of a gradual wardrobe change were being quietly modeled by guests at fashion week via exquisite florid embroidered sleeves or sequins that cascaded down the backs of flowing cloaks. They were accessorized with Gucci sneakers or Christian Louboutin stilettos, quilted Chanel handbags and diamond earring studs the size of Gobstoppers.Arwa Al-Banawi, a Saudi designer in Dubai who showed a polished contemporary collection of tailored staples infused with Bedouin references at the delayed opening night on Thursday, said she believed a Saudi fashion week could be another step on the road to female empowerment in her country.\u201cIt is so important for us that we have our own fashion week \u2014 historically I have always shown in Dubai or Paris but as a Saudi woman I really wanted to be a part of this moment,\u201d she said. \u201cYes it has been the most challenging event I have ever been a part of, but the only way to look is forwards not backward. Next time will be better.\u201dMashael AlRajhi, a Riyadh-based designer of men\u2019s and women\u2019s wear, agreed. She showed her street wear pieces with arabesque roots, including a collaboration with Nike on its first runway hijab, on Friday night. \u201cThere is so much creative talent flourishing here now. The next priority has to be building a better local infrastructure so that the Saudi fashion industry can grow, and most designers don\u2019t have to leave to scale themselves anymore\u201d she said, adding that while she was proud to run a studio and manufacture clothes in Riyadh, it was far from easy. \u201cA fashion week is a platform that gets the attention of the industry and those who can help us prepare for what comes next.\u201dOnce the shows actually happened, the determination, thoughtfulness and ambition of the many young brands in Riyadh last week were clear, despite the many challenges.A vast tent for 1,500 people had been erected, with a glossy catwalk backed by a floor-to-ceiling video screen advertising concerts and BMW cars (with beautiful Saudi models in abayas seated behind the wheel). There were John Legend and Ed Sheeran tracks being played live on the traditional Arab oud. Male designers weren\u2019t allowed backstage ahead of their shows. There was a strict social media ban, which meant an absence of front-row influencers, male editors and walkers, and overeager photographers, though a few official female photographers were granted access. (As Jacob Abrian, the chief executive of the Arab Fashion Council had mused at a media cocktail party on the eve of the event, it would be the first fashion week he had organized that he would not be allowed to see in person.)This gave the all-female audience the chance to take off their abayas, though few did. Instead, glimpses of embellished dresses and sleek designer trouser suits could often be seen peeking through. And on the runway: sorbet-hued frothy gowns of Lebanese couturiers like Tony Ward and Naja Saade; avant-garde all-black designs of Kazakhstan\u2019s Bibisara; a capsule collection of sequined abayas by Maison Alexandrine of Brazil; and over-the-top glamour courtesy of Mr. Gaultier.\u201cWe either wear our abaya or Western styles of our choice under that \u2014 there is still no in-between here like there is in other Islamic countries,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the changes continue here, however, modest fashion will be a huge growth market.\u201d Mr. Abrian, of the Arab Fashion Council, not surprisingly, agreed. \u201cThe stress is gone from all the past weeks,\u201d he said, when it was clear the shows would finally begin. \u201cI just feel relaxed and have started preparing for October. I might go and watch some TV.\u201d He was proud of the international brands that had come to Saudi Arabia, he said, and that they could see the opportunities emerging here.\u201cInshallah it will just all go smoothly now, this has been my baby after all,\u201d he said, sipping nervously from his coffee cup. \u201cThere have been some major hiccups, but the partners, government and designers are committed. They will take the rough with the smooth. This is a window into the future of Saudi Arabia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Doctors Choose Between Saving Lives and Saving a Fortune?", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MedicineTo understand something about the spiraling cost of health care in the United States, we might begin with a typical conundrum: Imagine a 60-something man \u2014 a nonsmoker, overweight, with diabetes \u2014 who has just survived a heart attack. Perhaps he had an angioplasty, with the placement of a stent, to open his arteries. The doctor\u2019s job is to keep the vessels open. She has two choices of medicines to reduce the risk for a second heart attack. There\u2019s Plavix, a tried-and-tested blood thinner, that prevents clot formation; the generic version of the drug costs as little as 25 cents a pill. And there\u2019s Brilinta, a newer medicine that is also effective in clot prevention; it costs about $6.50 a pill \u2014 25 times as much.\u201cWe thought about this nearly every day when discharging patients from the cardiology unit,\u201d Dhruv Khullar, a newly minted hospital attending, told me. \u201cSome of us believed that a doctor\u2019s job is to deliver the best possible care, period. Others argued that doctors should aim to find some balance between medical benefit, financial cost and social responsibility. It\u2019s the kind of question that we aren\u2019t really trained to solve. Are costs something that an individual doctor should do something about? What is a doctor supposed to do?\u201dThe study\u2019s authors also analyzed the costs of labor, salaries and administration. American doctors and nurses were paid substantially more than their European, Canadian or Japanese counterparts. But as Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and bioethicist, noted in an accompanying editorial in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Americans also have fewer doctors per capita than many other countries, and so these salaries, weighted on a \u201cper patient\u201d basis, are only minimally higher than those in most countries. The administrative burdens were, however, disproportional and unique to American care. In one 2009 survey, the costs associated with doctors and nurses \u201cinteracting\u201d with health-insurance plans \u2014 a euphemism for those deadly hours spent filling out forms, recording prior authorizations and negotiating with insurers \u2014 amounted to more than $23 billion a year.The three major factors identified by the researchers \u2014 administrative waste, pharmaceutical price and procedural cost \u2014 may provoke familiar-sounding solutions to the costs of health care. Decrease waste by removing unnecessary and burdensome paperwork. Drive down pharmaceutical prices \u2014 through negotiation on costs, for instance, or by enabling the introduction of generic alternatives for patent-expired medicines. And limit the use of high-cost, low-value procedures where possible.But what of the Khullar conundrum? What can an individual doctor do to fix health care costs? At first glance, the prescriptions prompted by the study\u2019s authors seem dispiriting: The solutions are abstract and political, and they lie outside the realm of medical practice. Yet if you look more closely, this essential quandary of medicine may require a medical solution. Among the problems of American health care is a startling dissociation between \u201ccost\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d: We pay more, but we often don\u2019t get more. How might anyone restore the cost-value balance? In part, of course, through legislative and administrative reform, via political and public pressure. But in part, also, by deploying powerful tools that are newly at our disposal \u2014 genetics, epidemiology, computational analysis, biochemistry.These strategies, if successful, will focus treatments on those most likely to benefit, reducing expenditures and complications. The big hope, yet unfulfilled, is that such treatment will ultimately increase value and decrease overall cost (in recent times, the focusing of medicines on subsegments of patients has resulted only in more expensive drugs). It\u2019s the sort of medicine that might treat medicine\u2019s cost crisis. It\u2019s the kind of problem that a young doctor might learn to love.Siddhartha Mukherjee is the author of \u201cThe Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer\u201d and, more recently, \u201cThe Gene: An Intimate History.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And it is a measure of the fraught relationship between China and India right now that he is seen as needing Mr. Xi\u2019s help to do that.Officials from both countries are describing the leaders\u2019 meeting, which came at India\u2019s request, as a chance to \u201creset\u201d relations. But it is clear that Mr. Modi will be seeking assurances from Mr. Xi.\u201cEverything for Modi right now is about 2019,\u201d said Manoj Joshi, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a policy and research organization in New Delhi. \u201cHe needs stability. He doesn\u2019t want anything to make him look like he\u2019s not the 56-inch-chest guy.\u201dChina\u2019s military power dwarfs India\u2019s, and very quickly, Mr. Modi, who is seen here in India as something of a strongman, was faced with a challenge he could not easily contain.Political analysts and even Indian officials themselves describe India and China\u2019s complex relationship as \u201cfrenemies.\u201dThis could be true for any number of countries but for India and China, their relationship seems especially slippery.They fought a short but intense war in the 1960s, supported insurgencies in each other\u2019s backyards, clashed over very different ideologies, and sparred over trade deficits.Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi are to meet in Wuhan for two days. Both sides have characterized this as a purely friendly get-together, with no big agreement to sign and no set agenda other than to improve the relationship.But analysts still expect Mr. Modi to tackle tough topics like India\u2019s growing trade deficit, pushing China to make it easier for Indian companies to export to China. That would play well here in India, where Mr. Modi has promised to sustain a wave of job growth.Still, analysts say Mr. Modi needs Mr. Xi more than Mr. Xi needs Mr. Modi.But that may not necessarily happen, Mr. Chellaney said, because the United States itself has not stood up forcefully to China, which makes India cautious about being too closely identified as joining the anti-China camp.\u201cWill the U.S. really help us if China were to launch a strategic attack?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a question a lot of Asian countries are now asking.\u201dIndia\u2019s style of government \u2014 highly decentralized, with nearly two dozen officially recognized languages and a noisy democracy \u2014 is anathema to China\u2019s iron-fisted central control. In the battle for influence across the South Asia region, Mr. Modi tries to use this, emphasizing India\u2019s tradition of tolerance and diversity.But it does not always work, partly because of money. China has so much more, and it is pouring huge amounts into Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Maldives \u2014 all South Asian countries traditionally dependent on India that are now feeling China\u2019s pull.In 1980, India\u2019s and China\u2019s economies were about the same size. But in the decades since, while China has rapidly industrialized, India has struggled more. China\u2019s economy is now about five times larger than India\u2019s.Indian analysts say this could be a source of cooperation, if India embraces the right attitude. China could export its surplus goods and capacity and India could get the infrastructure and cheap products its people need.\u201cBut their economic relationship is being hampered by their political relationship,\u201d said Mr. Joshi, the Observer Research Foundation fellow.On the other hand, many people in India tend to look at China, and especially its military muscle, with some awe.Subramanian Swamy, a member of Parliament and Mr. Modi\u2019s political party, said that Indians \u201chave one train of thought: that we shouldn\u2019t fight with the Chinese.\u201dSuhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Mexico First\u2019 Campaign Could End Welcome for U.S. Oil Giants", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 As President Trump moves to recast trade and border relations with Mexico, American oil companies are worried that the prospective winner of Mexico\u2019s presidential election will play his own nationalist card.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City with leftist leanings, has a comfortable lead in the polls ahead of the July 1 vote. He has moderated his tone since losing the presidential race six years ago, but he has proposed a sweeping reorientation of the nation\u2019s energy policy with an emphasis on independence from the United States.He has pledged to end oil exports, nearly all of which go to the United States, by 2022, and to instead spend $6 billion on building two refineries that would process crude for domestic consumption. That would sharply reduce American exports of gasoline to Mexico.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and his top energy adviser, Roc\u00edo Nahle, a former legislator who is in line to become energy minister, have called for a freeze on future deepwater drilling auctions and a review of contracts with international oil companies.\u201cWe cannot irresponsibly deliver our oil reserves to the transnational companies,\u201d Ms. Nahle, who was trained as a chemical engineer, wrote on Twitter this month, summing up her message to a gathering of oil workers in the Mexican oil town of Poza Rica. \u201cThis July 1, this town will end the looting of Mexico.\u201dMs. Nahle has said she wants the government to slash the price of electricity and gasoline, and to reduce Mexico\u2019s dependence on natural-gas imports from the United States by investing more in hydroelectric power. Any reduction in sales to the No. 1 foreign customer for gas from the United States would increase a glut that has depressed prices in America over the last four years.Such positions hark back to the 1930s, when Mexico nationalized its oil industry. Under the current government, a constitutional change enacted in 2014 let foreign companies invest in exploration, drilling, pipelines and even gas stations, and to team up on projects with the state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, or Pemex. The move allowed companies like Exxon Mobil to invest billions of dollars to develop vast fields offshore.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s nationalistic policies are resonating in Mexico as the Trump administration vows to curtail Mexican immigration into the United States and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement.The election outlook has caused concern among American oil executives.\u201cMexico is very critical as an energy partner of the United States, so a retreat from current policies would be a tragedy for both countries,\u201d said Scott D. Sheffield, chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas oil and gas producer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt Mexico long term and the United States long term.\u201dMr. Sheffield and other Texas oil executives are particularly worried that Mexico could slow its importing of American gas.In recent years, Mexico has replaced coal and diesel with cleaner American natural gas to produce about 30 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity. The shale-drilling revolution north of the Rio Grande has yielded an abundance of cheap natural gas for American and Mexican consumers, and Mexico announced a five-year plan in 2015 to increase imports.About 20 pipelines carry 4.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day to Mexico, and more are being built or planned.The gas sales to Mexico are an important source of revenue for American oil and pipeline companies, and they relieve a bulge of gas that is bubbling up with oil from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the nation\u2019s most prolific shale field. California is switching from natural gas to renewable energy sources, while a shortage of pipelines and export terminals for liquefied natural gas means that if sales to Mexico dwindle, there will be excess gas with nowhere to go.That gas will have to be flared, or oil drilling and production will need to decrease, a choice between increasing climate-warming carbon-dioxide emissions or decreasing profits.American refineries also face problems. Before the boom in shale oil production, refineries along the Gulf of Mexico were designed to process heavy oil grades from Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. Imports from Canada continue to increase, but they are limited by scarce pipeline capacity. Production in Venezuela is plummeting, and an expected ratcheting up of sanctions by the Trump administration could further hamper imports.That makes Mexico, which accounts for about 8 percent of American crude-oil imports, an even more critical source. American refineries can process lighter grades of oil but much less efficiently, or they can undertake expensive overhauls of their equipment. Either way, profits would slump.Mexico, for its part, has been importing higher-quality transportation fuels from the United States, in an effort to clean up its cities\u2019 air. Last year, Mexico bought more than one million barrels of American petroleum products a day, providing $23 billion in revenue to American energy companies.Ms. Nahle, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s energy adviser, has said Mexico\u2019s own refineries can be retooled to handle a changeover from American gasoline and diesel.Mexican oil officials, expecting at least a slowdown of their policies, are holding offshore auctions as fast as they can to lure investment before President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is barred by law from seeking a second term, leaves office in December. More than 100 development contracts have already been awarded. The nation\u2019s oil production remains in decline, but officials hope they can reverse the trend as international companies begin to produce large amounts of oil in the Gulf of Mexico over the next two years.Independent energy analysts have viewed Mexico\u2019s moves as a model for economic development, and some worry about a reversal. \u201cTo make a U-turn from the current reforms would be detrimental to the Mexican economy,\u201d said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.Some oil executives and energy experts say they are not overly worried that the new contracts will be overturned. They note that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will almost certainly not have the congressional support to entirely rescind the constitutional energy change. Campaign oratory could give way to the realities of governing, especially when the oil industry offers financing for more social services. The government has earned signing bonuses of $525 million from investors so far this year as a result of its efforts.\u201cMexico needs this change more than anybody else,\u201d said Ali Moshiri, who retired last year as Chevron\u2019s top executive in Latin America and is forming his own oil company to seek international opportunities. \u201cPemex has been a disaster, so they have to continue with the reform, though they could slow things down.\u201dIf necessary, international companies could focus less on Mexico and more on other Latin American countries, like Brazil, which also has huge offshore potential, or Colombia, which has significant potential for shale drilling. Both countries also have elections this year in which major candidates have expressed either opposition to giving foreign companies control over natural resources or environmental concerns about developing fossil fuels at all.\u201cThat creates a lot of uncertainties for energy policy,\u201d said Lisa Viscidi, an energy expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank. \u201cAround Latin America, there are serious contenders who want to make big changes in the oil sector and want to reverse previous reforms. L\u00f3pez Obrador particularly represents a lot of direct threats.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s even there, but I don\u2019t care. The people I\u2019m on Facebook with know who I am, and that\u2019s all that counts. If the data miners get it wrong, tough.TERRY SHAMES, BERKELEY, CALIF.To the Editor:We are sidestepping the larger problem of this predictable data breach.Facebook has been using \u2014 and selling \u2014 our data with little or no active consent or even active thought given by most data owners for more than a decade. This basic trade-off, of privacy for convenience, has been fundamental to the operation of social media sites over the last decade.The loss of user data to Cambridge Analytica is obviously an issue. But the bigger issue is the loss of countless hours to Facebook and other social media outlets. Compounding that issue is how screens affect our interactions with others and how social media influences our understanding and awareness of the world around us.Facebook\u2019s data breach without user consent should be a catalyst inspiring examination of our connection to screens and how screen time affects news consumption, time management and intimate relationships.To the Editor:I agree that we need better privacy rules. Here\u2019s a simple solution. Why not pay consumers for the use of their data?Instead of combing through agreements for buried data use protocols and having to \u201copt out\u201d of data sharing, consumers would \u201copt in\u201d to data sharing in exchange for a fee, depending on the extent and the frequency of data use.Much simpler, and more fair.RICHARD KATZ, BROOKLYNAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Reacts to Cohen Raid, Syria and More: An Annotated Transcript", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe following is a transcript of those remarks, as prepared by The New York Times, with analysis from The Times\u2019s Michael D. Shear, a White House correspondent.AnalysisIf there was one sign that Mr. Trump was furious about the raids of Mr. Cohen\u2019s office and hotel, it was this phrase: They \u201cbroke in to the office.\u201d Arms crossed, the president was clearly angry about how his friend and loyal attorney was treated \u2014 and did little to hide it.TRUMP: They continue to just go forward and here we are talking about Syria, we\u2019re talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever, and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now, and actually much more than that. You could say it was right after I won the nomination it started. AnalysisIn a presidency not known for consistency, Mr. Trump has never wavered from his insistence that \u201cthey found no collusion.\u201d In fact, what congressional investigators have always said is they had not yet determined whether the president or his aides had colluded with the Russians. Mr. Mueller has not said publicly one way or the other. AnalysisMr. Trump immediately focused on Mr. Mueller and his team, but in fact, Monday\u2019s raids were authorized by a United States attorney who was appointed by Mr. Sessions and is a former law partner of Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Trump supporter. They were not authorized by Mr. Mueller.TRUMP: They only keep looking at us. So they find no collusion, and then they go from there and they say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s keep going,\u201d and they raid an office of a personal attorney early in the morning and I think it\u2019s a disgrace. AnalysisMr. Trump\u2019s statement that \u201cwe\u2019ll be talking about it more\u201d \u2014 a reference to bias among the special counsel\u2019s team \u2014 is an ominous one, suggesting that he might do something about it. What that would be is unclear, though adversaries and allies alike have at times worried that he might fire Mr. Mueller.TRUMP: All I can say is after looking for a long period of time, not even before the special counsel because it really started just about from the time I won the nomination, and you look at what took place and what happened and it\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s a disgrace. I\u2019ve been president now for what seems like a lengthy period of time. We\u2019ve done a fantastic job. We\u2019ve beaten ISIS. We have just about 100 percent of the caliphate or the land. Our economy is incredible. AnalysisAfter repeatedly hailing stock market increases during his first year in office, Mr. Trump has all but ignored the market\u2019s steep declines in the wake of his protectionist trade policies. So it was ironic that the president would blame what he called \u201cthis nonsense\u201d for a drop in the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average actually ended the day up slightly after at one point rising nearly 400 points.TRUMP: And many, many other things, so I just think it\u2019s a disgrace that a thing like this can happen. With all of that being said, we are here to discuss Syria tonight. We\u2019re the greatest fighting force anywhere in the world. These gentlemen and ladies are incredible people. Incredible talent, and we\u2019re making a decision as to what we do with respect to the horrible attack that was made near Damascus, and it will be met, and it will be met forcefully. And when, I will not say because I don\u2019t like talking about timing, but we are developing the greatest force that we\u2019ve ever had. We had $700 billion just approved, which was the reason I went along with that budget, because we had to fix our military. General Mattis would tell you that above anybody, we had to fix our military and right now we\u2019re in a big process of doing that, $700 million and then $716 billion next year. So we\u2019re going to make a decision tonight or very shortly thereafter and you\u2019ll be hearing the decision. But we can\u2019t let atrocities like we all witnessed, and you can see that and it\u2019s horrible. We can\u2019t let that happen. In our world, we can\u2019t let that happen. Especially when we\u2019re able to, because of the power of the United States, because of the power of our country, we\u2019re able to stop it. AnalysisThe president shifted briefly to Syria, taking note of John R. Bolton\u2019s first day as national security adviser. He hinted that the United States would respond militarily to the chemical attacks in that country, saying that \u201cwe can\u2019t let atrocities like we all witnessed\u201d happen. He did not indicate whether Mr. Bolton \u2014 a noted national security hawk \u2014 had argued for a strike.JOHN R. BOLTON: Thank you. It\u2019s an honor to be here.TRUMP: Thank you all very much. REPORTER: Any concerns about what the F.B.I. might find, Mr. President?TRUMP: No. REPORTER: Do you have any concerns?TRUMP: No, I\u2019m not. REPORTER: Did you have an affair with Stormy Daniels? TRUMP: Why don\u2019t I just fire Mueller? REPORTER: Yeah, just fire the guy.AnalysisAmong Mr. Trump\u2019s verbal tics is the phrase \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d He says it all the time. So when he was asked why he doesn\u2019t just fire Mr. Mueller, it popped out. It is not clear whether that means he is really considering doing that, or if the response was just another instance of this habit.TRUMP: If you know the person who\u2019s in charge of the investigation, you know all about that deputy Rosenstein, Rod Rosenstein, he wrote the letter very critical of Comey. One of the things I said, I fired Comey, well, I turned out to do the right thing because you look at all of the things that he\u2019s done and the lies and you look at what\u2019s gone on at the F.B.I. with the insurance policy and all of the things that happened, turned out I did the right thing. But he signed, as you know, he also signed the FISA warrant. AnalysisThe president appointed Rod J. Rosenstein to be the deputy attorney general. But at Monday\u2019s meeting, he criticized him for signing a FISA warrant, an apparent reference to the fact that Mr. Rosenstein had authorized agents to seek a warrant to wiretap Trump associates in the Russia probe. Mr. Trump and Republican allies have said the warrants were sought under false pretenses.[Cross talk]REPORTER: Can we get more clarity on who was responsible \u2026 [Inaudible] TRUMP: We are getting clarity on that. Who is responsible for the weapons attack. We are getting very good clarity, actually. We have some pretty good answers. REPORTER: What are your options? [Cross talk]TRUMP: We have a lot of options militarily and we\u2019ll be letting you know pretty soon. AIDE: Thank you, everyone. Thank you all. TRUMP: Probably after the fact. AIDE: Thank you.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a former New York mayor and supporter of Mr. Trump. He is Rudolph W.

{"Headline": "Police in France Begin Clearing Airport Protest Camp", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 It was supposed to be the site of the biggest airport in western France, a hub for cargo traffic and Concorde flights.But instead, it became the center of a utopian experiment and an entrenched protest camp, one that challenged the government of President Emmanuel Macron.But in 2009, hundreds of protesters started squatting on the land, complaining of the project\u2019s noise and the threat to wildlife. They set up shelters made of corrugated iron, wood and earthworks.In January, they won an important victory when the airport was shelved by the government because of the divisions surrounding the project.The only problem: The squatters\u2019 camp had to go, too, the government said, and they didn\u2019t want to leave.On Monday, before dawn, the police began to clear the camp, with about 2,500 riot officers storming the area with armored vehicles and tear gas, destroying barricades and razing some of the activists\u2019 holdouts along the way.About 250 protesters fought back with petrol bombs, rocks and other projectiles. According to local officials, 28 police officers and one protester were wounded, although activists in the encampment said other protesters had been hurt and treated on-site.Seven people have been taken into custody so far.The police continued their clearing operation on Tuesday. And on Wednesday, another showdown loomed as security forces began their third day of intervention, while activists called for a peaceful gathering on the site.The move to clear the site is the latest episode in an airport project that stretches back more than 50 years. An oil crisis in the 1970s and the expansion of the country\u2019s high-speed rail network stalled the plan for decades before it was reactivated in 2000.The protesters call the area Z.A.D., the French initials for Zone to Defend \u2014 a play on the official name, Zone for Future DevelopmentInitially, the airport protest centered on complaints about noise and claims that the land was an important habitat for wildlife. Some also argued that the project was a waste of money \u2014 given that the nearby city of Nantes already had a functioning, if small, airport.As the project gained a second life, a group including environmental activists, local farmers and anticapitalists swung into action. They created an alternative society on the site, opening a library, a bakery, a weekly market and dozens of other buildings and services.Volunteer doctors treated activists who fell ill, and collective kitchens were created. Some activists grew medicinal plants, while others bred cattle or raised sheep.The activists set up common rules that they called limits, gathered in local assemblies, and every two weeks summoned 12 people to resolve conflicts.Thousands of supporters of the squatters gathered in Nantes, Paris and other parts of France to protest the violence at the site. Left-wing politicians and environmental activists criticized the police deployment and the use of armored vehicles to destroy the installations. Lawmakers from Mr. Macron\u2019s own parliamentary majority called for a pause in the eviction operation.\u201cLet\u2019s stop!\u201d Fran\u00e7ois-Michel Lambert, a lawmaker and member of Mr. Macron\u2019s party La R\u00e9publique en Marche (the Republic on the Move) said on France Info.\u201cOnly politics, only peace is the good solution, not the clash that ends in the destruction of one, which will never be the victory of the other,\u201d he said, referring to the face-off between the riot police and the squatters.G\u00e9rard Collomb, the French interior minister, said on the TV news channel LCI that the clearing of the area could last until the end of the week.The government has said that the protesters were offered alternative housing, but that nobody could stay unless they filed individual, agricultural projects to the authorities.A local official, Nicole Klein, said on Tuesday that she had not received any project submissions, though some activists said they had started legal procedures to claim some of the land.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018They Eat Money\u2019: How Mandela\u2019s Political Heirs Grow Rich Off Corruption", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVREDE, South Africa \u2014 With loudspeakers blaring, city officials drove across the black township\u2019s dirt roads in a pickup truck, summoning residents to the town hall. The main guest was a local figure who had soared up the ranks of the governing African National Congress and come back with an enticing offer.Over the next few hours, the visiting political boss, Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane, sold them on his latest deal: a government-backed dairy farm that they, as landless black farmers, would control. They would get an ownership stake in the business, just by signing up. They would go to India for training, all expenses paid. To hear him tell it, the dairy would bring jobs to the impoverished, help build a clinic and fix the roads.\u201cHe said he wanted to change our lives,\u201d said Ephraim Dhlamini, who, despite suspicions that the offer was too good to be true, signed up to become a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of the project. \u201cThis thing is coming from the government, free of charge. You can\u2019t say you don\u2019t like this thing. You must take it.\u201dBut, sure enough, his instincts were right.The dairy farm turned out to be a classic South African fraud, prosecutors say: Millions of dollars from state coffers, meant to uplift the poor, vanished in a web of bank accounts controlled by politically connected companies and individuals.The money from an array of state contracts like this one helped pay for a lavish wedding that a top executive at KPMG, the international accounting firm, described as \u201can event of the millennium,\u201d according to leaked emails. And Mr. Zwane, continuing his meteoric rise, soon leaped to the national stage to become South Africa\u2019s minister of mineral resources.Almost nothing trickled down to the township or the scores of would-be beneficiaries after that first meeting in 2012. The only local residents to get a free trip to India were members of a church choir headed by Mr. Zwane.In the generation since apartheid ended in 1994, tens of billions of dollars in public funds \u2014 intended to develop the economy and improve the lives of black South Africans \u2014 have been siphoned off by leaders of the A.N.C., the very organization that had promised them a new, equal and just nation.Corruption has enriched A.N.C. leaders and their business allies \u2014 black and white South Africans, as well as foreigners. But the supposed beneficiaries of many government projects, in whose names the money was spent, have been left with little but seething anger and deepening disillusionment with the state of post-apartheid South Africa.South Africa has a large, advanced economy, an aggressively free press and a wealth of independent organizations and scholars who keep a close watch on government malfeasance. But even with its vibrant democracy, in which the details of corruption schemes are routinely aired and condemned by the news media and opposition politicians, graft has engulfed the country.Beyond that, politicians who long oversaw provinces rife with public corruption, including the one where the dairy farm is, now sit at the top of the A.N.C.\u2019s hierarchy.National prosecutors, often criticized for being servile to the sitting president, say they are trying to recover more than $4 billion lost to corruption related to the Gupta family\u2019s undue influence on Mr. Zuma\u2019s administration.And that is just a small measure of the corruption that has whittled away at virtually every institution in the country, including schools, public housing, the police, the power utility, South African Airways and state enterprises overseeing everything from rail service to the defense industry.Almost no one comes out of this looking good.At just under $21 million, the money lost in the Vrede dairy farm may seem small. But it is a big test of whether South Africa\u2019s new government has the power and the will to confront public corruption at its source.The police have apprehended some low- and midlevel officials involved in the dairy farm, the first arrests related to a high-profile case of public corruption during the Zuma presidency. But notably, they have yet to pursue any A.N.C. officials. Mr. Zwane has not faced any charges. What\u2019s more, the provincial premier who approved the project, Ace Magashule, was recently elected secretary general of the A.N.C., elevating him to the top ranks of the party\u2019s leadership.The endless scandals have also raised serious questions about the complicity of major Western companies, with multiple investigations scrutinizing the role they may have played in enabling corruption and weakening the country\u2019s institutions.South African regulators have urged the police to begin a criminal inquiry into McKinsey, the American consulting giant, over its relationship with a Gupta-linked company in a contract involving a state-owned utility. A South African court has frozen the $83 million McKinsey was paid for the contract, and the firm says it will return the fee.Regulators say they have also pressed the police to investigate KPMG, the Big Four auditing firm based in the Netherlands, for its work for the national revenue service in 2015. KPMG has acknowledged that elements of the work \u201cshould no longer be relied upon\u201d and offered to pay back its consulting fees.SAP, the German software behemoth, is being investigated by the United States Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission after it disclosed payments to intermediaries on state contracts that may have contravened the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.International banks have been ensnared in the scandals, too. HSBC and Standard Chartered have been accused by a British lawmaker of laundering the Guptas\u2019 ill-gotten gains. HSBC says it has closed a number of accounts that belonged to front companies operated by the Gupta family.Many trace the deep corruption in the nation to a fundamental flaw in South Africa\u2019s transition from white rule to democracy a generation ago. In the grand bargain struck between the apartheid government and the A.N.C., headed by Nelson Mandela, a transfer of power was carried out peacefully, disproving predictions of civil war and earning Mr. Mandela accolades as a visionary peacemaker.But the deal was reached on what many South Africans today consider Pyrrhic terms: The black majority was allowed to control politics, but much of the country\u2019s economic resources, including land, has remained in the hands of white South Africans and a small group of other elites.In the early years of A.N.C. rule, Mr. Mandela and other top leaders, who had helped defeat apartheid but had no personal savings, received houses, vehicles and money from white business leaders \u2014 essentially bribes, critics say.A smattering of influential figures, like the current president, Mr. Ramaphosa, amassed extraordinary wealth. They were allowed to buy shares of white-owned companies on extremely generous terms and invited to sit on corporate boards. They acted as conduits between the governing party and the white-dominated business world.Some of the A.N.C. leaders who were left out of that bonanza quickly found a new road to wealth: lucrative government contracts. The public tap became a legitimate source of wealth for the well connected, but also a wellspring of corruption and political patronage, much as it had been for the white minority during apartheid.While Mr. Mandela is still revered in the West, his legacy is regarded more critically in South Africa, especially by some young black people. To them, he sold out the country\u2019s black masses to the white business elite.Even some of Mr. Mandela\u2019s longtime supporters struggle to defend the deal that he struck to bring democracy to South Africa. Ultimately, it left most black people in poverty while benefiting a small elite, including the chief negotiator during the talks, Mr. Ramaphosa.After 27 years as a political prisoner, Mr. Mandela did not understand South Africa\u2019s political economy and agreed to a settlement that failed to secure black South Africans\u2019 economic independence, said Mamphela Ramphele, an anti-apartheid activist who became close to Mr. Mandela. She later went on to serve as a managing director of the World Bank.\u201cHe didn\u2019t know any better,\u201d Ms. Ramphele said.The dairy farm case is emblematic of the many ills afflicting South Africa a quarter-century after the end of apartheid. It shows how corruption, in a government controlled at all levels by a single party, has entrenched old racial inequalities.About 125 miles southeast of Johannesburg, in the province of Free State, Vrede is a small farming town with discount chain stores, two supermarkets and a gas station. A cemetery and a police station \u2014 buffers during the apartheid era \u2014 still separate Vrede from the neighboring black township of Thembalihle.As in so many other townships, the level of local corruption can be quickly gauged by the quality of government housing for the poor. In one of the most common sources of corruption, money and building materials are diverted from a housing project, often leaving behind shoddy dwellings for poor residents who have waited years or decades to move out of shacks.In a new outpost of the township, single-family government houses were so poorly built that many have collapsed, while new houses are being erected on shaky foundations and frames, with deep cracks spreading across extremely thin walls.In many ways, the area is a microcosm of the enduring economic imbalance in South Africa. Nationally, black people make up 80 percent of the population, but most remain shut out of economic opportunities. White people, accounting for 8 percent, retain an oversize influence on the economy.Nearly all of the commercial farmers around Vrede are white, as is the main government contractor. In the adjoining township, black people operate small taverns and basic carwashes. But in the town of Vrede itself, white people still own all of the faded buildings on the main street, where they \u2014 along with immigrants from other African nations and countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh \u2014 operate shops. Black people, who were not allowed to live in the town under apartheid, now own or rent only about 10 percent of its residences.\u201cThis system that was built for us, blacks, it\u2019s very difficult for us to create our own businesses,\u201d said Veli Thulani Tshabalala, 29, who runs a computer and cellphone repair shop with his cousin. They are the only black South Africans to operate a store in Vrede.Pieter Bergh, 83, a white South African who served on Vrede\u2019s City Council in the years immediately before and after the end of apartheid, agreed that little has changed for black South Africans since 1994 and that the economic inequality has remained static.\u201cThey only received the power to vote \u2014 that was all,\u201d Mr. Bergh said, adding that he \u201cdefinitely\u201d considered that a historical mistake.In the late 1990s, officials were purged from city government and replaced by A.N.C. appointees with little experience. The purge, which occurred at all levels of government across the nation, contributed to the corruption that emerged toward the end of Mr. Mandela\u2019s term.Here in Free State, one of the first post-apartheid cases of corruption in government revolved around Mr. Magashule, the A.N.C.\u2019s current secretary general.After white rule ended, he oversaw economic development in the cabinet of the first post-apartheid provincial premier, Mosiuoa Lekota. In an interview, Mr. Lekota said he had caught Mr. Magashule stealing government funds \u2014 a charge that Mr. Magashule, whose spokespeople did not respond to interview requests for this article, has long denied.Mr. Lekota said he had fired Mr. Magashule, but was overruled by his patron, the A.N.C.\u2019s deputy secretary general at the time: Mr. Zuma.In the early days after the end of apartheid, Mr. Zuma openly complained about the A.N.C. leaders who were getting rich. Most \u2014 like Mr. Ramaphosa and Tokyo Sexwale, another anti-apartheid activist \u2014 were favorites of Mr. Mandela.\u201cZuma did go to some of the other guys and said to them, \u2018This is what Mandela is doing. We must wake up and we must go for the money ourselves,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Lekota, who left the A.N.C. to found his own party, the Congress of the People, in 2008.Mr. Magashule went on to flourish inside Free State. He became premier of the province in 2009 just as Mr. Zuma became president.Like other powerful premiers, he was able to turn his province into a fief, said Mr. Lekota and several provincial officials from the A.N.C., as well as its historical ally, the South African Communist Party.Taxes are mostly collected by the national government, and the money is redistributed to the provinces, where it is spent with little oversight. Free State \u2014 a rural economy where black people remain dependent on the A.N.C. for jobs and government contracts \u2014 has remained a stronghold for the party even as it has lost support among middle-class black voters in urban areas.Mr. Magashule\u2019s ambitions, however, were never confined to the province. Like Mr. Zuma, he forged a relationship with the Gupta brothers, who had befriended some high-ranking A.N.C. figures after arriving in South Africa from their native India in the early 1990s. Mr. Magashule\u2019s son, Tshepiso, worked for the Guptas, and, according to emails leaked from a Gupta-company server, served as a conduit to his father\u2019s office.Under Mr. Magashule\u2019s governance, many of the province\u2019s public services departments teetered on the brink of insolvency, according to A.N.C. officials and opposition parties. In a harsh report in 2017, the national auditor said that Free State\u2019s government showed \u201ca lack of accountability and commitment towards clean administration,\u201d adding that the situation had worsened in recent years.\u201cIf you find that the one who is supposed to be the custodian of the purse like the premier \u2014 he is the one who is involved in corrupt practices \u2014 it becomes easy then for others also to get involved,\u201d said Thabo Manyoni, an A.N.C. official in Free State who was once a close friend and deputy of Mr. Magashule.\u201cYou end up in a situation where nobody is able to stop anyone else because we all are doing it,\u201d Mr. Manyoni said.To many, the dairy farm project appeared to be a swindle from the beginning.For starters, there were ample suspicions about the pitchman, Mr. Zwane.\u201cI know this guy,\u201d said Mr. Dhlamini, the would-be beneficiary who was also the chairman of Vrede\u2019s arm of the African Farmers Association, a national organization for black farmers. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him.\u201dAs he climbed the political ranks, Mr. Zwane often came back to Thembalihle, the black township next to Vrede. Sometimes, he doled out fistfuls of cash from the trunk of his latest luxury car, said A.N.C. and opposition politicians, as well as many residents.Throughout the township and town, many people shared the same wariness of Mr. Zwane. His meteoric rise had been too fast and seemed tied to the corruption taking hold in the A.N.C. and in Free State.Mr. Zwane, who declined through a spokesman to comment for this article, grew up on a nearby farm and moved to Thembalihle in his teens. People remember him as an undistinguished student who, after high school, taught the children of black farm laborers in a nearby village where he met his future wife. The couple lived next to the school building, in a low, two-room concrete structure that is still used as a schoolteacher\u2019s residence.There, villagers remember Mr. Zwane as an engaged teacher, at least until he became a district councilor and his interests turned to politics. Soon, Mr. Zwane rose swiftly in the party, as well as in local and district governments, thanks in great part to his close relationship with the province\u2019s head of the A.N.C., Mr. Magashule, according to politicians in Free State. He joined Mr. Magashule\u2019s cabinet in 2009 and a few years later took over the agriculture portfolio.When Mr. Zwane became the provincial minister of agriculture, many black farmers in Vrede rejoiced. Like others in the country, they had neither capital nor land. With a local son heading the province\u2019s department of agriculture, they thought their \u201clives were going to change,\u201d recalled Meshack Ncongwane, the deputy chairman of Vrede\u2019s African Farmers Association.A dozen black farmers from Vrede chartered a bus, each paying about $20, to attend Mr. Zwane\u2019s swearing-in ceremony in the provincial capital, Bloemfontein, about four hours away. Even the association\u2019s chairman, the skeptical Mr. Dhlamini, went along.\u201cWe were happy,\u201d Mr. Ncongwane said, adding, in hindsight, \u201calthough we were happy for a crook.\u201dIn 2012, Mr. Zwane and agricultural department officials arrived in Vrede to promote the dairy farm project. Flanked by the council speaker, Roseline Zwane, known as Topsy \u2014 who happened to be his wife \u2014 and by his longtime ally, Mayor Tlokotsi John Motaung, Mr. Zwane told the crowd about a dairy farm that would empower black farmers and create 150 jobs.Shortly afterward, his department signed the first of its two dairy farm agreements with a company called Estina.This was a peculiar choice. Estina was to buy cows for local farmers and process milk at the farm. But the company was headed by a businessman from India who had a background in information technology \u2014 not in farming. Yet, importantly, he had long worked for the Guptas.Despite the project\u2019s sketchy details, Mr. Zwane signed off on it and asked the provincial treasury to start paying Estina, according to an investigation by the National Treasury. Initially, he was overruled by lawyers in Mr. Magashule\u2019s office, who deemed the contract invalid because procurement rules, like a competitive bid, had not been followed.But that was only a hiccup. The province signed another contract with Estina the following month \u2014 this time with the lawyers\u2019 blessing. That agreement stated that Estina would invest just under $20 million in the project and the province would contribute about $30 million over three years. Local farmers, the so-called beneficiaries, would retain 51 percent of the shares.There was \u201csomething fishy\u201d from the start, said Doctor Radebe, who was a councilor for the opposition Democratic Alliance in Vrede. Mr. Zwane and the agricultural officials presented no business plan or budget for the project, but they and the mayor insisted on pressing ahead, Mr. Radebe said.The local municipality quickly decided to hand over 3,400 hectares, or about 8,400 acres, of land for the dairy farm.In fact, the municipality was so determined to get the project underway that it compensated four white commercial farmers, who had been leasing the land for about $80,000 a year, in order to prematurely break their leases. Later that year, just before Mr. Zwane and his local choir left for India, on a trip sponsored by a Gupta company, the province leased the farm to Estina \u2014 rent-free, for 99 years.In an interview, Mayor Motaung said, \u201cWe had no doubt that the plan will work.\u201dBut the mayor acknowledged that Mr. Zwane presented no detailed plan or document about the proposed dairy farm. Even basic details \u2014 like the criteria for selecting the beneficiaries \u2014 were missing, the mayor said, acknowledging that his role in the project was now under scrutiny.The payments to Estina began months later. Court documents show that the province deposited just under $21 million in two Estina bank accounts over three years. Days after every payment, the company transferred the entire sum to other accounts. From there, prosecutors say, the money was withdrawn by individuals and other Gupta-linked companies that had little to do with the farm.In fact, prosecutors say that only about 1 percent of the money invested by the province actually went into dairy farming. Beyond that, the National Treasury found no evidence that Estina ever invested its own money in the project, despite its obligation to do so.Emails leaked from a Gupta company server indicate that some of the money was sent to the United Arab Emirates and put into accounts registered to the Guptas. The money then made its way back to South Africa through a maze of bank transfers, according to spreadsheets, logs and an invoice in the email trove.The emails, amounting to thousands of exchanges, were leaked last year to South African news organizations and an anti-corruption group. It is not known who leaked them, though they soon fanned national outrage at the Gupta family and at Mr. Zuma. The Guptas denied the authenticity of the emails, but some A.N.C. officials included in the correspondence confirmed that they were real.In one of the emails, Gupta companies paid one another for expenses at a relative\u2019s lavish four-day wedding in 2013, including fireworks, dancers, chocolates and scarves.In another exchange, KPMG, then an auditor of the Gupta companies, ignored a junior employee\u2019s protest and allowed the Gupta family to write off some of the expenses at the wedding as business costs.\u201cI have never been to an event like that,\u201d Moses Kgosana, a KPMG executive who attended the wedding, gushed to a Gupta brother in one of the emails, calling it \u201can event of the millennium.\u201dThe accounting firm has since acknowledged that its actions \u201cfell well short of the quality expected.\u201dMany of the problems surrounding the dairy farm could have been ignored had the province not tried to tap into a national fund for struggling farmers. The national government initially agreed to give about $4 million to the project on the condition that the province submit, among other things, a list of 100 poor farmers who would benefit from the farm.When the government found no evidence that local farmers were involved, it sent National Treasury auditors to investigate in 2013. Though Mr. Zwane, sometimes accompanied by his wife, had held meetings to look for beneficiaries, no official list had been drawn.After the auditors started asking questions, a list of beneficiaries \u2014 between 80 and 100, depending on the version \u2014 was hastily assembled.Some were genuine farmers. \u201cOthers, they are not even farmers,\u201d Mr. Radebe said, adding that many were A.N.C. supporters. \u201cThey don\u2019t even have a cat.\u201dEstina did try its hand at dairy farming in Vrede. When the National Treasury\u2019s investigators visited in 2013, they found about 350 cows and some buildings under construction. But the seemingly inflated costs \u2014 including $215,000 for a manually sliding gate and a guardhouse \u2014 drew scrutiny from the opposition party.And while the beneficiaries were supposedly the farm\u2019s owners, they were never informed of the project\u2019s developments. They were not even allowed to visit the premises.Those who were serious about farming started to complain. At a meeting with officials in the provincial government, Mr. Dhlamini and Mr. Ncongwane, of the African Farmers Association, said that when they raised questions about the project, they were dismissed as noisy \u201cfrogs.\u201dThat especially stung Mr. Dhlamini, who once was the only black South African business owner in Vrede. He ran a small record store called \u201cSiyathuthuka,\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019re moving forward,\u201d in the Zulu language, but was forced to shutter his store because of rising rents. He was now focused full time on farming and owned 35 cows.In early 2014, the National Treasury sent a scathing report to Mr. Magashule, the premier of Free State, and told the province to stop paying Estina. But it took Free State another six months to take the farm back. The province even continued to pay Estina another $11 million after officially terminating the contract, court documents show.In the end, a project meant to empower black farmers like Mr. Dhlamini further enriched the Guptas and one of the wealthiest white men in Vrede, Willie Basson. With a fleet of vehicles, construction equipment and billboards advertising his business all over town, Mr. Basson is the main government contractor in Vrede and helped build the dairy farm.But he said that Estina mismanaged the business so badly that he ended up having to dig graves for as many as 100 cows, even though he had delivered feed for them.\u201cThey just do projects like this to get money,\u201d he said in an interview in his office. \u201cThat\u2019s how they operate, but, luckily, they paid me every cent,\u201d Mr. Basson said.\u201cHey! It\u2019s rotten in this place here,\u201d he exclaimed, pounding on the table in front of him. \u201cAnd we work with all of them, so we know.\u201dIt was a measure of how corrupt South Africa had become a generation after the end of apartheid that nothing was done about the Vrede dairy farm case for years.The national police and prosecutors looked away even after the National Treasury raised alarms about the project.In Free State, some who spoke out against public corruption were suddenly killed in circumstances that, even in a country with widespread violent crime, aroused suspicions.Moses Tshake, a provincial government auditor who inquired about projects in the agriculture department, was killed in a carjacking in 2013. In Warden, a town where Mr. Zwane has a large home, Vusi Mlaba, a politician who had campaigned against corruption in public housing, was fatally shot a dozen times just outside his home in 2016. Police investigations resulted in no arrests in either case.As for Mr. Zwane, the dairy farm hardly hurt his career.During Mr. Zuma\u2019s presidency, the Gupta brothers increasingly acquired economic and political influence by forging close ties with the president, his son and political allies like Mr. Magashule, the provincial premier who endorsed the dairy farm project. A lawyer for Atul Gupta, from whom prosecutors tried to recover public money spent on the dairy farm, did not respond to a request for an interview with his client.The Guptas\u2019 influence, and possibly direct role, in the appointment of ministers and other important government officials has been investigated by the Public Protector and is expected to be a focus of a recently begun government inquiry into public corruption.In August 2015, according to the leaked emails, Tony Gupta, the youngest of the three brothers, forwarded Mr. Zwane\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to Duduzane Zuma, one of the president\u2019s sons, who was a director of many companies operated by the Guptas. Two months later, Mr. Zwane, whose highest qualification is a teacher\u2019s diploma, became South Africa\u2019s new minister of mineral resources, one of the most important \u2014 and potentially lucrative \u2014 portfolios.Shortly after his appointment, Mr. Zwane went to Zurich with Tony Gupta and met with an executive from Glencore, the giant international commodities and mining firm. At the time, the Guptas were trying to buy a Glencore coal mine. In a 2016 report on corruption, the Public Protector called Mr. Zwane\u2019s lobbying in Switzerland \u201cpotentially unlawful.\u201dLast December, A.N.C. delegates from all over the country chose Mr. Magashule, Free State\u2019s longtime premier, as the party\u2019s secretary general \u2014 one of the top four positions in the party. Mr. Magashule had been one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s fiercest backers, along with two other provincial premiers who became known in the South African news media as the \u201cpremier league.\u201d They had endorsed Mr. Zuma\u2019s chosen candidate as the A.N.C.\u2019s next president.But, at the last minute, one of the premiers, David Mabuza, switched sides, handing a narrow victory to Mr. Ramaphosa. Afterward, Mr. Ramaphosa made Mr. Mabuza \u2014 whose province, Mpumalanga, became known for political killings and endemic corruption during Mr. Mabuza\u2019s decade as premier \u2014 the nation\u2019s deputy president.With a new president in charge, the national police and prosecutors have started moving against some individuals involved in the dairy farm case. Eight people were charged with fraud, and others had their assets linked to the farm frozen. But a judge released most of the frozen assets in March. The next court hearing in the criminal case is scheduled for August.Mr. Zwane, who was not appointed to Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s new cabinet, has kept out of the public eye in recent weeks. Neither he nor Mr. Magashule has shown any willingness to answer questions about the dairy farm from the news media or Parliament \u2014 reinforcing the public perception that A.N.C. officials are above the law.\u201cWhat has gone wrong has gone wrong under their watch,\u201d said Mathole Motshekga, a senior A.N.C. official who is a member of the party\u2019s decision-making body, the national executive committee, and is also chairman of Parliament\u2019s justice committee. \u201cWe expect, and the public expects, that they should take responsibility for what has happened. We are waiting to hear what they have to say, because we don\u2019t expect people in such positions to be absentee landlords.\u201dBut many have given up on the A.N.C. Though the money lost in the dairy farm paled in comparison to the scale of corruption inside South Africa\u2019s state-owned enterprises, it resonated deeply across the nation. Government money meant to help poor farmers simply vanished, the way it does across South Africa, and so far none of the A.N.C. officials in charge at the local or provincial levels have been held to account.As Mr. Ramaphosa pledges to clean up the South Africa he has inherited from Mr. Zuma, this case will test his capacity to do just that. A spokeswoman for Mr. Ramaphosa said he was unavailable for interviews.One of the would-be beneficiaries, Adam Khatide, 55, retired early from his teaching job believing that the Vrede dairy farm would take off. In the fallout, he lost faith in the power of his vote.\u201cIt\u2019s voting for nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust taking people, putting them in office, and then they eat money.\u201dWhen democracy arrived for black people in 1994, Mr. Khatide drove elderly neighbors to voting stations, where they elected Mr. Mandela as the first president of the new South Africa.\u201cWe managed to bring democracy, which is not working for us now. It\u2019s working for individuals,\u201d Mr. Khatide said, laughing. \u201cI cannot cry. When I\u2019m crying, it\u2019s just the same. It\u2019s better I must laugh.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Scandal-Tarred Abe Meets Trump, \u2018the Situation Is Getting Dangerous\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet Mr. Abe may not stay in power long enough to complete the diplomatic trifecta.Junichiro Koizumi, one of Mr. Abe\u2019s best-known predecessors, told a reporter for the magazine Weekly Asahi that \u201cthe situation is getting dangerous\u201d for Mr. Abe and questioned whether the prime minister might resign when the current session of Parliament ends in June.But over the last few weeks, leaks of tampered files and previously missing documents are raising sharper questions about whether Mr. Abe helped friends at two educational institutions gain preferential treatment from the government. Mr. Abe has insisted he was not involved in either case and has suggested that bureaucrats may have acted independently.The drip-drip of revelations has poked holes in Mr. Abe\u2019s credibility as he prepares to meet Mr. Trump, who is himself consumed by his own scandals.\u201cThere has been a lot of new evidence that has come to light that there has been some kind of cover-up,\u201d Kristi Govella, assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said of the inquiry surrounding Mr. Abe. \u201cAs time goes on, the disjuncture between what he\u2019s saying and the facts that are coming to light with the scandals just really increase public distrust and feelings that his leadership is no longer what the country needs.\u201dBut last month, the Finance Ministry said an internal investigation found that bureaucrats had tampered with official documents related to the sale of public land to an ultraconservative education group, known as Moritomo Gakuen, at a steeply discounted price. Mr. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie, served as a onetime honorary principal of a planned elementary school that Moritomo wanted to build on the disputed land.In one of the most damaging findings, the ministry said that officials had scrubbed Mrs. Abe\u2019s name and alleged remarks encouraging the deal from the documents when they were first submitted to Parliament, known in Japan as the Diet. Then this month Mitsuru Ota, a senior official at the Finance Ministry, told Parliament that a bureaucrat had urged a lawyer for Moritomo to lie about how much it would cost to remove garbage from the public land in order to justify the sale at a discounted price.Last week, the newspaper The Asahi Shimbun reported the existence of a memo in a separate scandal showing that Mr. Abe had talked over a meal to a friend seeking to set up a veterinary school in a special economic zone in southwestern Japan. The memo also suggested that a secretary for Mr. Abe had helped the friend set up the veterinary school.None of the leaks have yet proven Mr. Abe\u2019s involvement.\u201cThere\u2019s still nothing to say that Abe ordered the cover-up\u201d or pushed for his friend\u2019s veterinary school deal, said Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy based in New York. \u201cBut between the Finance Ministry falsifying documents submitted to the Diet and the bureaucracy making up documents, those are things that are not just going to be accepted passively by the public.\u201dMr. Abe \u201cis running out of time, and there doesn\u2019t really seem to be a way out of this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.For the five years that Mr. Abe has been in power, he has benefited from a weak opposition and public weariness over the revolving door at the prime minister\u2019s office that preceded his election in 2012. And as Japan has faced increasing threats from China and North Korea, he has been able to persuade voters that he is the best leader to keep Japan secure. The economy has been gradually improving, too.With the scandals gaining traction, however, that formula is weakening. \u201cFor the last five years we have had some consensus that Japan needs a strong leader and we have to sustain that strong leader,\u201d said Ryo Sahashi, a professor of international politics at Kanagawa University. \u201cBut I think that consensus is now eroded.\u201dIf Mr. Abe is able to hold on to power, it may be public fatigue that helps him. Norimasa Araki, 76, a retired trading company employee who was having lunch near Shimbashi Station in central Tokyo on Monday, said that the scandals were \u201cnot worth paying attention to.\u201d\u201cThe problems are trivial,\u201d he added.Still, there is no question that Mr. Abe has been politically weakened even if he secures a third term as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party in September.Mr. Sahashi said it would be much more difficult for Mr. Abe to push through some of his most cherished agendas, including revising the country\u2019s pacifist Constitution.\u201cA big handshake with a U.S. president about trade liberalization is a chance for Prime Minister Abe to reclaim his ground as a reformer to the Japanese public,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors. \u201cIt is a good opportunity for Prime Minister Abe to show the public that he is a strong leader in foreign policy.\u201dEven if he can claim some kind of victory in his meeting with Mr. Trump, it is unclear whether it will help him. \u201cEven now the vultures are starting to circle,\u201d Ms. Govella said. \u201cPeople are trying to figure out what comes next after Abe.\u201dReporting was contributed by Makiko Inoue, Hisako Ueno, Shiho Takezawa and Erica Yokoyama.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North and South Korea Set Bold Goals: A Final Peace and No Nuclear Arms", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a historic summit meeting, the first time a North Korean leader had ever set foot in the South, the leaders vowed to negotiate a treaty to replace a truce that has kept an uneasy peace on the divided Korean Peninsula for more than six decades. A peace treaty has been one of the incentives North Korea has demanded in return for dismantling its nuclear program.\u201cSouth and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula,\u201d read a statement signed by North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, after their meeting at the border village of Panmunjom.Everything at the historic meeting of two Korean leaders, from the menu to the meeting room, is laced with meaning.The Trump administration has tightened sanctions on North Korea with China\u2019s help and, mindful that the North has failed to deliver on its promises in the past, insisted that Mr. Kim make substantial progress dismantling his nuclear arsenal before the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign is eased.But by agreeing to pursue a peace deal this year, Mr. Moon held out the prospect of progress toward one of North Korea\u2019s top goals before the North has given up its nuclear weapons, and perhaps measures to withdraw troops from inside the Demilitarized Zone, the heavily armed buffer area between the two Koreas, and create a joint fishing zone around the disputed western sea border, a scene of bloody naval skirmishes between the two Koreas.Mr. Moon also dangled an economic incentive, reaffirming promises made in the past by the South of huge investments to help improve the North\u2019s road and train systems. But those agreements collapsed as the North persisted in developing nuclear weapons, and Mr. Moon\u2019s aides have said that such assistance can only come after the North makes progress toward denuclearization and sanctions are lifted.During an appearance in the Oval Office with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Friday, Mr. Trump said he believed that the North Korean leader was serious about making a deal to give up his nuclear weapons.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s playing,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who faulted his predecessors for their handling of the threat from North Korea, saying they had allowed themselves to be duped.\u201cThe United States has been played beautifully, like a fiddle, because you had a different kind of a leader,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be played, O.K.? We\u2019re going to hopefully make a deal; if we don\u2019t, that\u2019s fine.\u201dChina\u2019s state news media played the summit meeting prominently, even though China had been left on the sidelines with little influence over the proceedings. The Chinese Foreign Ministry praised the courage of the two Korean leaders, and said it welcomed \u201cthe new journey\u201d for peace on the Korean Peninsula.The tone of the summit meeting \u2014 much of which was broadcast live in South Korea but not North Korea \u2014 was convivial and at times jocular, with Mr. Kim showing surprising honesty about the differences in conditions between the two nations.Yoon Young-chan, Mr. Moon\u2019s spokesman, said Mr. Kim acknowledged the poor road conditions in his country, a startling admission for a member of his ruling family, which is considered godlike and faultless among North Koreans. Mr. Kim also revealed that the North Koreans who visited the South during the Winter Olympics in February all admired the bullet train there.After Mr. Moon spoke of wanting to visit North Korea, Mr. Kim said, \u201cIt will be very embarrassing,\u201d alluding to roads there.\u201cI heard you had your early-morning sleep disturbed many times because you had to attend the N.S.C. meetings because of us,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cGetting up early in the morning must have become a habit for you. I will make sure that your morning sleep won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201dMr. Moon joked back: \u201cNow I can sleep in peace.\u201dAn armistice brought about a cease-fire to the Korean War in 1953, but the conflict never officially ended because the parties could not agree to a formal peace treaty. They would have to overcome significant obstacles to do so now, including China\u2019s likely demand that American troops leave South Korea.In their joint statement, the two Korean leaders said that within a year, they would push for a trilateral conference with the United States, or a four-party forum that also included China, with the aim of \u201cdeclaring an end to the Korean War\u201d and intentions to \u201creplace the armistice with a peace treaty.\u201dMr. Kim and Mr. Moon also agreed to improve inter-Korean relations by opening a liaison office in the North Korean border town of Kaesong and arranging a reunion later this year of families separated by the war. And they said Mr. Moon would visit Pyongyang in the fall.Mr. Moon, a progressive leader who says he likes to see South Korea \u201cin the driver\u2019s seat\u201d in pushing the peace effort forward, is trying to broker a successful summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, which is expected in late May or early June.The declaration by Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon \u201cis breathtaking in its scope and ambition,\u201d David Albright, president of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, said by email. \u201cBut how to achieve all the goals laid out in the document, given the current situation?\u201dUnless \u201ca firm foundation\u201d for North Korea\u2019s verifiable nuclear disarmament were laid out, he added, most of the other commitments in the agreement were \u201cmerely wishes.\u201dAnalysts have warned that once negotiations begin with the United States, North Korea could push them into a stalemate by trying to drag Washington into nuclear arms reduction talks.To prevent that, South Korea and the United States are trying to persuade North Korea to agree to a specific timeline for complete denuclearization: as soon as possible and no later than the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s current term, in early 2021, according to South Korean officials and analysts.During their morning talks, Mr. Kim pushed for more summit meetings with Mr. Moon, saying he would like to visit the presidential Blue House in Seoul. He said North Korea would cooperate to make a \u201cbetter world.\u201dBut he also voiced caution, suggesting South Korea and the United States deserved blame for scuttling previous deals.\u201cAs the expectations are high, so is the skepticism,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, we had reached big agreements, but they were not implemented for more than 10 years. There are people who are skeptical that the results of today\u2019s meeting will be properly implemented.\u201dAustin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong, Jane Perlez from Seoul, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farmers\u2019 Anger at Trump Tariffs Puts Republican Candidates in a Bind", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump moves to fulfill one of the central promises of his campaign \u2014 to get tough on an ascendant China \u2014 he faces a potential rebellion from a core constituency: farmers and other agricultural producers who could suffer devastating losses in a trade war.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on Chinese goods came with a presidential declaration that trade wars are good and easily won. But the action has injected damaging uncertainty into the economy as Republicans are already struggling to maintain their hold on the House and the Senate in a difficult election year.While the battle for control of the House will be waged in large part in the suburbs, rural districts in Southern Illinois, Iowa, Arkansas and Missouri could prove important. And control of the Senate could come down to Republican efforts to unseat Democrats in North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Montana \u2014 all states staring down the barrels of a trade war\u2019s guns.With farmers angry and worried as China vows to retaliate, many Republicans find themselves torn between loyalty to a president who remains broadly popular in rural states and the demands of constituents, especially farmers, to oppose his tariffs.In North Dakota, a major soybean-producing state, Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican who is running for the Senate, sounded restrained this past week when he urged Mr. Trump to \u201ctake a more measured approach\u201d to China. By Friday, he sounded panicked.China\u2019s aggressive response to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs is aimed squarely at products produced in the American heartland, a region that helped send him to the White House. A trade war with China could be particularly devastating to rural economies, especially for pig farmers and soybean and corn growers. Nearly two-thirds of United States soybean exports go to China.The tariffs have not yet gone into effect, and the administration is engaging in back-channel talks with the Chinese to try to resolve their differences.In the meantime, Mr. Trump has been escalating his threats, and shows no sign of backing off. On Thursday night, he threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese products.Trump administration officials argue that the tariffs on Chinese goods, while not intended to help certain American industries, are necessary to prevent China from continuing to violate international trade rules. They say that less aggressive measures by past administrations failed, and that China has stolen American jobs and technology that are the key to future prosperity.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to have true gain without the pain,\u201d said Dan DiMicco, a trade adviser to Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. \u201cThe battle is worth the victory, and we will win.\u201dBut farm-state Republicans like Mr. Cramer believe that their constituents could be a casualty, and they are begging the Department of Agriculture to intervene.Mr. Trump has directed the department to implement a plan to help farmers cope with the damage from tariffs. But few details have been forthcoming about how such a program would work or how much it might cost. And it is not clear how much the Agriculture Department could do to remedy the damage done to key trading relations in a global economy.The secretary of agriculture has some authority to help farmers by creating new programs that could draw on funds from the Treasury. For instance, the secretary could direct the Commodity Credit Corporation, a government-owned entity, to purchase soybeans to buoy farmers\u2019 revenues, said Kent Conrad, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota.In the past, these powers have been used to provide relief from wildfires and other natural disasters, farm groups said. But such a program could be time-consuming and costly.If the White House does end up subsidizing farmers, that may open trade conflicts on other fronts. Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that such a measure could spark trade challenges from countries beyond China, which would object to unfair competition from American agriculture.Patrick Delaney, a spokesman for the American Soybean Association, said his group was still focused on trying to prevent the tariffs from going into effect, rather than examining what kind of measures the administration might take to support farmers.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole lot easier not to wreck the car in the first place than it is to think about what a repair might look like,\u201d he said.Farmers have been among the most organized groups in lobbying the administration about its trade policy. But as trade tensions with China have escalated, farmers say these complaints appear to be falling on deaf ears. Many of them are now complaining to Congress.For Republicans like Mr. Cramer, who is in a tough race against an incumbent Democrat, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, the president\u2019s threat to sharply escalate the administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports \u2014 and China\u2019s threat to retaliate against American farm products \u2014 spells trouble in this year\u2019s midterm races. Mr. Cramer\u2019s aides did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that it puts Republicans in a tough spot, because they\u2019ve got to talk to their farmers and affected business owners about the negative impact of the tariff, which I\u2019m sure they are hearing complaints about,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist in Kentucky. \u201cOn the other hand, they\u2019ve got constituents who probably think it\u2019s a good idea for the president to stand up to China.\u201dA number of Republicans are pushing back against the president. In Iowa, Representative David Young, who represents a district that Mr. Trump carried by just four percentage points, has publicly urged Mr. Trump to negotiate before imposing tariffs. His state is a major producer of soybean, grain and pork products, and farmers there are already seeing prices drop.Iowa\u2019s senators \u2014 Joni Ernst and Charles E. Grassley, both Republicans \u2014 have called on Mr. Trump to reconsider. In a statement, Ms. Ernst cited the \u201creal danger that increased tariffs on U.S. exports will harm Iowa producers and undermine the rural economy,\u201d and she said she had spoken directly with the president about it.The clash with China began last month, when Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, fulfilling a central promise of his campaign. China responded with tariffs on $3 billion worth of American products, including pork, fruit and other items.Then, in late March, the president announced plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods from China. Once again, China retaliated; this past week, it proposed its own tariff measure on $50 billion in American products, which, in turn, goaded Mr. Trump to propose the additional tariffs on Thursday night.It remains to be seen if China will answer Mr. Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat with an escalation of its own.In addition to soybean farmers, carmakers and Boeing would be hit hard by China\u2019s tariffs. Many American companies purchase products from Chinese factories, while others rely on the country\u2019s vast consumer market to sell their goods.The trade spat with China also comes on the heels of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade accord that was to rope in countries on both sides of the Pacific in an alliance against a rising Beijing. The administration is also renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both were valuable deals for American farmers, and Mr. Trump\u2019s move to upend them had already set agricultural producers on edge.Suffering has come quickly for the sector on the stock market. Investors dumped stocks linked to agriculture on Friday. Deere & Company and the fertilizer giant Mosaic dropped nearly 4 percent, while the fertilizer maker CF Industries fell by 4.5 percent.While some farmers and lawmakers have expressed hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s threats are merely a negotiating tactic, administration officials insisted this past week that was not the case.\u201cThere is the potential of a trade war,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cThere is a level of risk that we could get into a trade war.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said he was hopeful that talks with his Chinese counterparts could avert a damaging escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs, but he declined to elaborate on the status of talks and whether he thought an agreement could be reached.The president\u2019s new economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to China was not a bluff.\u201cTrump is not just using tariffs as a negotiating card. He said that to me,\u201d Mr. Kudlow told reporters on Friday.But the White House strategy to press China to reform its economic behavior seemed unclear. Mr. Kudlow said that the administration was holding back-channel talks with the Chinese, but that he would not characterize them as negotiations. He added that the United States was considering providing China with a list of the changes the United States would like to see, but that it had not yet done so.\u201cI cannot guarantee that, but it\u2019s something that is under discussion,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said.Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New York.Follow Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Ana Swanson on Twitter: @SherylNYT @AnaSwansonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Misunderstands Trade", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs. de Rugy is a senior research fellow at George Mason\u2019s Mercatus Center.In 1776, Adam Smith observed that nothing \u201ccan be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade.\u201d Sadly, almost 250 years later, the president \u2014 along with his economic adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross \u2014 has elevated this economic fallacy into a pretext for protectionism.Fueling this bipartisan hysteria is the widespread failure to understand that United States trade deficits generally add capital to our economy \u2014 more factories, more R & D or more machines.The notion that trade deficits are always bad for the economy is based on several fundamental mistakes. The first mistake is the assumption that trade is a zero-sum game, suggesting that the country selling products abroad is a winner while the one who buys is a loser. That\u2019s simply wrong.Think about your own experience. Without ever worrying about it, we run up trade deficits on a daily basis with many merchants. When you shop at the grocery store, enjoy a drink at your favorite bar or get your hair cut, you run up a personal trade deficit with your grocer, bar and hair stylist. Do they ever buy anything from you in return? When you get paid by your employer, he runs up his trade deficit with you. Do you buy as much from your employer as he buys from you?These examples illustrate how trade deficits with other economic entities are almost always nothing to fret about. They\u2019re unavoidable consequences of the specialization and trade on which our modern prosperity depends. To be sure, on rare occasions trade deficits are symptoms of underlying dysfunctions, but they are never themselves a cause of these dysfunctions.Even if we were to ignore the counsel of nearly every economist and blindly accept the notion that a United States trade deficit with the rest of the planet is undesirable, it would still be completely untrue that a deficit with any single country is undesirable. In this world of nearly 200 countries, bilateral trade deficits are as unavoidable and as economically meaningless as your trade deficit with your grocer. If America\u2019s overall trade deficit were balanced, we\u2019d still have deficits with some countries and surpluses with others.Here\u2019s how it works: The American dollars we use to buy imports are of little use to foreigners outside our borders. They are, however, of great use to foreigners who want to invest within the United States. And that\u2019s what happens with the dollars that aren\u2019t spent on American exports.Foreign investment is key to our economic growth here at home. In other words, we Americans win when we get to buy the stuff we want from abroad and when those dollars are pumped back into our economy.This benefit remains intact despite Beijing\u2019s many violations of our trade rules \u2014 such as its subsidization of Chinese steel makers. It\u2019s true that those subsidies artificially lower the price of steel imported by America and might hurt some American steel mills and workers. But this effect is the same as it would be if Chinese steel makers had a genuine efficiency advantage over our producers. Despite the administration\u2019s constant refrain about the devastating impact of foreign export subsidies on the steel industry, experts know that a vastly greater number of steel jobs were lost to innovation, not trade.Even in the subsidization scenario, we pay for Chinese steel with dollars, and the Chinese then use some of those dollars to buy our exports and use the rest to invest in our country. In both cases, it creates jobs here. The same relationship holds when the Chinese manipulate their currency to stimulate their exports.Some worry that the Chinese won\u2019t spend their dollars in the United States, but this concern is misplaced. If there were no foreigners who wanted to spend or invest dollars in America, the Chinese would not have exported steel to the United States to begin with. At the end of the day, dollars have value only because they can ultimately be used to buy American-made outputs or be invested in American assets.If the Chinese spend their dollars in Japan, the Japanese will turn around and spend their dollars in America, by investing in such things as a brand-new Toyota plant that will employ United States workers. Dollars will always find their way home.President Trump argues that yet another reason to eliminate the trade deficit is because it fuels our debt. Nonsense. The only reason we have so much debt is because our government spends more than it collects in taxes. That\u2019s not the fault of foreigners.We could reduce our trade deficit by reducing our government\u2019s dependence on borrowing, but that requires a discipline that no one seems to have. Until that changes, foreigners help us shoulder the burden of our irresponsible debt. In fact, we should hope that they don\u2019t ever change their minds about buying our debt, because the resulting higher interest rates would lead to even bigger budget deficits and even higher taxes on everyone.Veronique de Rugy is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Fed Names John Williams President, Bucking Calls for Diversity", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Tuesday named John C. Williams as its next president, choosing a longtime insider for what is widely regarded as one of the Fed\u2019s most influential positions.Mr. Williams, the 55-year-old president of the San Francisco Fed, is a respected economist who will bring academic expertise that is in short supply among the Fed\u2019s senior leaders. But unions, progressive groups and Democratic lawmakers had pushed the Fed to diversify its senior leadership beyond Fed veterans and white men, and the selection drew immediate criticism.The position is unique among the Fed\u2019s top policy roles. While the Fed chairman and other members of the board of governors are appointed by the president and subject to Senate confirmation, regional Fed appointments are made outside the political process.And unlike the 11 other regional Fed chiefs, New York\u2019s president has a permanent vote on the policymaking Open Market Committee and serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman. The New York bank also plays a key role in carrying out monetary decisions and overseeing many of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, issued a statement saying that given the importance of the job, the New York Fed should have solicited a wide set of views, but instead \u201cturned the process over to a handful of private individuals and ignored calls to choose one of many qualified alternatives who might have brought a new perspective.\u201d\u201cIf the Fed wants to regain some of its credibility around this decision,\u201d she added, \u201cit should have Mr. Williams and the co-chairs of the New York Fed search committee promptly testify before Congress.\u201dThose leading the search said they had indeed cast a wide net, and advocates for Mr. Williams argue he is well suited to the complex role. He has led the San Francisco bank for seven years and has spent virtually his entire career inside the Fed system. He is an influential expert on monetary policy who has worked closely with progressives \u2014 including Janet L. Yellen, who before her term as Fed chairwoman was Mr. Williams\u2019s predecessor at the San Francisco Fed \u2014 and with conservatives such as John B. Taylor, the Stanford economist.\u201cHis work is rigorous and thoughtful, and he discusses it carefully, considers other views,\u201d said Mr. Taylor, who was Mr. Williams\u2019s thesis adviser in graduate school. Ms. Yellen also released a statement on Tuesday praising Mr. Williams\u2019s selection.Mr. Williams would also bring a seasoned policymaking hand to a Fed that is short on them. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed\u2019s newly appointed chairman, has been at the Fed since 2012, but he is a lawyer by training and not \u2014 unlike Ms. Yellen and most of her recent predecessors \u2014 an economist. The Fed\u2019s vice chairmanship is vacant, and the candidate President Trump has been reported to favor, Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist, has little policy experience. Three other positions on the seven-member board of governors are also vacant, and several regional bank presidents are new in their roles.The relative inexperience at the top of the Fed made finding someone with practical experience a priority, two people close to the search process said. The search committee, these people said, wanted a candidate who understood the Fed\u2019s inner workings and who would protect the Fed\u2019s independence.But Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth economist and former Fed staff member, said there are also risks to picking an insider. Fed officials failed to appreciate the risks posed by the housing bubble in the mid-2000s, for example, even as some outside voices tried to raise the alarm.\u201cThe problem with picking a longtime Fed insider is it just amplifies the risk of groupthink,\u201d Mr. Levin said, \u201cand I think groupthink has been proven to be a very serious threat at the Fed.\u201dMr. Williams also has less experience with financial markets than many past New York Fed chiefs. The bank\u2019s president and its staff are traditionally responsible for communicating Fed decisions to Wall Street, and for interpreting financial markets\u2019 reactions for Fed policymakers.Mr. Williams was chosen by a search committee headed by two members of the bank\u2019s board: Sara Horowitz, founder of the Freelancers Union, a New York-based labor organization, and Glenn Hutchins, a private-equity investor and philanthropist. Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the financial crisis, board members who represent financial institutions regulated by the Fed are excluded from the appointment process.Mr. Williams\u2019s appointment was also approved by the Fed\u2019s board of governors.In a statement announcing the decision, Mr. Hutchins praised Mr. Williams as someone who has a rare mix of policy expertise and management experience and who \u201cunderstands the plumbing of the financial system.\u201d In a call with reporters, Mr. Hutchins and Ms. Horowitz also cited Mr. Williams\u2019s record of community engagement in San Francisco and his progress in diversifying the bank\u2019s senior leadership.In a statement Tuesday, the Fed Up campaign, a progressive group, criticized the New York Fed\u2019s board for \u201cignoring the demands of the public and choosing yet another white man whose record on Wall Street regulation and full employment raises serious questions.\u201d The group said the search process \u201ccalls into question whether the Federal Reserve can be trusted to act in the public interest.\u201dYet in one sense, the protesters got their wish. Unlike Mr. Dudley, who was chief economist for Goldman Sachs before he joined the Fed, Mr. Williams has never worked on Wall Street. And some of his positions have drawn cheers from progressives. He has, for example, pushed the central bank to consider a new approach to monetary policy that could lead the Fed to be more aggressive in fighting the next recession.But Mr. Williams has also supported gradually raising interest rates to stave off inflation, an approach that progressive economists worry could prematurely choke off the economic recovery. And his regulatory record is also drawing scrutiny: He was president of the San Francisco Fed while Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in the opening of millions of accounts without customers\u2019 knowledge. (Regulatory policy is set in Washington, and Fed insiders say regional bank presidents play only a limited role overseeing banks in their districts.)Perhaps the loudest criticism has focused on the fact that Mr. Williams, like every other person to lead the New York Fed in the bank\u2019s century of history, is a white man.\u201cThe New York Fed has never been led by a woman or a person of color, and that needs to change,\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said in a statement last week.The search committee promised to consider a diverse pool of candidates, and the two leaders of the search said they had succeeded. Neither of the other two finalists for the job \u2014 Raymond McGuire, an executive at Citigroup, and Mary J. Miller, a former Treasury official \u2014 is a white man, and the search committee also interviewed other candidates who would have brought diversity to the Fed. One such candidate, Peter Blair Henry, who recently stepped down as dean of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said that the search committee had pushed him to pursue the job, but that he had declined.\u201cI\u2019m just one data point, but if the effort they put into trying to persuade me to be a candidate is any indication, then they took diversity pretty seriously,\u201d said Mr. Henry, who like Mr. McGuire is African-American.But Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist who has studied the Fed, questioned whether there were really so few qualified candidates who weren\u2019t white men. And she said that the closed-door nature of the process made it hard for the public to evaluate how the search committee had carried out its work.\u201cIt\u2019s such an opaque and pretty byzantine process,\u201d Ms. Binder said. \u201cThe fact that it is so cloistered from public view and really has very little if any public accountability for how that choice is made \u2014 given the importance of the position, it\u2019s really quite glaring.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Vegas Golden Knights, It\u2019s Not Only Magic on Ice", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingMs. Bronson is a hospitality worker and a contributing opinion writer.LAS VEGAS \u2014 To those who thought ice hockey couldn\u2019t work in the Nevada desert, you should see Las Vegas Boulevard.We are Vegas, after all \u2014 we know our brand better than anyone.Last week, when the Golden Knights swept the Los Angeles Kings in their first round Stanley Cup playoff series, half of my neighborhood was at that bar \u2014 people I had lived on the same street with for years but whose names I didn\u2019t learn until we were side-by-side with the same Golden Knights helmet silk-screened onto our chests like a new, indestructible armor.Although Las Vegas has never had major professional sports teams, it has always been a sports town. In 1990, it was Runnin\u2019 Rebel fever, when the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, men\u2019s basketball team defeated Duke in the N.C.A.A. National Championship game. But to some people, it takes professional teams to legitimize a city.Historically, expansion teams perform poorly. But as this year\u2019s Pacific Division Champions, the Golden Knights accomplished in their inaugural season what no other expansion team in any sport has done.To the outsider, the Golden Knights might seem like a first-time gambler on a heater. But to locals, the most poignant result of the team\u2019s arrival is not their unlikely success but how their journey has been intimately tied to our city\u2019s healing and catharsis. Just days before the Golden Knights\u2019 first home-game opener, a gunman fortressed inside the Mandalay Bay hotel with nearly 50 weapons and 4,000 rounds of ammunition opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival crowd, killing 58 concertgoers and wounding hundreds of others.Instead of introducing their team with standard Vegas-like theatrics, the Golden Knights comforted Las Vegans with a tribute to emergency medical workers. The players entered the rink paired with nurses, police officers, E.M.T.s and surgeons. The names of the 58 victims were projected onto the ice, and 58 seconds of silence was observed.The city of Las Vegas extends far beyond the two-mile corporate glitz where T-Mobile Arena is, yet our identity is so often contained to the Strip. Getting the nation to acknowledge us as anything other than America\u2019s favorite place to party has been an endless challenge. The Route 91 massacre seemed to awaken the country to the community of Las Vegas, a collection of diverse people with shared victories and disappointments.But the Golden Knights recognized this truth almost immediately. As the season progressed and the city moved forward, the team certainly catered to our big personality, but it also continued to acknowledge our often overlooked heart.Professional sports franchises helping their cities cope with tragedy is nothing new. After Sept. 11, the New York Yankees made it to the World Series.Had the Golden Knights never been displaced to the desert, Las Vegas\u2019s grief and recovery still would have occurred, but on a much quieter, lonely scale. We would have pressed on, because surprisingly, Las Vegans are not strangers to loneliness or displacement: Three out of every four residents were not born here. Similarly, despite the team\u2019s slogan, \u201cVegas Born,\u201d the players for the Golden Knights were plucked from all around the country.The Golden Knights have offered residents a way to be rooted to one of the most transient cities in the world. For the small contingent that truly is \u201cVegas Born,\u201d they have affirmed that being so is something to be proud of.But our new, shiny armor is certainly not indestructible. Explosions of fandom are always tied to success. Hard times will certainly come to the Golden Knights, whether it\u2019s in the next round of the Stanley Cup playoffs or next season.But in our quintessentially Las Vegas style, we never ease into anything. We started our show with the entire bejeweled and bedazzled bandwagon. Who knows how long the ride will go? You might as well jump on it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venting on Immigration, Trump Vows \u2018No More DACA Deal\u2019 and Threatens Nafta", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump, blaming Democrats and the Mexican government for an increasingly \u201cdangerous\u201d flow of illegal immigrants, unleashed a series of fiery tweets on Sunday in which he vowed \u201cNO MORE DACA DEAL\u201d and threatened to walk away from the North American Free Trade Agreement.Minutes after wishing the nation a happy Easter Sunday, Mr. Trump denounced \u201cliberal\u201d laws that he said were preventing Border Patrol agents from doing their jobs. He said that Republicans should use the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to sidestep Democratic opposition in the Senate and enact \u201ctough laws NOW.\u201dIt was unclear whether the president\u2019s tweets represented any change in his immigration policy, or were just the sort of venting he is known to do after reading a newspaper article or seeing a television program. The president, who spent much of his holiday weekend golfing with supporters and watching television, was apparently reacting to a \u201cFox and Friends\u201d segment on immigration that had aired minutes before.Whatever his intention, Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter outburst captured the fickle tendencies that have driven his policy positions on immigration. On one hand, he has suggested at times that he is open to extending citizenship to millions of undocumented people. On the other hand, he has denounced those who have entered the country illegally as brutal criminals and raged about lax enforcement that he said had allowed immigrants to pour into the country.As he walked into church in Palm Beach on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump did not respond to a question from reporters about whether his tweets meant that he would no longer support any deal for the young immigrants protected by the DACA program. But he said that \u201cMexico has got to help us at the border, and a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA.\u201dThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, gave protected status to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The program requires immigrants to have resided in the United States since 2007, meaning any crossing the border now would not be eligible.Mr. Trump announced last year that he was ending the program, but courts have blocked his decision. He has said he is open to negotiating with Democrats on it, but has repeatedly backed away from potential deals that he argues do not include immigration changes that are tough enough.Outside the church on Sunday, the president said the Democrats \u201cblew it\u201d after having \u201chad a great chance.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019ll have to take a look,\u201d he added.Several Democrats challenged the idea that they were at fault for a breakdown in negotiations.Mr. Evans said the president\u2019s comments were \u201csimply unacceptable.\u201d\u201cNEED WALL!\u201d he added.The president\u2019s tweets seemed at odds with some unifying steps taken last week by members of his administration: The homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, met with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico to discuss ways to work together on security and trade issues, according to a description of the conversation released by the Department of Homeland Security.But Mr. Trump may have been hearing a harder-line administration voice over the weekend. He was accompanied to his Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, by Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who has shaped much of the administration\u2019s tough stance on immigration.The president, in his tweets, criticized what he called \u201cCatch & Release,\u201d a practice in which detained undocumented immigrants are sometimes released as they wait for a hearing before an immigration judge. In some cases, they are released because the government has nowhere to house them.Critics say the practice \u2014 which, contrary to the president\u2019s tweet, is not enshrined in law \u2014 gives the immigrants an opening to skip their hearing and settle undetected in the country. The Trump administration has declared an end to the practice, though it may take a while before significant changes are carried out.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets on Sunday echoed remarks on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d by Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, whom the president has praised in the past.\u201cOur legislators actually have to stand up, and the Republicans control the House and the Senate, they do not need the Democrat support to pass any laws they want,\u201d Mr. Judd said on the program. \u201cThey can go the nuclear option, just like what they did on the confirmation. They need to pass laws to end the catch-and-release program that\u2019ll allow us to hold them for a long time.\u201dMr. Judd also said that the \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy was helping to lure the caravan of Central Americans to the United States.A representative for a group called Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which organized the caravan, said that it would take four to six weeks before it reached the United States-Mexico border, and that the number of participants would be significantly smaller by then.Most people are likely to drop out of the caravan in Mexico, rather than journey all the way to the border, the representative said, because they know they would be turned back by American border officials.\u201cMany of them know they won\u2019t qualify for asylum. They are afraid of being detained,\u201d said Roberto Corona, the group\u2019s communications director, adding that most of them just wanted to reach Mexico, where they plan to speak with members of that country\u2019s Congress.Migrants who cannot prove that they face persecution or that their lives are endangered in their home country are unlikely to be allowed to remain in the United States. The Trump administration has also sought to increase detentions to deter would-be migrants.Ron Nixon and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Washington, and Miriam Jordan from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Officials Have Concerns About Trade, March Meeting Minutes Show", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe officials also expressed uncertainty about how newly enacted tax cuts would affect the economy, partly because the cuts are expected to exacerbate the swelling of federal budget deficits, and because some of the cuts are to expire in the years ahead. Policymakers also expressed unanimous, increased confidence in the strength of the country\u2019s economic recovery, even accounting for trade and tax uncertainties.The minutes of the meeting, on March 20 and 21, provide more detail into the concerns being raised by the farm industry about the potential domestic impact of President Trump\u2019s plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum.\u201cParticipants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook,\u201d the minutes read, \u201cbut a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy. Contacts in the agricultural sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retaliation.\u201dFed policymakers also said at the meeting that they expected the combination of the tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump last year and a bipartisan congressional deal this year to increase federal spending to give economic output \u201ca significant boost\u201d in the next few years.However, the minutes reflect officials\u2019 uncertainty about how big that boost might be, and when it might come, because there is little historical precedent for such fiscal stimulus when unemployment is so low. The minutes also show that policymakers \u201csuggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.\u201dThe minutes suggest that decision on interest rates generated little controversy: \u201cAll participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months,\u201d and that they expected the annual inflation rate to rise in the months to come.But the minutes say that a \u201ccouple of participants\u201d suggested the Fed would benefit from holding off until a future meeting to raise rates, in order to wait for more data to confirm evidence that the rate of inflation was approaching the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent annual growth.Officials also debated the benefits of the economy\u2019s running hot \u2014 with unemployment very low and growth above forecast trends \u2014 for a prolonged period of time, weighing the potential for drawing more workers back to the labor force against the risk of financial instability and \u201csignificant\u201d inflation growth.Officials seemed to shrug off the increase in stock market volatility in February, attributing it in part to Labor Department reports that the suggested growth in wages \u2014 and, with it, inflation \u2014 was gaining steam, which could force the Fed to raise rates faster than expected. \u201cMany participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month\u2019s turbulence in stride,\u201d the minutes read.The official statement released immediately after the March meeting did not mention trade policy concerns, which roiled financial markets after the Trump administration announced its plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as well as on some other Chinese goods. Mr. Powell acknowledged those concerns at his news conference, saying that trade policy had begun to worry business leaders who speak with Fed officials. Still, he played down any immediate threat to growth.\u201cThere\u2019s no thought that changes in trade policy should have an effect on the current outlook,\u201d Mr. Powell said at the news conference, adding that could change if a global trade dispute escalated.In a speech in Chicago last week, Mr. Powell elaborated on the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s concerns during a question-and-answer session.\u201cThe discussion about tariffs is at a relatively early stage, and we talked about this at the F.O.M.C. meeting a couple of weeks ago now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people really don\u2019t see yet any implications in the near term for the outlook, because we don\u2019t know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be.\u201dAny negative effects from tariffs could put the Fed in a bind, forcing policymakers to break what Mr. Powell and his predecessors have repeatedly characterized as a delicate balance between supporting economic growth and job creation, and holding inflation to the target growth rate. Economists generally view tariff fallout as stagflationary, meaning it hurts growth and also feeds inflation. Taxes on imported goods raise prices for businesses and consumers, pushing up the inflation rate, while also dampening consumption and economic growth.The minutes suggest that Fed officials are worrying more about that possibility than they have acknowledged publicly: \u201cMost participants also cited trade policy as a source of either uncertainty or downside risk,\u201d the minutes say.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looming China Trade Action Divides Industry and Roils Markets", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s promise to take tough action against China\u2019s unfair economic practices was one of his most popular campaign ideas. But as the United States prepares stiff trade measures and China retaliates, stock markets have plummeted and some of America\u2019s biggest companies are pushing back.Industry giants like General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as agricultural companies, have lodged objections with the White House, saying that tariffs on both sides of the Pacific and limitations on investments will cut off American companies from the world\u2019s most lucrative and rapidly growing market.Since then, the White House has announced another trade measure targeted at China that would place tariffs on at least $50 billion worth of products imported to the United States and would restrict investment flows between the two economic giants. This week, the Trump administration is expected to announce a list of Chinese imports subject to tariffs, which could include high-tech products like semiconductors as well as cheap electronics and other goods that many Americans buy.Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocate for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and IBM, said his group had been largely supportive of the administration\u2019s targeting of China\u2019s unfair trade practices. But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d\u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201dThat theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.Companies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.\u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.\u201cAmerican farmers appear to be the first casualties of an escalating trade war,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and a chairman of a group called Farmers for Free Trade. \u201cWith farm incomes already declining, farmers rely on export markets to stay above water. These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201dHowever, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.Speaking Monday on CNBC, the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, defended the administration\u2019s tough actions on China and said investors should not fear a trade war.\u201cEverybody needs to relax,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe economy is as strong as an ox.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farmers Hit the Road to Reach Shoppers Before Amazon Does", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo is David Nowacoski, a chicken and pig farmer here in East Smithfield.We recently spent the day with Mr. Nowacoski and his wife, Marla, traveling about 92 miles in the family minivan, picking up and dropping off food from three farms, one cheese room, one tavern and a bakery. Even in this rural patch of natural gas fields and deer hunting grounds, where the closest Whole Foods is more than 100 miles away, Amazon\u2019s influence is deeply felt. Mr. Nowacoski says Amazon and other big retailers have conditioned consumers to expect a higher level of convenience.\u201cThis is where society is going, and we have to figure out how the small farm plays a role in it,\u201d he says. A day on the road with the Nowacoskis shows how exhausting and costly e-commerce can be. Dressed in overalls and a purple sweatshirt, Mr. Nowacoski walks over to a shed that smells like diesel fuel, dirt and garlic. He mixes garlic powder into the chicken feed as a natural antibiotic. Mr. Nowacoski raises about 4,000 chickens a year for meat and an additional 600 hens for eggs. In warmer months, the birds live in fields, eating grass, herbs and insects. But on a morning like this \u2014 with the temperature around 18 degrees and a snowy mist making it feel even colder \u2014 the chickens are kept in a coop with a vaulted ceiling and walls made of clear plastic. Mr. Nowacoski walks among the birds, carrying a blue feed bucket in each hand. The hens flock to him, while the rooster hangs back, crowing with jealousy and alarm. \u201cThat bird hates me,\u201d Mr. Nowacoski says. With the chickens fed, we walk down a winding dirt road to the pig pen. The sky has gone from light purple to blue-gray, and the snow has stopped.The pigs are still sleeping when we poke our heads into their hut, carpeted with hay. They lie side by side like a band of brothers \u2014 warm, plump and blissfully unaware that they have about three weeks left on earth.\u201cYeah, boys. Yeah, boys,\u201d Mr. Nowacoski calls to them. Most of the 300-pound pigs are opting to sleep in, but a few amble out onto the snowy ground, grunting, snorting and looking for breakfast. Mr. Nowacoski rubs and scratches their haunches vigorously, sizing up their meat.Confirmed. Three weeks left.A pot of coffee brews in the kitchen, and bacon sizzles on the stove. Ms. Nowacoski stands at the counter organizing online orders on her tablet.The Nowacoskis grew up in East Smithfield, a town of about 200 residents 75 miles west of Scranton. Friends since high school, they got married and moved to Princeton, N.J., where Mr. Nowacoski worked for an employee benefits firm. In 1993, they returned to East Smithfield and bought 80 acres of rolling fields, maple groves and a swamp that they dug out into a lake stocked with catfish and largemouth bass. Like many farms in the area, the Nowacoskis\u2019 land sits above the Marcellus Shale formation, a huge natural gas deposit. The couple lease some of their land to gas companies for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. When gas prices were high, the Nowacoskis received enough money to send two of their three children to college without amassing debt. But as prices slumped, the infusion of wealth from the fracking boom all but evaporated.\u201cEveryone thought they would be millionaires,\u201d Mr. Nowacoski says. \u201cThen it just stopped.\u201dThe gas money is vanishing while milk prices are also low, putting pressure on farms and the broader economy.The Nowacoskis hope their e-commerce business, Delivered Fresh, can help farmers find new markets for their milk, meat and produce.The Nowacoskis spend Wednesdays picking up food from as many as 20 farms \u2014 a loop that sometimes totals 300 miles. They make deliveries on Thursdays and Fridays. For now, most orders are dropped off at central locales like farm stands or church parking lots. Eventually, Mr. Nowacoski hopes to expand delivery directly to the homes of as many customers as he can. It\u2019s not clear how many shoppers can afford \u201cpasture raised\u201d chicken breasts that cost $7.95 a pound in an area where household incomes are far below the national median.\u201cPeople ask, \u2018Why do you cost so much?\u2019\u201d Mr. Nowacoski says. \u201cThe better question is how are others like Walmart able to sell it so cheaply?\u201dWith the minivan loaded with three large coolers, the Nowacoskis pull out of their driveway and head west. The first stop is a small dairy farm about 35 minutes away in Roseville, to pick up cheese. To reach the farm, we climb a long, lonely hill that cuts through a snow-encrusted field.Near the top of the hill, we turn right and glide down a paved road that resembles a bobsled run. The cheese shop is at the bottom of the driveway, next to a barn.Amanda Kennedy is in her \u201ccheese room,\u201d wearing a white smock. She got up at 1:30 in the morning to start making the cheese. She milked the cows at 3 and helped her three children onto the bus at around 7.Ms. Kennedy, who was raised on a farm down the road, hopes that she can weather the turmoil in the dairy industry \u2014 which has been roiled by years of low milk prices \u2014 by finding a market for her specialty Cheddar and dill cheese curds.Ms. Nowacoski packs the curds into a cooler and leaves Ms. Kennedy a check for $24, and we are back on the road.After dropping off chicken thighs at a tavern along the way, the Nowacoskis drive to Milky Way Farms in Troy, Pa., to pick up bottles of milk for the week\u2019s online orders.The lunch menu at the Milky Way restaurant features broccoli salad, vegetable beef soup, lemon pineapple cake and gluten-free bread. The hamburgers are made from beef raised at a farm next door. \u201cIt is the middle of lunch time,\u201d Ms. Seeley says, taking our order. \u201cAnd there is nobody here.\u201dTourist traffic to the area has dropped, her husband says, and most people no longer take time to sit down for lunch. Even as the restaurant fades, Mr. Seeley will keep running a store at the farm that sells his chocolate milk, ice cream and egg nog. He\u2019s counting on online deliveries to extend his reach farther.\u201cWe have high hopes,\u201d he says.Fred McNeal, another farmer, joins us for lunch. He runs a farm market in Towanda, Pa., called Farmer Fred\u2019s that sells everything from lawn furniture to turkey bone broth and garden seeds. Mr. McNeal says he never worried about competition from Amazon until the company bought Whole Foods last June. He is convinced that Amazon will find a way to deliver fresh food locally, eating into the market for local goods.\u201cWe see this coming,\u201d Mr. McNeal says. \u201cWe have to figure out how to give customers what they want or we are going to be another story about a business that didn\u2019t adapt.\u201d After lunch, the Nowacoskis return to their farm to pick up heads of lettuce and then drive to a bakery, minutes before it closes at 4:30 p.m. The couple have been on the road for more than six hours. They will visit more farms the next day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Americas Summit, a Peruvian Seaside Locale, and Plenty of Trouble", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 As the region\u2019s leaders converged for a summit in this seaside capital, it had the feel of an escape from the scandals raging at home. But their meeting will be no respite.In Brazil, the October presidential election was upended last week after its front-runner, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, surrendered to authorities to serve a 12-year jail sentence for corruption and money laundering.President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia arrested one of the chief negotiators of the country\u2019s landmark peace deal with rebels, an ex-guerrilla named Seuxis Hern\u00e1ndez. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez is accused of helping traffic 11 tons of cocaine.Worse, the summit\u2019s original host resigned the Peru presidency over corruption allegations. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski quit last month when opponents released leaked tapes in which members of Congress bragged about supporting the president in return for lucrative government deals.Corruption is nothing new in Latin America, but the headlines have reached a fever pitch in recent months and likely will be at the center of debate at the Summit of the Americas, a gathering of regional leaders held once every several years.The corruption issue also has raised the question: In a region where graft is so entrenched, who will be left to govern if the swamp is fully drained?President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela was barred from attending, and President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba decided not to go amid complaints of authoritarianism in coming presidential elections in both countries.Mr. Trump\u2019s absence has forced regional leaders instead to consider rising anger at the corrupt practices in their own countries.The bribes from a single company alone have been enough to give the region pause.The text was expected to include proposals for citizen watchdogs, protections for whistle-blowers and the press, more transparency in government contracts and the sharing of information by prosecutors.\u201cThe summit has one substantive theme to deal with: democratic governance to confront corruption,\u201d N\u00e9stor Popolizio, Peru\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters this week.Mexico, where voters pick a new president in July, has become a major focus of the corruption debate.The front-runner in polls to succeed him is Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a nationalist whose anti-corruption rhetoric and pledge to govern austerely has struck a chord with voters.In Colombia, scandals within one of its newest political groups have been creating election waves.On Monday, Mr. Santos announced the arrest of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, the blind former rebel who was one of the top leaders in the Common Alternative Revolutionary Party, which was formed by guerrilla fighters after they signed a peace deal in 2016.The authorities said Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, whose group has renounced decades of violence and drug running, was in the process of trafficking 11 tons of cocaine to the United States \u2014 even as he prepared to take one of the party\u2019s first congressional seats. The trafficking accusations immediately turned into a political football in the May election, where the front-runners harbor deep criticisms of the peace deal.Some point out that bright spots exist in the region as well.In Guatemala, high-level investigations of corruption have been outsourced to an independent body of international prosecutors backed by the United Nations. Working with the attorney general, they gathered evidence against Otto P\u00e9rez, who resigned as president in 2015 and is awaiting trial on corruption charges.Two countries in the south, Uruguay and Chile, both scored well on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index in 2017, holding the 23rd and 26th places out of 180 countries. (The region\u2019s largest countries sit in the middle, around the 100th slot.)Mr. Schneider, the former State Department official, said Chile in particular had much to teach other countries when it came to fighting corruption.For example, after family members of Michelle Bachelet, until recently Chile\u2019s president, were implicated in a tax-evasion scheme, Ms. Bachelet appointed a council headed by an economist, Eduardo Engel, to propose reforms.A number of new laws and institutions were created from his recommendations, which were embraced widely and continue into the presidency of Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, a right-wing rival of Ms. Bachelet.\u201cChile is as ideologically polarized as any country in the hemisphere, but they\u2019ve adopted these measures, and kept them,\u201d said Mr. Schneider.Andrea Zarate and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Lima, Peru, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Pickets and Lawsuits, Unions and Developers Go to War", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter decades of relative peace, a labor war between New York\u2019s construction unions and real estate developers has broken out.There are daily picket lines in front of a site at Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan, where construction of a $4 billion office tower is just getting underway. Anti-union ads are showing up in the subways and in the newspapers targeting \u201cunion boss Gary LaBarbera.\u201d In the courts, the two sides have traded lawsuits and complaints claiming corruption and unfair labor practices.This month, in the most visible skirmish yet, thousands of union lathers, electricians, laborers, ironworkers and carpenters from work sites across Manhattan poured into the intersection of 40th Street and Seventh Avenue near Times Square for a rally against the city\u2019s largest developer, Related Companies.Against the sound of a marching band with drummers and bagpipes and honking support from passing motorists, the workers and union officials vowed to \u201ckeep New York City a union town.\u201dLabor leaders contend that Related is attempting to diminish the unions\u2019 collective bargaining strength and is now attacking the very labor leader it once praised. But Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for Related, said Mr. LaBarbera has shown bad faith. \u201cWe will not negotiate with Gary again. He hasn\u2019t lived up to his obligations. Why would we negotiate with a party who says he can\u2019t enforce the agreement?\u201d she said.Related is not alone in seeking to cut labor costs, eliminate what it says are antiquated work rules and overhaul the once relatively harmonious relationship between unions and developers. In this battle, \u201cRelated is leading the charge,\u201d said the developer Douglas Durst.The roots of the current crisis lie in the 2008 recession that followed a debt-fueled real estate boom. Projects collapsed, lending ceased and apartment buyers disappeared.But the cost of construction materials and land escalated. So developers and contractors who had projects pushed to cut labor costs.Gradually over the last decade, nonunion contractors gained a foothold in the city, moving over time from smaller projects to high-rise residential buildings for developers who once used union labor exclusively. Some nonunion workers are paid as little as $15 an hour with few, if any, benefits or training, compared with some experienced union workers who earn $93 an hour in wages and benefits.One study for the carpenters union indicates that organized labor now accounts for only 65 percent of the projects in Manhattan and a mere 39 percent of the work in Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx.Mr. LaBarbera acknowledged that union labor is more costly, but argued that unionized workers are better trained and work faster and more safely. In addition, he said that well-paid construction work has long provided a path into the middle class.To compete, however, Mr. LaBarbera and the unions have made what they said were substantial wage and work-rule concessions in what were known as \u201cproject labor agreements,\u201d which include a no-strike pledge.Related signed one of the first agreements in January 2013 for the initial phase of its $25 billion residential and commercial project at Hudson Yards, where 4,000 workers labor on any given day.Another 131 agreements with builders in the private and public sectors followed, covering $64 billion worth of construction, according to Mr. LaBarbera.But developers such as Related and Gotham Construction have argued that the labor agreements did not provide anywhere near the savings the unions had promised. And union contractors have continued to lose work to nonunion builders, especially in residential construction, although they remain dominant on large office buildings and public works.\u201cThis has gone from one of the most highly unionized sectors of the American economy to one where huge chunks of it now operate on a nonunion basis,\u201d said Joshua B. Freeman, a labor historian at the City University of New York. \u201cThere\u2019s been a slow chipping away of union clout.\u201dIncreasingly, developers who had customarily done all-union jobs have turned to \u201copen shops,\u201d in which union contractors compete against nonunion outfits for work.At the Times Square rally, Bryant Nunez, a Marine veteran and a second-year apprentice with the ironworkers union, said, \u201cThe nonunion guys are taking our work. It\u2019s pretty much a bread-and-butter issue for me.\u201dRelated insists that its intention is not to break the unions, but to hold unions to their agreements. The company says that some have not made negotiated changes, like having work crews include more apprentices, paid at a lower wage, in order to bring costs down.Although Related has been the most aggressive in its approach to the unions, the industry\u2019s powerful Real Estate Board of New York has also taken up the cause. The unions, said John Banks, president of the board, have \u201cchosen to try and apply pressure through the political process and aggressive public theatrics, rather than reform of their work rules and benefit structure. These futile efforts will result in such unions losing even more market share.\u201dRelated has grown more aggressive with the unions as the first phase of its Hudson Yards project nears completion. It is building the nearby tower at 55 Hudson Yards under open-shop conditions, although 92 percent of the workers are union members, according to Related. The company has also started the foundation of another tower at 50 Hudson Yards using nonunion workers and a small contingent of union carpenters.A few years ago, Related executives expressed support for Mr. LaBarbera, but in February Related filed a lawsuit in federal court against him and the Building and Construction Trades Council, claiming that they and some of the unions had violated the labor agreements and bilked the company out of more than $100 million through \u201cvarious corrupt practices.\u201dExecutives at Related say they will no longer negotiate with Mr. LaBarbera, ending a century-old tradition in which the council bargained on behalf of more than a dozen unions. The developer also said it would no longer work with the laborers, lathers and electricians unions because they had refused to live up to the labor agreements. From now on, it would deal with the other unions individually.Mr. LaBarbera and other union leaders view the lawsuit as an attempt to divide and conquer the labor movement, as well as retaliation for a pro-union rank-and-file movement, #CountMeIn. The group had been holding a weekly picket line at 50 Hudson Yards to protest nonunion contractors.\u201cRelated wants to pick and choose who they want to use,\u201d Mr. LaBarbera said. \u201cRelated\u2019s been driving all this for some time.\u201dWilliam Wachtell, the lawyer who filed the lawsuit on behalf of Related, adamantly denied the union-busting charge.\u201cIt\u2019s about working with the majority of unions that are honest,\u201d Mr. Wachtell said. \u201cThe fact that Gary LaBarbera made this about an all-or-none proposition is his error in judgment.\u201dBut some union officials said that Related\u2019s aggressive posture is linked to cost overruns and mistakes made on the first tower at Hudson Yards, which they blame on the construction manager.\u201cI\u2019ve done everything I could to work with them,\u201d said Terry Moore, the business manager and financial secretary-treasurer for Local 46 of the lathers union. \u201cBut the next job starts and it wasn\u2019t enough. They want more.\u201dThe Trades Council recently filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board charging that Related had engaged in unlawful surveillance, interrogation and threats against union members wearing pro-union stickers on their hard hats or carrying pro-union signs at Hudson Yards. The mason tenders union has also filed complaints with the board against Trade Off Construction Services, a relatively new nonunion company that supplies low skill workers for construction, saying it fired workers illegally when they complained about safety or working conditions. Also, the State Attorney General\u2019s Office has opened a preliminary investigation into wrongdoing at Trade Off, which pays about $15 an hour.And several unions have jointly filed suit against a nonunion concrete company that Related hired to work at 50 Hudson Yards, saying it is being used to avoid paying union wages and benefits on the job.Ms. Rose, the spokeswoman for Related, dismissed the lawsuit as \u201cfrivolous.\u201dDavid Stronger, a union electrician who attended the raucous rally in Times Square after finishing his shift at Hudson Yards, said he feels that his livelihood is under attack both locally and nationally.\u201cI think about half our work now is nonunion,\u201d Mr. Stronger said. \u201cWithout the unions, it\u2019s a race to the bottom. They pay as little as they can. It doesn\u2019t just hurt us, it brings the whole economy down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Empire of Guns\u2019 Challenges the Role of War in Industrialization", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryGiven that \u201cBritain was involved in major military operations\u201d for most of the years leading up to and during the Industrial Revolution, Professor Satia argues that imagining an alternative universe in which peace prevailed is a fool\u2019s errand. (\u201cIt is impossible to factor the violence out.\u201d) She contends, rather than crowding out infrastructure development, perpetual war actually \u201cproduced the financial structures that could fund it.\u201dProfessor Satia\u2019s detailed retelling of the Industrial Revolution and Britain\u2019s relentless empire expansion notably contradicts simple free market narratives. She demonstrates that the deep partnership between the public and private sectors underpinned economic growth. Professor Satia argues convincingly that the expansion of the armaments industry and the government\u2019s role in it is inseparable from the rise of innumerable associated industries from finance to mining.Government planning played a central role even in the new technologies that are \u201carguably the most iconic developments of the industrial revolution,\u201d like the steam engine and interchangeable parts manufacturing. Government investment \u201cin manufacturing and technological progress\u201d was viewed as \u201ca national obligation in a time of political vulnerability.\u201d Just as the United States government\u2019s establishment of Arpanet, the precursor to today\u2019s internet, laid the foundation of the current digital revolution, the British government\u2019s financing of a wide range of technological and organizational innovations \u2014 many directly or indirectly associated with small arms manufacture \u2014 spawned the original Industrial Revolution.On the subject of guns, \u201cEmpire of Guns\u201d seeks to elucidate not only their industrial history but also their social and moral history. To tell these parts of the story, Professor Satia uses the Quaker church\u2019s decision in 1796 to disown the prominent British gun maker, Samuel Galton Jr.On its face, the decision by the Society of Friends to censure a flagrant arms merchant in its ranks may not seem surprising. Pacifist principles were central to Quaker ideology, as was opposition to slavery. Guns fueled not just war but the slave trade. Yet Mr. Galton\u2019s father, and his father before him \u2014 and indeed many other Quakers who long dominated Birmingham\u2019s arms industry \u2014 had been unapologetic gunmakers for 70 years without attracting rebuke. What had changed in the interim, in ways that are deeply interrelated, were society and the guns themselves.Guns, for long after their introduction, were rather clumsy instruments of death. The unpredictability of guns had previously made them more suitable to terrorize than inflict harm. Despite their availability, guns were rarely fired in homicides, in robberies, in riots or even on the battlefield throughout most of the 18th century. But the British government, through enforced standardization and sponsored experimentation, drove \u201ccountless small innovations\u201d that improved gun performance significantly by the end of the century.Enhancements in gun technology increased both their ubiquity and their use in violent human interaction by the end of the 18th century. This, in turn, corresponds with the shifting social and moral meaning of these inanimate objects, which remain so profoundly associated with the \u201cimpersonal, casual violence they enable.\u201dProfessor Satia examines these changes not only across time but across cultures. Although much of this exploration is fascinating, the detail can be numbing. Tracking the exhaustive catalog of Quaker family intermarriages and gun part transactions that characterized the 18th-century armaments trade, for instance, is quite a slog.The biggest disappointment of \u201cEmpire of Guns,\u201d however, is how little detail there is on the history of gun culture in the United States and its deep hostility to government regulation. The contrast with Britain \u2014 and, indeed, all other developed nations \u2014 is so striking that it begs for some kind of explanation, particularly given that Britain was historically more economically reliant on this sector of its economy.Although Professor Satia does include a discussion of the role of guns from the founding of Jamestown in 1607 through the Revolutionary War, she focuses on the use of guns in the colonists\u2019 interactions with Native Americans and various competing European powers. In the last pages of the book, she does include a critique of the historical myths underpinning the sweeping 2008 Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The short discussion is provocative but seems disconnected from her writing on colonial life, which didn\u2019t mention early state gun regulation or the Second Amendment at all: \u201cThe Second Amendment was not about protecting Americans from federal government [gun] seizure; it addressed the practical danger that militias might be disarmed by federal inaction, providing reassurance that if the federal government neglected to arm the militias, state governments might do so.\u201dUnder this view of the framers\u2019 intent, the \u201cissue was not self-defense, but national defense.\u201d Even if Professor Satia is correct about the problem originally targeted by the Second Amendment, \u201cEmpire of Guns\u201d provides few clues as to how or why the focus has shifted so drastically in America over the ensuing centuries.Despite mounting a vigorous public defense, Mr. Galton was ultimately unsuccessful in escaping rebuke from the Quakers. Many of the arguments he proffered have parallels to those made by contemporary gun rights advocates. Professor Satia has shown how the revolutionary changes in the very nature of guns and their role in society and the economy require those arguments to be considered in a very different light. To do that effectively at this time of national debate over our political, social and moral relationship to the modern gun, more work must be done to fully understand the source of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d when it comes to our attitudes toward guns.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "China Strikes Back at the U.S. With Plans for Its Own Tariffs", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China hit back at the United States on Wednesday with proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of American soybeans, cars, chemicals and other goods, in a move likely to stoke fears that the countries\u2019 escalating confrontation could become an all-out trade war.Moving with unusual speed, Chinese officials outlined plans to make it more costly to import 106 types of American goods into China. They are intended to hit the United States square in the farm belt \u2014 a major section of President Trump\u2019s political support but also a major supplier of what China stocks in its supermarkets.\u201cChina has never succumbed to external pressure,\u201d Zhu Guangyao, vice minister of finance, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. He added, \u201cExternal pressure will only make the Chinese people more focused on economic development.\u201dThe question now is whether the two sides will intensify their efforts to punish each other before they sit down to negotiate. Neither set of tariffs go into effect right away, though the exact timing of the Chinese measures was not clear.Letting the dispute turn into a test of wills would be a mistake, said Jie Zhao, a senior research fellow at Fudan University in Shanghai.\u201cWe should negotiate in a professional way,\u201d Ms. Zhao said, \u201cand make it less ideological and emotional.\u201dBy contrast, because the United States imports significantly more from China, tariffs on the same amount of products make up roughly one-ninth of its Chinese imports. That gives the United States more room to find other Chinese products to target.Even as Chinese officials struck a defiant tone on Wednesday, they still said they wanted to avoid escalating the conflict.\u201cChina\u2019s attitude is clear,\u201d Mr. Zhu, the vice minister of finance, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a trade war because a trade war would hurt the interests of both countries.\u201dMany companies in Europe and the United States say they fear the program will create state-supported competitors, an argument that has won backing in the Trump administration. Some companies say that Beijing finds ways to force them to hand over technology if they want to sell their wares in China, an allegation that Chinese officials dispute.For now, China\u2019s new tariffs could create a more immediate issue for the Trump administration.While they include plenty of goods Americans make, they have a heavy focus on products Americans grow: soybeans, corn, cotton, beef, frozen orange juice, even tobacco and whiskey. Many of those products come largely from Republican-dominated states, where lawmakers might be expected to have some influence with President Trump and could therefore persuade him to back down from his latest trade demands.For manufactured goods, the new Chinese tariffs include cars and car parts, plastics, aerospace products and chemicals. Many of those products are also sold by European companies, giving Chinese buyers alternatives. The new tariffs announced on Wednesday will amount to 25 percent on the American products.Chinese officials \u2014 who blamed President Trump for provoking the clash \u2014 have appealed to the World Trade Organization, which sets trade rules and moderates disputes, to resolve the feud. But both sides risk censure by the W.T.O. \u2014 the Trump administration for its tariffs, and China for swiftly retaliating without a proper review.\u201cA key time has come for the United States and China to form a new consensus that includes intellectual property and the opening up of markets,\u201d said Song Guoyou, the deputy chief of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. \u201cOtherwise, trade may fluctuate a lot.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, and Steven Lee Myers from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Trump Voters Driven by Fear of Losing Status, Not Economic Anxiety, Study Finds", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since Donald J. Trump began his improbable political rise, many pundits have credited his appeal among white, Christian and male voters to \u201ceconomic anxiety.\u201d Hobbled by unemployment and locked out of the recovery, those voters turned out in force to send Mr. Trump, and a message, to Washington.Or so that narrative goes.A study published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences questions that explanation, the latest to suggest that Trump voters weren\u2019t driven by anger over the past, but rather fear of what may come. White, Christian and male voters, the study suggests, turned to Mr. Trump because they felt their status was at risk.\u201cIt\u2019s much more of a symbolic threat that people feel,\u2019\u2019 said Diana C. Mutz, the author of the study and a political science and communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where she directs the Institute for the Study of Citizens and Politics. \u201cIt\u2019s not a threat to their own economic well-being; it\u2019s a threat to their group\u2019s dominance in our country over all.\u201dIn her study, Dr. Mutz sought to answer two questions: Is there evidence to support the economic anxiety argument, and did the fear of losing social dominance drive some voters to Mr. Trump? To find answers, she analyzed survey data from a nationally representative group of about 1,200 voters polled in 2012 and 2016.In both years, participants were asked the same wide-ranging set of questions. Party loyalty overwhelmingly explained how most people voted, but Dr. Mutz\u2019s statistical analysis focused on those who bucked the trend, switching their support to the Republican candidate, Mr. Trump, in 2016.Even before conducting her analysis, Dr. Mutz noted two reasons for skepticism of the economic anxiety, or \u201cleft behind,\u201d theory. First, the economy was improving before the 2016 presidential campaign. Second, while research has suggested that voters are swayed by the economy, there is little evidence that their own financial situation similarly influences their choices at the ballot box.The analysis offered even more reason for doubt.Losing a job or income between 2012 and 2016 did not make a person any more likely to support Mr. Trump, Dr. Mutz found. Neither did the mere perception that one\u2019s financial situation had worsened. A person\u2019s opinion on how trade affected personal finances had little bearing on political preferences. Neither did unemployment or the density of manufacturing jobs in one\u2019s area.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t people in those areas that were switching, those folks were already voting Republican,\u201d Dr. Mutz said.For further evidence, Dr. Mutz also analyzed a separate survey, conducted in 2016 by NORC at the University of Chicago, a research institution. It showed that anxieties about retirement, education and medical bills also had little impact on whether a person supported Mr. Trump.While economic anxiety did not explain Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal, Dr. Mutz found reason instead to credit those whose thinking changed in ways that reflected a growing sense of racial or global threat.In 2012, voters perceived little difference between themselves and the candidates on trade. But, by 2016, the voters had moved slightly right, while they perceived Mr. Trump as moving about as far right as Mrs. Clinton had moved left. As a result, the voters, in a defensive crouch, found themselves closer to Mr. Trump.On the threat posed by China, voters hardly moved between 2012 and 2016, but while they perceived both presidential candidates as being to their left in 2012, they found Mr. Trump as having moved just to their right by 2016, again placing them closer to the Republican candidate than the Democratic one.In both cases, the findings revealed a fear that American global dominance was in danger, a belief that benefited Mr. Trump and the Republican Party.\u201cThe shift toward an antitrade stance was a particularly effective strategy for capitalizing on a public experiencing status threat due to race as well as globalization,\u201d Dr. Mutz wrote in the study.Her survey also assessed \u201csocial dominance orientation,\u201d a common psychological measure of a person\u2019s belief in hierarchy as necessary and inherent to a society. People who exhibited a growing belief in such group dominance were also more likely to move toward Mr. Trump, Dr. Mutz found, reflecting their hope that the status quo be protected.\u201cIt used to be a pretty good deal to be a white, Christian male in America, but things have changed and I think they do feel threatened,\u201d Dr. Mutz said.The other surveys supported the cultural anxiety explanation, too.For example, Trump support was linked to a belief that high-status groups, such as whites, Christians or men, faced more discrimination than low-status groups, like minorities, Muslims or women, according to Dr. Mutz\u2019s analysis of the NORC study.What does it matter which kind of anxiety \u2014 cultural or economic \u2014 explains Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal?If wrong, the prevailing economic theory lends unfounded virtue to his victory, crediting it to the disaffected masses, Dr. Mutz argues. More important, she said, it would teach the wrong lesson to elected officials, who often look to voting patterns in enacting new policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump on Syria Strikes: Full Transcript and Video", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump addressed the nation on Friday night about his decision to order strikes on Syria, following a suspected chemical attack. The following is the complete text of his remarks, as prepared by The New York Times.Read here for the latest on the strikes \u00bb______PRESIDENT TRUMP:My fellow Americans. A short time ago, I ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both.Tonight, I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of the Syrian air force.Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians, this time in the town of Douma near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons used by that very terrible regime.The evil and the despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster instead.Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous, not only because they inflict gruesome suffering, but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation.The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States.The combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power: military, economic and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.I also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping and financing the criminal Assad regime.To Iran and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep.No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants and murderous dictators. In 2013, President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. Assad\u2019s recent attack and today\u2019s response are the direct result of Russia\u2019s failure to keep that promise.Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully, someday we\u2019ll get along with Russia and maybe even Iran, but maybe not.I will say this, the United States has a lot to offer with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world.In Syria, the United States, with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS, is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 percent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated.The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment and all of the anti-ISIS effort.Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and others, can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS. America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria, under no circumstances.As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home \u2014 and great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny.No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It\u2019s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place.The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold.By the end of World War I, more than one million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Communist Party Is Abandoning Workers", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHONG KONG \u2014 China is a sea of labor unrest. During the first 10 weeks of this year there were more than 400 publicly reported strikes, more than double the number during the comparable period last year. President Xi Jinping\u2019s government has responded with a firm hand: Labor activists are being arrested and assaulted simply for demanding their wages.Mirroring the recent trend of manufacturing moving from the coasts to the middle of the country, the most labor strife this year appears to be happening in central provinces such as Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui. And the unrest isn\u2019t affecting only traditional industries like manufacturing. White-collar workers and new-economy industries like e-commerce and green tech are also dealing with labor struggles.In January, hundreds of teachers from all over China assembled in Beijing to bring attention to missing pensions and other perks. Last month, workers at a solar power factory in Guizhou Province staged a sit-in, and poorly paid taxi-app drivers protested in Shandong and Guangxi. Medical staff in Hebei demonstrated in February over unequal pay and the nonpayment of social insurance.Labor activists are also organizing online. In Spring 2016, the Walmart Chinese Workers\u2019 Association, an independent group of China employees of the retailer, opposed a change that would have permitted Walmart to schedule long shifts for workers without paying them overtime. The activists used the popular WeChat messaging service to organize strikes that forced their employer to retract the new policy.The fact is that in most strikes Chinese workers are demanding only to be paid wages and benefits that are owed to them, and for their legal right to collective bargaining. Still, why are strikes on the rise?The slowing economy has squeezed manufacturers and service-oriented companies. Many owners have responded by simply not paying workers. Many companies close shop overnight, surprising workers with the closure and the news that they won\u2019t be paid wages that are owed to them. Meanwhile, it appears that workers are becoming more aware of their legal rights to demand pay and benefits.The 2008 China Labor Contract Law, successor to the 1995 China Labor Law, codifies wide-ranging protections for Chinese workers, including the right to collectively bargain. The law was drafted to help raise living standards but has always been unpopular with big business and its political friends. Yet in 2015 President Xi Jinping urged the sole official union, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, to come up with a plan to improve workplace representation.Experts say that five million to six million workers could lose their jobs in the coming years as the economy continues modernizing. If history is any guide, the result of the job losses is likely to be more unrest. And a government that denies hard-pressed workers a legitimate channel to express their grievances is inviting trouble. As strikes continue, workers broaden their demands and are driven to more extreme measures.By ensuring that workers can use their legal right to collective bargaining, the government could help families to share more of the rewards of growth and give a boost to the rebalancing of the economy. This was the story of America\u2019s postwar boom years, when strong unions helped to expand the middle class.The Communist Party should fully embrace its historical claim to representing workers. By enforcing legal protections the party may find that higher household incomes are a solution to slower growth as well as to the country\u2019s more serious ills of unfairness and inequality.Harvey Thomlinson is the author of the novel \u201cThe Strike.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Loss of Union Power Has Hurt American Manufacturing", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWant to make America great again and keep factories in the United States? Try strengthening labor unions.That may seem counterintuitive, and certainly contrary to the direction the country has been moving in lately. But the reality is that when organized labor dug in its heels \u2014 as it did regularly in the United States until late in the 20th century \u2014 manufacturing companies thought twice about shutting a factory and transferring production to another country.As union membership declined, however, so did the political leverage of once nationally-known leaders like John L. Lewis, head of the United Mine Workers, and George Meany, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s first president. Not since the Nixon and Ford administrations in the 1970s has a union leader served in a president\u2019s cabinet as secretary of labor, or in a similar post.Ms. Perkins remained in the post throughout his presidency, which ended with Mr. Roosevelt\u2019s death in 1945, at the start of his fourth term. Social Security came into existence in 1935 partly through her efforts, as did 1938\u2019s Fair Labor Standards Act, which established a Federal minimum wage as well as rules for overtime pay.Union membership grew rapidly during her tenure and continued to do so in the immediate post-World War II decades, reaching a peak in the mid-1960s, when at least a third of all wage-earners in the upper Midwest states belonged to unions. In Michigan \u2014 the quintessential manufacturing state \u2014 the share stood at 45 percent in 1964, or nearly half of that state\u2019s work force. Simply by their numbers, unions had the leverage to slow manufacturers who wanted to build factories abroad.Think about it: A huge amount of what America consumes is made overseas, with the implicit consent of the nation\u2019s now nearly neutered industrial unions. There were just seven strikes that involved at least 1,000 workers in 2017, according to Labor Department records. From 1968 to 1983, in sharp contrast, the total number of strikers across the country fell below 10 million in only one year \u2014 1982. After that period, the annual total exceeded 10 million only three times.In 1983, union membership was 17.7 million \u2014 representing 20 percent of all wage and salary workers. Last year, it was 14.8 million, representing just 10.7 percent of those workers. No wonder President Trump can talk about making America great again and not feel much pressure from organized labor to do much about it.As union membership declines, labor has less leverage to intervene in the management of a corporation, or to galvanize the public into boycotting the products of manufacturers who put too many factories overseas while exporting less from the United States.Strikes work when union membership is high enough to encourage the public to support the strikers, or at least feel a kinship with them. My parents, who lived comfortably on my father\u2019s earnings as a textile broker in New York, never crossed a picket line thrown up by a labor union in pursuit of a favorable contract. They might not have agreed with a union\u2019s demands, or even known what they were. But they respected a strike as an often-necessary tool in reaching a compromise acceptable to both sides.They wanted that compromise. They had been young adults during the Depression, and they did not want to see, once again, the vagrancy and hunger that had been so commonplace \u2014 so visible \u2014 in the 1930s. That sentiment resurfaced for many Americans in 1965, when Cesar Chavez dug in his heels against California\u2019s table grape growers, organizing a strike against them and calling \u2014 successfully \u2014 for a nationwide boycott of their grapes.Mr. Chavez and his cause riveted the nation, and my family and friends stayed away from grapes for weeks. So did millions of others.Or at least they haven\u2019t yet. Perhaps in time new organizations will emerge \u2014 heirs to the old union movement \u2014 and one of their priorities will be to pressure manufacturers quite publicly to put more of their factories in the United States.An earlier version of this column misstated the date of President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. It was 1974, not 1973.Louis Uchitelle, who covered economics for The New York Times for more than 20 years, is the author of \u201cMaking It: Why Manufacturing Still Matters.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Countless studies have demonstrated the physical and psychological health costs for children experiencing poverty.We relied on the latest government data and social science research in making our cost estimates. In particular, we examined the effect that childhood poverty has upon future economic productivity, health care and criminal justice costs, and increased expenses as a result of child homelessness and maltreatment.The bottom line is that reducing poverty is justified not only from a social justice perspective, but from a cost-benefit perspective as well.Investing in programs that reduce childhood poverty is both smart and efficient economic policy.Most of us are familiar with the saying, \u201cAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d It turns out that this is particularly true in the case of poverty.It is not a question of paying or not paying. Rather, it is a question of how we pay, which then affects the amount we end up spending. In making an investment up front to alleviate poverty, the evidence suggests, we will be repaid many times over by lowering the enormous costs associated with a host of interrelated problems.Recognizing the sizable costs of childhood poverty is an important first step toward summoning the political will to address this economic and societal blight. Instead of slashing an already weakened safety net, we should be following the example of most leading countries, which have built effective support systems that prevent poverty. By doing so, we would give our children a much better chance of reaching their full potential, which benefits us all.Mark R.

Perhaps. But it won\u2019t matter. When it comes to Syria, Washington is incoherent and, ultimately, uninterested. Mr. Assad knows this. He also knows that as long as there isn\u2019t prolonged, focused American military action, his regime can survive. He rarely puts himself in real danger. For years, he has carefully balanced his aggression and brutality with strategic patience. This has served him well with the United States; it most likely will again in the latest crisis.Mr. Assad is a careful watcher of the signals from Washington and he understands America\u2019s appetites and anxieties in the Middle East. He likes what he\u2019s seen recently.Given this chaos, contradiction and incoherence, it\u2019s little surprise Mr. Assad feels confident enough to use chemical weapons. In fact, he probably believes he can wait out limited strikes by an ambivalent president. He knows this because throughout the years he\u2019s learned that the United States and its allies don\u2019t have the appetite or commitment to hold him accountable for his serial obscenities. That means he can engage in periodic acts of extreme aggression and wait for the inevitable international outcry and limited backlash to pass.Waiting out halfhearted enemies is a key Assad survival tool.In 2003, Mr. Assad watched the United States invade neighboring Iraq and pull its fearsome dictator out of a hole in the ground. Mr. Assad worried, briefly, that he might be next. But rather than trying to placate the Americans by ending his support for terrorist groups or his alliance with Iran, he instead waited for the United States to exhaust itself in Iraq. (He helped speed up that exhaustion by funneling extremists to Iraq.) Sure enough, the United States not only spared Mr. Assad \u2014 it left Iraq and went home.In 2005, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon was assassinated in Beirut. The Syrian regime and its allies in Hezbollah were suspected. The United States responded with extreme diplomatic pressure, eventually forcing the Assad government to end Syria\u2019s 29-year occupation of Lebanon. But Mr. Assad wouldn\u2019t be so easily discouraged.His government reinfiltrated Lebanon through intelligence assets and local allies. He knew that the United States was growing tired of the Middle East as the Iraq war went sour. So rather than end his interference in Lebanon, he gradually deepened it. An international tribunal investigating the assassination shifted its attention from the Syrian regime to individual Hezbollah members.In 2009, John Kerry went to Damascus and hailed the Syrian president as \u201can essential player in bringing peace and stability to the region.\u201d Mr. Assad had waited out yet another passing storm of Western hostility, which was replaced by outright friendship, without sacrificing his interests in Lebanon.When the civil war began in Syria in 2011, President Barack Obama called on Mr. Assad to step down. At times, it seemed that the United States might even try to make that happen. But Mr. Assad took steps to protect against an American intervention. He allowed the Islamic State to flourish, essentially creating a dilemma for the Americans: Would they rather have the jihadists take over Syria? So long as the Islamic State existed, Mr. Assad was safe \u2014 all he had to do was wait. Not only was he spared, but also the United States obliged him by fighting the Islamic State while letting him continue his war on the opposition unobstructed.As the Islamic State weakened, life grew dangerous again for Mr. Assad. Not only did the group\u2019s defeat eliminate the \u201cAssad or the jihadists\u201d dilemma, but it also coincided with a new administration in Washington that is bent on \u201crolling back\u201d the influence of Mr. Assad\u2019s main ally, Iran. However, despite Mr. Tillerson\u2019s announcement of an indefinite American military deployment in Syria, President Trump soon signaled the United States would beat the Islamic State and get out of Syria.This most likely won\u2019t be the United States\u2019 last word on Syria. The latest chemical attacks could force Washington\u2019s hand once more, leading Mr. Trump to try to prove that his \u201cred lines\u201d matter. If so, Mr. Assad will wait out any American response, knowing it will not aim to endanger his regime\u2019s survival. And then he will resume his conquest of Syria. (Though it\u2019s also possible that the policy machine in Washington is too dysfunctional to decide on and execute a strategy.)American policymakers like to say that Mr. Assad has not won the war because much of Syria is occupied by foreign powers, its economy and cities are in ruins and its regime is an international pariah. But Mr. Assad does believe that he is winning, that he will take his country back eventually and that a wave of airstrikes or cruise missiles will not change that. Who can blame him?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Military Plane Crash Is Algeria\u2019s Worst Air Disaster, With 257 Dead", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 The crash of a military transport plane that killed 257 people on Wednesday was Algeria\u2019s deadliest ever, compounding the woeful air safety record of an insular country where there has been little accountability for such disasters in the past.A Russian-built Ilyushin plane carrying soldiers and civilians slammed into a field moments after it took off from Boufarik military base, about 15 miles southwest of the capital, Algiers. The plane exploded into flames, sending black smoke billowing into the air. Only a handful of people survived.The cause of the crash was not immediately known, and Algeria\u2019s Defense Ministry began an investigation. But there was little prospect of any political repercussions in a country that has come to be seen as the region\u2019s hermitlike giant, hesitant and inward-facing, as its economic and political malaise has deepened.Rich in gas and oil, and the largest country in Africa by size, Algeria should loom large over the region. It avoided the turmoil of the Arab Spring uprisings that engulfed its North African neighbors Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. And it has established itself as a bulwark against Islamist extremism.But in recent years, falling oil prices have driven up unemployment and fostered disillusionment among the young, who account for half of its 40 million people. The president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, is an infirm man in his 80s who is rarely seen in public, resulting in persistent speculation about his health.Experts say that Mr. Bouteflika is a front for what is essentially military rule. The government\u2019s inner workings are notoriously opaque \u2014 which is why some are skeptical that it will provide answers about Wednesday\u2019s crash.The crash occurred just before 8 a.m. when people near the Boufarik base saw flames shooting from one engine as the plane lifted off the runway, private Algerian television stations reported. Seconds later, as the plane reached an altitude of about 1,000 feet, it lurched violently and plunged to the ground.Some onlookers told a private television station that the plane landed on one wing before crashing into a field, where it broke apart and was engulfed in flames.Dozens of ambulances and scores of rescue workers rushed to the scene but struggled to find survivors as strong winds fanned the blaze, officials said. The fire was extinguished after two hours, Lt. Adel Zghaimi, a security official, told state news media. But by then, just a handful of survivors \u2014 no more than five, by most accounts \u2014 had been taken to a hospital for injuries.In the early afternoon, rescue workers laid out long rows of white body bags near the smoldering wreckage. Farouk Achour, a spokesman for the Algerian civil protection agency, told The Associated Press that many bodies showed signs of \u201cdeep burns caused by the fuselage catching fire.\u201dAviation Safety Network, which tracks air accidents, considers the crash to be the 16th worst in history, excluding ground fatalities, according to Harro Ranter, its chief executive. For Algeria it was the ninth aviation disaster in 15 years, counting helicopter and plane crashes, said Mohamed Khelfaoui, a former officer in the Algerian secret service.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said, pointing to the military\u2019s aging fleet as a possible cause.Most of the dead were soldiers and their families, although the toll also included 30 members of Western Sahara\u2019s Polisario independence movement, an official in Algeria\u2019s governing F.L.N. party said. Mr. Bouteflika declared three days of national mourning.Mr. Bouteflika, 81, has been a sporadic presence since 2013, when a stroke left him in a wheelchair and raised questions about his ability to rule. Yet his appetite for power appears undiminished.A rare public appearance on Monday, when Mr. Bouteflika opened a mosque and a metro extension, stoked speculation that he intended to run for a fifth term. Supporters insist he remains strong, even if he requires a microphone to make himself heard.\u201cExcept for his dead voice, he is in good shape and he rules the country,\u201d Lakhdar Brahimi, a retired United Nations diplomat and a friend of Mr. Bouteflika, said in a recent interview.Others say that real power in Algeria lies with the military, which uses civilian leaders as a front for its own interests.\u201cBouteflika has no power. The prime minister has no power,\u201d said Mr. Addi, the academic. \u201cIt\u2019s the military.\u201dAlgerians privately grumble about corruption inside the military, and accounts of crooked deals involving Russian military suppliers are rife. But faced with harsh political repression, most simply shrug their shoulders \u2014 which is why Wednesday\u2019s crash is unlikely to have serious political repercussions.Mr. Bouteflika, who came to power in 1999, is part of a thinning generation of Algerians who fought in the 1954-62 independence war against France, and who continue to exert great influence. Although Algeria has large oil and gas reserves, which account for 60 percent of national income, officials are notoriously averse to foreign interference and have imposed strong controls that critics say have choked the economy.In recent months, teachers and doctors held a series of long strikes to protest their pay and conditions. But some doctors suspended their walkout to treat the plane crash victims on Wednesday, Reuters reported.Officials said the military plane was headed to Bechar in the southwest of the country, but was scheduled to stop in Tindouf, an area on Algeria\u2019s border with the disputed territory of Western Sahara.Algeria is a longtime backer of Polisario, the group that has been fighting for independence for Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara since the 1970s. A military official in Algiers, speaking by phone, said the Polisario members killed in the crash had probably been receiving medical treatment at government hospitals before returning to Tindouf.Until Wednesday, Algeria\u2019s deadliest accident was in July 2014 when an Air Alg\u00e9rie jetliner traveling from Burkina Faso to Algeria crashed in the desert in Mali, killing all 116 people on board, including 54 French citizens. A French investigation into the crash blamed pilot error.In February of that year, an American-built C-130 Hercules transport plane of the Algerian military, carrying 78 personnel and their families, crashed into a mountain in the northeastern province of Oum El Bouaghi during bad weather. One person survived.Reporting was contributed by Adam Nossiter from Paris, Hadjer Guenanfa from Algiers, Nour Youssef from Cairo, and Susan Beachy from New York.Advertisement"}

It will instead encourage them to share more. This, of course, will produce more data for Facebook to mine to its own financial advantage.\u201cDisingenuous is the adjective I had in my mind,\u201d said Alessandro Acquisti, a leading expert on privacy-related behavior at Carnegie Mellon University, when I called to chat about how Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony meshed with his research.\u201cFifteen years ago it would have been legitimate to propose this argument,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it is no longer legitimate to ignore the behavioral problems and propose simply more transparency and controls.\u201dThe phenomenon even has a name: the \u201ccontrol paradox.\u201d\u201cPrivacy control settings give people more rope to hang themselves,\u201d Professor Loewenstein told me. \u201cFacebook has figured this out, so they give you incredibly granular controls.\u201dIt is time that Congress appreciates it, too.The question for members of Congress goes beyond how much Facebook and others may be exploiting our inability to rationally assess the pros and cons of sharing information \u2014 profiting from the difficulty we have measuring the immediate reward of the cute puppy video against the more distant risk of having our data sloshing around the internet for years.Those in the industry often argue that people don\u2019t really care about their privacy \u2014 that they may seem concerned when they answer surveys, but still routinely accept cookies and consent to have their data harvested in exchange for cool online experiences.Professor Acquisti thinks this is a fallacy. The cognitive hurdles to manage our privacy online are simply too steep.This is all pretty novel. The idea of online privacy didn\u2019t exist a generation ago. While we are good at handling our privacy in the offline world, lowering our voices or closing the curtains as the occasion may warrant, there are no cues online to alert us to a potential privacy invasion. It seems foolhardy to think we could determine the boundaries of data collection on our own.Even if we were to know precisely what information companies like Facebook have about us and how it will be used, which we don\u2019t, it would be hard for us to assess potential harms. Could we face higher prices online because Amazon has a precise grasp of our price sensitivities? Might our online identity discourage banks from giving us a loan? What else could happen? How does the risk stack up against the value of a targeted ad, or a friend\u2019s birthday reminder?Members of Congress have mostly let market forces prevail online, unfettered by government meddling. Privacy protection in the internet economy has relied on the belief that consumers will make rational choices. Give them a simple dial to manage their preferences \u2014 and accurate information, in a timely fashion and a big font, about what they are sharing online \u2014 and they will make the right calls to avoid discrimination, protect themselves from predatory behavior and thrive.The more that psychologists and behavioral economists study psychological biases and quirks, the clearer it seems that rational choices alone won\u2019t work. \u201cI don\u2019t think any kind of disclosure or opt in or opt out is going to protect us from our worst instincts,\u201d Professor Loewenstein argued.What to do? Professor Acquisti suggests flipping the burden of proof. The case for privacy regulation rests on consumers\u2019 proving that data collection is harmful. Why not ask the big online platforms like Facebook to prove they can\u2019t work without it? If reducing data collection imposes a cost, we could figure out who bears it \u2014 whether consumers, advertisers or Facebook\u2019s bottom line. That could help set societywide boundaries about what data to collect and what to leave alone.It would no longer be up to confused users to protect themselves.Advertisement"}

It was the moment, investigators say, when a remote-controlled bomb packed with TNT was armed and placed under the driver\u2019s seat of this tiny country\u2019s most famous, and most provocative, journalist.Her son Matthew heard a powerful explosion and felt the windows of the house shake. He raced outside and sprinted barefoot down the long, unpaved drive from their home to the main road, where a column of black smoke churned upward into the autumn sky. Shards of glass and plastic were everywhere, and, most gruesomely, chunks of flesh were strewn on the road, all accompanied by the droning blare of a car horn.He struggled to maintain hope that it was not his mother\u2019s car, until he saw a hubcap with the stylized lion logo of a Peugeot on the ground and could no longer deny what had happened. He stared at the burning hulk that had come to rest in a nearby field. \u201cI expected to see something like the shadow of a person or something, but there was nothing,\u201d Mr. Caruana Galizia recalled in an interview. \u201cIt was just flames.\u201dToday, the once-barren field where the burning wreck of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s car came to rest has sprouted green and lush, dotted with yellow and red spring wildflowers. The men charged with the killing \u2014 the brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, and Vincent Muscat, no relation to the prime minister, who shares the surname \u2014 have pleaded not guilty but have otherwise refused to talk, and they remain in custody.But the police say the three men were tipped off to their imminent arrest, according to evidence gathered in the investigation. Among the allegations the victim\u2019s family passed to investigators is that Mr. Cardona, the economy minister, and two of the suspects in the killing were regulars at the same out-of-the-way bar.In a written response, Mr. Cardona said that the bar, Ferdinand\u2019s, \u201cwelcomes patrons from all walks of life, including other politicians.\u201d He added, \u201cI do not, however, recall having any discussions with any of these individuals, and have definitely never had any meetings with them.\u201dMr. Cardona said that he had not been interviewed in connection with the case. The police have chosen to work their way up from the evidence at the crime scene rather than look for motives in the journalist\u2019s reporting. A person with knowledge of the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter confirmed that the police were not actively looking into whether the crime had been motivated by Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s reporting on politicians. They still have a dozen investigators working on the case \u2014 half of them full time \u2014 while other authorities are combing financial and communications records to try to find links to the killers.Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s family says that the police are content to let the three suspects in custody take the fall without investigating deeper and potentially uncovering wrongdoing by the governing party. They fear that with time, the urgency to uncover why she was killed, and who was behind the attack, has already begun to recede. Six months after her death, neither the bomb maker nor the person or people who wanted her dead have been found.\u201cThere is now a sense of impunity, a culture of impunity,\u201d said Simon Busuttil, the former leader of the opposition Nationalist Party. \u201cSo everyone thinks they can get away with murder,\u201d he added, \u201cperhaps even literally.\u201dIn her years as a muckraking journalist, Ms. Caruana Galizia angered countless people on this island, not to mention an Iranian-born banker, drug-trafficking syndicates and the president of Azerbaijan. Ms. Caruana Galizia was no stranger to threats. In 1995, someone slit her dog\u2019s throat and laid its body on her doorstep. In 2006, unidentified perpetrators stacked five large tires filled with bottles of gasoline against the back of her home and set them ablaze.In an interview she gave to a researcher from the Council of Europe shortly before her death, Ms. Caruana Galizia, 53, described \u201ca climate of fear\u201d in Malta, a country where people were afraid of the consequences of speaking out.\u201cThere have been periods where literally I would feel like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to get a stomach ulcer,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat churning, churning nerves all the time.

Hated by many but read by all, her post about Mr. Cardona had 547,146 page views; Malta has 460,000 people.Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, a former lawmaker who switched from the Nationalist Party to the Labor Party and who was a regular subject of Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s blog, shared a view expressed by many here: that Ms. Caruana Galizia engaged in loosely sourced personal attacks rather than in sober, careful journalism.\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly what\u2019s called a journalistic gem,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of it is mainly insults and denigrating any opponent to her clique.\u201dMr. Orlando also pointed out that Labor, which won elections called after her disclosures about the offshore accounts, had nothing to gain from her death, as it would bring only renewed criticism and attention. \u201cNo one in the political sector of Malta had any interest in her death,\u201d he said.After the murder, foreign law-enforcement experts arrived to help with the investigation. A team from the Netherlands assisted with forensics at the crime scene. The F.B.I. sent a team to analyze cellphone data. Europol, the European Union law-enforcement agency, had people on the ground working with its Maltese counterparts out of a command center set up at Police Headquarters.Significant evidence was gathered from cellphones used to coordinate the bombing, and from surveillance videos linking the three suspects to the killing. But little progress has been made in discovering who was behind them.The inquiry has been hampered by the family\u2019s distrust of the police, which means that investigators have not had the chance to examine her laptop, which might contain clues to who might have betrayed her, or had an interest in silencing her.\u201cDaphne would never have handed over her laptop,\u201d Corinne Vella, Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s sister, said in a statement on Monday. \u201cShe always said, \u2018If anything happens, if the police ever come to the house, I will throw my laptop into a well,\u2019 and she meant it.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt was about protecting her sources.

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Set to Oust Matthias M\u00fcller as C.E.O. After Diesel Scandal", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen is set to oust its chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, as it grapples with a diesel emissions scandal that has cost it billions of dollars, led to the imprisonment of two executives, and scarred the German carmaker\u2019s reputation.Herbert Diess, who is in charge of the company\u2019s flagship Volkswagen brand, was likely to succeed Mr. M\u00fcller, according to two people with knowledge of the internal discussions. The company said earlier on Tuesday that it was considering a leadership change, and a final decision was expected by the end of the week.While there was no obvious trigger for Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s departure at this moment, his efforts to lead the company beyond the 2015 emissions cheating scandal have stalled.The repercussions have continued to multiply, tainting not only Volkswagen but also its rivals BMW and Daimler just as they grapple with an industrywide shift toward electric and self-driving vehicles. Political leaders are pressing the German carmakers to compensate diesel owners who bought cars that turned out to be dirtier than advertised, which could add to the already astronomical cost of the scandal.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.\u201cThis is a chance for Volkswagen to make a change,\u201d said Christian Strenger, the former chief executive of Deutsche Bank\u2019s wealth management division, who is suing Volkswagen because he said it violated its duty to shareholders by failing to be forthcoming about the emissions scandal. But Mr. Strenger said that Mr. Diess would have to \u201chave the guts to clean things up.\u201dVolkswagen is still the target of a wide-ranging criminal investigation that has included searches of Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s offices. However, there has been no new information that would have prompted Mr. M\u00fcller to leave now, said Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the prosecutors in Braunschweig who are conducting the inquiry.German prosecutors have not charged anyone in the Volkswagen case, but they expect to complete their investigation this year. Two former Volkswagen executives, James Liang and Oliver Schmidt, are serving prison sentences in the United States after pleading guilty to charges including conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act.Mr. M\u00fcller was a high-ranking executive involved in product development at the same time that the company was developing the illegal software and deploying it in vehicles. He also worked closely with some of the people under investigation over possible involvement in the emissions scandal. Mr. M\u00fcller has insisted he was ignorant of any wrongdoing, but he has nonetheless faced the accusation that he was part of a system that allowed it to take place.Mr. Diess has a shorter history at Volkswagen than most other members of the management board, but he would nonetheless satisfy the company\u2019s longtime preference for choosing chief executives from within its own ranks. He joined Volkswagen in July 2015 from BMW, where he had been a member of the management board in charge of product development. He has succeeded in improving the profitability of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars like the Golf, Jetta and Passat. The division accounts for most of the cars that Volkswagen sells but is far less profitable than the company\u2019s Audi and Porsche luxury brands.Mr. Diess, who managed factories in Britain for BMW, is much more comfortable speaking English than Mr. M\u00fcller and will have an easier time communicating with investors and media outside Germany. Mr. Diess has also not spent his career steeped in Volkswagen culture and may be in a better position to change it.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.But he will most likely face resistance from entrenched interests within the company. He has already clashed with Volkswagen\u2019s powerful workers council, which has de facto veto power over major decisions.And Mr. Diess must answer to Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the chairman of the supervisory board and former chief financial officer of Volkswagen. Mr. P\u00f6tsch is a confidant of the Porsche family, which via a holding company owns more than half of Volkswagen\u2019s shares. The family, descendants of the man who created the Volkswagen Beetle for Adolf Hitler, has been criticized by shareholders for failing to appoint more independent members of the supervisory board and resisting more sweeping change.The challenges that Mr. Diess faces are considerable. Even now, the diesel scandal continues to corrode Volkswagen\u2019s reputation.In January, The New York Times reported that the company had helped to finance experiments in which monkeys were forced to breathe diesel fumes at a lab in Albuquerque. The exposure of the research caused a furor in Germany and beyond. Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the experiments, the German Parliament debated possible consequences, and animal rights activists demonstrated outside Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg.Volkswagen\u2019s cheating has also had an effect on the wider industry. Diesel was once the most popular engine option in Europe because of its fuel economy. But diesel vehicle sales have been dropping since Volkswagen\u2019s deception was uncovered.Volkswagen\u2019s stock price closed the day 3.1 percent higher, at 169 euros, or about $208, on the news of Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s upcoming departure.Amie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investment Boom From Trump\u2019s Tax Cut Has Yet to Appear", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of costly layoffs and plant closings, things are looking up for the heavy-machinery giant Caterpillar, which forecasts solid global sales growth and increased demand this year. Yet despite the corporate investment incentives at the center of President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, the company\u2019s executives have no plans to supercharge investment or expansion.Caterpillar\u2019s plans for new investment remain low by historical standards. Instead, the company has started using cash to repurchase its own stock as a way to return cash to shareholders, something it hadn\u2019t done since 2015.\u201cWe feel we have the necessary bricks-and-mortar capacity that we need,\u201d Brad Halverson, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a post-earnings conference call last Tuesday.Republicans sold the 2017 tax law as \u201crocket fuel\u201d for American investment and growth, saying that corporations \u2014 flush with cash from lower tax rates \u2014 would channel money back into the economy by building factories and offices and investing in equipment, which would help companies grow and provide winnings for workers.Economists say that may happen as companies readjust their spending plans over the coming months to take advantage of the new law, and they note that it is too early to tell how much the tax law will spread into the broader economy.But, so far, hard evidence of such an acceleration has yet to appear in economic data, which show more of a steady investment roll than a rapid escalation. And while there are pockets of the economy where investment is picking up \u2014 among large tech companies and in shale oil business, for example \u2014 corporate spending on buying back stock is increasing at a far faster clip, prompting a debate about whether the law is returning money to the overall economy or just rewarding a small segment of investors.Data on the gross domestic product, released Friday, showed that business investment grew at a 6.1 percent annual clip during the first three months of 2018, down from 7.2 percent during the first quarter last year. Excluding oil and gas investment, which is particularly volatile, the investment pace grew slightly over the past year.While the first-quarter investment numbers were more robust than they were in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 when a bust in oil prices curtailed a large chunk of American corporate spending \u2014 they weren\u2019t radically different from the roughly 5 percent rate of growth for business investment that has prevailed since 2010.Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who chairs the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, attributed the G.D.P. growth to the tax cuts. \u201cAmericans are better off today than they were 16 months ago,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday. \u201cBusiness investment is strong, wages are growing, and disposable income is climbing thanks to tax reform and pro-growth policies.\u201dAnalysts were more cautious in drawing conclusions.\u201cEven regardless of the tax plan kicker, we would have seen a pickup in business investment,\u201d said Keith Parker, head of United States equity strategy at UBS. Capital spending, he said, \u201ctypically follows profits with a lag.\u201dScott Greenberg, a tax analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, warned that it was \u201calways difficult to identify an economic trend from just one quarter\u2019s data.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, told The Economist in remarks published last week that after the tax cuts passed, corporations \u201cbought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that the money\u2019s been massively poured back into the American worker.\u201d A spokeswoman said Monday that Mr. Rubio\u2019s criticism was that the law could have done more to help working families while also stimulating corporate investment.While overall business investment in the American economy was up 6.1 percent in the first quarter, business spending by the larger corporations included in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 as measured by their announcements of capital expenditures so far this earnings season \u2014 is up 23.5 percent from the first quarter of 2017, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That would be the fastest pace since 2012.Large tech companies are among some of the biggest spenders. Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, nearly tripled its first-quarter capital spending to $7.3 billion on real estate and computing capacity and data centers. Amazon increased investment by more than 40 percent to more than $3 billion as it builds out its network of fulfillment centers.But with roughly a quarter of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported first-quarter results, their spending on buybacks is even higher, up 43 percent from the first quarter of 2017, to $43 billion, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Traditionally when companies have more cash than they think they can invest productively, they return it to shareholders either by paying them cash dividends or by going into the market and repurchasing shares. Those buybacks tend to push the price of a stock up, making shareholders wealthier, at least on paper.Republicans, and some Democratic economists, say this can help the economy, if those shareholders sell their stock and then use their profits to make other investments. But critics argue that buybacks disproportionately benefit the wealthy \u2014 the richest 10 percent of Americans own 84 percent of all stock \u2014 and executives who are often compensated with shares.Boeing said it had bought back $3 billion worth of its stock in the first quarter. (It expects to buy $15 billion over the next two years.) Facebook expanded its plans to buy back its shares to the tune of $9 billion. the appliance maker Whirlpool said it would sell its Brazilian refrigerator compressor business for roughly $1 billion, and then use that money to buy its own shares. The railroad operator CSX said it had bought back more than $800 million in shares in the first quarter, as part of plans to buy $5 billion in shares by the first quarter of next year.As they anticipated a windfall from tax cuts, the nation\u2019s banks increased their pace of buybacks by more than 50 percent last year, to $77.5 billion from $51 billion in 2016, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The 10 largest banks, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, accounted for 70 percent of those buybacks.Republicans have highlighted the buybacks as a boost for the economy, saying they will put money in the hands of investors who will find productive and widespread ways to use it. Many Democrats say those buybacks undermine Republican claims about the tax law and prove the overhaul will reward only corporations and the wealthy.\u201cThe whole theory was to lavish corporations and the already wealthy with tax cuts, and maybe the benefits will trickle down to everyone else,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a floor speech in April. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the balloon burst on that idea, as corporations dedicate an enormous percentage of the tax savings to stock buybacks, and only a sliver to worker compensation.\u201dA recent surge in oil and gas investment is largely a result of the recovery in oil and gas prices and easing of regulations over the last year, rather than incentives put in place by the tax overhaul. Economists believe those incentives \u2014 such as allowing companies to immediately and fully deduct the cost of capital spending in order to lower their taxes \u2014 could help stimulate investment for companies.Verizon, in its quarterly earnings report last week, said it had increased capital expenditures to $4.6 billion in the first quarter, up $1.5 billion from the same period in 2017. But the company plans to stick to its target of spending at most $17.8 billion on investment this year \u2014 a level that has not budged much for the past four years.\u201cI don\u2019t see us having a massive acceleration in capex,\u201d Verizon\u2019s chief financial officer, Matt Ellis, told analysts on its post-earnings conference call.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Car Stolen in Alaska? It Could Be Your Neighbor Chasing the Thief", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANCHORAGE \u2014 When bad stuff happens here in the nation\u2019s wildest state, where the distances are vast and the population low, you can\u2019t always count on government officials swooping in for a rescue. Tales of individuals\u2019 gumption \u2014 trekking the tundra, fighting off bears, starting fires to stay warm \u2014 are as much a part of Alaska\u2019s culture as the midnight sun or the North Star on the state flag.Now, people like Floyd H. Hall are taking that get-it-done, go-it-alone way of life to the city streets, where crime has soared. Rather than waiting for the police or political leaders to slow the sudden wave of stealing, ordinary people are taking matters into their own hands.Mr. Hall, 53, is a soft-spoken snow-removal worker with a slight paunch, a salt-and-pepper beard and a matched set of .45 caliber pistols. In his spare time, he recovers stolen cars in Anchorage, the state\u2019s largest city, to the occasional annoyance of the police and the cheers of just about everybody else.Along the way, he has been shot at by a car thief, cited for reckless driving in pursuit of a stolen car, and celebrated by fans who showed up to his court case wearing \u201cLet Floyd Go\u201d T-shirts. A lawyer has stepped forward to represent him for free as he fights the reckless driving charge.By now, the dispatchers and officers \u2014 even the chief of police \u2014 know him simply as Floyd. By his own tally, he has found and helped return about 75 vehicles so far this year. The authorities in Anchorage say they have not tracked the number of people, like Floyd, who have taken on roles as self-appointed spotters, watchers, trackers or all-around crime fighters, but that they are numerous. Frustration has fueled their energy, and social media has given them tools to coordinate efforts.That is making way for people like John Staser, another civilian crime fighter in Anchorage. Mr. Staser, 60, is a fit-looking retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the co-owner of two sporting goods stores that have been hit lately by increased shoplifting.Not long ago, when Mr. Staser suspected someone had been stealing, he held the culprit with a Taser at a store\u2019s front door until the police arrived. He said he once followed another man on foot for about 45 minutes, trying to talk to him about issues of \u201caccountability for his actions,\u201d even though the stolen goods, valued at about $1,500, had been dropped at the store\u2019s door. Mr. Staser only ended his pursuit after the man desperately waved a $20 bill at a passing motorist, climbed into the car and raced off.Mr. Staser said he knows that he might one day cross a line and put himself at risk. The culprits are almost all much younger than he is, for one thing.\u201cI\u2019ve got to stop chasing these guys,\u201d he said, shaking his head.Anchorage, a city with nearly 300,000 residents, has long had its share of rough edges, including patterns of homelessness and transience, with people here for a while, then gone. In interviews around the city, people said they still felt safe walking around, day or night, but the need to lock doors \u2014 a new imperative here \u2014 has left them unsettled.Anchorage set a record for homicides last year, with 35, though violent crimes overall were up only slightly, according to the F.B.I. Some other American cities have far higher per capita rates of killings, but Alaskans say the uptick in property crime is still palpable.Some people here attribute the rising crime to an increase in opioid addiction and an economic downturn. The state\u2019s unemployment rate, 7.3 percent in February, was the highest in the nation, as the state\u2019s oil industry has sputtered. The State Legislature also overhauled the criminal justice system in 2016, reducing penalties for some property crimes.\u201cThere isn\u2019t just one thing,\u201d Justin Doll, the Anchorage police chief, said. Chief Doll said that new hires have brought the department to its highest staffing ever, with 435 officers, giving him hope that the crime trend can change. Arrests for car theft have also increased, he said, adding: \u201cTo me that suggests we\u2019re starting to have an impact.\u201dSo vehicles are stolen to commit other crimes, the police said, or to live in for a while, or simply as a quick lift. It also means that most stolen cars are eventually recovered and returned \u2014 if worse for wear.\u201cI\u2019ve seen cars stolen, abandoned, then stolen again by somebody else,\u201d Mr. Hall, the stolen car chaser, said.Car thefts have surged in winter, when people start their cars and leave them warming, keys in plain view. That prompted Tracy Lohman and her husband, Tom, to buy a car with a remote that starts their vehicle from inside the house.Karen Stephens, an architect, said everybody knows somebody who has been a victim.\u201cI used to leave my house, my car, everything, open all the time \u2014 all the time,\u201d she said.\u201cEveryone\u2019s got a gun inside their house, you know, so not too many people are concerned about home invasion,\u201d said Blake Quackenbush, a lawyer.Chief Doll said he supports citizen activism like neighborhood watches, but said he worries that more aggressive tactics could drift toward vigilante justice.\u201cNobody is doing this with anything other than good intentions in trying to help keep the community safe, but it\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d Chief Doll said.\u201cWhat I would encourage Floyd or anybody to do is to continue to be active, be a voice for public safety,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when crime actually happens, let us deal with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Markets Reel After U.S. Imposes New Sanctions", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussia paid a price in the financial markets on Monday for its standoff with the West.Investors dumped Russian stocks, bonds and the ruble in the face of new American sanctions and signs of cracks in the relationship between President Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president.The sell-off left Russian stocks down more than 8 percent and sharply raised borrowing costs for some of the country\u2019s most important companies. The ruble dropped more than 4 percent against the dollar, and the price of government bonds fell.The combined effect is that life will be at least a bit more expensive for Russian companies and consumers.\u201cWe\u2019re still dealing with an economy that is run by an authoritarian regime that is very dependent on global oil and oil prices,\u201d said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of downside, and most of it is geopolitical.\u201dOf course, none of this is a grave threat to the Russian economy, or to Mr. Putin, as long as oil prices \u2014 up roughly 25 percent over the last year \u2014 remain relatively high.Since Russia\u2019s military involvement in Ukraine four years ago, relations with the West have corroded to their worst level since the Cold War.Then on Sunday, after a deadly chemical attack, Mr. Trump took a rare swipe at Mr. Putin for his support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.\u201cMany dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cPresident Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad.\u201dA tweet might appear minor, but it signaled to investors that Russia is likely to remain at risk of further sanctions.\u201cAnyone who had hopes that sanctions might be lifted, it\u2019s not happening,\u201d said William Jackson, the senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.Despite Moscow\u2019s rancorous relationship with the United States and Europe, investors have tiptoed back into Russian stocks and bonds over the last year, as the economy proved resilient to the raft of sanctions in recent years.Inflation, which surged after the sharp drop in the ruble in 2014, has declined. After shrinking in 2015 and 2016, the Russian economy grew a modest 1.5 percent last year, thanks to rising global prices for oil. (The oil and gas sector accounts for an estimated 25 percent of the gross domestic product, according to Goldman Sachs.)The new round of sanctions jeopardizes those gains.Companies targeted by the latest round of American sanctions suffered some of the sharpest drops Monday. The shares of United Company Rusal, one of the world\u2019s largest aluminum producers, fell more than 20 percent. The company was included in the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions.The stock sell-off spread to large Russian banks, with Sberbank tumbling 17 percent and VTB 9 percent.The widespread nature of the rout \u2014 battering companies not directly controlled by the Kremlin and roiling the normally resilient bond markets \u2014 is a sign of how nervous investors suddenly are about Russia\u2019s prospects, especially the possibility of sanctions targeting a wider range of people and companies.\u201cIt is very hard to evaluate who is going to be included on the list in the future, if this happens again,\u201d said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets in Moscow. \u201cRussia country risk has increased quite substantially.\u201dAndrew E.

{"Headline": "The Dream of a Republican New Deal", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionMr. Kabaservice is the author of \u201cRule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party.\u201dMany Republican officeholders would like to distance themselves from Mr. Trump, yet they can\u2019t as long as his approval rating from their voters remains sky-high. But these legislators have an alternative: They can rally around Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 vision of a Republican Party no longer bound by unpopular conservative dogma. They could even support a Trump New Deal.Mr. Ryan, who served as Mr. Brownback\u2019s legislative director when Mr. Brownback was a senator, was the Republican Party\u2019s most prominent cheerleader for the Ayn Rand-inspired idea that society\u2019s \u201cmakers\u201d should be lavished with tax cuts while its \u201ctakers\u201d should be deprived of a social safety net. The downfall of Ryanism, and the rise of Trumpism, indicates that the decades-long domination of the Republican Party by ideological conservatism is finally giving way to an outlook that, for good or ill, better reflects the party\u2019s changed base.It\u2019s no secret that the interests of the party\u2019s donor class have been sharply at odds with those of its base. But political parties ultimately have to deliver concrete benefits to their core constituents if they want to retain their support. And politicians have to respond to the needs and hopes of their voters, not just pander to their fears and hatreds.Desperation focuses the mind. As the elections loom, Republicans must resist the impulse to become full-time campaigners instead of legislators. That would only reinforce the public perception of Congress as a dysfunctional mess and incumbents as swamp-dwellers more concerned with their political survival (and self-enrichment) than with the national welfare.Instead, the party should approach the elections under the banner of an ambitious program to bring economic revival to the working class. The starting point for such a program would be Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign-trail commitment to rebuild our decaying national infrastructure \u2014 including the roads, schools, hospitals and other civic assets that have been squeezed by conservative cutbacks.A Republican campaigning on the back of a Trump New Deal could sell himself or herself as someone who shares the values of voters in the economically ravaged American heartland but who also has a real program to address their problems. It would be a lot more persuasive than just touting the magic of tax cuts.The president would relish an initiative built around the most popular parts of his agenda; he might even find it in his self-interest to call Congress into a special session to pass it. Republicans running for re-election could present themselves as loyal to Mr. Trump\u2019s overarching goals while avoiding the president\u2019s toxic tweets and scandals. Democrats would be reluctant to give Mr. Trump a political win heading into the elections, but equally reluctant to offer him a legitimate opportunity to paint them as partisan obstructionists. Entrenched special interests would be outraged by any Republican move toward the economic center, but the Koch brothers and other big donors would still work for Republican majorities to supply the regulatory relief and conservative justices they crave.The idea of a New Deal advanced by Republicans, even as unorthodox a Republican as Mr. Trump, sounds like alternate-reality science fiction. But historically the Republican Party has not been an organization with a fixed identity. Its transformation into a conservative ideological force began to take root only in the 1960s and took half a century to complete. It\u2019s hardly impossible for the party to move toward the economic center while continuing to embrace Trump-style cultural populism.A reborn Republican Party with economic policies oriented toward the working class isn\u2019t beyond imagining. If it succeeded in restoring working-class prosperity, that might also lower the temperature of the culture wars, since economically secure people tend to be less prone to outrage and scapegoating. Such a party might even have considerable appeal to minority voters who currently have little reason to consider it.In all likelihood, Mr. Trump is too divisive and ideologically inconsistent a leader to create a Republican version of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal coalition. But the ongoing transformation of the party under Mr. Trump points toward a future when it is more attuned to the economic needs of working-class Americans \u2014 and more popular than the conservative party that faces ruinous defeat in November.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Another Pence Runs for Congress, His Business Record Raises Questions", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBUS, Ind. \u2014 When you have the best known name in your congressional district and your younger brother is a heartbeat away from the presidency, it is difficult to run a stealth campaign. But Greg Pence is doing a pretty good job of it.Mr. Pence has skipped candidate debates and declined to give interviews or release a public schedule, instead posting after-the-fact campaign snapshots on Twitter or Facebook, often smiling, wearing a red fleece vest with his name on it. His first television ad featured President Trump and did not mention his brother, Vice President Mike Pence.His inspiration for running? \u201cI looked in the mirror and said, \u2018If not me, who?\u2019\u201d he told The Columbus Republic in February in the only extensive interview he has granted.Hardball it is not. Legacy politics it is.Hardly the first candidate to run on a famous name, Mr. Pence, 61, extols two central credentials in his House bid: his service in the Marines and his success as a business executive. But an examination of his record in business shows decidedly mixed results. He was the president of a convenience store chain \u2014 making key strategic decisions \u2014 that filed for bankruptcy protection and was assessed penalties of $8.4 million by the State of Indiana for environmental damage, caused primarily by leaking underground storage tanks.A local bank, where he also served on the board of directors, was forced to sue him to recover $3.8 million in debts that he had personally guaranteed, only to have to settle for pennies on the dollar.But when he needed a second chance, one seemed to be waiting for him.Mr. Pence\u2019s race in a safely Republican district where he has lived most of his life \u2014 stretching from the far eastern suburbs of Indianapolis to Muncie in the north and the Kentucky line to the south \u2014 shows the durable power in politics of a famous name and insider connections even in an outsider era.The older Mr. Pence has the same white hair, genial bearing and deeply conservative politics of his brother, and his campaign is tethered to the Trump administration. He pledges to help advance Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda in Congress. The vice president held a fund-raiser for him at the Trump International Hotel in Washington recently, and Donald Trump Jr. will headline another later this month in New York.The race is Mr. Pence\u2019s first for public office, and he has largely avoided attention and scrutiny. But that strategy will be tested as the Republican primary on May 8 approaches. He faces at least one serious challenger, Jonathan Lamb, who has put more than $800,000 of his own money into the race and calls himself a serial entrepreneur. He said Mr. Pence\u2019s run smacked of nepotism.\u201cNo amount of money in the world can buy the name ID that Pence has,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cBut with name ID, you step on toes. People don\u2019t want to see this dynasty, like the Kennedys and Bushes.\u201dMr. Pence has never displayed the political ambitions of his brother, who was elected in 2000 to the House seat that he now seeks, then Indiana\u2019s governor in 2012, before joining Mr. Trump\u2019s ticket in 2016. The elder Mr. Pence\u2019s campaign says he is \u201cready to serve again,\u201d a reference to his enlistment in the Marines in 1979 after he graduated from Loyola University in Chicago.He also highlights his business experience, which he said showcased how he cared for his employees, putting their interests ahead of his own. His most prominent position was when he served as president of Kiel Brothers Oil Company from 1998 until 2004.Kiel Brothers was a growing family business in Columbus when its founder, Carl Kiel, asked Edward Pence, the father of Greg and Mike, to join the company in 1965. They sold fuel to service stations, then eventually went into the convenience store business, which grew to more than 200 outlets, primarily in Indiana and Kentucky, mostly under the name Tobacco Road.\u201cWant a smoke, a Coke or a tank of gas? Kiel Brothers Co. is there to serve you,\u201d a company description in Hoover\u2019s said. The company prospered, building a corporate headquarters in Columbus, where it held a place of esteem.When Mr. Pence died in 1988, the Kiel family turned to Greg Pence to join the business. Mr. Pence steadily took on more responsibility until he became president in 1998. With that came other obligations to the company, and he and a younger member of the Kiel family, Theodore, each signed personal guarantees to the local Home Federal Bank to obtain loans to continue to expand.A year later, Mr. Pence was named to Home Federal\u2019s board of directors. As he was becoming a more prominent member of the Columbus business community, Mike was a rising power in the Republican Party.Mr. Pence signed another guarantee in 2001, records show, promising to repay any outstanding debts from his personal assets if the need arose.Three years later, it did \u2014 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, facing $100 million in claims from creditors.At the next regular board meeting of the bank, with the officials seated around a wooden conference table, Mr. Pence told them about the bankruptcy and said he would not be able to honor his personal guarantee to repay company loans. He acknowledged the obvious conflict of interest, board members said, and resigned from the board.He had resigned abruptly from the company as well, leaving the restructuring work to the chief financial officer, David E. Roll, who, bank officials said, worked tirelessly, sometimes until midnight, trying to keep the company afloat. Attempts to reach Mr. Roll were not successful.That is not how former bank and company officials said Mr. Pence acted when it mattered most. While businesses fail all the time, said one former bank official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, such failures reveal the character of those involved, and Mr. Pence had \u201cbailed.\u201dAnother bank board member, Harold Force, who runs a construction company in Columbus, had no criticism of Mr. Pence, but acknowledged the consequences of the failure of a homegrown company that he described as a \u201cpillar\u201d in the town of 46,000 in southern Indiana.\u201cWhen a company like that comes to an end, there are probably a lot of loyal people who are let down in some ways, heartbroken in some cases,\u201d Mr. Force said, adding, \u201cI think everybody regrets that.\u201dJay Jaffe, a lawyer in Indianapolis who represented the company in the bankruptcy proceedings, defended Mr. Pence\u2019s actions. \u201cI would not say he ran away because he wanted to run from a bad situation,\u201d Mr. Jaffe said. \u201cHe stuck around for a long time to try to make the situation work.\u201dKyle Robertson, the spokesman for Mr. Pence\u2019s campaign, said in a statement that \u201cprior to his departure, Mr. Pence negotiated and secured a KERP (Key Employee Retention Plan) that would help employees going through the eventual transition. Mr. Pence voluntarily forfeited his KERP when he resigned.\u201dThe account of Mr. Pence\u2019s actions and the bankruptcy is based on interviews with a half- dozen former bank officials and others with ties to the company, along with a review of hundreds of pages of court records, including in the bankruptcy case. One of the creditors in the case was the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, which said that the company had caused $8.4 million in damage to the state.In a separate legal action, Mr. Pence also refused several attempts from the bank to collect money based on his personal guarantee, forcing the institution to go to court.Pence campaign officials defended the candidate\u2019s actions.\u201cMr. Pence chose to resign in order to pursue other opportunities,\u201d Mr. Robertson said in response to written questions. \u201cEveryone knows the oil and gas industry changed rapidly in the 1990s and early 2000s, and many small, independent companies like Kiel Brothers were not able to survive because of the national consolidation.\u201dRecords from the Superior Court in Indianapolis show that Home Federal Bank won a $3.8 million civil judgment against Mr. Pence to satisfy the personal guarantees. But former bank officials said he settled the matter for a small fraction of that amount. In contrast, Theodore Kiel lost his primary residence as part of his effort to satisfy his guarantee.Mr. Robertson declined to discuss those actions except to say that they were unrelated to bankruptcy court action against the company. Those \u201cpersonal guaranty liens\u201d were \u201creleased after being satisfied,\u201d Mr. Robertson said.The Indiana Department of Environmental Management claim against the company was withdrawn after insurance payments and remediation efforts. Mr. Robertson said that Mr. Pence played no role in settling the action brought by the state.Six months after Mr. Pence resigned from the bankrupt company, the state\u2019s governor at the time, Mitch Daniels, seemed to offer him a lifeline, appointing him deputy commissioner of the same state environmental agency that had sued his company. But Mr. Pence stayed in the job at the agency, known as IDEM, for only two and a half months.\u201cGovernor-elect Mitch Daniels asked Mr. Pence to help with transition work at IDEM,\u201d Mr. Robertson said, later adding, \u201cThere was never a discussion how long Mr. Pence would stay.\u201dMr. Pence and his wife now own two antique malls in southern Indiana, valued at between $5 million and $25 million, according to financial disclosure statements he filed with the House in January.Mr. Lamb, his opponent in the primary, said he could draw a sharp contrast between his business success and Mr. Pence\u2019s record. \u201cI\u2019m an entrepreneur and have had success,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cHe was handed a very large corporation that he ran into the ground.\u201dWhile Mr. Pence\u2019s business record may become one focus of the campaign, his hearty endorsement of the Trump agenda could provide another.Columbus is a rare Rust Belt town that continues to have a thriving manufacturing economy, with an unemployment rate of 2.7 percent. Its downtown is bustling with small businesses, and its modern architecture has drawn international acclaim.A Brookings Institution study last year ranked Columbus as the No. 1 metro area measured by exports as a share of local gross domestic product \u2014 50.6 percent. As such, it is heavily exposed to the kind of wild trade gyrations that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies have generated.The district also has a large agricultural presence that could be hurt by them as well. \u201cWe can\u2019t be getting into a tariff war over soybeans,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cThat\u2019s why people are looking for someone who can be their voice.\u201dWhen asked about the Brookings study, Mr. Robertson replied, \u201cMr. Pence supports the Trump administration in its defense of American companies who have been subjected to decades of illicit trade practices and unfair policies.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Facebook reports earnings\u2022 Twitter\u2019s strong results were driven by an impressive performance overseas.\u2022 The fight is on for Sky.\u2022 Why investors are feeling blue.\u2022 What\u2019s behind the fight over an important banking regulation.- Peter Eavis\u2022 Net income rose 63 percent to $4.99 billion, up from $3.06 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $1.69. Analysts expectations of $1.35 per share.\u2022 Revenue jumped 49 percent to 11.97 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $11.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Mobile advertising revenue rose 50 percent to $11.8 billion.\u2022 Facebook now has 1.45 billion daily users worldwide\u2022 Daily active users in the U.S. and Canada rose to 185 million in the first quarter.\u2022 Facebook added about 70 million monthly users during the quarter.\u2022 Monthly active users in the U.S. and Canada increased to 241 million\u2022 It now has 2.2 billion users.\u2022 Average revenue per user rose to $5.53 from $4.23 a year ago.\u2022 Cost of revenue came in at 16 percent, compared with 14 percent during the first quarter of 2017.Twitter on Wednesday posted strong first-quarter results that were driven by an impressive performance outside of the United States. But anyone wanting to assess where the stellar foreign growth came from \u2013 and whether it can continue \u2014 would have little company data with which to work.Twitter on Monday did not break down international revenues by region. It did say that Japan, its second largest source of revenue, brought in $117 million, a 61 percent increase. Facebook, in contrast, releases revenue and user numbers for four regions. That Twitter offers limited international data is perhaps not that surprising, given that the company does not release a tally for daily active users, a number Facebook provides. (Twitter does release a growth number for daily users but only provides an actual total for monthly active users.)Twitter\u2019s revenue trends may at some point prompt it to divulge more. Foreign advertising revenue accounted for half its sales in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent in the same period a year ago.Ned Segal, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer, on Wednesday said the strength of international revenue could mean that they account for more than half of the total. In the first quarter, foreign ad revenue surged 51 percent, compared with the year-earlier period. In the United States, the increase was just 1 percent.Mr. Segal did mention some first-quarter \u201chighlights\u201d for the international operations. A good ad sales performance and audience growth powered Japan\u2019s results, he said, adding that ads outside of China for Chinese exporters were also a source of strength. Britain, Brazil and the Middle East were also bright spots, Mr. Segal said.Twitter\u2019s stock slid on Wednesday despite the good numbers. With a little more clarity, investors may be willing to give them more weight.- Peter EavisComcast has formally bid nearly $31 billion for the European broadcaster. Sky has withdrawn its recommendation of Fox\u2019s year-and-a-half-old bid for full control.What\u2019s next?Keep these dates in mind\u2022 On May 1, Britain\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, is expected to offer its recommendation on whether Fox\u2019s bid should allowed to go through.\u2022 By June 13 or so, Britain\u2019s culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, is expected to make a final decision on Fox\u2019s offer.In the meantime, Comcast is working to obtain regulatory approvals for its own bid. Given the American telecom giant\u2019s relatively small presence in Britain, that shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPutting together a nearly $31 billion takeover requires a fair amount of help. Here\u2019s who\u2019s working for Comcast and Sky \u2014 and Fox, which may come back with a higher bid.Comcast\u2022 Robey Warshaw, the small boutique investment bank run by \u201cthe two Simons.\u201d Both Mr. Robey and Mr. Warshaw are on the deal.\u2022 Evercore Partners, led by co-founder Roger Altman and senior deal maker Eduardo Mestre\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch (which is working as corporate brokers, a peculiarly British function that is something like relationship banking and market surveillance), led by Adrian Mee, a global co-head of M.&A., and Tim Waddell, a vice chairman of corporate and investment banking for Europe and a veteran corporate broker.\u2022 Wells Fargo, led by Stephen Locke, a managing director.Sky\u2022 Morgan Stanley (financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Simon Smith, head of investment banking in Europe; Anthony Zammit, a managing director; and Ben Grindley of corporate broking.\u2022 PJT Partners, led by partners Simon Lyons and Scott Matlock.\u2022 Barclays (as financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Mark Astaire, chairman of corporate broking and Richard Taylor, co-head of investment banking.Fox\u2022 Centerview Partners, led by co-founder and longtime Fox adviser Blair Effron and partners David Cohen and James Hartop\u2022 Goldman Sachs, led by investment banking co-head and longtime Fox adviser John Waldron; Mark Sorrell, head of M.&A. for EMEA (and a son of Martin Sorrell); and managing directors Mike Smith and Owain Evans\u2022 JPMorgan Chase, led by Jennifer Nason, global chairwoman of T.M.T.; Hugo Baring, co-head of T.M.T. banking for EMEA; Marco Caggiano, a managing director; and Dwayne Lysaght, head of U.K. M.&A.How the offers stack up:\u2022 Comcast: \u00a312.50 a share, and pledges to maintain Sky News\u2019s independence\u2022 Fox: \u00a310.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t yet own. (Disney, which had already agreed to buy the bulk of Fox in a separate deal, has also offered to buy Sky News to satisfy editorial independence concerns.)Financial companies are on the brink of having one of their top demands granted: an end to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s public database of complaints about their products and services.What\u2019s in the databaseWhy finance institutions want it shut downThey say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.Why consumer groups say that could be problematicConsumer groups argue that taking the database offline would neuter one of its core purposes: pushing companies to take complaints more seriously.More than 185,000 complaints to the bureau have been resolved with some form of compensation or relief, often with financial institutions changing their practices or making customers whole.The social media company became the latest firm to easily beat expectations, only to have its shares tumble.If those stock moves sound familiar, that\u2019s because similar moves happened at 3M and Caterpillar on Tuesday. Despite meeting expectations, 3M tumbled after it lowered the high end of its outlook. Caterpillar, meanwhile, raised its guidance for the year, but comments on its conference call that the first quarter would be the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for earnings per share sent the stock sliding.Why such big moves? It\u2019s worth pointing back to what DealBook\u2019s Peter Eavis wrote Tuesday:\u201cDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.\u201dIn the case of Twitter, the stock is up about 30 percent this year and more than 75 percent since late October. A rally like that leaves little room to disappoint.Wall Street executives are eagerly awaiting a relaxation of the supplemental leverage rule, which governs how much their firms can borrow. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency are for it; the F.D.I.C. and Lael Brainard, an Obama administration appointee at the Fed, are opposed.Why relax the rule? It\u2019s making it too hard for banks to do business. \u201cThe best analogy is that it\u2019s like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,\u201d Greg Baer of the Clearing House Association told Peter.Why keep it? The rule provides adequate protection in case there\u2019s another downturn, and banks have been doing fine otherwise. \u201cU.S. bank lending has been healthy over recent years and profits are strong,\u201d Ms. Brainerd said in a speech last week.\u2022 There are more Republican senators and Democratic governors named John than there are women in either group.\u2022 There are almost as many C.E.O.s named John in the Fortune 500 as female C.E.O.s in that group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Open Thread: This Week in Style News", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpen ThreadHello and happy Friday. Today\u2019s conversational topic is what my peers and I used to call \u201cused clothing,\u201d also known as secondhand clothing and occasionally consignment, which then became vintage clothing, but which is now apparently officially known as the Resale Market.You know something is a big deal when it becomes its own market. Time to pay attention!After all, I mean \u201cbig\u201d literally: According to a report released last week by thredUP, a resale site that is part of this emerging Resale Market, the whole used clothing sector in the United States alone could reach $41 billion by 2022. Nine million more of us bought used clothing in 2017 than in 2016. That\u2019s a lot of new chickens.I also think it is a really good thing.(By the way, thredUP resold 340,000 pieces from fast-fashion brands last year.)Given the growth of resale, you have to wonder why every brand doesn\u2019t do the same, instead of letting another retailer profit from their brand name. Just imagine the possibilities. Louis Vuitton Reluxe? Gucci Re-naissance?It seems like an obvious brand extension. I\u2019d shop there. Wouldn\u2019t you?So what\u2019s a frustrated person to do?One colleague suggested carefully picking the label out with embroidery scissors, though noted that this doesn\u2019t always help when the edges are rolled. In the search for an answer I emailed Herm\u00e8s, the silk scarf experts, to see what they advised. Their answer pretty much boiled down to \u201cdon\u2019t,\u201d but if you have to, use \u201cgreat care\u201d and \u201cnail scissors.\u201d You can also, interestingly, bring any Herm\u00e8s scarf to an Herm\u00e8s store, and the tailors there will remove it for you, a service that suggests they have a certain number of clients who request this.However, given that Herm\u00e8s scarves are not in the cards for most of us, I also wanted to pass on another solution, which may be the best one, though it does require a bit of work (and organization).It came from Cameron Silver, the founder of the Los Angeles vintage store Decades, who acknowledged that a scarf without a label could lose 30 percent of its resale value (they then say it is \u201cattributed to\u201d X brand) UNLESS you do \u201cwhat some die-hard fashionistas do: Delicately remove the label, place it in an envelope with either a photo of the item or a written description of the item, and create an actual fashion file. Think of it as the Dewey Decimal system of fashion.\u201dThen, when you want to resell the scarf, you just bring the envelope with the object. Voil\u00e0! \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMANAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Fills Trump\u2019s Empty Seat at Latin America Summit", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr.\u00a0Serrano, a native of Chile, has written extensively\u00a0about Latin America.Vice President Mike Pence may be taking President Trump\u2019s place at the Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru, on Friday, but the vacuum left by the United States\u2019 steady retreat from the region was filled, much earlier, by China.China\u2019s soft power is perhaps most visible at the southern edge of Argentina, in Santa Cruz province. This pristine Patagonian terrain, home to glacial lakes and one of Argentina\u2019s last free-flowing rivers, has also become home to bulldozers and cranes made by Shantui, the Chinese construction giant. The machines are excavating the area around the Santa Cruz River to build two hydroelectric dams, financed by $4.7 billion from the China Development Bank and built by China Gezhouba Group with partners from Argentina. When completed, the dams will flood roughly 116,000 acres, generating 5 percent of the country\u2019s energy needs and an estimated 5,000 local jobs.The Santa Cruz project is just one of the $141 billion in loan commitments China made to Latin America from 2005 to 2016. China\u2019s lending now surpasses lending from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.But China, unlike those agencies, isn\u2019t putting short-term conditions on those loans or pushing for austerity measures. Instead, its interest in Latin America is part of a long strategic game, an effort to assert its influence around the world, quench its need for raw materials and control the flow of global trade through Chinese-funded transportation hubs.While the United States has been retreating from its southern neighbors for years, Mr. Trump has added outright hostility to neglect. Five months after taking office, he reversed Barack Obama\u2019s historic overtures to Cuba and stifled United States business ties with the country, a move perceived as potentially devastating for the island\u2019s private sector. Threats to blow up Nafta, cut aid to Honduras and Colombia, and militarize the United States border with Mexico have underscored Mr. Trump\u2019s contempt.The message is not lost on Latin America, and it is much louder than anything Mr. Pence may say in Lima, where he is expected to argue that the United States, not China, is Latin America\u2019s preferred trading partner. He may also announce some progress on a renegotiated Nafta.United States influence in the region lingers, of course. The United States remains Latin America\u2019s largest trading partner. Despite the pivot to China, certain countries have resisted its dominion, wary of China\u2019s thirst for raw materials and its lax environmental standards. President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, breaking from his predecessor, has sought warmer ties with the West. And however strong Mr. Trump\u2019s xenophobic rhetoric may be, Latin America is intimately tied to the United States by immigration. Remittances from the states to the region amounted to $74 billion in 2016, a 7.4 percent increase from the previous year.This is a good moment for a few friendly gestures. Some of China\u2019s splashiest megaprojects, including a transcontinental railway from Brazil to Peru, a high-speed railway in Mexico and an interoceanic canal project in Nicaragua, have run into trouble. Germany has already emerged as a potential investor in the stalled Brazil-Peru railway.Meanwhile, Chinese firms have begun to expand into sectors other than natural resources and transportation, particularly into energy infrastructure projects in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador, as China makes good on Xi Jinping\u2019s pledge to deliver $250 billion in direct investment and $500 billon in bilateral trade by 2025.Mr. Xi has backed that lofty promise by visiting Latin America three times in his first three years in office. The Chinese president doesn\u2019t have a seat at the table for the Summit of the Americas, but he doesn\u2019t really need one.Alfonso Serrano is an independent journalist who writes frequently about Latin America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Turf Battle Threatens to Delay Tax Law Rollout", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A power struggle between two of President Trump\u2019s top cabinet members threatens to delay implementation of the new tax law and could give lobbyists and political hands in the White House greater ability to shape critical decisions about which types of businesses benefit from the law.The White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, headed by Mick Mulvaney, and the Treasury Department, run by Steven Mnuchin, are at odds over whether to end Treasury\u2019s traditional independence in writing tax regulations and to give the budget office more oversight of those rules. If an agreement is not reached soon, the president may have to weigh in and make the decision himself.Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney, who are among Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic lieutenants, have largely been in sync on the shape and direction of the tax law. Both supported lowering corporate taxes and using the tax code to discourage companies from shifting operations overseas.Where they differ, however, is over who has the ultimate authority to interpret the many lingering questions that will need to be answered in the coming months and years, including which types of companies qualify as \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses eligible for the 20 percent deduction and how broadly the international tax provisions aimed at preventing profit shifting should apply.The Treasury Department, which issues tax regulations through the Internal Revenue Service and offers guidance that dictates how the tax code is applied, will have broad discretion in determining the effects of the law. It has long been exempt from the type of cost-benefit analysis that the Office of Management and Budget performs on most rules that government agencies issue.Some congressional Republicans are rooting for Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s office to wield greater oversight of the tax law, in the hopes that it would push for the most lenient interpretations of regulations that enable the largest number of businesses to pay lower rates under the law. Other lawmakers and business groups are pulling for Mr. Mnuchin, believing that adding review by the Office of Management and Budget could slow down the creation of regulations that businesses say they need to make investment and tax planning decisions this year.Mr. Mulvaney has taken the view that tax regulations issued by the Treasury are of significant economic importance and that decisions that determine the fate of hundreds of millions of dollars are being made without sufficient scrutiny by his office. The budget office analyzes regulations issued by agencies across the federal government, with its Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs determining whether agencies have sufficiently addressed problems during rule-making and either accepting regulations or sending them back to be reworked.The Treasury Department does consult the budget office on some of its rule-making, but since a 1983 memorandum of understanding, the office has not had the authority to review the Treasury\u2019s tax guidance, on the theory that it is not economically significant enough to warrant it.Greater accountability, however, could come with costs.If Mr. Mulvaney wins the argument, \u201cit will slow the process down,\u201d said John A. Koskinen, a former I.R.S. commissioner whose term ended last year. \u201cIf you had all the regulations coming out of Treasury and I.R.S. subject to more review and delays, it would not be making taxpayers, accountants and lawyers happy. They are pushing to get that information as quickly as they can.\u201dSince the passage of the tax bill late last year, negotiations between Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney have grown increasingly vigorous, with both sides laying claim to being the law\u2019s final arbiter.A change would be seen as a win for Mr. Mulvaney, who has made deregulation a priority in the White House. It would also be a blow to Mr. Mnuchin, who has been the tax bill\u2019s most public defender on behalf of Mr. Trump, diminishing his department\u2019s authority under his watch.The potential change in regulatory oversight could have major implications, both logistical and political.Adding a cost-benefit analysis by the budget office into the process would potentially add another layer of red tape \u2014 which Mr. Trump famously hates in other areas of regulation \u2014 to a process that is already proceeding too slowly for many business groups\u2019 liking. Treasury officials are concerned that the budget office lacks the resources and tax expertise to properly assess tax guidance and that the process will get bogged down, potentially delaying rules to clarify the law for months. One early hurdle would be hiring; the budget office does not currently employ its own team of tax lawyers.\u201cThere\u2019s a moderate level of concern that it could potentially slow down the guidance process,\u201d said Ken Spain, a partner at CGCN Group, a lobbying firm with a number of tax-related clients. \u201cAny time you blur the lines on what is already a tricky process to navigate, it\u2019s going to give the business community some degree of heartburn.\u201dOfficials from previous administrations also say that opening the tax regulation effort beyond Treasury would invite not just comments from the budget office, but from the White House political team and other advisory groups in the government.\u201cMidlevel political appointees get their fingers in there, find out when the meetings are and have their opinions,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution who served in President Barack Obama\u2019s Treasury Department.Such an expansion, Mr. Looney said, also offers more avenues for lobbyists to press their case for why their clients should receive more preferable tax treatment. \u201cThe swamp is going to be enriched by this one,\u201d he said.Budget office officials say the desire for final oversight over the tax bill is in line with the administration\u2019s deregulatory push and that a more uniform approach to rule-making would benefit the federal government. They point to a 2016 Government Accountability Office report concluding that the agreement that has made Treasury an exception is outdated and that the department has been inconsistent in documenting its guidance process.Republican leaders in Congress have walked a delicate line as the dispute plays out. Julia Slingsby, a spokeswoman for Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said last week that Mr. Brady \u201cappreciates the different, complementary roles that O.M.B. and Treasury play with respect to tax code regulations.\u201d\u201cThe Ways and Means Committee has partnered with Treasury on developing the pro-growth tax reform legislation and we look forward to it continuing the partnership as Treasury and O.M.B. do their work on the regulations,\u201d she said.Administration officials have suggested that a compromise could be reached within weeks.\u201cWe have been working productively with O.M.B. and are very pleased with the process,\u201d said Tony Sayegh, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury. \u201cWe look forward to a resolution in the near future.\u201dMeghan Burris, a budget office spokeswoman said, \u201cWe do not discuss ongoing, pre-decisional processes and negotiations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Brexit Vote, Town\u2019s Nostalgia for Seafaring Past Muddied Its Future", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "Branded \u201cidiots,\u201d residents of Grimsby, England, choose romance for a dying fishing industry over another that is thriving.Supported byGRIMSBY, England \u2014 There aren\u2019t a lot of fishermen left in this town in North East England, once home to one of the largest fleet of trawlers in Britain. But nostalgia for the fishing industry permeates the place. So the result seemed inevitable when 70 percent of residents voted to leave the European Union. Britain\u2019s fishermen have complained for years about regulations imposed on all members. The surprise came later when a local business group began lobbying to avoid tariffs, customs and the other burdens of departing the European Union. Social media scorn ensued. In thousands of tweets across the country, the people of Grimsby were derided as dummies and hypocrites. Either they wanted the upsides of Brexit with none of its costs, or they didn\u2019t grasp the harm that leaving would cause until it was too late.\u201cGrimsby residents branded \u2018idiots\u2019 for Brexit vote as seafood industry seeks free trade deal,\u201d read a headline in a local newspaper.\u201cSome industries that are economically insignificant have enormous public resonance,\u201d said Bronwen Maddox, director of the Institute for Government, an independent think tank in London. \u201cAnd because of that, they have political influence that is way out of proportion.\u201dIt isn\u2019t fishermen who are pushing for a kind of exemption from Brexit. It is a group of fish processors, an industry that is thriving in Grimsby, where fish from all over the world are gutted, packaged and sold to wholesalers. This town of around 88,000 is a hub in a global supply chain.\u201cWe haven\u2019t fished here for 25 years,\u201d said Simon Dwyer, who leads Seafood Grimsby & Humber Group, the organization arguing for a special free trade deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve reinvented ourselves.\u201dThe once-bustling docks here would be pretty desolate were it not for 70 processing warehouses with some 5,000 employees, about one-third of whom are foreign nationals, mostly Poles and Lithuanians. To stay competitive, these companies want the kind of frictionless trade and immigration policy that they currently enjoy, and will probably lose, after Brexit.The goal of fishermen, on the other hand, is regaining full control of British waters so that they aren\u2019t forced to compete with trawlers from other countries.The first problem with this dream is the scarcity of local fishermen. Today, there are not enough here to fill a service elevator.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past 20,\u201d said John Hancock, a skipper with three decades of experience and a fan of Brexit. \u201cAnd most of them are retired or dead.\u201dSo how did the interests of a tiny, shrinking industry defeat a larger, thriving one at the polls? While active fisherman here are nearly extinct, the job maintains an almost folkloric hold throughout Britain. Brexit passed for a complex variety of reasons in Grimsby and elsewhere, including fears about immigration, sovereignty and the loss of a way of life. All of those factors played a role here and will privilege a moribund industry at the expense of one that is growing.A similar calculus is evident in the United States, where President Trump has promised to resuscitate coal mining. It\u2019s an industry that now employs roughly 55,000 people, a figure that has been trending downward for years. If economic agendas were driven strictly by data, a lot more would be heard about solar power, which employs about five times the number of people.In Grimsby, the fishing past is very much alive. Pubs are filled with sepia-toned photographs of the town in its 1950s heyday, when 500 boats were crammed into what was then one of the largest ports in the world. Locals speak wistfully about the work of their fathers, taking an almost perverse pleasure in underscoring the hardships that were part of their lives.\u201cWhen I was a kid, I hardly saw my dad for 20 years,\u201d said Steve Swallow, a port operative who was having a drink at the JD Wetherspoon pub one recent afternoon. \u201cHe used to go to Iceland, Norway, the Arctic Circle, and that\u2019s like a month\u2019s trip.\u201dOn occasion, these voyages yielded no income at all. The owners of trawlers were always paid first, and when hauls weren\u2019t large enough, fishermen went home empty-handed. It was known as \u201clanding in debt.\u201d\u201cYou needed a cup of sugar,\u201d Mr. Swallow said, \u201cyou\u2019d go ask your neighbor.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a recording of an actual BBC broadcast,\u201d said Dave Ornsby, the center\u2019s operations officer. \u201cThirty-two ships from Grimsby sank in the \u201950s.\u201dApparently, none of this work or lifestyle appeals to British youths.\u201cYou can\u2019t get young people to fish these days,\u201d said Danny Normandale, a skipper with three decades of experience. \u201cIf you say to them, \u2018I\u2019ll take you if you\u2019re willing to learn,\u2019 their next question is, \u2018Do you have Wi-Fi on the boat? Do you have the internet?\u2019\u201dIn other words, Britain exports most of what it catches and imports most of what it eats. Either the country will need to change its appetite or it will need to trade.With enough investment and the right incentives, he believes that British fleets could catch as much as $5 billion worth of fish a year, five times their current annual haul.\u201cAfter Brexit, our government won\u2019t be in a position to create more fish,\u201d Mr. Boyers said. \u201cWe\u2019re all cogs in wheels. If you don\u2019t integrate, you won\u2019t get anywhere.\u201dThe cog that Mr. Boyers oversees is one of the few that are largely unchanged from decades ago. The daily auction takes place in a chilled and cavernous hall, which one recent morning was filled with more than 2,500 yellow boxes of fish on ice, each weighing about 110 pounds. A scrum of wholesalers looked over the merchandise and then trailed auctioneers holding pen and paper.The scene unfolded the same way 30 years ago except for one detail: Nearly all of the fish now come via the highway. They are off-loaded at a port eight miles away then packed onto a truck. The residents of Grimsby are well aware of the role that fish processing plays in the local economy, and many doubt that a sizable fishing fleet will ever return. \u201cEurope needs the U.K. more than the other way around,\u201d said Ian Thompson, a Grimsby resident and former merchant marine, having a drink under one of those sepia-toned photographs. \u201cWe will prevail.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the population of Grimsby, England. It is around 88,000, not 27,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grumpy Investors Can\u2019t Find Anything to Look Forward To", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market is forward-looking. That\u2019s a problem when there\u2019s not much to look forward to.Stocks sank for the fourth-straight day on Tuesday, as investors looked past a series of outwardly positive earnings reports and fixated on threats to the nine-year-old bull market.Foremost among them is the Federal Reserve. Super-low interest rates from the central bank have fueled the rally, pushing up the prices of stocks and bonds since the Great Recession.But that was then. Now, the Fed is slowly withdrawing some of its support. It is shrinking its portfolio of government bonds and lifting interest rates. As a result, a yearslong tailwind for the stock market is disappearing.The new environment is evident in interest rates on government bonds, closely watched by many investors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note touched 3 percent in trading early Tuesday. That benchmark interest rate \u2014 which influences the price of borrowing for both consumer loans and corporate bonds \u2014 has not been that high since early 2014.Other pressures rattled the markets, and worries began to set in after 3M and Caterpillar reported a gloomy outlook.The threat of a trade war, or even a real war, is unnerving investors. Oil prices have surged higher because of tensions in the Middle East, as well as President Trump\u2019s public musings about withdrawing the United States from its nuclear deal with Iran.Those rising commodity prices represent something of a double worry for investors. For one, they feed into price inflation, making it even more likely that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates. (One of the Fed\u2019s main objectives is keeping prices stable.) At the same time, higher commodity prices eat into profit margins for companies, which is bad for their stock prices.Last year, investors might have shrugged off those concerns, preferring to focus on the buoyant global economy and the prospect of a major reduction in American corporate tax rates.That tax cut came to fruition in December, and it supercharged corporate profits, but that was a one-time event.Investors were heartened by the tax cuts, said Evan Brown, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. But their focus has shifted since then.\u201cThe market\u2019s attention is rotating to other things, and one of those things is rising inflation and rising yields,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cOne of those things is the potential for increasing trade tensions.\u201dOther events are looming, and investors see little to be excited about. With congressional elections later this year, the prospects of pro-business legislation \u2014 or any legislation, for that matter \u2014 are dim. The biggest economic action out of Washington might be the Fed raising interest rates \u2014 a clear negative for investors.In short, it\u2019s up to companies themselves to give investors reasons to believe their shares can keep climbing.Recent earnings reports suggest that is becoming harder to do. Shares of Alphabet, the parent of Google, dropped sharply Tuesday despite the company reporting Monday that quarterly profits rose 73 percent to $9.4 billion. Investors appeared concerned with a surge of spending at the company that hurt its profit margins.Earnings reports also provoked a sell-off in the industrial firms 3M and Caterpillar. Investors were rattled by lower sales and profit forecasts and by sluggish demand for the products that 3M sells to auto body shops. Its shares sank 6.8 percent.And investors, after initially applauding Caterpillar\u2019s first-quarter results, were unnerved when a Caterpillar executive told analysts that the first quarter might be a \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for the year. The shares fell 6.2 percent.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sank 1.3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished with a loss of 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.7 percent.The decline in the S.&P. on Tuesday left the benchmark index down 1.5 percent for the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Art of the Flail", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistIf you\u2019ve been watching stock markets, you\u2019re probably feeling seasick. The Dow is crashing! No, it\u2019s bouncing back! Wait, it\u2019s crashing again!In general, trying to explain stock fluctuations is a mug\u2019s game. But in this case it\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s going on. Whenever investors suspect that Donald Trump will really go through with his threats of big tariff increases, provoking retaliation abroad, stocks plunge. Every time they decide it\u2019s just theater, stocks recover. Markets really, really don\u2019t like the idea of a trade war.So is a trade war coming? Nobody knows \u2014 even, or perhaps especially, Trump himself. For while trade is one of Trump\u2019s two signature issues \u2014 animus toward dark-skinned people being the other \u2014 when it comes to making actual demands on other countries, the tweeter in chief and his aides either don\u2019t know what they want or they want things that our trading partners can\u2019t deliver. Not won\u2019t \u2014 can\u2019t.As a result, incoherence rules: The administration lashes out, then tries to calm markets by saying that it might not carry through on its threats, then makes a new round of threats.Let\u2019s talk in particular about the will-he-or-won\u2019t-he confrontation with China.In some ways, China really is a bad actor in the global economy. In particular, it has pretty much thumbed its nose at international rules on intellectual property rights, grabbing foreign technology without proper payment. And to be fair, Trump officials do sometimes raise the intellectual property issue as a justification for getting tough.But if getting China to pay what it owes for technology were the goal, you\u2019d expect the U.S. both to make specific demands on that front and to adopt a strategy aimed at inducing China to meet those demands.In fact, the U.S. has given little indication of what China should do about intellectual property. Meanwhile, if getting better protection of patent rights and so on were the goal, America should be trying to build a coalition with other advanced countries to pressure the Chinese; instead, we\u2019ve been alienating everyone in sight.Beyond this conceptual confusion, there\u2019s a raw fact few people \u2014 and, as far as I can tell, nobody in the Trump administration \u2014 seem to appreciate: China no longer runs big trade surpluses.It\u2019s not clear why we should demand that China stop playing that role. Indeed, it\u2019s not clear that China could even do much to reduce its bilateral surplus with the U.S.: To do so, it would basically have to have a completely different economy. And this just isn\u2019t going to happen unless we have a full-blown trade war that shuts down much of the global economy as we know it.And that\u2019s why things seem so incoherent. One day Trump talks tough on trade; then stocks fall, and his advisers scramble to say that the trade war won\u2019t really happen; then he worries that he\u2019s looking weak, and tweets out more threats; and so on. Call it the art of the flail.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bright Lights, Big Shoulder Pads: A Timid Japan Recalls Its Bubble Era", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Kaori Masukodera remembers, barely, riding as a child with her mother, her hair teased and her lips bright red, in the family\u2019s convertible to the beach. It was the last gasp of the 1980s, a time of Champagne, garish colors and bubbly disco dance-floor anthems, and the last time many people in Japan felt rich and ascendant.A so-called Lost Decade and many economically stagnant years later, the family\u2019s convertible and beach vacations are long gone \u2014 but Ms. Masukodera is helping to bring the rest of Japan\u2019s bubble era back. She performs in a pop-music duo called Bed In that borrows heavily from the keyboard lines, electric drums and power chords of the \u201980s. They dress \u201980s, too: The shoulder pads are big, the skirts are mini and the hues are Day-Glo when they aren\u2019t just plain shiny.\u201cUntil a few years ago, most people saw the bubble period as a negative legacy, and it was considered quite tacky,\u201d said Ms. Masukodera, 32, wearing a tight blazer with jutting shoulder pads emblazoned with images of the Tokyo nightscape, paired with a miniskirt and gold jewelry.\u201cThat completely changed in the last few years,\u201d she added. \u201cNow people recognize it as kind of a cool period.\u201dThen there is the Maharaja. A disco chain that ignited a boom in similar clubs more than 30 years ago, Maharaja clubs have reopened across Japan over the last five years to cater to nostalgic baby boomers, curious millennials and unwitting tourists.Many young Japanese like to re-enact the era through wild limousine rides through Tokyo\u2019s streets. Called princess parties by one event-planning company, they are aimed at giving otherwise frugal young women a chance to dress up and cruise the streets the way their mothers might have in another era.\u201cI wanted to do this one last time before I start working full time,\u201d said Mirei Sugita, 20, as she curled her long hair and balanced a tiara on her head before heading out for the night. \u201cWe never do anything glamorous like this.\u201dThat conspicuous consumption of the \u201980s and the relative lack of it now underline the crucial differences between the two eras.During the bubble years, men jockeyed to take women out on expensive dates and young people flooded ski resorts and other overseas travel destinations. In Tokyo, taxis were so hard to catch at night that people waved 10,000 yen bills \u2014 worth nearly $100 in today\u2019s money \u2014 to get the drivers\u2019 attention.\u201cIt just feels like it was a more forgiving time,\u201d said Mai Chusonji, 30, the other member of Bed In, recalling how her mother said she could barely remember the era because she was \u201cout having too much fun.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s so much more pressure on young people now to avoid any mistakes, to make sure they\u2019re stable,\u201d Ms. Chusonji said.Japanese households now spend less of their disposable income than they did in the \u201980s, in part because of stagnant wages and worries about the future. The government has struggled to get consumers to open their wallets. Last year, the government introduced \u201cPremium Friday,\u201d a program that encourages companies to let workers leave early one Friday a month so they have extra time to shop and contribute to the economy.\u201cYoung people today feel anxious because they live in unstable times,\u201d said Yohei Harada, who leads a team of researchers that focuses on youth culture at the advertising agency Hakuhodo. \u201cThat\u2019s why there are more people searching for stability and civil servant jobs have become so popular.\u201dA group of high schoolers captured national attention last year when they channeled some bubble era confidence into this more timid time. Raiding thrift stores and their parents\u2019 closets, 40 high school girls found enough power suits to win second place in a national dance competition set to the 1985 disco hit \u201cDancing Hero (Eat You Up).\u201d The video has been viewed more than 50 million times.\u201cI feel like back then, people weren\u2019t afraid to be noticed,\u201d said one dancer, Nanako Meguro, 18, who recently graduated from Tomioka High School in Osaka, about 250 miles southwest of Tokyo. \u201cThey wanted to be No. 1. I think that compared to people nowadays, everyone seemed to have a lot more confidence.\u201dWhen young people do try to emulate the glamour of the bygone era, they do it on tighter budgets.On a recent evening, six university students picked through racks of colorful dresses in Nishi-Azabu, a tony neighborhood in Tokyo. Paying about $60 each, they can rent designer dresses and ride in a limousine for an hour as part of a princess party.Anipla, the company that hosts the parties, said limousine rentals had become its most popular service in the last few years.Walking off to catch their limo, Ayame Michigu, 20, said it would be their \u201cfirst and last\u201d time shelling out for such an experience.\u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about my future yet, but I know I have to start considering it soon,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents want me to have a stable job.

{"Headline": "Steep Slide in Currency Threatens Iran\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 All this week panicked Iranians have gathered in throngs outside banks and other financial businesses hoping to buy dollars, as the government seeks to head off a collapse in the rial, the national currency.But they have met with nothing but frustration, told there were no dollars or other currencies for them to buy at the official government rate. In an effort to stop the run on foreign exchange, the government has forbidden anyone from holding more than the equivalent of $10,000 in dollars or euros, which account for most of the foreign exchange in Iran.Long on a downward path, the rial plunged this week, losing 35 percent of its value against the dollar and hitting what has been widely described as a record low. The government is seeking to impose an exchange rate of 42,000 to the dollar, but in Tehran\u2019s black-market exchanges this week the going rate was 60,000. When President Hassan Rouhani took office in 2013, the rate was 36,000.In an effort to squelch currency speculation, the government sent riot police into the bazaars on Wednesday, where they arrested several money changers. One senior cleric, Ayatollah Nasser Makarem-Shirazi, said that some money changers ought to be executed to set an example.However, many of those changing money in the bazaars were ordinary people seeking to protect themselves against rising prices and fearful of further declines in the currency.Others, like Mohsen Yekta, a university professor, said they needed the foreign exchange for personal business. \u201cEvery month I send some money to my daughter in Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cI need foreign exchange to help her out. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dOrdinary Iranians agree with most of these explanations, but also blame the government for poor planning and bad management of the economy. They also view the black-market rate as one of the few trustworthy indicators of the country\u2019s economic health.The currency slide is taking its toll on business, with many firms selling foreign products halting all sales, unable to determine prices. The manager of a paint factory said that he had sent his 70 employees on a paid vacation, because he did not know what price to ask for products that were based on foreign ingredients bought with foreign exchange.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democrats Are the Party of Fiscal Responsibility", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistEver so slowly, conventional wisdom has started to recognize this reality. After Ryan\u2019s retirement announcement last week, only a few headlines called him a deficit hawk. People are catching on to the con.But there is still a major way that the conventional wisdom is wrong: It doesn\u2019t give the Democratic Party enough credit for its actual fiscal conservatism.The charts here tell the story, and I\u2019ll get into the details in a moment. But I first want to spend a few moments on the perception gap, because it highlights a problem that\u2019s bigger than budget policy.The country\u2019s political impressions are heavily influenced by people who are supposed to be neutral observers \u2014 reporters, television anchors, think-tank experts and the like. They\u2019re not perfectly neutral, of course. They have their biases. But most aspire to partisan neutrality. It\u2019s an honorable aspiration.And it\u2019s not easy to achieve. For one thing, they\u2019re inundated by partisan advocates. If your job involved listening to people claim that, say, the Obama administration\u2019s Syria policy was a success or that George W. Bush\u2019s economic record was underrated, you too would develop a robust skepticism.All of these storylines have at least some truth to them. Like a stopped clock, they sometimes have a lot of truth. But they are indeed like a stopped clock. They never change.I\u2019ve spent 25 years as a journalist and have repeatedly seen the discomfort that journalists feel about proclaiming one political party to be more successful than the other on virtually any substantive issue. We journalists are much more comfortable holding up the imperfections of each and casting ourselves as the sophisticated skeptic.Sometimes, though, one party really is doing a better job than the other. To refuse to admit it is to miss the story.So it is with budget policy. Get this: Since 1977, the three presidential administrations that have overseen the deficit increases are the three Republican ones. President Trump\u2019s tax cut is virtually assured to make him the fourth of four. And the three administrations that have overseen deficit reductions are the three Democratic ones, including a small decline under Barack Obama. If you want to know whether a post-1976 president increased or reduced the deficit, the only thing you need to know is his party.So it would certainly be false to claim that Democrats are perfect fiscal stewards and that Republicans are all profligates. Yet it\u2019s just as false to claim that the parties aren\u2019t fundamentally different. One party has now spent almost 40 years cutting taxes and expanding government programs without paying for them. The other party has raised taxes and usually been careful to pay for its new programs.It\u2019s a fascinating story \u2014 all the more so because it does not fit preconceptions. I understand why the story makes many people uncomfortable. It makes me a little uncomfortable. But it\u2019s the truth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Neo-Nazis Marched Through Berlin\u2019s Old Jewish Quarter, a Bookshop Took Notice", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsBERLIN \u2014 On a freezing Saturday last month, a group of people were setting up microphones and handing out brightly colored whistles in Berlin\u2019s old Jewish quarter. They were preparing for a protest against neo-Nazi marchers who were en route to the neighborhood.J\u00f6rg Braunsdorf, a bookseller, rubbed his hands together to keep warm, as a local singer did a sound check. One man worried that the cold would keep fellow protesters away, but Mr. Braunsdorf was reassuring: \u201cIt\u2019s also cold for them,\u201d he said, referring to the marchers who carry, among other banners, a German flag from the early 1930s.First, he emailed everyone on his bookstore distribution list. Then he set up folding chairs among his store\u2019s shelves of contemporary novels, children\u2019s books and an extensive collection of the writings of the German-Jewish writer Kurt Tucholsky. Forty people attended an after-hours meeting. Along with a half-dozen of these attendees, Mr. Braunsdorf co-founded the Residents\u2019 Initiative for Civil Courage.By last summer, when a third march through this neighborhood was announced, the group was ready: They had teamed up with \u201cBerlin Against Nazis,\u201d a city-funded organization that targets racism and anti-Semitism. A friend of Mr. Braunsdorf\u2019s designed colorful posters and fliers and together they set up three protest stations along the marchers\u2019 route. Between 200 and 300 neighbors showed up with soup spoons, banging on pots and pans, to protest the march.\u201cWe wanted to take back the public space,\u201d Mr. Braunsdorf recalled on a recent afternoon, between answering one customer\u2019s question about the literary structure of a young adult thriller, and warmly recommending a new novella to another. \u201cAt a certain point, you just have to do something.\u201dIn Germany, Mr. Braunsdorf\u2019s efforts are part of a long tradition in which bookstores play an active role in civil society, said Johanna Hahn, director of the German Association of Booksellers in Berlin and Brandenburg.\u201cThe book industry has always reacted with great sensitivity to the political climate,\u201d she said, \u201cand bookstores are always a place where social change occurs.\u201d In the 1970s at the height of the women\u2019s liberation movement, for example, Germany had large numbers of feminist bookstores. \u201cNow, the theme really seems to be freedom of speech, freedom of opinion. Look at America, look at Turkey \u2014 this problem is all over the world.\u201dIn German bookstore circles, the topic of nationalism and fascism is particularly prominent now, Ms. Hahn added. This follows the rise of groups like the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West and Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which won 12.6 percent of the national vote in September, making it the first far-right party to sit in Parliament in 60 years.\u201cIn every book there\u2019s a new perspective,\u201d Ms. Hahn said, \u201cso bookstores automatically fall on the side of openness and diversity.\u201dGermany has a healthy number of independent bookstores, thanks largely to a German law that requires all booksellers to sell books at set prices. But Zo\u00eb Beck, co-founder of a group called Publishers Against the Right, worries that market-oriented chain stores have weakened bookstores\u2019 role as a place of political debate. \u201cWhat J\u00f6rg Braunsdorf is doing is something I find exemplary,\u201d wrote Ms. Beck, in an email. \u201cThe need now is greater than ever.\u201cFor Mr. Braunsdorf, 58, social engagement has always been part of running a bookstore. Originally from Wetzlar, a small city in what was then West Germany, Mr. Braunsdorf started working in his 20s at a book collective there run by a group of his young left-wing friends. They did not do much business, but the shop was a meeting place for students and activists: There, they printed fliers decrying nuclear power plants or calling for affordable housing.Today, 37 years later, Mr. Braunsdorf is still working at a bookstore, but now it\u2019s his own shop, in Berlin, and other political issues have come to the forefront. \u201cNone of us expected that this confrontation with fascism would be so close at hand,\u201d he said, alluding to the AfD success in entering Parliament. \u201cI think in the next years we are going to need to not just protest \u2018against,\u2019 but really come up with a \u2018for.\u2019 What do we want, in our society?\u201dMr. Braunsdorf, who has hosted German-Arabic reading events at his shop for refugee children and moderated debates about gentrification, the economy and politics, said he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine running a bookstore just as a selling point.\u201dThe same could be said of Mr. Braunsdorf. Last month, as the crowd of protesters grew, Ralf Teepe expressed his appreciation for Mr. Braunsdorf\u2019s bookstore, which he said he visited once a week, in lieu of church, for spiritual enrichment.Mr. Teepe, a civil servant with the foreign service who recently moved back to Berlin after years in Africa and elsewhere, had joined Mr. Braunsdorf a few blocks from the bookstore. He too wanted to protest the neo-Nazis who were headed to the neighborhood.\u201cI was born in \u201958, and both of my parents were marked by the Nazi period,\u201d Mr. Teepe said. \u201cThe older I get, the more I understand how traumatized my father, in particular, was.\u201d He paused to rub his hands together and blow on them for warmth. \u201cToday, 70 years later, you have the feeling for the first time that history could repeat itself. That that\u2019s not out of the question.\u201dAfter the black-clad line of right-wingers had passed behind a line of police officers \u2014 greeted by chants of \u201cNazis out!\u201d \u2014 the crowds dispersed. Elnura Yivazada, who works in culture management and heard about the protest through the bookstore, took a moment to stay and listen to the last musical act, before heading home to warm up.\u201cIt\u2019s important to show our faces,\u201d she said. \u201cTo say, people here won\u2019t just accept this.\u201dSally McGrane, a journalist, is the author of \u201cMoscow at Midnight,\u201d a spy novel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Big Is Beautiful\u2019 Questions the Virtues of Small Business", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe empirical evidence amassed by Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Lind in opposition to the \u201ccult of small business in America\u201d is impressive. The authors conclude that \u201con virtually every meaningful indicator, including wages, productivity, environmental protection, exporting, innovation, employment diversity and tax compliance, large firms as a group significantly outperform small firms.\u201dEven the conventional wisdom that \u201csmall businesses are the engine of job growth in our economy\u201d comes under attack. \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d points to flawed research based on \u201cgross\u201d rather than \u201cnet\u201d job creation as the \u201corigin of the small business job creation myth.\u201d Because the vast majority of small businesses fail, taking into account the resulting job losses reveals a modest contribution to overall job creation. One particularly striking research article cited notes that \u201cit takes 43 start-ups to end up with just one company that employs anyone other than the founder after 10 years.\u201d The average number employed by that surviving start-up: just nine.This skeptical attitude toward the inherent superiority of small firms to large is supported by the fact that their share of overall employment tends to go up only when the economy is weak rather than strong. This suggests not that small firms are the engine of job growth, but that job seekers are willing to accept their systematically lower wages, benefits and diversity only when forced to in times of high unemployment.The national consensus in favor of all things small is reflected in a dizzying array of local and national laws that provide either affirmative benefits or valuable exemptions. Both authors are inveterate policy wonks, having spent much of their careers at a succession of public and private think tanks, and devote half the book to discussing the history of these rules and justifying alternatives to our current regulatory approach to antitrust, tax and dozens of other topics.Possibly inspired by the wide popularity of \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d defends many of its often radical policy proposals under the benign-sounding principle of \u201csize neutrality.\u201d Although these arguments are often interesting, they are weakened by caricaturing the positions of those who take a different view and the overuse of policy jargon. For instance, they name their own philosophy \u201cnational developmentalism\u201d and describe opponents of their approach to antitrust enforcement as \u201cneo-Brandeisians\u201d who, if they \u201cget their way,\u201d will \u201cbreak up most large companies into medium-sized ones.\u201dRegardless of the validity of their specific policy prescriptions, the data synthesized by Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Lind does call into question the wisdom of prevailing attitudes toward small business relative to large not just in law but in society. A look at recent trends in where graduates of top M.B.A. programs go to work reflects this increasing antipathy toward large firms.Given that Stanford is in the heart of Silicon Valley, it should be neither surprising nor worrisome that today almost as many graduates decide to start their own company as those who go into consulting (20 percent).If Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Lind are correct that big businesses are the prime driver of productivity while also maintaining a better record on social issues, it is at a minimum worth pausing before rejoicing over the rejection of large corporations by the most promising M.B.A.s. Large corporations themselves, as the recent Facebook scandals attest, bear much of the blame for the increasing disfavor in which they are held. But even if some of the contempt has been earned, \u201cBig Is Beautiful\u201d succeeds in highlighting why it is in our collective interest to find ways to help the biggest corporations earn back our trust, and attract more of our best graduates.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Are Iran and Israel Headed for Their First Direct War?", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistSYRIA-ISRAEL BORDER, Golan Heights \u2014 Ever since the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran and Israel have been fighting each other in the shadows \u2014 through proxies, assassination squads and cyber-virus attacks, but never as rival armies meeting on the field of battle. That may be about to change, and if it does, it will have vast implications for Syria, Lebanon and the whole Middle East.I\u2019m sure neither side really wants a war. It could be devastating for Israel\u2019s flourishing high-tech economy and for Iran\u2019s already collapsing currency. But Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds Force seems determined to try to turn Syria into a base from which to pressure Israel, and Israel seems determined to prevent that. And in the past few weeks \u2014 for the first time ever \u2014 Israel and Iran have begun quietly trading blows directly, not through proxies, in Syria.They have already gone through two rounds, and Round 3, now pending, could blow Syria sky-high.Round 1 occurred on Feb. 10, when an Iranian drone launched by a Quds Force unit operating out of Syria\u2019s T4 air base, in central Syria, was shot down with a missile from an Israeli Apache helicopter that was following it after it penetrated northern Israel airspace.If true, that suggests that the Quds Force \u2014 commanded by Iran\u2019s military mastermind Qassem Suleimani \u2014 was trying to launch an actual military strike on Israel.\u201cThis is the first time we saw Iran do something against Israel \u2014 not by proxy,\u201d a senior Israeli military source told me. \u201cThis opened a new period.\u201dWhile the Israeli Army spokesman refused to confirm or deny the Israeli raid, Iran\u2019s government unusually highlighted it \u2014 and Iran\u2019s casualties \u2014 and vowed to take revenge.\u201cThe Zionist entity will sooner or later receive the necessary response and will regret its misdeeds,\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qasemi, said Monday.So now the whole neighborhood is holding its breath: Will there be a Round 3? Israeli defense officials let it be known that if the Iranians strike back, Israel may use the opportunity to mount a massive counterstrike on Iran\u2019s entire military infrastructure in Syria, where Iran is attempting to establish forward air bases and factories for GPS-guided missiles that could hit targets inside Israel with much greater accuracy \u2014 inside a 50-meter radius. Iran also plans to provide the missiles to Hezbollah in Lebanon.These Israeli defense officials say there is zero chance Israel will make the same mistake it made in Lebanon \u2014 letting Hezbollah establish a large missile threat there \u2014 by letting Iran do so in Syria.On Tuesday, to drive home that point, the Israeli government reportedly distributed maps to Israeli news organizations showing five Iranian-controlled bases in Syria. All that was missing on them were bull\u2019s-eyes of exactly where Israel will drop its bombs if the Iranians carry out their threats. The message from Israel to the Quds Force was hard to miss: \u201cBeware. We know exactly where to find you.\u201dAs Israel\u2019s defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, put it to a gathering of Israeli soldiers on Monday: \u201cWe are facing a new reality \u2014 the Lebanese Army, in cooperation with Hezbollah, the Syrian Army, the Shiite militias in Syria and above them Iran \u2014 are all becoming a single front against the state of Israel.\u201dIran has legitimate security concerns in the gulf; it faces a number of hostile, pro-American Sunni Arab powers trying to contain its influence and undermine its Islamic regime. From Iran\u2019s perspective, these are a threat. I get that.But what is Iran doing in Syria?Tehran\u2019s building of bases and missile factories in Syria, after having helped President Bashar al-Assad largely crush the uprising against him, appears to be a move by the Quds Force\u2019s Suleimani to extend Iran\u2019s grip on key parts of the Sunni Arab world and advance his position at home in his struggle for power with Hassan Rouhani, Iran\u2019s president. The Quds Force now more or less controls \u2014 through proxies \u2014 four Arab capitals: Damascus, Beirut, Baghdad and Sana.Indeed, Iran has become the biggest \u201coccupying power\u201d in the Arab world today. But Suleimani may be overplaying his hand.Even before the recent clashes with Israel, many average Iranians were publicly asking: What is Iran doing spending billions of dollars \u2014 which were supposed to go to Iranians as a result of the lifting of sanctions from the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 fighting wars in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen?That concern is surely one reason Iran, for all its fist-shaking \u2014 has not retaliated \u2014 yet. The Israeli airstrike on T4, along with the U.S.-British-French airstrike on the Syrian regime\u2019s suspected chemical weapons facilities, have actually exposed the strategic vulnerabilities of both Russia and Iran in Syria. Their forces are very powerful versus the rebels there, but not so powerful versus the Western forces and Israel. Iran, which has to depend largely on Syria\u2019s air defense system, is particularly exposed to Israel\u2019s Air Force.\u201cRussia\u2019s appearance of omnipotence in the Syrian arena has been shattered,\u201d military writer Anshel Pfeffer noted in Haaretz on Monday. \u201cAppearances of power count for a lot in this region.\u201d Russia\u2019s \u201cforces there are insufficient to take on any of the other nations who have operated, and may operate again, in Syria. \u2026 The United States, Britain and France, as well as Israel and Turkey, can all deploy larger and more capable forces to the region much faster than Russia can.\u201dSuleimani could opt to strike back at Israel through proxies, either in the Middle East or against Israeli targets globally. But he now has to think twice about that, both because his forces in Syria are exposed \u2014 and for another reason: Iran is exposed financially. Iran\u2019s currency is collapsing back home. The Iranian rial has lost one-third of its value just this year, which a wider confrontation with Israel would only exacerbate.It would seem, in other words, that Suleimani is at odds with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran\u2019s President Rouhani. Putin and Rouhani share an interest in Syria quieting down now, and not becoming a financial drain or a military quagmire \u2014 by Suleimani turning it into an arena for a direct war with Israel.But economic restraints have never stopped Suleimani and his Quds Force before and may not now. Their ambitions are big \u2014 to create a base to pressure Israel directly, to dominate the Arab states around them and to maintain the fervor of the Islamic Revolution. Everyone is basically awaiting Suleimani\u2019s next move. Does he back down, lose a little face, and wait until he is stronger? Does Israel let him?These are momentous days for both countries. One thing I know for sure. The status quo is not sustainable.This column was updated April 17 to reflect news developments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Seize on Impeachment for Edge in 2018 Midterms", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Republican leaders scramble to stave off a Democratic wave or at least mitigate their party\u2019s losses in November, a strategy is emerging on the right for how to energize conservatives and drive a wedge between the anti-Trump left and moderate voters: warn that Democrats will immediately move to impeach President Trump if they capture the House.What began last year as blaring political hyperbole on the right \u2014 the stuff of bold-lettered direct mail fund-raising pitches from little-known groups warning of a looming American \u201ccoup\u201d \u2014 is now steadily drifting into the main currents of the 2018 message for Republicans.The appeals have become a surefire way for candidates to raise small contributions from grass-roots conservatives who are devoted to Mr. Trump, veteran Republican fund-raisers say. But party strategists also believe that floating the possibility of impeachment can also act as a sort of scared-straight motivational tool for turnout. Last week, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas used his re-election kickoff rally to introduce a video featuring a faux news anchor reading would-be headlines were conservatives not to vote in November.\u201cSenate Majority Leader Schumer announced the impeachment trial of President Trump,\u201d one of the anchors says.And when Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the House Republican campaign organization, convened about two dozen party strategists in February for a private dinner at a French bistro here, the attendees were surprised when he addressed an issue not included in his formal PowerPoint presentation: the threat of impeachment against Mr. Trump, which he said fired up the party base.Then there is the most prominent Republican to have started invoking the specter of a Democratic-controlled House impeaching Mr. Trump: the president himself. In just the last month, he has used three separate speeches to warn that Representative Maxine Waters, a veteran California Democrat he has casually insulted as a \u201clow-I.Q. individual,\u201d aims to impeach him.Advisers to the president say they have made clear to him that Republican control of the House is tenuous, and some have encouraged him to more aggressively lay out the stakes for the midterm elections, including who exactly would be in charge of key committees should Democrats retake the chamber.\u201cEverybody has told him that,\u201d Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, said about the prospect of a Democratic takeover of the House. \u201cThe threat of impeachment is something that unifies everybody in the party, even if you\u2019re not a big Trump supporter.\u201dDemocrats are divided on how to respond to the charge. Many top officials in the capital fear it is a political trap that would distract from their core message and possibly even boomerang to harm them in November. (Mr. Schumer himself has said he thinks impeachment is premature at the moment.) But other more progressive figures see impeachment as a rallying cry of their own to galvanize the left\u2019s anti-Trump base.\u201cI\u2019ve been urging members to refrain from discussing impeachment,\u201d said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, adding: \u201cI think we should let these investigations conclude and see what evidence is found.\u201dThe mere thought of impeachment could energize Trump supporters who may otherwise be disinclined to vote in the midterm elections without him on the ballot, supporters of the strategy say.\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine the Democrats would go there,\u201d said Mark Lundberg, the former chairman of the Sioux County Republican committee in Iowa. \u201cImpeachment for what? For being rude to them? That would be so outrageous.\u201dAnd to those voters in the political center who may be uneasy with, or simply exhausted by, his tumultuous administration, the possibility of an even more chaotic 2019 in Washington is unappealing.Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, a member of the House Republican leadership, predicted that the possibility of impeachment would divide the hard left from the broader political mainstream.\u201cIt separates their base from reasonable, rational people that decide elections,\u201d said Mr. McHenry, noting that this bloc of the electorate does not \u201cwant to put people in power that are going to create complete chaos and in essence shut down any potential legislative progress.\u201dBut the mere fact that Republicans are talking by early spring about running on an impeachment threat reveals the depth of their challenge going into this fall\u2019s election. The first midterm campaign of a new administration is typically difficult for the president\u2019s party. But the tempestuous Mr. Trump has compounded the Republicans\u2019 difficulties by generating an unending stream of made-for-TV controversies that overshadow their policy achievements and the health of the economy.There are voices in the Republican Party who believe that it is too soon to sound the alarm, and that doing so will come off as overly panicked. Indeed, what is striking about the politics of impeachment is that both parties are divided over how to navigate the issue in the midterm campaign.Polls show most voters are not supportive of impeachment at the moment, but if Mr. Trump were to fire the White House special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, the country would become about evenly divided on the question.In January, 66 House Democrats, over a third of the caucus, voted to begin impeachment proceedings. That was eight more than the total number who voted for a similar measure in the House a month earlier.\u201cI think he\u2019s committed impeachable offenses,\u201d said Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, adding that waiting for the special counsel is risky because Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry may never \u201csee the light of day.\u201dOn Thursday, the House Democratic campaign organization released a memo based on an internal poll that urged candidates to \u201cexpress a willingness to work with the president when his agenda might help the district.\u201d\u201cIf impeachment becomes a political tool instead of the end result of a credible investigation, then you are as guilty as Trump, in some ways, of taking a hammer blow to institutions,\u201d said David Axelrod, former President Barack Obama\u2019s onetime chief strategist, adding that it would also create risks in swing districts. \u201cTo say I\u2019m for impeachment come hell or high water is to promise chaos.\u201dAnd Democratic lawmakers say they are wise to the bait that Mr. Trump is placing before them when he invokes Ms. Waters, an outspoken black woman whose jeremiads against the president conservative media outlets delight in amplifying.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to encourage us to be more out front on impeachment so then they can use that to rev up their base and say, \u2018That\u2019s all the Democrats care about,\u2019\u201d said Representative Dina Titus of Nevada, a political-science professor by training.To some Republican strategists, waving the bloody shirt of impeachment is unwise \u2014 at least this early in the election season.\u201cRepublicans should leave that insanity to the left,\u201d said Mike Shields, who worked for former Speaker Newt Gingrich during the Clinton impeachment wars. \u201cWe should be talking about the soaring economy, record low unemployment, 90 percent of workers getting tax cuts, defeating ISIS, and peace through strength on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dBut other veteran party officials say what they are doing now is precisely what Democrats should have done to rouse their own voters, and protect their House majority, in the elections leading up to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998.The Faith & Freedom Coalition, a group run by the longtime Republican strategist Ralph Reed, recently sent out a fund-raising solicitation seeking small contributions that warned about what it called the \u201cImpeachment Election!\u201d \u201cWill you do your part to help stop this coup attempt by the radical anti-Christian left and the media against our duly elected president?\u201d the letter read, with \u201cstop\u201d and \u201ccoup\u201d in all capitals.Other groups, some even more marginal, have filled the mailboxes of grass-roots conservatives with similar high-decibel appeals.But what is notable is how this fire-and-brimstone approach is making its way into the party\u2019s mainstream.Last week, America Rising, a Washington-area candidate-tracking and opposition-research firm that assists Republicans, sent out a fund-raising email that read, \u201cRight now the only thing standing between the president and the Democrats\u2019 underhanded impeachment attempts is the Republican majority in the House fighting to defend our president.\u201dOr as Representative Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, a Republican, said last week in a talk radio interview: \u201cDo you think that the far-left Resist movement base of the Democrat Party would accept anything other than impeachment?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Elon Musk finally responded to last week\u2019s bad news about Tesla.\u2022 Trump continues to go after Amazon.\u2022 China retaliated to President Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.\u2022 Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook.For months, the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way.But now, the S.&P. 500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all-time high.Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical. Here\u2019s how Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, described Live Nation:\u201cIt is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe inquiries come as the department is reviewing two more mergers, between AT&T and Time Warner, and Disney and Fox.The department\u2019s new antitrust chief has said that the Live Nation deal and several other deals posed problems because they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d the antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, said in a speech.More for your playlistThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do Taxpayers Know They Are Handing Out Billions to Corporations?", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEvery year, states and local governments give economic-development incentives to companies to the tune of between $45 billion and $80 billion. Why such a wide range? It\u2019s not sloppy research; it\u2019s because many of these subsidies are not public.Economic development all across the country is getting less open \u2014 and both Democrats and Republicans are doing it. In fact, in many cases, the politicians themselves aren\u2019t even the ones negotiating for the public.How do communities balance the tremendous opportunity of attracting a world-class company against the taxpayer costs, the pressures on our infrastructure and our struggles of providing affordable housing?Many of these companies want to hide their proposed jobs and wages on the initial application \u2014 it\u2019s an extremely effective way of making it impossible to evaluate if these companies kept their promises to create high-paying jobs in exchange for taxpayer dollars.Other states are also secretive about economic development. Amazon\u2019s brazen public call for proposals for its second headquarters reveals how far governments will go to keep these secrets. Some cities and states revealed their bids, including New Jersey\u2019s $7 billion taxpayer-funded incentive. But the majority didn\u2019t. In January, when Amazon cut down this list down to 20 locations, the finalists signed nondisclosure agreements to keep the rest of the process secret.Another strategy to avoid transparency in a competition like this is through complexity. The idea is to make economic development so twisted that it\u2019s nearly impossible to figure out who is responsible for it. If governments aren\u2019t submitting these bids, with taxpayers\u2019 money, who is responsible for economic development?The recent bidding war for Amazon and failure of communities to live up to the Standards Board reporting rule reveals that weak transparency laws can be further thwarted by using the complexity of these programs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trade War the U.S. Is Actually Winning, for Now", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs. Cao is a professor of international economic law.The dollar\u2019s status is inextricably linked to international trade. Because the dollar reigns supreme in the trading system, other countries need to accumulate dollars. Most international trade is conducted using the dollar, even if the United States is not a party to the transaction.The United States wasn\u2019t always so dominant. After the 1971 decision to end the link between the value of the dollar and gold reserves, the dollar became a currency much like any other. But in 1974, the United States and Saudi Arabia struck an agreement in which the Saudis and the other Gulf states supported the dollar as the primary medium of exchange for oil exports. Thus, oil and other commodities are priced in dollars, so any country that buys oil must build up its dollar reserves to pay for it \u2014 mostly by exporting its goods and services so that it can receive dollars as payment.Still, there are enormous benefits to being able to print paper money and have the world treat it as if it were gold. Other countries need American dollars, and they are willing to pay a premium to hold them. Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing, finance minister of France from 1962 to 1966, called this an \u201cexorbitant privilege.\u201d Once they have amassed those all-important dollars, countries use them to buy United States Treasury bonds. (China alone held $1.2 trillion dollars of United States government debt at the end of 2017.) This enormous global demand for American debt means that the United States can borrow at relatively low interest rates, financing its budget deficits away.The \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d extends to ordinary Americans, who have access to a vast supply of credit and can borrow to buy homes and cars at lower interest rates.China and the United States are too closely economically intertwined via the dollar to make that a credible fear. United States treasuries are still the world\u2019s safe haven of choice. And selling off American debt would cause the yuan to appreciate, which would put China\u2019s exports at a disadvantage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adapting to American Decline", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionMr. Preble is the author of \u201cThe Power Problem: How American Military Dominance Makes Us Less Safe, Less Prosperous and Less Free.\u201dThe news that Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, met in secret with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, over the Easter weekend has renewed hope that one of the world\u2019s most dangerous standoffs might be resolved without war. On Saturday, in fact, Mr. Kim announced that he would halt nuclear tests. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s trip was surprising for many reasons: he went personally, it was kept a secret and it was revealed at a time when others were questioning his fitness to become secretary of state.But it says something about America\u2019s place in world affairs that at least one aspect of the trip was no surprise at all: that Americans are deeply, centrally involved in a dispute involving two sovereign countries thousands of miles away from Washington.Of course, there\u2019s a good historical reason. Under American tutelage, South Korea eventually evolved from a desperately poor autocracy to one of the wealthiest democracies on the planet. American taxpayers continue to spend billions of dollars a year to help maintain regional security. A similar process played out in other parts of Asia and in Europe, where the American security umbrella, including tens of thousands of military personnel, provided room for those countries\u2019 leaders to build strong democracies and economies.American leaders argued that such policies served the cause of global peace and security. They also reasoned that the substantial costs would be tolerable. And, so long as American productivity and workers\u2019 wages were rising, it seemed that Uncle Sam could ensure a decent standard of living at home and security around the world.It is becoming harder, though, for America to maintain this global posture. Eventually, it may become impossible, in part because we helped create the conditions that allowed other countries to prosper and grow. There may come a time, not too far in the future, when Americans would be surprised to hear that they are responsible for keeping peace on the Korean Peninsula.Americans should be debating how to manage that transition in a way that avoids destabilizing the rest of the world. Unfortunately, if the current administration\u2019s maneuvers between the two Koreas are any indication, this is the last thing on the minds of policymakers.The proliferation of various technologies \u2014 from crude explosives to advanced robotics \u2014 has made it easier for even relatively small and weak countries and nonstate actors to challenge the big and powerful United States. These days any truly determined country, even a very poor one like North Korea, can develop nuclear weapons to deter attacks.Its answer? Try harder.The document predicts that America\u2019s allies will lose faith and the country\u2019s global influence will wane unless taxpayers commit to \u201cdevoting additional resources in a sustained effort to solidify our competitive advantage.\u201dThe problem is, the United States already spends more on its military than the next seven or eight nations combined. Total annual expenditures, including for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, have averaged $561 billion since 2001. So, how much more must Americans spend to maintain a military edge sufficient to deter attacks against others?About $196 billion more, on average, over the next five years. The Trump administration projects spending $3.78 trillion from 2019 to 2023, or $756.9 billion a year. Some doubt that even that will be enough.Ideally, this additional spending will discourage others from challenging us. Even if it did, however, that would require Americans to accept less domestic spending, higher taxes or both in order to allow others to underspend on their militaries.There are, however, alternatives to simply spending more and trying harder. Of course, the easy, and unpalatable, options would hand over the reins of global leadership to China, or simply have American forces withdraw quickly and let the chips fall where they may.Instead, America should seek a new arrangement that asks the beneficiaries of today\u2019s relatively peaceful and prosperous world order to make a meaningful contribution to maintaining it. The American security umbrella will stay aloft \u2014 and American military power will remain formidable \u2014 but others will need to do more.Rather than treating allies like reckless teenagers who can\u2019t be trusted without Uncle Sam\u2019s constant supervision, or feckless weaklings that will jump at the chance to capitulate to rapacious neighbors, Washington should empower mature, like-minded states to deal with local challenges before they become regional or global crises.Of course, one purported advantage of an American-funded global security order is that it supposedly allows Washington to call the shots \u2014 and, naturally, some worry that its allies would show less deference and be less willing to comply with Washington\u2019s dictates if they were less dependent upon American power. But that already happens: In fact, some allies have been known to act recklessly when they believe that America has their back. Look at the ruinous war that Saudi Arabia is waging in Yemen, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. Greater independence could induce greater caution.And the benefits flow both ways. If Washington was slightly less confident that it could call the tune and expect others to dance, that might help America to avoid costly mistakes. Would the United States have invaded Iraq if it didn\u2019t believe that other countries would help clean up after?Transitioning to a world with many capable actors won\u2019t be easy. It will require a deft hand to unwind defense arrangements, and patience as others find their way. Given their own domestic spending priorities and continued uncertainty about whether the United States will recommit to the old model, most American allies are likely to take a wait-and-see attitude. A gentle nudge might be needed to move them from comfortable adolescence to empowered adulthood.The United States is the most important country in the world and will remain so for many years by virtue of its strong economy and prodigious military capabilities. But admitting that the United States is incapable of effectively adjudicating every territorial dispute or of thwarting every security threat in every part of the world is hardly tantamount to surrender. It is, rather, a wise admission of the limits of American power and an acknowledgment of the need to share the burdens, and the responsibilities, of dealing with a complex world. It is about seizing the opportunity to make changes that benefit us and others.The alternative is a renewed commitment to discourage self-reliance among allies. That will be an undertaking far more onerous than any the United States has attempted since World War II \u2014 and one that is unlikely to work.Christopher A.

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Said to Be Target of $1 Billion U.S. Fine", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal regulators are poised to impose a $1 billion fine on Wells Fargo for years of selling unnecessary products to customers, the toughest action by the Trump administration against a major bank.The penalty, part of an expected settlement on Friday between the bank and two regulators, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, will punish Wells Fargo for forcing customers to buy auto insurance policies they did not need and other misdeeds, according to four people briefed on the regulatory action.It is the latest blow to Wells Fargo. For years, it was regarded as one of the country\u2019s best-run banks but lately has been reeling from a string of self-inflicted crises.President Trump has been especially vocal about holding Wells to account, taking to Twitter last year to warn that the bank could face stiff penalties. But he has been equally adamant about dismantling banking rules, part of a broader regulatory rollback.The consumer bureau is carrying out both agendas. The agency\u2019s interim director, Mick Mulvaney, has pushed aggressively for the penalty against Wells. The consumer bureau\u2019s portion of the penalty is likely to represent the largest fine in its history.Mr. Mulvaney is simultaneously working to defang the consumer bureau, an agency that has been a thorn in the side of the financial industry. He has criticized the bureau for wasteful spending and overzealous oversight.Those dueling priorities \u2014 neutering the agency while fulfilling Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to come down hard on Wells Fargo \u2014 have created friction.Mr. Mulvaney, who also is director of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, has spent the past several months doing everything he can to weaken the agency. He requested $0 for the agency\u2019s quarterly budget.But at the same time, according to several administration officials, Mr. Mulvaney has been eager to ensure that the bureau fulfilled the president\u2019s commitment to go after Wells Fargo. In conversations with colleagues in the Trump administration, Mr. Mulvaney has emphasized his role in orchestrating the $1 billion fine.\u201cI am extraordinarily concerned that some of these leaks might have come from bureau employees,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI recognize that there may well be some (a few? a lot?) of people who work here who aren\u2019t happy that I\u2019m working here. That\u2019s fine. I also recognize that these folks might be interested in undermining my leadership here, or in quite simply looking to make me look bad.\u201dThe penalty against Wells Fargo is likely to help insulate Mr. Mulvaney and the Trump administration against charges from Democrats and consumer groups that they are giving a pass to big banks. But aside from the expected Wells Fargo settlement, the consumer bureau \u2014 like other financial regulators in the Trump era \u2014 has been pursuing far fewer cases against banks than under the Obama administration.That is largely by design. Administration officials including Mr. Mulvaney have repeatedly said that overly harsh regulation has left the banking industry with less capacity to make loans to American businesses and to otherwise support a growing United States economy.Wells Fargo is one of the country\u2019s largest lenders, with branches and mortgage lending operations stretching from coast to coast. Until recently, Wells was the envy of the banking industry, with a reputation for steadily churning out profits while avoiding the reckless lending and investments that felled many of its rivals during the financial crisis.That reputation has been obliterated by recent scandals. The trouble started in September 2016, when the consumer bureau revealed that the bank had been opening accounts and new credit cards in its customers\u2019 names without telling them. The bank paid $185 million to settle that matter.The fines kept coming. Since the beginning of 2016, state and federal regulators and the Justice Department have levied almost $1.5 billion in fines and penalties against the bank for offenses ranging from punishing whistle-blowers to unlawfully repossessing the cars of military service members.In February, the Federal Reserve affixed extraordinarily tight handcuffs to Wells Fargo. The bank was barred from expanding until it cleaned up its internal financial and risk systems. The Fed also pushed for Wells to bring new blood on its board.And Mr. Trump singled the bank out for criticism. \u201cFines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cI will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!\u201dThe settlement expected on Friday is likely to cite Wells Fargo\u2019s practice of forcing auto insurance on some of its customers. It also is expected to blame the bank for improperly charging mortgage customers and for failing to maintain adequate risk management and compliance practices, according to one of the people briefed on the action.The $1 billion settlement is likely to intensify pressure on Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, Timothy J. Sloan. Mr. Sloan, a veteran of the bank, took over after his predecessor, John Stumpf, resigned after the eruption of the scandal involving Wells Fargo\u2019s creation of fake accounts. A person briefed on the matter said that Mr. Sloan had no plans to leave the bank.Experts cautioned against viewing the expected large penalty as a sign that the Trump administration or the consumer bureau are changing their attitudes toward oversight of the banking industry.\u201cThe Wells activities are so egregious, they are unique,\u201d said Lawrence J. White, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cI don\u2019t think this tells us one way or the other about the future direction of the C.F.P.B.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sometimes it looks as if fashion houses \u201cread the same memo.\u201d I am in the interiors industry, and there we have the same situation, which is caused by the influence of fabric mills and production economies. Is this also true in fashion? \u2014 Jennifer, DallasA: Indeed it is. If you want to know, for example, why you are about to see all sorts of plaid and tartan in shops, or why next fall it\u2019s going to be all about silver mylar separates (I kid you not) \u2014 the first place you should look is the fabric fairs.Specifically Pitti Immagine Filati in Florence, MilanoUnica in Milan, and Premi\u00e8re Vision in Paris. Pretty much every designer \u2014 or at least a member of a design team at a big brand \u2014 attends them. And when they do, they all see the same things. And not just fabrics, but also trend presentations aimed at helping them sense what\u2019s in the wind (People will want to cocoon! They will be thinking about the space age!). Designers actually have to choose their fabrics, or start experimenting with them, a season before the season when they actually start creating. So if you do the math, that\u2019s at least a year before the clothes actually get sold.There are exceptions, of course \u2014 Dries Van Noten often designs all of his own prints; companies like Zegna actually began as manufacturers, and still make fabrics for other brands \u2014 but for many smaller brands especially, who don\u2019t have the corporate muscle or means to do this, it\u2019s the mills that set the tone. I know everyone says trends are about X movie or X museum show, and the cultural ethos is a part of it, but it\u2019s honestly a lot less highfalutin than all that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Effort to Hold Bank Executives Accountable May Fall Short", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchA persistent complaint about the government\u2019s response to the financial crisis has been that the executives who helped push the economy to the brink were not charged with crimes.Prosecutors have not been able to prosecute managers with the usual tools for pursuing white-collar cases, like wire fraud or false statements, because defenses of ignorance or good faith could not be overcome.One way to remedy that problem would be to lower the level of intent needed to establish a violation. Doing so might make it easier to hold an executive who is not part of day-to-day decisions responsible for wrongdoing.The legislation requires officers of any bank with more than $10 billion in assets to certify each year that they have not uncovered any criminal conduct or civil fraud to the Justice Department.Even if it did pass \u2014 which seems unlikely in the current anti-regulation environment \u2014 the proposed certification requirement is unlikely to result in a wave of prosecutions. The criminal law is a blunt instrument for pursuing corporate misconduct, and executives are experts at keeping problems at arms-length, or at least maintaining the kind of plausible deniability that makes it difficult to prosecute them.Prosecuting a bank is easier than proving an individual committed a crime. The intent of all employees is attributed to the organization, which is vicariously liable for what individuals do on its behalf. But prosecuting executives means showing they had knowledge of a violation. That can be difficult.Ms. Warren\u2019s bill tries to remedy that by forcing management to make the necessary inquiries to determine that the organization is not violating the law.The bill would add a new offense for an executive who \u201cwillfully\u201d files a false certification, including violations that are \u201cpart of a pattern of any illegal activity involving more than $100,000\u201d in a year. The maximum penalty would be up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.Another possibility is having to show merely that executives knew they were engaged in wrongful activity. That is much easier to prove and something that prosecutors would no doubt prefer.The Sarbanes-Oxley certification statute has been used in only a few cases since. In each instance, prosecutors had evidence that the executive had direct knowledge of the fraudulent activity.Absent proof of an executive\u2019s involvement, or at least knowledge, of the fraud, a willful violation of the certification requirement in Ms. Warren\u2019s legislation would be difficult to prove. We can expect executives to put in new procedures to show that they tried to comply with the law, which can provide a basis for claiming there was not an intentional violation of the certification requirement.For those reasons, I doubt the Too Big to Jail Act would result in increased criminal liability for executives. There is no simple cure to the challenge of holding senior managers responsible for what takes place within their organizations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the New Boss. Actually Quite Different From the Old Boss.", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.In the end, the wheelers and dealers faded away, trying to get what they could under cover of darkness. Their loss of stature was abrupt. Only those willing to soldier on as subordinates remained, ceding authority to their leader, President Trump.For four decades, from 1968 to 2008, what was loosely described as the Republican establishment \u2014 the party\u2019s congressional leaders, campaign operatives, donors, lobbyists and special interests \u2014 reigned supreme.Every four years, the party\u2019s presidential nominee secured the establishment\u2019s stamp of approval. Endorsements from governors and senators \u2014 and a gigantic campaign chest fed by major Republican fund-raisers \u2014 were the main markers of that approval.In a party deeply committed to hierarchy, the establishment-favored candidate was always the next in line, often the vice president (George H.W. Bush in 1988) or the candidate who had come in second (or a very close third) in the previous contested nomination battle (Ronald Reagan 1980, Bob Dole 1996, John McCain 2008 and Mitt Romney 2012).[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]\u201cThe Republican Party today is very much an outsiders\u2019 party,\u201d Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary for the last anointed president, George W. Bush, said in an interview. \u201cThe mood of the party is \u2018pound the table\u2019 and say \u2018everybody who has been on the inside is part of the problem\u2019. \u201dThe establishment destroyed itself by blundering into the Iraq war and by not preventing the financial crisis of 2007. Those were the precipitating events that gave rise to the Tea Party which ultimately transformed into the Trump movement.\u201cAt a more granular level,\u201d Feehery continued,the so-called influencers distanced themselves from the actual voters, retreating into a bubble and pontificating from their gated communities. This gave rise to the popularity of the conservative media movement, which became the go-to news source. The news from these sources didn\u2019t have to be fully accurate as long as it seemed right.On the plus side, they write,Fox News, talk radio, and right-wing internet sites allow Republicans to communicate with their party\u2019s popular base and help to mobilize conservative activists and voters against the Democratic opposition.On the negative side,the distinctive popular conservative culture that these media outlets both reinforce and promote is also fertile ground for repeated challenges to the party\u2019s existing leadership by self-styled political outsiders \u2014 including, most notably, Donald Trump.Fox, Breitbart, Townhall, The Daily Caller and other right-wing media outlets now perform multiple functions traditionally associated with political parties: candidate screening, the maintenance of ideological conformity, reviewing policy positions and vetting congressional voting.The right-wing media was purposefully created by the conservative wing of the Republican Party, in part to help resolve a basic contradiction in the movement, according to Grossmann and Hopkins:Conservative candidates have also long grappled with the challenge of attracting electoral support for an ideological movement primarily dedicated to the perennially unpopular objective of limiting or rolling back major government programs and social benefits.Crucial to the continued survival of the Republican Party, however, is the fact that when questions about taxes, spending and the role of government are put in generic, symbolic, abstract terms, without reference to specific policies, the majority of Americans take a conservative stance.To counter potential defections to the Democratic Party, according to Grossmann and Hopkins, the right must focus on \u201cconservatism as a brand name, or as a collection of general principles and values,\u201d which is far more popular \u201cthan conservatism as a package of detailed policy positions.\u201dArthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, argued in an email that Trump and other Republican insurgents have been better at mobilizing their troops than the establishment wing of the party. The dissident wing, Lupia wrote, hasused social media to organize its myriad members more effectively. Some mass media outlets, and significant social media players, produce a steady stream of polarizing content that keeps members of the group hyper-vigilant towards real and imagined threats from globalists, foreigners, and the American left.In practical terms, the creation of a new and massive source of campaign support freed candidates to defy the establishment. This is just what the Tea Party did in 2010 and 2014.There is considerable disagreement over whether deregulated campaign finance and the mobilization of the angriest segment of the Republican electorate will inflict permanent damage on the Republican establishment.Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote me by email. \u201cThe establishment, such as it is, still exists, but its influence has been permanently weakened by changes in the media,\u201d not just by conservative media, but by social media that \u201cenables candidates to reach their respective bases in an inexpensive way. Endorsements and money mean less and less.\u201dIdeological media outlets on both the left and right, Tanner argues \u201ccarry more weight than ever before,\u201d displacing establishment influence over candidate selection, because both sides are now more dependent on mobilizing base voters than in persuading the ever-smaller faction of uncommitted voters.A colleague of Tanner\u2019s, Emily Ekins, director of polling at Cato, argued in an email thatIt\u2019s useful to not think of the G.O.P. establishment as a cohesive bloc but rather as a coalition that has been fracturing long before Trump arrived. We saw this with the rise of the tea party, the push to oust former Speaker John Boehner, the House Freedom Caucus, the inability of House Republicans to agree on health care reform, etc. Without cohesion it\u2019s hard for it to control the process.Ekins points out that Trump\u2019s successful defiance of the establishment in winning the nomination has not resulted in the abandonment of policies favored by the traditional power brokers.\u201cWhen it comes to policymaking, traditional establishment priorities appear to maintain influence over agenda setting,\u201d she wrote:Although reforming the tax system and repealing the ACA (Obamacare) are traditional Republican priorities, these were ranked far lower, below a border wall, among Trump\u2019s core set of supporters. So while the establishment may be hanging back such that they avoid conflicts with Trump, they are still engaged in the policymaking process.It is not without irony that the most recent presidential election produced a result that so violated a great many substantive ideas about democracy. From his campaign promises to jail his opponent to his pre-election lamentations that the general electoral contests were rigged to his vows to strip citizens of their rights for expressing unpopular political views, Donald Trump proved to be one of the most hostile presidential candidates toward basic democratic norms in the modern age.How \u201cdid such democratic parties produce such an anti-democratic result?\u201d Azari and Masket ask. Their answer:The parties\u2019 moves toward internal party democracy, we maintain, helped create an environment in which a candidate like Trump could succeed. We believe that several aspects of party democratization are responsible for the inability of the Republican Party to thwart Trump\u2019s candidacy.Put another way, the demotion of Republican power brokers opened the door to the Trump presidency.Voters do not have to listen to elite signals. Elites do not have to listen to each other\u2019s signals. Parties have been stripped (in part by their own actions) of their ability to coordinate and bargain.Not only have party establishments lost their ability to coordinate and bargain, but Trump has successfully pushed the Republican Party elite into a corner. As Masket wrote in an email,Trump has access to a group of voters that they\u2019ve been courting for decades \u2014 working class whites. They\u2019re eager to claim the support of this demographic and, more importantly, terrified to offend it by turning on Trump.The Trump insurgency, in this context, amounted to an internal realignment or revolution within the Republican Party. What is now the party\u2019s largest bloc of voters \u2014 whites without college degrees \u2014 wrested power from the establishment.Trump\u2019s populism was simply the expression of one crucial but underrepresented element of the original conservative coalition, fighting back to achieve some measure of respect and equality.Sarah Treul, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, suggested in an email that by failing to take a firm stand against Trump in the early stages of the Republican primaries,the establishment may have lost its ability to be persuasive in future elections. The insurgence of inexperienced candidates will make it increasingly challenging for the establishment of either party to coordinate around one candidate even if it wants to.All this raises a larger question: Can the Republican Party continue to function over time without an elite establishment?As a first step, Castellanos calls for the renunciation of the traditional establishment, a group that converted the Reagan revolution from a movement into a business and then intoa self-preserving racket. In 2016, the American people judged that Washington Republicans had been poisoned by their success and become the very thing they were sent to the Capitol to change.In Castellanos\u2019s view, the contemporary Republican Party must capitalize on Trump\u2019s successes:He has crushed ISIS and increased our paychecks with a tax cut. He has erased regulations that were growing Washington\u2019s economy at the expense of our economy. He has appointed a respected Supreme Court justice and transformed the judiciary to call balls and strikes.But the party must also steer clear of Trump\u2019s failures:He left behind a vicious inflationary spiral. That, alongside devouring the country\u2019s expectations for a president\u2019s personal conduct, may be the greatest cost of his t. rex presidency.Permanently reorganizing the party around Trumpism will not be an easy task. Castellanos believes that Trump is likelyto be assessed as the bipolar leader he has become, both one of the worst and best presidents Americans have ever elected, perhaps the greatest president to be removed from the Oval Office in chains.Reflecting on the tumult, a Republican strategist who has been involved in campaigns at every level for more than 35 years and who is a dues-paying member of the establishment (and thus did not want his name used to avoid alienating his clients), expressed the contradictions of contemporary Republicanism with precision:The post-Trump world is a Humpty Dumpty story. No one is going to be able to put things back together again.An earlier version of this column misspelled the last name of the director of polling at the Cato Institute; she is Emily Ekins, not Elkins.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stranded French Commuters Could Test Macron\u2019s Reform Agenda", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In what is emerging as the first serious test of the determination of President Emmanuel Macron to stick to his reform agenda, France on Wednesday endured the second day of a train strike that left stations empty, platforms deserted and millions of travelers frustrated.French unions, blindsided by the pace of Mr. Macron\u2019s labor and fiscal reforms, have been spoiling for a fight. The terrain they have chosen, the country\u2019s heavily used rail network, has the potential to either make the president buckle by crippling France\u2019s economy or infuriate its citizens and turn them against the unions.Other French governments have foundered as train strikes have stretched on, and this has the potential to last until June.But if he loses, Mr. Macron risks going the way of predecessors: out the door.On Wednesday, the normally packed Gare de Lyon was echoing and deserted. Someone could have ridden a bicycle unimpeded across the vast halls where passengers habitually fight for elbow room. The tracks were empty of trains, including those ordinarily bound for Marseille and Nice.Grinning, red-jacketed workers of the SNCF \u2014 the national rail company \u2014 who were designated to guide the few bewildered-looking passengers who showed up were outnumbered by them. Only one of seven high-speed trains was running.Hoping to head off public anger, the unions opted for striking the rail system two days out of five. Yet the nonstrike days could be nearly as chaotic, with those left behind piling into the few operating trains.Canceled suburban commuter trains, also hard hit, left travelers stranded at the Ch\u00e2telet station downtown.\u201cIt took me two hours to get to central Paris and now I am stuck,\u201d said Diomande Abou, 28, a computer scientist trying to get to his job in another suburb. \u201cGoing on strike is great, but it blocks everyone and we must go on working.\u201dWith the weather improving, university students across France \u2014 in Toulouse, Montpellier, Nantes, some Paris campuses and elsewhere \u2014 have also begun their habitual springtime walkout, this time to protest Mr. Macron\u2019s intention to make university entrance more selective. Garbage workers are striking and trash is piling up.Mr. Macron has been criticized for not adequately explaining his reform agenda and for not preparing the public enough. But his newest reform target\u2014 the railways \u2014 is in line with what he has criticized before as \u201cthe Statutory Society,\u201d on which he has had a fat bull\u2019s-eye from the beginning. Mr. Macron\u2019s idea is that overprotected entities in French social and economic life block \u201cany prospect of mobility\u201d and must be transformed.His main current objective is a set of special provisions known as the Statute of Railway Workers, alternately decried and celebrated as a corporatist holdout from an earlier era. French railway workers are hired for life, can retire in their 50s \u2014 as young as 52 \u2014 have the right to pensions based on their highest salaries and enjoy subsidized housing.The SNCF is $68 billion in debt, has costs far higher than its German counterpart and runs high-speed trains that are technological wonders but are not very profitable. While these difficulties go well beyond the workers\u2019 statute, it is over that important symbol that Mr. Macron has chosen to stake his fight.\u201cIt\u2019s a symbolic battle, but one that is a key element in defining the future of French society,\u201d said Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a centrist member of Parliament.But the railway workers, led by the once Communist Party-affiliated CGT, broke a government in the 1990s and they have not forgotten. Mr. Macron\u2019s proposed reform would not affect current workers, only future hires. The CGT is fighting it anyway. There is \u201chuge social discontent\u201d the CGT\u2019s leader, Philippe Martinez, said Tuesday, and he intends to take advantage of it.But it remains to be seen whether either that diagnosis or its prescription is correct. For now Mr. Macron appears to have a slight edge over the rail workers. The percentage of employees on strike at the SNCF declined on Wednesday to 29 percent from 33 percent on Tuesday \u2014 \u201cnot a very good sign\u201d for the strike, Mr. Groux said.Polls show that a small majority of French view the strike as unjustified. Mr. Macron\u2019s popularity ratings have risen slightly as a majority declare themselves in favor of his reform plans.And with a series of holiday weekends coming up in May and then national exams in June, \u201cthe risk to the unions is very, very high,\u201d said Mr. Groux.\u201cThere are many, many elements that could make this strike very unpopular indeed,\u201d he said.Mr. Macron has shown no signs of backing down. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told the National Assembly on Tuesday: \u201cI daresay I am just as much hearing the strikers, who are certainly making their feelings known, as those who don\u2019t accept this strike. Specifically those who want to go to work, who want to enjoy their constitutional right to come and go as they please.\u201dAnd Mr. Macron, admonished to hang tough by a passer-by over the weekend, replied simply: \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dMr. Bourlanges, the member of Parliament, predicted that Mr. Macron would win this fight as he has so far won other face-offs with the unions. \u201cHe won\u2019t give up, and the people will finally say, it\u2019s not the president who is preventing us from traveling,\u201d he said.Tanguy Garrel-Jaffrelot contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Shadowy War\u2019s Newest Front: A Drone Base Rising From Saharan Dust", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAIR BASE 201, Niger \u2014 Rising from a barren stretch of African scrubland, a half-finished drone base represents the newest front line in America\u2019s global shadow war.At its center, hundreds of Air Force personnel are feverishly working to complete a $110 million airfield that, when finished in the coming months, will be used to stalk or strike extremists deep into West and North Africa, a region where most Americans have no idea the country is fighting.Near the nascent runway, Army Green Berets are training Nigerien forces to carry out counterterrorism raids or fend off an enemy ambush \u2014 like the one that killed four American soldiers near the Mali border last fall.Taken together, these parallel missions reflect a largely undeclared American military buildup outside the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, often with murky authorities and little public attention, unfolding in remote places like Yemen, Somalia and, increasingly, West Africa.In Niger alone, the Pentagon in the past few years has doubled the number of United States troops, to about 800 \u2014 not to conduct unilateral combat missions, but to battle an increasingly dangerous Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and even loosely associated extremist groups with proxy forces and drone strikes. The military\u2019s missions in Niger are expected to come under scrutiny in a long-awaited Defense Department investigation into the deadly Oct. 4 ambush that is nearing release.\u201cThe base, and the more frequent flights that its opening will allow, will give us far more situational awareness and intelligence on a region that has been a hub of illicit and extremist activity,\u201d said P.W. Singer, a strategist at New America in Washington who has written extensively about drones. \u201cBut it will also further involve us in yet more operations and fights that few Americans are even aware our military is in.\u201dBut the combat \u2014 along with at least 10 other previously unreported attacks on American troops in West Africa between 2015 and 2017 \u2014 underscored the fact that the deadly ambush in Niger was not an isolated episode. Nigerien forces and their American advisers are preparing other major operations to clear out militants, military officials say.\u201cIt\u2019s essential that the American public is aware of, engaged in, and decides whether or not to support American military operations in countries around the world, including Niger,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, who visited Niger with four other senators this month.Six months after the fatal attack, which took place outside the village of Tongo Tongo near the Mali border, the Trump administration stands at a critical crossroad in the military\u2019s global counterterrorism campaign.One path would push ahead with President Trump\u2019s campaign vow to defeat the Islamic State and other violent extremist organizations, not just in Iraq and Syria, but worldwide. The other would be to pull out and leave more of the fighting to allies, as Mr. Trump said he wants to do in Syria, possibly ceding hard-fought ground to militants.During a counterterrorism exercise this past week in north-central Niger that drew nearly 2,000 military personnel from 20 African and Western countries, many officers voiced concerns that America\u2019s commitment in West Africa could fall victim to the latter impulse.\u201cIt\u2019s important to still have support from the U.S. to help train my men, to help with our shortfalls,\u201d said Col. Maj. Moussa Salaou Barmou, commander of Niger\u2019s 2,000 Special Operations forces, who trained at Fort Benning, Ga., and the National Defense University in Washington.In an interview on the sidelines of the exercise, Maj. Gen. J. Marcus Hicks, the head of American Special Operations forces in Africa, put it this way: \u201cThis is an insurance policy that\u2019s very inexpensive, and I think we need to keep paying into it.\u201dBuilding a new base in this remote, landlocked country nearly twice the size of Texas marks the latest chapter in the military\u2019s contentious history of drone operations around the world.It comes as American drone strikes are on the rise again, after tapering off somewhat in places like Pakistan. The number of American strikes against Islamist militants last year tripled in Yemen and doubled in Somalia from the figure a year before.Where American and Nigerien officials see enhanced security in drone operations \u2014 for surveillance, strikes or protecting Special Forces patrols \u2014 others fear a potentially destabilizing impact that could hand valuable recruiting propaganda to an array of groups aligned with Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, and that could increase the militants\u2019 menace.\u201cEliminating jihadi military leaders through drone operations could temporarily disorganize insurgent groups,\u201d said Jean-Herv\u00e9 Jezequel, deputy director of the International Crisis Group\u2019s West Africa project in Dakar, Senegal. \u201cBut eventually the void could also lead to the rise of new and younger leaders who are likely to engage into more violent and spectacular operations to assert their leadership.\u201dA rare visit this month to Air Base 201, the largest construction project that Air Force engineers have ever undertaken alone, revealed several challenges.Commanders grapple with swirling dust storms, scorching temperatures and lengthy spare-part deliveries to fix broken equipment. All have conspired to put the project more than a year behind schedule and $22 million over its original budget.American officials have sought to allay fears of local residents that the base, just two miles outside the city of Agadez, could be a target for terrorist attacks \u2014 not a guardian against them. Rumors circulated that the dozens of dump trucks rumbling in and out of the heavily defended front gates each day were secretly stealing valuable uranium, for which the region is renowned.\u201cWe had to overcome some suspicion and distrust,\u201d said Lt. Col. Brad Harbaugh, commander of the 724th Expeditionary Air Base Squadron, the senior officer here.For centuries, Agadez has been an important way-stop for smugglers, migrants and camel caravans traversing the Sahara. The city of 125,000 people is more than 450 miles from Tongo Tongo, where the American soldiers and Nigerien troops were attacked last fall, but militants have also targeted this region in recent years.In May 2013, Islamist militants staged coordinated attacks, using suicide car bombs to strike a Nigerien military compound in Agadez and a French-operated uranium company in the nearby town of Arlit. Two groups claimed credit for the bombings, which Nigerien authorities said killed at least 24 soldiers and one civilian, as well as 11 militants.President Barack Obama ordered the first 100 American troops to Niger in February 2013 to help set up unarmed surveillance drone operations in Niamey, Niger\u2019s capital, to support a French-led operation combating Qaeda and affiliated fighters in neighboring Mali.Even as those troops deployed, military officials said then that they ultimately wanted to move the drone operations to outside Agadez, closer to Saharan smuggling routes that Islamist militants use to transport arms and fighters from Libya to northern Mali. Runway construction broke ground in the summer of 2016.MQ-9 Reaper drones, made by General Atomics, will be moved to Air Base 201 once its runway and hangars are completed by early next year, as will several hundred American troops. Roughly half of the 800 American forces in Niger \u2014 the second-largest American troop presence in Africa, second only to the 4,000 military personnel at a permanent base in Djibouti \u2014 work here now.Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal, a website run by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies that tracks military strikes against militant groups, said that moving the drone operations to Agadez had two main advantages.First, he said, the base will be more centrally located to conduct operations throughout the Sahel, a vast area on the southern flank of the Sahara that stretches from Senegal to Sudan and has been seized by a growing wave of terrorism and armed conflict.Second, Agadez is more isolated than Niamey. That will help keep the operations more low-key and away from prying eyes.\u201cThe Agadez base has the potential to become the most active counterterrorism hub in Africa,\u201d Mr. Roggio said.The Niger deployment is only the second time that armed drones have been stationed and used in Africa.Drones now based in Djibouti are used in Yemen and Somalia, where there were about 30 strikes last year against Shabab and Islamic State targets \u2014 twice the number in 2016. Drones used against targets in Libya have flown from Sicily, but with a range of about 1,100 miles, the Reapers could not reach militant hide-outs in southern Libya.The United States also flies unarmed surveillance drones from bases in Tunisia and Cameroon.At Air Base 201, building a runway more than 6,800 feet long and 150 feet wide poses severe logistical hurdles. Rock from local quarries is crushed into gravel for the runway\u2019s underlying support. But the rock crushers have broken down, forcing workers at least once to use couriers to hand-deliver spare parts from Paris to avoid weekslong shipping delays.\u201cThere\u2019s no Home Depot downtown here,\u201d said Colonel Harbaugh, 40, an Afghanistan war veteran from Pittsburgh.Runway construction also requires choreographed precision.Dump trucks disgorge piles of wet gravel. A giant grader equipped with a GPS-controlled blade spreads the rock to an exact depth. Steamrollers pace back and forth behind the grader to compact the gravel. To settle properly, the moistened rocks must not dry too quickly, so much of this work is done at night to avoid daytime temperatures that this past week soared to 107 degrees.Later this summer, workers will lay five inches of asphalt atop the rock bed. In all, commanders say they will pave some 39 acres of airfield. While built mainly for the Reaper drones, the runway and adjoining taxiways and ramps must be able to handle much heavier C-17 cargo planes. Three huge hangars capped in a tan fabric covering sprout-like giant mushrooms, visible from miles away. Each can fit one or more drones.Eventually, the plan is to turn Air Base 201 completely over to the Nigerien military. American and Nigerien security forces now jointly patrol the 2,200-acre site. The base cafeteria employs 80 local workers, and the Americans have spent tens of millions of dollars on local rock, concrete, steel, wood and other supplies. Civic leaders and local journalists were recently invited to tour the base.A four-man civil affairs team led by Capt. Andrew Dacey, a former Army infantry platoon leader in Iraq, has worked closely with civic, religious and educational leaders in Agadez to help address the high unemployment and ill-equipped schools \u2014 shortcomings that Islamist extremists can exploit.The team is helping local schools start a metal and wood craftsman apprenticeship that teaches teenage students new skills and supplies classrooms with refurbished desks.\u201cThe base has been very helpful for our security and our economy,\u201d said Mahaman Ali, an inspector for primary schools in the area, pointing to piles of broken desks that will be repaired.And yet doubts still linger about the base\u2019s enduring legacy.\u201cThe deployment of armed drones is not going to make a strategic difference,\u201d said E.J. Hogendoorn, the International Crisis Group\u2019s deputy Africa program director in Washington, \u201cand may even increase local hostility to the U.S. and the central government in distant Niamey.\u201dHelene Cooper and Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why China Is Confident It Can Beat Trump in a Trade War", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s leaders sound supremely confident that they can win a trade war with President Trump.The state news media has depicted him as a reckless bully intent on undermining the global trading system, while presenting the Chinese government as a fair-minded champion of free trade. And China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, has used the standoff to reinforce the Communist Party\u2019s message that the United States is determined to stop China\u2019s rise \u2014 but that it no longer can. China is already too strong, its economy too big.\u201cChina is not afraid of a trade war,\u201d the vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, declared at a news conference to discuss possible countermeasures. More than once, he cited the history of the \u201cnew China\u201d \u2014 which began its extraordinary economic revival four decades ago \u2014 as evidence that it would \u201cnever succumb to external pressure.\u201dMissing in the bluster and the propaganda are the questionable methods that China has adopted to squeeze foreign companies out of key technology markets \u2014 and the fact that in the cold-eyed calculus of economics, China is more vulnerable to a trade war than officials admit.Exports account for a big share of Chinese economic growth. Because the United States buys so much from China, Washington has many more ways to hit Chinese manufacturers. By contrast, the retaliatory tariffs Beijing has proposed already cover more than one-third of what China buys from the United States, leaving it fewer options to strike back.In the political realm, however, Mr. Xi enjoys advantages that may allow him to cope with the economic fallout far better than Mr. Trump can. His authoritarian grip on the news media and the party means there is little room for criticism of his policies, even as Mr. Trump must contend with complaints from American companies and consumers before important midterm elections in November.The Chinese government also has much greater control over the economy, allowing it to shield the public from job cuts or factory closings by ordering banks to support industries suffering from American tariffs. It can spread the pain of a trade war while tolerating years of losses from state-run companies that dominate major sectors of the economy.\u201cMy impression is that there is in Washington an exaggerated sense of how painful these tariffs might be\u201d in China, said Arthur R. Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm in Beijing.At worst, he estimated, the American actions could shave one-tenth of a percentage point off China\u2019s economic growth \u2014 hardly enough to force a drastic reversal of policies, given the enormous benefits that Chinese leaders see in the state-heavy economic model they have relied on in recent decades.At the same time, Chinese officials seem to believe they can take advantage of what they consider vulnerabilities in the American political system.\u201cThe American agricultural sector is quite influential in the Congress,\u201d said Wang Yong, a professor of economics at Peking University, explaining why China has targeted farm products such as soybeans with possible retaliatory tariffs. \u201cChina wants the American domestic political system to do the work.\u201dThe president and his administration have sent drastically different messages this week.But late Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would consider levying an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods in response to its \u201cunfair retaliation.\u201d In a statement, he said, \u201cRather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers.\u201dMr. Zhu, China\u2019s vice minister of finance, this week had thanked American soybean farmers and the association that represents them for declaring their opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s plan.\u201cIf anyone wants to fight, we will be there with him,\u201d Mr. Zhu said, more or less outlining the terms for an American surrender: the removal of unilateral tariffs and a resolution of any grievances through the World Trade Organization. \u201cIf he wants to negotiate, the door is open.\u201dGlobally, China\u2019s strategy has been to isolate the United States, splitting it from allies in Europe and Asia who otherwise share American concerns about heavy-handed Chinese trade policies intended to protect key markets and to acquire technology from foreign firms.Mr. Kroeber said a united front against China would be more effective than American tariffs alone, but so far Mr. Trump has not managed to build one.Instead, Mr. Xi has largely succeeded in occupying the high moral ground on the world stage, projecting China as the sober-minded steward of international agreements on issues \u2014 from global trade to climate change \u2014 that Mr. Trump has been eager to walk away from.\u201cToday, it targets China, and tomorrow may take aim at other countries,\u201d it said.The party has also seized on the trade dispute as new evidence that the United States is intent on undermining China\u2019s rise as a global power, a central narrative used to justify the party\u2019s, and Mr. Xi\u2019s, rule.The document signaled a bipartisan shift in Washington\u2019s posture toward China after decades of economic cooperation and concessions. The party has argued that the United States is only now challenging China because it fears losing its privileged place in the world order.It went on to note that China\u2019s market was now \u201cno smaller or less attractive\u201d than the American one \u2014 a bit of an exaggeration perhaps, but not as big as it would have been a decade ago. And that makes the country a more formidable opponent than Mr. Trump may have anticipated.\u201cTo take China down,\u201d the editorial said, \u201cwould mean an unimaginably cruel battle for the U.S.\u201dOlivia Mitchell Ryan and Echo Hui contributed research.Advertisement"}

On Wednesday, Paul Ryan announced that he would not seek re-election. A midterm defeat, should Mr. Ryan have chosen to run, wasn\u2019t exactly inevitable. But when no less an authority than the speaker of the House of Representatives expressed the desire to rejoin his children, with all the freedom of plummeting rock longing to eat dirt, it confirmed what practically everyone suspects: The Republican Party is in free fall, and its House majority is racing toward annihilation.Mr. Ryan may be oblivious to the ultimate cause of his entirely free and unforced decision to spend more time with his kids, but it is, in a nutshell, Paul Ryan. He is truly the author of his own destiny.Politics isn\u2019t physics, but a governing Republican philosophy that sees it as a moral imperative to slash the budgets of social programs that benefit mainly older and working-class white people is bound, sooner or later, to drive a party of mainly older and working-class white people off a cliff. The slow-motion disaster now unfolding in Washington results in no small measure from Mr. Ryan\u2019s puzzling success in persuading Republican elites that they could flourish as the party of free-market, anti-redistributive convictions.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]Mr. Ryan\u2019s ideas have always resonated with the corporate Republican donor class. But they are indifferent, at best, to the challenges faced by the mass of ordinary Republican voters. For decades, American innovation and growth has been largely concentrating in a handful of big liberal cities. When the recovery finally came, it came to the Democratic metropolis. Most of the sparse Republican outlands never bounced back.Jobs were scarce, opioid addiction was rife, and life felt insecure. Indeed, life expectancy for many rural whites fell. A few red states graced with booming metro areas, like Texas, flourished under Republican regimes of low taxes and light regulation. But in more rural Republican states, like Kansas under Mr. Ryan\u2019s mentor and former boss, Gov. Sam Brownback, taxes had been cut to the bone, and the promised boom never materialized to make up for the loss and degradation of public services.Meanwhile, many tens of millions of loyal Republicans in struggling regions came to rely on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, unemployment insurance and disability benefits just to scrape by. By 2016, the last thing grass-roots Republicans wanted was yet another bloodless, ideologically rigid iteration of the stale Reagan formula. But thanks to the intellectual leadership of dogmatically small-government conservatives like Paul Ryan, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, that\u2019s mostly what they got. Except from Donald Trump.Mr. Trump spotted opportunity in the injured dignity of the Republican base and the feckless irrelevance of the establishment\u2019s agenda. He told Republicans shaken by the reality and risk of downward mobility that they were the only Americans who counted, and that they had been cheated and betrayed.He promised never to cut their Social Security or Medicare, and expressed admiration for single-payer health care. He took their side against immigrant rapists, murderous jihadis, plundering trade deals, dangerous city people and disloyal, condescending elites of all parties and persuasions. He promised to use his billionaire superpowers to rig the economy to their advantage. It didn\u2019t matter that he is a transparently corrupt, bigoted, sexually abusive, compulsive liar. He offered the dignity of recognition, promised to fight, and won.Mr. Ryan, who had dreamed of building a more inclusive party, was sincerely horrified by Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive white-identity politics. But there wasn\u2019t anything he and the Republican establishment could do about it. They had nothing with which to fight the towering inferno of resentment they had kindled through their arrogant, ideologically driven indifference to the pressing needs of the people they claim to represent.As soon as Mr. Trump clinched the nomination, Mr. Ryan became as tame as a poodle. Congressional leaders hoped that Mr. Trump\u2019s need for political cover might make him tractable, and that unified government would enable them to finally set America on the path to broad-based prosperity through tax cuts, entitlement reform and the replacement of Obamacare with something no one had bothered to work out.But the Republican majority was crippled from the start by the fundamental conflict between a government-shrinking agenda and the immediate material interests of Republican voters. Thus, the only thing Mr. Ryan has to show for his meekness in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s corruption and bigotry is an enormous tax cut that leaves the level of government spending basically untouched, except for interest payments on the debt, which the Congressional Budget Office now estimates will outstrip annual military spending in five years.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is bulldozing congressional Republicans into a mass grave. Democrats outnumber Republicans, so the latter depend on a sizable turnout advantage to win elections and sustain minority rule. But Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of scapegoating demagogy, which Mr. Ryan as speaker has done nothing but enable, is a turbocharged Democratic turnout machine that converts swing districts into Democratic seats and converts enormous Republican advantages into razor\u2019s edge contests. Barring a miracle, Republicans are going to lose their House majority, and even their Senate majority, once thought untouchable, is no longer safe.So Mr. Ryan has cornered himself, and his party. The Republican base won\u2019t buy what he\u2019s selling, unless it\u2019s awkwardly grafted onto white-identity populism, which is a self-annihilating strategy for mobilizing Democrats to the polls.The forthcoming implosion of Mr. Ryan\u2019s party, and his imminent retreat to Wisconsin, illustrates the danger of hidebound ideological overconfidence. Party elites in the grip of dogma can\u2019t see the point of checking in with the people they represent and are blind to new problems the partisan catechism is not equipped to comprehend. If a decent Republican Party one day rises from the devastation Paul Ryan practically invited Donald Trump to inflict, it will be one that has stopped legislating for an imaginary world of self-financing tax cuts, having rediscovered and realigned with the basic interests of aging and working-class white suburban and rural American voters. It will take their woes seriously, and nurture their welfare, not their grievance.Will Wilkinson is a contributing opinion writer and the vice president for policy at the Niskanen Center.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fear and Hope in South Korea on Eve of Summit With Kim Jong-un", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 As South Koreans prepare for their president to meet Kim Jong-un on Friday, many are left scratching their heads about the motives of a North Korean leader who has abruptly pivoted from threats of nuclear annihilation to offering warm peace overtures.Many older South Koreans feel they have seen this before: a member of the Kim dynasty gets rewarded for coming to the bargaining table, the talks sputter, and the North goes back to its old ways. But this time, the North\u2019s 34-year-old leader comes equipped with a fearsome nuclear stockpile as he walks into the summit meeting with the South\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in.\u201cThe North Koreans are cheating again, putting up this show so they can buy time and ease sanctions, never intending to abandon their nuclear weapons,\u201d said Kim Chang-guk, 73, who joined other older citizens in downtown Seoul on a recent weekend to protest the inter-Korean summit meeting. \u201cI would rather believe a woman who has given birth to a baby and still insists that she is a virgin than Kim Jong-un.\u201dBut in recent months Mr. Kim has turned on a charm offensive as breathtaking as his bellicosity last year.Choi Hae-jong, 55, who runs a gas station in the provincial city of Ulsan, said he believed that Kim Jong-un would indeed bargain away his nuclear weapons if given the aid and security guarantees that he needed to rebuild the economy.\u201cHe knows he can\u2019t feed his people with nuclear weapons and tanks,\u201d Mr. Choi said.The flurry of diplomacy has left South Koreans guessing at Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions and debating the wisdom of negotiating with him \u2014 and wondering what lies in store for the future of the Korean Peninsula.For generations, it has been an article of faith among South Koreans that they should eventually reconcile and reunify with the North. But after seven decades of division, the capitalist South and the totalitarian North have drifted so far apart that the yearning for reunification is not what it used to be, especially among young South Koreans.\u201cUnlike those in their 60s and older, who still shared a sense of national identity with the North Koreans, many in their 20s merely perceived North Korea as an \u2018enemy\u2019 or a \u2018stranger,\u2019\u201d said a study published last week by Kim Ji-yoon, Kim Kil-dong and Kang Chung-ku for the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, based in Seoul. \u201cMany in their 20s were indifferent to unification and did not view it as an urgent matter.\u201dMr. Kim\u2019s recent behavior has led to some paradoxical findings in public opinion surveys. One poll last month showed that more than 81 percent of South Koreans supported holding a summit meeting with Mr. Kim. But another survey this month showed that more than 70 percent doubted that Mr. Kim would give up his most dangerous weapons.\u201cWhen dealing with North Korea, there is always this nagging feeling that they may stab us in the back again,\u201d said Choi Hae-pyeong, 55, a businessman from south of Seoul.Indeed, many older conservatives fear that North Korea has developed its nuclear weapons to drive American troops from the South and reunify the peninsula under its rule. But others see the North\u2019s nuclear program as rooted in the Kim dynasty\u2019s insecurity following the collapse of the Soviet bloc, which left North Korea more vulnerable and isolated in its standoff against the United States. And a peace deal could be one way out of that predicament.\u201cThe North Korean nuclear and missile problem is a byproduct of hostile relations between the United States and North Korea,\u201d said Lim Dong-won, a former unification minister and intelligence chief of South Korea. \u201cIt can be resolved only in the context of ending the Cold War enmity and establishing peace on the peninsula, through a comprehensive deal of formally ending the Korean War and normalizing ties.\u201dProgressive South Koreans like Mr. Moon argue that the only realistic and peaceful way of removing the North\u2019s nuclear weapons is to persuade the government that it can survive without them. While conservatives prioritize the alliance with Washington, the progressives like to see their country as finally \u201cin the driver\u2019s seat\u201d in managing the precarious situation on the peninsula.\u201cWe are at the crossroads where it will be decided whether denuclearization and permanent peace is possible by peaceful \u2014 not by military \u2014 means,\u201d Mr. Moon said on Monday.Some conservatives, having been burned before, remain deeply skeptical of that approach.\u201cThe current government turned the table, claiming to be \u2018a driver\u2019 just when the North began feeling the pain of sanctions,\u201d Lee Bong-bok, a well-known right-wing expert on North Korea, told the conservative daily Chosun Ilbo.Mr. Trump is the first American leader to agree to sit down with a North Korean leader.\u201cWhen I said I supported President Trump\u2019s election because it would be a great opportunity for us, people called me crazy,\u201d said Mr. Lim, who leads a panel of senior nongovernmental advisers to Mr. Moon. \u201cNo matter what people say about him, here is an American leader who wants to overturn the status quo.\u201dMr. Kim himself has been overturning some of the conventional wisdom about North Korea.His pledge to stop conducting nuclear and missile tests is the kind of concession that would have taken Washington years of haggling to extract from the North in the past \u2014 and only with promises of aid. Mr. Kim announced it Saturday without any conditions attached.Park Sang-min, 39, a marketing official in Seoul, said he sees in the North Korean leader \u201ca confidence and eagerness to negotiate.\u201d\u201cHe has completed his nuclear weapons and long-range missiles so that the Americans would have no option but to take him seriously and pay the prices he wanted,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misidentified a Seoul-based research center.

{"Headline": "Iran Lives on This App", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Derakhshan is an Iranian media analyst who spent six years in an Iranian prison for blogging and online activism.TEHRAN \u2014 If you are Iranian, much of your life for the past few years has depended on a messaging app called Telegram. It has become something of a parallel, but uncensored, internet.Since 2013, Telegram has replaced email, chat, forums, blogs, news websites, e-commerce, social networks, dating services and, for many, even television. With Telegram, Iranians keep in touch with family and friends, read the news, shop, discuss soccer, babies, marriage and politics. It\u2019s the best of Twitter and the most viral videos on YouTube. People use it to download music and films, and, of course, to flirt. They also use it to read speeches from the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who blasts out content over his official channel.Part of the reason Telegram is so popular is it\u2019s easy to use. Another reason is more political: Since the pro-reform protests in 2009, the hard-liners in Iran\u2019s government, working through their allies in the judiciary and security services, have effectively blocked nearly all foreign-based blogging and publishing platforms, social media and messaging apps.Now they want to do the same with Telegram. On March 31, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a hard-line member of Parliament and the head of its National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, announced that Telegram would be blocked for security reasons by the end of April. \u201cThis was a decision made at the highest levels, and Telegram will be replaced by a domestic app,\u201d Mr. Boroujerdi said. A few days later, Abolhassan Firouzabadi, secretary of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, which was established by Ayatollah Khamenei in 2012, appended an unlikely economic case against Telegram, which had announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency: \u201cTelegram is seeking to turn the Iranian economy into an intermediary company, and that will destroy jobs such as in real estate and auto trading,\u201d he said. (Telegram doesn\u2019t plan to offer its cryptocurrency to countries that, like Iran, are under Western or United Nations sanctions.)The story goes back to spring 2014, when millions of Iranians downloaded Telegram after another messenger, Viber, was blocked over alleged ties to Israel by a judicial committee that overseas internet censorship. (Viber was created and run by an Israeli company but was sold to a Japanese company three months before it was blocked by Iran.) Telegram, founded by Russian-born Pavel Durov, was slick, fast and secure. When it added a blog-like feature that allowed everyone to easily publish and share text, videos and audio files, its popularity took off.Initially, this wasn\u2019t a problem for the conservatives. Even the hardliner-dominated state television used Telegram to seek viewer feedback. But then, in early 2016, the situation started to change. During parliamentary elections, moderates ended the conservatives\u2019 more than decade-long grip on the Parliament, despite the fact that some of their best-known candidates had been barred from running by the hardline-dominated Guardian Council. Given that television and radio are run by the state and are staffed mostly by conservatives, the surprising victory was seen by many conservatives as being delivered by the newly popular Telegram. State television turned against the app, and producers were warned not to utter its brand name on air.Tension over Telegram rose to its highest level last May. President Hassan Rouhani, a reformer, was running for re-election. The conservatives thought he could be defeated given the slow economic recovery; after President Trump\u2019s election in the United States, they reasoned, Iranians would be more ready for their own hard-line government.Mr. Rouhani was running on a platform of reviving the economy and expanding social freedoms. This platform encompassed a variety of issues, but those two themes were symbolized, respectively, by his commitment to the 2015 nuclear agreement and by his promises to keep Telegram open.The conservatives weren\u2019t going to take chances. In the months before the vote, conservatives made repeated calls on Mr. Rouhani to either block \u201canti-revolutionary\u201d channels or to shut down access to the messenger entirely. They even arrested a dozen editors of pro-Rouhani channels with hundreds of thousands of members each.During the campaign, state television favored the conservative candidate, Ebrahim Raisi, despite the fact that all candidates were supposed to be given equal airtime and fair treatment. Mr. Raisi had been groomed not just to replace Mr. Rouhani as president for the next four years but also to succeed Ayatollah Khamenei as the next supreme leader.This was more than the hard-liners could take. They had worked for over a decade to secure Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s succession. The ayatollah is almost 80 years old, so a second term for Mr. Rouhani could ruin everything. They blamed Telegram.That wasn\u2019t reasonable, of course. Elections are complicated affairs, and a candidate\u2019s popularity has as much to do with values and narratives as with economics and social policy. Media like Telegram can amplify popularity or dissatisfaction, but they can\u2019t fabricate them entirely.History shows that, too. The 1979 Islamic revolution broke out while its exiled leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was barred from appearing in Iranian news media. But his fiery sermons and messages found their way to huge audiences inside the country through recorded audiocassettes transmitted through phone calls. In 1997, reformists saw how the word-of-mouth, low-tech campaigning techniques brought about a surprising victory for Mohammad Khatami.But the hard-liners don\u2019t want to reconcile with these hard truths \u2014 they want to quash what they see as a dangerous tool.In late December, a wave of protests swept across Iran. The demonstrations, which were largely leaderless and sometimes violent, targeted the reformist president and the hard-line supreme leader alike. Telegram had been used to spread the calls for the protests, and some channels were encouraging violence and vandalism. Mr. Rouhani agreed to block the app temporarily. The ban shook the entire population. It was lifted after only two weeks, as the president had promised. But the hard-liners had found a crack. They have kept pressing the issue.In the months since the protests, hard-liners have used state media to argue for more reasons to ban Telegram, such as the damage it does to the teenage psyche and its threat to families. They also began promoting various native-made messaging apps, which have remained unpopular because of public suspicion about data privacy.Then, some two weeks ago, right before the Persian new year, rumors were spread about Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s unhappiness with Telegram and its monopoly on Iranian cyberspace. That was the lead-up to the recent explicit warnings against it.For Mr. Rouhani, Telegram and the nuclear deal constitute the bulk of his political capital. On both issues, he now seems outmaneuvered by hard-liners \u2014 in Tehran and in Washington. If Telegram is banned, there will still be other ways for reformers to reach their voters. But the damage to Mr. Rouhani and his political allies will be severe. And millions of Iranians will lose their access to an app that has come to mean for them a space free from state control.Hossein Derakhshan is a research fellow at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center.

{"Headline": "Japan Worries It\u2019ll Be Forgotten as Its Allies Talk to North Korea", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Amid hurried preparations for the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s upcoming meetings with the presidents of South Korea and the United States, even the dessert menu is making Japan nervous.Upon learning of plans to serve Mr. Kim a mango mousse decorated with a map of the Korean Peninsula that includes islands over which Tokyo claims sovereignty, Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry lodged an official complaint with its neighbor.What might seem like a petty protest over dabs of icing speaks to long-simmering tensions between the two allies, but also anxiety in Japan that it is being left out as high-stakes talks with Mr. Kim on the fate of his nuclear arsenal begin.The disputed islands, in the sea between Japan and the Korean Peninsula, are known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan. South Korea regularly depicts the islands on official maps, and Japan just as regularly protests.Japan\u2019s unease extends beyond the moussed maps, of course. Given the speed at which the summit-level diplomacy is playing out, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has been working overtime to make sure his country is not forgotten.On Tuesday, in a phone call, Mr. Abe asked President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who will meet with the North Korean leader on Friday, for a similar commitment.In principle, both Mr. Trump and Mr. Moon have agreed to Mr. Abe\u2019s requests. But given how unpredictable at least two of the players are, Japan is by no means assured that it will be happy with the outcome.In general, the Japanese are very skeptical that North Korea would stick to any deal, given its history of going back on commitments to stop its nuclear program.\u201cWe never trust the words of North Korea,\u201d said Tsuneo Watanabe, a senior research fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation in Tokyo. \u201cWhat we can trust is the actions of North Korea. That is probably a sentiment shared among all Japanese, including ordinary citizens.\u201dAnd while Japan is accustomed to dealing with mercurial North Korean leaders, Mr. Trump represents a new volatility from the American side.\u201cWith this President Trump, there is a sense in Japan that he has a little bit different sense of the alliance,\u201d said Fumiaki Kubo, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo.Under Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, said Mr. Kubo, the sense was that \u201cif your ally is in trouble, you feel that you must help your ally. But in this president, if your ally is in trouble, it might suggest that this is a good time for him to exploit this ally.\u201dAnalysts said that Japan\u2019s biggest worry might be an impulsive desire on Mr. Trump\u2019s part to declare a quick victory, even at the cost of Japan\u2019s or the region\u2019s security. Though Mr. Trump has said that he is committed to North Korea\u2019s complete denuclearization, Japan is concerned he might accept something short of that.\u201cI think it may be that the Abe cabinet is still a little nervous that Trump is still going to say, \u2018See, I did it,\u2019 claim a win and walk away,\u201d said Sheila A. Smith, a Japan expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.An editorial in the right-leaning newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun called Mr. Kim\u2019s announcement \u201ca tactic to weaken the pressure of the international community\u2019s sanctions,\u201d adding that \u201cthere was no mention of any intention to abandon nuclear and ballistic missiles\u201d in the statement.Japanese officials \u201care trying to keep the conversation very focused on what \u2018denuclearization\u2019 means,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThe experts that have been here before have had these conversations multiple times. They understand that when Kim Jong-un is talking about denuclearization he doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the same thing that we mean, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure to just put the brakes on, be cautious, make sure you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201dCommentators in Japan speculated that Mr. Trump might also see some value in keeping Japan nervous.Besides the security concerns, the return of the Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and \u201980s is a top priority of Japan and Mr. Abe in particular.Mr. Abe scored what appeared to be a diplomatic victory in Mar-a-Lago when Mr. Trump promised he would raise the issue directly with Mr. Kim.Analysts said that the most Mr. Trump could do is mention the abductees, and that it was extremely unlikely he would insist on any specific action. \u201cYou had Trump voicing and saying the words that Abe wanted him to say,\u201d said Jeffrey W. Hornung, a political scientist at the RAND Corporation.But if Mr. Kim offered, for example, to extend a testing freeze for a year but insisted the United States set aside any demands about the abductees, \u201cwould Trump say, \u2018Nope, sorry, you\u2019ve got to do the abduction issue too?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hornung said.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine Trump, who wants a success here and who really wants the big win, throwing away any big deal on denuclearization or missiles for the sake of a Japanese priority,\u201d he said.Mr. Moon has also said he would raise the issue of the Japanese abductees in his meeting with Mr. Kim on Friday.Although Mr. Kim has said he would not demand the withdrawal of American troops as a prerequisite for discussing the North\u2019s nuclear program, some supporters of Mr. Moon\u2019s liberal administration have long wanted the United States to reduce or withdraw its presence in the South, where about 28,500 American troops are stationed. Such a move would alarm Japan, which benefits from United States military protection in the region.Analysts in Japan also worry that South Korea, in an effort to unify the peninsula, could start to pull away from the United States and be drawn further toward China, a North Korean ally.\u201cIf South Korea becomes a Chinese ally in the most extreme scenario, how can we defend ourselves?\u201d said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.\u201cWe would be put in a very, very difficult position,\u201d Mr. Michishita said. \u201cIf the Korean Peninsula gets inside the Chinese sphere of influence and there are no U.S. forces on the peninsula, life for the U.S. and Japan would be very difficult, but especially for Japan.\u201dHoping to have some say in the course of events, Japan has been seeking to set up its own summit meeting between Mr. Abe and Mr. Kim. So far, the North has not responded.Analysts said that Japan may get its moment if the North indeed comes out of isolation, and starts looking for financial support to fulfill Mr. Kim\u2019s promise of building the country\u2019s economy.\u201cIf North Korea is serious about having a totally different life from now on, they need some financial help from someone and it must be, in the end, Japan,\u201d said Mr. Kubo, the University of Tokyo professor.Japan, which until its defeat in World War II ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony, paid reparations to South Korea in 1965 but has yet to pay any to the North, Mr. Kubo noted. \u201cSo then, logically, they should be interested in talking with Japan in the end.\u201dMakiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

Because Putin has undertaken so many actions in recent years that contributed to the weakening of Russia\u2019s economy and human capital base that you have to wonder whether he\u2019s secretly on the C.I.A.\u2019s payroll.Beginning around 2007 or 2008, Putin appears to have decided that rebuilding Russia by nurturing its tremendous human talent and strengthening the rule of law was just too hard \u2014 it would have required sharing power, holding real, competitive elections and building a truly diverse, innovation-based economy.Instead, Putin decided to look for dignity for Russia in all the wrong places: by tapping his oil and gas wells, not his people; by strengthening the Russian military, instead of the rule of law; and by enriching himself and his circle of oligarchs while wrapping himself in a cloak of Russian Orthodoxy and Russian nationalism that appealed to his base.For all his shirtless bravado, and despite all the recent talk about how Putin is proving to be a successful authoritarian, I have one question: Then why is Putin so insecure about his real popularity in Russia that even after nearly 20 years at Russia\u2019s helm, he was afraid to allow a single credible independent candidate to run against him in the latest presidential election?Here\u2019s the real truth: Putin consistently acts like a farmer who sells his most valuable beef in return for cubes of sugar. That is, he looks for short-term sugar highs to boost his popularity with his Russian nationalist base because he is insecure, and pays for it by giving up real beef, leaving Russia weaker in the long term.Beef for sugar \u2014 not a good trade.For instance, in 2014 Putin seized Crimea and invaded Eastern Ukraine with disguised Russian troops \u2014 to get a short-term sugar boost with the Russian electorate \u2014 and in return, he has had to live with long-term economic banking sanctions imposed by the West that help to slow Russia\u2019s growth.In 2015, to prove that Russia was still a superpower \u2014 another short-term sugar high for his base \u2014 Putin sent advisers, Russian Air Force jets, special operations teams and surface-to-air missile batteries to Syria to prevent the toppling of Russia\u2019s Cold War ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Putin\u2019s support, along with the help of Iran, has just barely kept Assad upright, but for now Putin is stuck in the middle of Syria and can\u2019t get out, lest Assad falls and Putin looks foolish.In Syria, Russia is discovering that winning the war might be easier than winning the peace. Each time President Putin declares victory or announces a drawdown of Russian forces, like he did in December, the fighting flares up with a new intensity and Moscow is required to fly in reinforcements \u2026 Moscow is now struggling to parlay its military gains into an internationally legitimate political settlement that would help Russia recoup its investments in the conflict. For now, Syria remains ungovernable and splintered into fiefdoms run by regional players with their own interests.Putin\u2019s latest beef-for-sugar trade was his apparent ordering of the use of a military-grade nerve agent, produced only in Russia, to poison the former Russian spy Sergei V. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in the English city of Salisbury. The Western response has been what British Prime Minister Theresa May described as the biggest collective expulsion of alleged Russian intelligence officers ever \u2014 over 100 from more than 20 countries.Whether timed or coincidental, the poisoning attack and the Western backlash helped Putin run up his vote totals in his latest phony presidential re-election \u2014 another sugar high. But the morning after, Putin\u2019s Russia is more isolated than ever. Also, Putin\u2019s cronies and other Russian oligarchs \u2014 whose game is to make tons of dirty money in Russia and then take it to London, where it can be laundered for safekeeping \u2014 are now getting more scrutinized than ever by British authorities.Putin\u2019s troubles are nothing I celebrate. I was against NATO expansion; I wanted Russia integrated into the family of European democracies. A weak, isolated and humiliated Russia is a dangerous animal. But to thrive in the long term, Russia needs a \u201creset,\u201d and it can come only from within, but Putin won\u2019t press the button.It\u2019s sad to see a country that gave us Tchaikovsky, Tolstoy, Spassky, Sakharov, Stravinsky, Shishkin, Dostoyevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Pushkin, Nureyev and the Google co-founder Sergey Brin become better known for giving the world Novichok, the deadly Russian nerve agent used in Britain; \u201clittle green men,\u201d the disguised Russian soldiers who seized Eastern Ukraine; and Guccifer 2.0, the Russian cyberagent who hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.It\u2019s all beef for sugar \u2014 and that\u2019s Putin\u2019s legacy.Advertisement"}

He is also editor at large for Inc. magazine.Having more orders than you can fill is generally deemed a high-class problem.Despite demand for 400,000 of its Model 3, Tesla is proving otherwise, and that\u2019s a problem for investors, not to mention the future of electric vehicles.President Trump claims that companies overestimated demand for highly efficient cars such as fully electric vehicles \u2014 E.V.s. Yet consumers\u2019 initial rush to own Tesla\u2019s Model 3, with current pricing starting around $50,000, certainly belies that claim.Yet you want to believe that Mr. Musk can pull this off. He rescued Tesla once before, when the company was days away from running out of cash. And in SpaceX, Mr. Musk has proved that he can run a highly sophisticated private spacecraft company.Tesla\u2019s problem, unfortunately, isn\u2019t rocket science. In some ways it\u2019s more complex.Tesla can\u2019t seem to run an auto production line, something that the Detroit auto companies that Mr. Musk mocks are very good at. Ford\u2019s electric vehicles and hybrids, such as the Fusion Energi, may not match the Tesla Model X in style or speed, but Ford can knock out millions of fenders and hoods in its stamping operations with absolute certainty and to tight specifications.Tesla is operating out of the former G.M./Toyota joint venture plant in Fremont, Calif., which produced more than 400,000 cars annually at its peak. Tesla has been running at a quarter of that rate, and has had to resort to pulling cars off the line and finishing them by hand. That\u2019s not what you call mass production; more like mass confusion.\u201cSo I\u2019m back to sleeping at factory,\u201d Mr. Musk tweeted on April 2. \u201cCar biz is hell.\u201dDiesel is dying; the gasoline internal combustion engine may soon follow. The administration\u2019s latest assault on the environment and our lungs rests partly on the premise that deregulation will make Detroit more competitive. It will do exactly the opposite.When regulation forces an industry to invest in leading-edge technologies, that industry often gains a competitive advantage. E.V.s and ultraefficient internal combustion engines will dominate the auto industry within a decade.If American companies fail to keep up technologically, the domestic auto industry will resemble the 1980s all over again, when Detroit ignored fuel economy to build gas-guzzler S.U.V.s because they were so profitable. When oil spiked again, the Big Three went into a decline that would not end until taxpayers ultimately paid the price in a huge bailout.Auto companies are still free to make monster S.U.V.s, but if they don\u2019t continue to improve efficiency, there\u2019s a real risk they\u2019ll find companies like Volvo and BMW speeding past them. That doesn\u2019t enter the thinking of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt in their shortsighted attack on our health in the name of deregulation. Car buyers love their S.U.V.s; they love their planet and their lungs, too. There\u2019s no reason to trade one for the other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Bannon, Tariffs on China Will Be Ultimate Test of Trump\u2019s Beliefs", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 To Stephen K. Bannon, the political strategist who helped get President Trump elected but no longer speaks to him, the next few weeks will present his former client with the ultimate litmus test.If Mr. Trump stands firm on $150 billion worth of tariffs he has threatened to impose on China, Mr. Bannon said, he will fulfill the promise of his nationalist presidential campaign. If he retreats, because of either a hemorrhaging stock market or a rebellious Republican Party, he will demonstrate that the Trump movement was not much of a movement after all.\u201cThis is going to be a bumpy ride,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in an interview Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll back off because of a couple of bad days in the stock market \u2014 and I do think he\u2019ll have a couple of bad days.\u201dBut Mr. Bannon said he worried about the lack of support for Mr. Trump\u2019s moves within the Republican establishment and about pressure from major party donors like Sheldon G. Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate who has huge investments in the Chinese territory of Macao.\u201cThe donor class and the politicians, from Paul Ryan to Mitch McConnell, have thrown in completely with the \u2018we don\u2019t want a trade war\u2019 crowd,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fear is \u2018What does the money want to do?\u2019\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s moves have already scrambled the political map, winning him improbable Democratic allies like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who said he viewed the president\u2019s moves as \u201ctrade enforcement\u201d rather than a trade war, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who on a visit to China last week dismissed years of trade negotiations with Beijing as a \u201chappy-face story that never fit with the facts.\u201dWith characteristic bravado, Mr. Bannon sees the China showdown as the key to a political realignment in the United States. \u201cThe new politics is not left versus right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is globalist versus nationalist.\u201dSo far, Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals about how far he is willing to press the case against China. On Monday, he vowed to punish Beijing for decades of predatory trade practices, but expressed personal warmth for China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. Over the weekend, he predicted China would take down trade barriers and agree to protect America\u2019s intellectual property, even as the Chinese ruled out any talks in the current charged atmosphere.Where others see inconsistency, Mr. Bannon sees the culmination of three decades of take-no-prisoners trade rhetoric by Mr. Trump. Politicians and scholars may fault his bombastic style, but Mr. Bannon said the president had moved the debate on China, which had been stuck in a cycle of accommodation since China was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001.\u201cFor as much as Trump is mocked and ridiculed, he has played a forcing function in this discussion,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201cMany of the elites, and many of the institutions, have become more much hawkish about China. There are very few cheerleaders anymore.\u201d\u201cIt is Trump and his collection of nationalists who have brought this to the forefront,\u201d he added.Mr. Bannon was the standard-bearer for the nationalists during the 2016 campaign and as the president\u2019s chief strategist before he was ejected from the White House last summer. Though he initially stayed in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces \u2014 talking to him regularly \u2014 the president turned sharply against him after the publication of \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d Michael Wolff\u2019s account of the White House, in which Mr. Bannon is quoted disparaging the president, his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\u201cWhen he was fired,\u201d the president said in January, \u201che not only lost his job, he lost his mind.\u201dIn exile, Mr. Bannon has sought to restyle himself as a kingmaker in Republican politics, backing nationalist candidates in congressional races around the country. But he was dealt a stinging setback in Alabama, after his scandal-scarred prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Roy S. Moore, was defeated in a special election for the Senate by the Democrat, Doug Jones.While Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump have yet to repair their rift, the president\u2019s moves against China represent a policy victory for his excommunicated aide. During his final weeks in the White House, Mr. Bannon kept a whiteboard in his office, on which he had scrawled a calendar for trade actions against China, the European Union and others.The rollout was delayed for a few months after other advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the national economic council, persuaded Mr. Trump that he should not impose tariffs at the same time he was pushing a tax-cut bill, because it would antagonize Republicans on Capitol Hill.Later, Mr. Cohn and Mr. Mnuchin warned the president that protectionist moves would pummel the stock market, which Mr. Trump views as a barometer of his success. That was true last week, when the market plunged over fears of a trade war with China. But Mr. Trump\u2019s more conciliatory tone over the weekend fueled a modest rebound on Monday.Mr. Bannon blamed the news media and Wall Street for fanning fears of a trade war, even as he conceded that the tariffs would drive up the price of some consumer goods in the United States and that China\u2019s retaliation against soybean imports could hurt American farmers.\u201cThe American consumer is going to pay 3 percent more for their products at Walmart,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cEverything is about the American consumer, but what about the American worker?\u201dAlthough Mr. Bannon is gone from the White House, officials there still share his views, not least Peter Navarro, the director of trade and industrial policy. An economist whose books include \u201cDeath by China,\u201d Mr. Navarro is the intellectual driver of the trade policy.For Mr. Bannon, the trade dispute is part of a larger narrative about how China has systematically exploited the United States, building up its middle class on the backs of American workers by exporting the overcapacity in its steel and other industries. China, he said, posed a far greater threat to the United States than Japan, the Soviet Union or any other historic rival.\u201cFor 20 years, we\u2019ve not confronted the most significant threat this country has faced,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time in our history where we really have a competitor with an economy that could be vastly larger than ours.\u201dChina, moreover, has dedicated itself to dominating next-generation industries like artificial intelligence and robotics. It is waging economic and information warfare against the United States \u2014 a step short of actual war, though he said that was now more likely than in 2016, when he predicted, \u201cWe\u2019re going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years.\u201d\u201cThis is far greater than trade; this is far deeper than tariffs,\u201d Mr. Bannon said of the coming confrontation with China. \u201cThis is about a confrontation, on a global scale, between two systems.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Does Kim Jong-un Want? U.S. Fears Answer Is \u2018Give a Little, Gain a Lot\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 As North Korea\u2019s reclusive ruler, Kim Jong-un, prepares for a landmark meeting with President Trump, he has seized the diplomatic high ground, making conciliatory gestures on nuclear testing and American troops that have buoyed hopes in South Korea and won praise from Mr. Trump himself, who called it \u201cbig progress.\u201dBut Mr. Kim\u2019s audacious moves are unsettling officials in the United States, Japan and China. Some suspect he is posturing in advance of the summit meeting, as well as a separate meeting this coming week with South Korea\u2019s president, and has no real intention of acceding to demands that he relinquish his nuclear weapons.They worry that his gestures could put Mr. Trump on the defensive in the difficult negotiations to come, by offering symbolically potent but substantively modest concessions in place of genuine disarmament \u2014 what one senior American official labeled a \u201cfreeze trap.\u201dThe sudden offer of olive branches, from a leader who only four months ago warned the United States that he was ready to launch missiles from a nuclear button on his desk, is sharpening a question that has long bedeviled North Korea watchers: What does Mr. Kim want?In Washington, most officials and experts believe that the North Korean leader is determined to cement his country\u2019s status as a nuclear state while escaping the chokehold of economic sanctions. His concessions on nuclear testing and the presence of American troops in South Korea, they said, are calculated to prod the United States into easing such penalties, even before the North dismantles its arsenal.\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize the Korean War has not ended,\u201d Mr. Trump said with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan sitting next to him. \u201cIt\u2019s going on right now. And they are discussing an end to the war. So, subject to a deal, they would certainly have my blessing.\u201dMr. Abe pointedly did not echo those sentiments. Japan is deeply skeptical of Mr. Kim\u2019s motives, and worried that its security concerns may not be taken into account in any agreement between either North and South Korea, or North Korea and the United States.Japanese officials dismissed North Korea\u2019s announcement that it was suspending nuclear and missile tests as \u201cnot sufficient\u201d because it did not clearly state whether it included the short- and midrange missiles that are capable of hitting Japanese territory.\u201cJust because North Korea is responding to dialogue, there should be no reward,\u201d Mr. Abe said after spending two days with Mr. Trump at his Palm Beach estate in Florida, Mar-a-Lago. \u201cMaximum pressure should be maintained, and actual implementation of concrete actions towards denuclearization will be demanded.\u201dEven China, which is accustomed to controlling its relationship with North Korea without interference from other powers, is chafing at the speed of events, and the increasingly warm feelings between Pyongyang and Washington. Chinese officials fear that they will be sidelined in negotiations and that Mr. Kim will pursue a deal with the United States that places the North closer to Washington than Beijing.Much of the anxiety in Tokyo and Beijing stems from the unpredictability of the main players. Mr. Trump, who threatened in August to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the North, is now talking about \u201cgood will\u201d between Washington and Pyongyang. Mr. Kim has proved more adroit than many expected in orchestrating the diplomatic opening to South Korea and the United States.\u201cThey\u2019re doing a great job of appearing reasonable, but picking apart the maximum pressure campaign, and positioning themselves to be accepted as a nuclear weapons state in the future,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.Adding to the uncertainty is the flux on Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team. Days after accepting Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to meet, the president fired his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, was forced to step down.Now, Mr. Trump has entrusted the diplomacy to Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, whom he nominated to replace Mr. Tillerson and who is embroiled in a difficult Senate confirmation process. Mr. Pompeo traveled secretly to Pyongyang over Easter weekend to meet Mr. Kim, bringing along only aides from the spy agency.Mr. Pompeo raised the issue of the detained Americans, according to a senior official. But much of his one-day visit was devoted to logistical issues, like the venue and date for a meeting, which is expected in late May or early June. The lack of involvement by the White House or the State Department, another official said, has limited the amount of substantive preparation for the meeting with Mr. Kim.General McMaster\u2019s hawkish successor, John R. Bolton, is another wild card. Two weeks before he was recruited as national security adviser, he said a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim was useful only because it would inevitably fail, and then the United States could move swiftly on to the next phase \u2014 presumably a military confrontation.\u201cIt could be a long and unproductive meeting, or it could be a short and unproductive meeting,\u201d he said on Fox News.Since entering the White House, however, Mr. Bolton has stuck to a traditional definition of his job, brokering proposals to present to Mr. Trump, officials said. Even among officials who worry about war, there is sympathy for his view that \u201cfailing quickly\u201d would be valuable. The United States, they said, should flush out Mr. Kim\u2019s intentions before he has another six months or a year to master intercontinental ballistic missiles.Mr. Bolton\u2019s presence has also not stopped Mr. Trump from praising Mr. Kim and voicing optimism \u2014 even excitement \u2014 about their looming encounter. On Friday, he tweeted, \u201cNorth Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World \u2014 big progress! Look forward to our Summit.\u201dThe administration viewed Mr. Kim\u2019s statement about halting nuclear tests as more intriguing than his acceptance of a continuing American troop presence because he made it to his own people. Still, they noted his unwillingness to rule out short- and medium-range missiles, which they said could divide Japan from the United States.Officials also acknowledged the challenge of staying in sync with Mr. Moon, who is acting as a mediator between the United States and North Korea and who is deeply invested in ending years of estrangement between the North and South.Mr. Moon contends that it would not be difficult to broker a \u201cbroad\u201d agreement between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim in which North Korea commits to giving up its arsenal and the United States makes security guarantees, including a peace treaty and normalized ties, and offers aid that Mr. Kim needs to rebuild his economy.South Korea envisions a sequential process, starting with an agreement to freeze North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and ending with total denuclearization. The North, officials said, will insist that for each step it takes, the United States offer reciprocal incentives.Such an approach is not new: The George W. Bush administration tried it with Mr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, in 2005. But the process could be open-ended if North Korea and the United States, mistrustful of each other, haggle each step of the way, as they did then.The key to success, South Korean officials said, is if North Korea and the United States can agree to narrow the time span between the initial freeze, which Mr. Moon has called \u201cthe entrance,\u201d and complete denuclearization, which he calls \u201cthe exit.\u201dSouth Korean officials are banking on Mr. Kim\u2019s desperate desire to improve the economy and Mr. Trump\u2019s need for a diplomatic victory before the midterm elections in November.Once they reach a broad deal, analysts said, Mr. Kim could move to dismantle production facilities for intercontinental ballistic missiles and allow access to nuclear sites in the North; the two leaders could exchange liaison offices in Pyongyang and Washington; and Mr. Trump could ease sanctions, especially those that affect ordinary North Koreans.Like their American counterparts, South Korean officials do not believe that Mr. Kim will swiftly relinquish his nuclear weapons. But there is a growing belief in Seoul that he might ultimately bargain them away, if it helps him rebuild the economy. That is why some in South Korea viewed his announcement on testing as a hopeful sign.\u201cIt means that North Korea is willing to give up an ICBM capability that threatens the United States,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior North Korea analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank in South Korea. \u201cThis is why it is good news for the Trump administration.\u201dFollow Mark Landler on Twitter: @MarkLandlerMark Landler reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Deutsche Bank is finally, and drastically, shrinking itself.\u2022 Facebook can afford to clean up its act.\u2022 Is the problem with I.P.O.s a \u2018middle-market tax\u2019?\u2022 On today\u2019s earnings calendar: Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Lazard.Since the financial crisis a decade ago, the German institution\u2019s giant investment banking operations have lagged well behind those of its rivals. And Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems had relevance well beyond the trading desks of Wall Street; its difficulties have at times pumped uncertainty into the global financial system. Deutsche Bank\u2019s post-crisis behavior stands in contrast to that of other European investment banks that had also become risky and bloated before the 2008 meltdown. Switzerland\u2019s Credit Suisse and UBS made hard decisions several years ago that helped them adapt to new realities. But Deutsche Bank wavered and delayed. And since this probably won\u2019t be the last time that a too-big-to-fail bank takes too long to fix itself, it\u2019s worth asking why Deutsche Bank dragged its feet. Some reasons follow:- Peter EavisDeutsche Bank\u2019s decision to end its Wall Street ambitions should benefit its American rivals.The German lender said on Thursday that it was scaling back operations such as trading and providing services to hedge funds. According to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to shrink its investment banking business should \u201chelp industry pricing and provide a revenue opportunity\u201d for United States banks.Deutsche Bank\u2019s scale of tradingLast year Deutsche Bank had a 7.7 percent share of the trading in bonds, currencies and commodities, and a 5.1 percent share of stock trading.Deutsche Bank reported \u20ac4.4 billion in revenue from fixed-income trading last year and another \u20ac2.1 billion from equity trading. Of the combined \u20ac6.5 billion in revenue it generated, 40 percent came from the United States, according to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Which banks stand to benefitJPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup should get a lift from Deutsche Bank\u2019s pull back from fixed-income trading. The three banks\u2019 market share of fixed-income trading is nearly 50 percent.For stock trading, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have about 45 percent of the market.Amazon\u2019s profit more than doubled during the first quarter, while Microsoft\u2019s earnings jumped 35 percent. A driver for both companies was their cloud-computing businesses.Amazon\u2019s numbers\u2022 The e-commerce giant reported a profit of $1.6 billion, up from $724 million a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $3.27. Analysts expected $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $49.78 billion.\u2022 Operating income increased 92 percent to $1.9 billion in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales for Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing business, increased 49 percent to $5.4 billion.Critic\u2019s corner\u201cSales have more than doubled in five years, but it\u2019s taking more fixed assets to get there. Amazon now uses property and such with less efficiency than Walmart.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s numbers\u2022 The software giant posted a profit of $7.42 billion, up from $5.49 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at 95 cents. Analysts expected 85 cents per share.\u2022 Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.82 billion, beating expectations of $25.77 billion.\u2022 Operating income rose 23 percent to $8.3 billion.\u2022 Revenue at Azure, Microsoft\u2019s could-computing business, surged 93 percent.Shares of Amazon climbed 7 percent after hours, while Microsoft\u2019s stock rose 2.1 percent.Critics\u2019 cornerSince hitting an intraday low of $150.80 on March 28, the stock has climbed 15 percent and reclaimed more than $60 billion in market value.Ross Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes:\u201cWe don\u2019t think 1Q marks the \u201call clear\u201d for FB shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period (next week\u2019s f8 should also help move the conversation back to innovation to some degree). Stepping back, FB\u2019s valuation is attractive vs. its peers, and while we fully expect more tape-bombs in 2018 we think patient investors will be rewarded at current levels when sentiment eventually improves.\u201dFacebook\u2019s first-quarter earnings featured a 63 percent jump in profit and a 49 percent rise in revenue. And roughly 70 million new monthly active users.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: If Facebook wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can: Its operating earnings are equivalent to 46 percent of its revenue. But its expense numbers haven\u2019t provided clear evidence that the company is going the extra mile yet.The key assessment, from the Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser:\u201cAll the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line.\u201dThe chipmaker reported results Wednesday that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The conference call that followed provided analysts an opportunity to ask about where Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP stands. The deal is awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, but growing trade tension between China and the United States has increasingly put the deal in doubt.Here is what Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said on the call:\u201cWe continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we expect to ultimately receive approval. And I\u2019ll just remind folks that we have 8 of 9 jurisdictions that have already ruled on it. So although we \u2014 we remain committed to it. And we think it\u2019s going to get done. However, if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the ability to move very rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the January time frame. I\u2019ll just remind everyone that we did a 90-day extension to the merger agreement. And we\u2019re going to work very hard to get that done. And if it doesn\u2019t get done, we\u2019re going to move on to another approach. So hopefully, that answers the question.\u201dA bit later in the call Mr. Mollenkopf added:\u201cWith respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is such that really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher-level discussions between the countries as opposed to any individual issue related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and work through any issues that pop up. But I think the environmental issues between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything else. But obviously, we work closely with the regulator.\u201dIt\u2019s not just regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley that put smaller companies off public listings, argues Rob Jackson, a Democratic S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that they pay on average 7 percent of proceeds raised in their offerings, way more than bigger clients.\u201cWith the deck stacked against them, it\u2019s no wonder that middle-market I.P.O.s have been on a steady decline. And this has had real effects across our economy, which is now dominated by fewer, and larger, public companies than ever before.\u201dHe suggests the S.E.C. should make underwriters disclose more about the costs of going public, including companies\u2019 potential losses from underpricing, and that bankers should do more to explain why they\u2019re worth their fees.What Jeffrey Lurie, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, said, according to the NYT:\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else.\u201dBob Kraft of the New England Patriots, a friend of Mr. Trump, said:\u201cThe problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don\u2019t feel is in the best interests of America.\u201dThere\u2019s no question that it will help make sense of Randall Stephenson\u2019s expansion of AT&T into the pay-TV market and improve AT&T\u2019s positioning and value proposition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Allies Brace for Trade War as Tariff Negotiations Stall", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 A few weeks ago, it felt as if a trade war pitting the United States against allies like Australia, Canada and the European Union was over before it even began. The Trump administration dispensed so many temporary exemptions to steel and aluminum tariffs that many countries figured the threats were just political theater.But with only days left before the exemptions expire and punitive tariffs take effect, it\u2019s dawning on foreign leaders that decades of warm relations with the United States carry little weight with a president dismissive of diplomatic norms and hostile toward the ground rules of international trade.What began as a way to protect American steel and aluminum jobs has since become a cudgel that the Trump administration is using to extract concessions in other areas, including car exports to Europe or negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.As a May 1 deadline looms, the decision on whether to grant permanent exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs, and to whom, appears likely to come down to the whims of President Trump, who has seesawed between scrapping and rejoining global trade deals.The European Union, the United States\u2019 biggest trading partner, indicated over the weekend that it was losing hope of reaching an agreement in the face of what many of the region\u2019s political leaders regard as unreasonable demands. While a last-minute extension of the deadline is still possible, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who each met with President Trump in Washington last week, spoke with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain over the weekend about enacting retaliatory tariffs if the European Union did not receive an exemption.The uncertainty is sowing chaos in international supply networks. Car companies and other manufacturers do not know whether ships carrying steel may suddenly be barred from American ports.Some countries are confident they will avoid the tariffs. Australia is treating an exemption as if it\u2019s a done deal. Brazil, which primarily exports slab steel to American manufacturers, is hoping to escape by agreeing on limited quotas for more sophisticated products. Argentina is counting on the good relationship between its president, Mauricio Macri, and Mr. Trump.\u201cIn the conversations that we have on the issue, the positive relationships between our governments \u2014 and our presidents \u2014 certainly comes up,\u201d Miguel Braun, Argentina\u2019s trade secretary, said in an interview.But it\u2019s unclear whether the confidence is justified. The White House has not confirmed that Australia, Brazil or Argentina will receive exemptions.In terms of the potential disruption to the global economy, the dispute with Europe may be the most critical. The United States and the European Union account for about one-third of world trade.Only a few years ago the United States and Europe were discussing the possibility of eliminating almost all trans-Atlantic trade barriers. Now they are stymied by fundamentally different worldviews. As the Europeans see it, Mr. Trump is demanding concessions that would make them accomplices in dismantling a postwar trade framework they hold sacred.The Europeans want to play by the rules of the World Trade Organization; the Americans are making demands that would force the Europeans to break them.\u201cIf we stick to the rules,\u201d said Thiess Petersen, an analyst at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Germany, \u201cthere is no chance for concessions.\u201dGerman cars, a particular target of presidential ire, are one of the major sticking points.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been handling talks with the European Union, has been pushing the 28-nation bloc to reduce its tariffs on imported American cars as one way of cutting its trade surplus with the United States. In a recent interview with CNBC, Larry Kudlow, the chief economic adviser, said that the United States wanted more concessions before it granted a permanent exclusion.But if the European Union accepted the demand for lower car tariffs, international treaties would require it to apply similar terms to automobiles from all other members of the World Trade Organization.The biggest beneficiary might be China. A member of the W.T.O., China is keen to become an auto exporter and would be thrilled to get easier access to Europe without giving up anything in return.The Europeans are offended that they are being asked to negotiate in the first place. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, said last week that the union would discuss terms of trade with the United States only after it had received a permanent and unconditional exemption to the steel and aluminum tariffs.\u201cWhen that is confirmed by the president,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom told reporters in Strasbourg, France, \u201cwe are willing as always to discuss anything. But we are not negotiating anything under threat.\u201dIn an extension of the disconnect between the two NATO allies, the president has expressed annoyance that he can\u2019t just bypass the European Union apparatus altogether and work out deals with favored leaders like Mr. Macron. That approach would be illegal under the E.U. treaty and undermine one of the bloc\u2019s fundamental principles \u2014 that all the members act in unison on trade matters.\u201cI would rather deal just with France,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House on April 24, ahead of a visit by Mr. Macron. \u201cThe Union is very tough for us. They have trade barriers that are unacceptable.\u201dDavid O\u2019Sullivan, the European Union ambassador to the United States, said that if tariffs go into effect, \u201cwe are back to the need to pursue this with the World Trade Organization, including the possibility of imposing rebalancing counter-tariffs on equivalent U.S. exports.\u201dThe E.U. has already drawn up a list of products targeted for retaliation. They are meant to inflict maximum pain on the Republican heartland, including recreational power boats made in Tennessee, digital flight recorders made in Arizona and playing cards made in Kentucky.But the strategy may not be effective. Business leaders who have visited Washington recently said that the president had been unmoved by protests from members of his own party.Other countries have already been denied exemptions and started paying tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. They include China and Russia as well as Japan, a close ally.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan refused to be coerced into one-on-one negotiations, instead trying to coax the United States back into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal Mr. Trump left last year.\u201cOur country\u2019s position is that T.P.P is best for both of the countries, and based on that position we will be approaching the talks,\u201d Mr. Abe said in mid-April.Mr. Trump was not persuaded. After briefly considering rejoining the trade agreement, he reversed course, writing on Twitter that the deal had \u201ctoo many contingencies.\u201dThe direct impact of the tariffs on world trade, assuming they take effect, will be minimal, economists say. Though steel plays a big role in the public imagination, it accounts for a sliver of global commerce.Economists are more worried that a trade war will escalate. Many of the effects will be difficult to predict.\u201cWhen two elephants fight,\u201d said Miguel Ponce, head of Argentina\u2019s Center for the Study of Foreign Trade in the 21st Century, \u201cit is the grass that suffers the most.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Berlin, and Ana Swanson from Washington.

{"Headline": "As Deficits Mount, Amendment to Require Balanced Budgets Fails in House", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With tax rates falling, spending rising and deficits soaring, House Republicans dusted off a long-debated proposal on Thursday to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget \u2014 only to watch it fail.In the abstract, the vote on Thursday was an opportunity for Republicans in the House to demonstrate their concern for the government\u2019s fiscal health, even if recent actions by their party suggest otherwise. But the symbolic move was derided on both sides of the aisle.\u201cIt is an effort to fool the American people into believing that this Congress is financially responsible when quite clearly, based on the votes of the past year, it is wholly and completely irresponsible,\u201d said Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama, who nonetheless voted for the proposal.Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a group backed by the Koch brothers, was similarly unimpressed.\u201cIf lawmakers think they can use a balanced-budget amendment as a fig leaf of fiscal responsibility after just voting for such an irresponsible spending bill,\u201d he said, \u201cthey should think again.\u201dIt has been a painful few months for those worried about growing budget deficits. In December, Republicans celebrated the passage of an overhaul of the tax code, which the Congressional Budget Office now says will add nearly $1.9 trillion to budget deficits from 2018 to 2028, a figure that includes lost revenue as well as additional interest costs.\u201cThis Congress and this administration likely will go down as one of the most fiscally irresponsible administrations and Congresses that we\u2019ve had,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, observed this week.Yet on Thursday afternoon, House Republicans took to the floor of their chamber to proclaim the peril of the rising national debt, which has topped $21 trillion. For Republicans, the debate over the proposal amounted to an opportunity to vent \u2014 but not much more than that.Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and the proposal\u2019s sponsor, said the constitutional amendment would apply needed \u201cexternal pressure\u201d to force Congress to make difficult decisions \u2014 a \u201cstop me before I kill again\u201d argument that has long propelled the balanced budget amendment.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to stop saddling future generations with the burden of crushing debts to pay for current spending,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said. \u201cWe should not pass on to our children and grandchildren the bleak fiscal future that our unsustainable spending is creating.\u201dBut the attempted display of fiscal responsibility did little to soothe some conservative critics of the Republicans\u2019 recent spending spree.\u201cThe base does not want to see a stupid bad bill and then go get patted on their head,\u201d said Adam Brandon, the president of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group.Amending the Constitution to require the federal government to have a balanced budget has been discussed for decades, and proposed amendments failed in the House and Senate in 2011. The vote held on Thursday fulfilled a commitment that the Republican leadership in the House had made to conservative lawmakers last year.But Democrats assailed Republicans for preaching fiscal responsibility not long after voting for a tax bill that is projected to widen deficits. They warned that the proposal, if it ever became reality, would lead to deep cuts to Social Security and Medicare, programs that are driving up spending as the population ages.\u201cLike some stormy sermon from Trump on the virtues of chastity, I believe these House Republicans today really do deserve a gold medal for hypocrisy,\u201d said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas.In addition, economists critical of the idea of a balanced-budget amendment argue that it would essentially tie the hands of the government in the event of a recession, making economic conditions even worse.\u201cIt would force the government to kick the economy when it was down, because it would force the government to raise taxes and cut benefit programs, or any other type of spending, when times were bad \u2014 which is exactly the opposite of what you want to do,\u201d said Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization.In another sign of the discomfort being felt by Republicans over the recent spending bill, the White House and congressional Republicans \u2014 including Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader \u2014 have been discussing whether to try to rescind some previously approved spending.Using procedures laid out in a 1974 budget law, such an effort could pass the Senate with only a majority, allowing Republicans to sidestep Democrats whose votes were needed to pass the spending bill last month.But even that would be a difficult threshold to reach, given the Republicans\u2019 razor-thin majority in the Senate. The idea of clawing back already-approved funding has quickly run into resistance from some Republican lawmakers who are not eager to chip away at what had been a painstakingly negotiated spending plan.Lawmakers are already looking toward coming up with spending legislation for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. By going back on what had been a bipartisan agreement, future negotiations would presumably become more difficult.On Thursday, House Republicans also unveiled their farm bill, which includes significant new work requirements for recipients of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food aid for around 40 million low-income Americans.Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Was Wrong\u2019: Armenian Leader Quits Amid Protests", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Ten days of demonstrations that escalated throughout Armenia forced the resignation Monday of the man who has led the country for the past decade, creating the latest crisis in a post-Soviet state trying to overcome a legacy of weak democratic rule.The unexpected resignation prompted scenes of jubilation in the capital, Yerevan, and other cities. Tens of thousands of people flocked to the central Republic Square in Yerevan, where all afternoon and into the night they danced, cheered and waved the Armenian flag, a striped tricolor of red, blue and orange.Serzh Sargsyan, president since 2008, reached his legal two-term limit earlier this month. A constitutional referendum in 2015 had transferred most presidential powers to the role of prime minister, however, and the Parliament, dominated by his right-wing Republican Party, swiftly voted him into the post with no other candidate given a chance.\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Mr. Sargsyan said in a brief resignation statement carried by the official news agency. \u201cThe street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand.\u201dThousands of incensed Armenians, most of them young, swarmed through Republic Square starting on April 13. The protests gradually spread to other major cities in the tiny southern Caucasus nation, including Gyumri and Vanadzor.The pressure on Mr. Sargsyan, 63, to resign ratcheted up markedly on Monday after soldiers from one company of the country\u2019s prestigious peacekeeping force, which had served abroad in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo, joined the march in Yerevan in their uniforms.Mr. Sargsyan had promised last year not to try to extend his tenure in office by becoming prime minister when his presidential term ended.Karen Karapetyan, who had just left the post of prime minister to make way for Mr. Sargsyan, stepped in as acting prime minister.The rapid events threw the country into disarray. The new Constitution invests considerable power in the Parliament, and some expected snap elections to be called.The demonstrations were fueled by a new generation of Armenians disenchanted with the small elite of politicians and their oligarch allies who have long controlled the government and much of the economy, analysts said. The protesters dismissed the standard argument that Armenia needed unvarying leadership to negotiate an end to the conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan and to deal with the tense relations with Turkey on the other side.\u201cThere is a new generation that wants change,\u201d Mr. de Waal said. \u201cThe problem is that they do not really have a leader.\u201dNikol Pashinyan, the opposition member of Parliament who led the protests, lacks a party and a large constituency.Mr. Sargsyan agreed to meet with Mr. Pashinyan on Sunday but stormed out of the meeting within minutes, claiming he was being blackmailed. Then Mr. Pashinyan and two of his opposition allies were detained overnight, after scores of demonstrators were also detained. The three opposition leaders figures were released on Monday.Mr. de Waal compared the protesters to the professional, urban elite who turned out to protest President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s re-election in 2012 after he served as prime minister for one term to avoid term limits. Some Armenians even referred to their leader\u2019s maneuver as \u201cpulling a Putin,\u201d Mr. Giragosian of the Regional Studies Center said.Unlike Armenian leaders, however, Mr. Putin cracked down hard, sending in the riot police and making an example of some protesters with lengthy jail sentences. Any sign of government change through protests, like that in Ukraine, makes the Kremlin jittery, so the protests in Armenia garnered scant attention on Russian state television until Mr. Sargsyan resigned.Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, praised the transition for being peaceful, saying, \u201cArmenia, Russia is always with you!Armenia, a Soviet state until declaring independence in 1991, remains a close partner of Russia in a volatile region, with a Russian military base at Gyumri. It has been locked for two decades in a low-grade war with Azerbaijan, another former Soviet republic, over control of a disputed enclave called Nagorno-Karabakh. Some Armenians accuse Russia of fueling a new outbreak of the fighting in 2016 by selling arms to both sides.Azerbaijan has long exploited unrest in Armenia to try to make gains in the conflict, which may be one reason Mr. Sargsyan acted swiftly, analysts said. Beyond that, the start of his presidency in 2008 was marred by street protests in which 10 people were killed and 100 injured \u2014 so he was determined to keep the peace this time, they said.Apart from political and territorial tensions, the country also has suffered from a rocky economy in recent years. Armenia depends heavily on remittances from its diaspora, which grows by some 50,000 people annually, said Andrei G. Areshev, a researcher on the Caucasus at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.Armenians working in construction and other manual jobs in Russia were hit hard by the devaluation in the ruble in 2015, but they sent home $1.07 billion last year, according to records from the Central Bank. As prime minister, Mr. Karapetyan had helped the economy grow by fostering a technology sector, among other steps.Given that most key government officials, including the acting prime minister, are Sargsyan allies, it is unclear that his resignation will bring any immediate change, or what he protesters might do next.\u201cThe government hoped the tide would die down, but the opposite happened,\u201d Mr. Iskandaryan said in Yerevan.Neil MacFarquhar reported from Moscow and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from London.

{"Headline": "Facebook Is Creepy. And Valuable.", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneOne of the most telling moments in the spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s congressional testimony last week was when Representative Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, warned the co-founder of Facebook of what Congress was likely to do about its multiple concerns surrounding the social network. \u201cCongress is good at two things: doing nothing, and overreacting,\u201d he said. After years of the former, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re getting ready to overreact.\u201dThat sounds worrisome. But I sympathize. Doing nothing and overreacting make sense when you have no clue of what is going on. And we don\u2019t. The cloud of questions aimed at Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 Is Facebook too dominant? Does it censor information? Whom does it share our data with? Does it help sell OxyContin? \u2014 suggests that we don\u2019t really know what the problem with Facebook is. It also suggests we don\u2019t understand what Facebook does.That goes for the entire data-driven ecosystem, from Google to the auto companies riddling your car with sensors that can tell where you\u2019ve been and how fast you got there. And that puts policymakers in an uncomfortable spot.The crucial issue for Congress, government regulators, members of the public and even Mr. Zuckerberg is how much all this data-driven stuff is worth to us. What do we stand to lose by, say, sharply limiting the data these companies can collect? What do we stand to gain?We don\u2019t know.\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the value to us of the new data economy nor the risks it entails,\u201d said Leonard Nakamura, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who has studied the economic impact of data. \u201cWe just let it rip and now are trying to catch up.\u201d Unfortunately, we have only rudimentary tools to measure the good and the bad.As the data-driven economy continues evolving at breakneck speed, catching up may be beyond our reach; we will build the guardrails by trial and error. The risk is that policy will be driven mostly by fear.What is the problem with Facebook? Clearly Moscow\u2019s use of the platform to spread fake news and warp the 2016 elections is one problem. Allowing data from tens of millions of users to flow, without their knowledge, to a political consultancy working for Donald Trump is another.But the raw business models of the colossi of the data economy are creepy in and of themselves. Start with the sheer scale of personal data scooped up by Facebook, often without users\u2019 knowledge. The platform not only harvests the data you share with the platform, but also collects information about you from the files of other Facebook users you know. It buys data about your offline lives from data brokers \u2014 including sensitive stuff like your income and the credit cards you own. And testifying in the House, Mr. Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook sucks up information about people who are not even on Facebook, so it can aim ads at them.But policy cannot be determined only by the potential creepiness of what corporate America might do with our data. Maybe perfect price discrimination will never take off because consumers don\u2019t like it.Indeed, it is unclear to what extent consumers are repelled by any of this. Though surveys repeatedly find that Americans are concerned about their privacy, they rarely take action to stop cookies and other tools deployed to gather their data \u2014 leading scholars to coin the term \u201cprivacy paradox.\u201d As Sinan Aral of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has noted, \u201cLots of the things that depend on ads we want as public goods.\u201dBut this must understate the data economy\u2019s contribution to our well-being. Facebook is an immensely valuable mode of communication and interaction for two billion people around the world. The company has published in-house research suggesting that people who do lots of sharing on the social network are happier and healthier.Facebook\u2019s advertising tools \u2014 the ones that use your data to figure out whether you should see an ad from the small shop in Connecticut that sells organic yarn \u2014 provide mom-and-pop operations with cost-effective marketing opportunities once reserved for large corporations.More broadly, Mr. Nakamura points out, the online economy powered by data collection and advertising is improving welfare in a way not properly captured in standard measures of economic output. This includes reams of \u201cfree\u201d music and the potential benefits from the artificial intelligence that will be trained using personal data. The consumer surplus \u2014 the benefit that we get from a good or service above and beyond the price we pay for it \u2014 is bigger than it ever was. And it will grow further.And yet if this sounds like an argument against touching the data-driven digital economy with even the slightest regulation, it is not. Worries that Facebook and some of its brethren may have become large enough to squelch innovation are legitimate. So are suspicions that it plays fast and loose with consumer data.Regulations to curb the power of the digital behemoths \u2014 say, barring them from buying up rising companies like Instagram and WhatsApp that might threaten their dominance in the future \u2014 make sense. So do policies that ensure responsible stewardship of the data they gather.\u201dI don\u2019t think the right policy position is to totally eliminate the business model, but instead to introduce some restraint,\u201d said Terrell McSweeny, the lone Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cThe idea is to give people more control over the uses of their data and ensure companies are responsible for what is happening to it.\u201dSummoning Mr. Zuckerberg to testify suggests that Congress is no longer happy doing nothing. Hopefully, it can do better than simply overreact to its fears.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kudlow Plays \u2018Happy Warrior\u2019 Role in Counseling Trump", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the Oval Office on Tuesday, as fears of a trade war with China roiled markets and panicked American farmers and lawmakers, Larry Kudlow, President Trump\u2019s new top economic adviser, scored what passes for a major coup in a White House whipsawed by angry presidential tweets.He helped get the president to say something nice on Twitter about President Xi Jinping of China.\u201cVery thankful for President Xi of China\u2019s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted, referring to a trade speech that Mr. Xi had just delivered. \u201cWe will make great progress together!\u201dIt was a sign of the early fingerprints of Mr. Kudlow, the Wall Street economist best known as a CNBC television personality who is now the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council. Mr. Kudlow, barely two weeks into the job, casts himself as a \u201chappy warrior\u201d trying to give the best economic counsel he can to a president who has proved disinclined to follow advice.\u201cThe way this has worked so far, we\u2019ve been pretty close, but we have had differences,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said of himself and the president during an interview in his West Wing office on Thursday. Asked what those were, he replied: \u201cOh, Lord\u2026. I\u2019m not sure I want you to know that.\u201dMr. Kudlow said fears of a trade war were premature, a breakthrough on the long-stalled North American Free Trade Agreement was possible, a second tax-cut bill was under consideration by Mr. Trump, and a large infrastructure initiative was still a \u201cbig priority.\u201dHis glass-half-full predictions were punctuated with talk of branding and \u201cKudlowisms,\u201d terms he said he invents and tries to weave into the staff vernacular, like telling the press secretary to make a trade talking point \u201cgrowthier.\u201d\u201cThis administration and its economic advisers, our goal here is growth \u2014 growth, growth, growth, growth \u2014 that\u2019s the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of this administration on domestic policy,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cWe will rise and fall politically on that.\u201d\u201cLarry, will you get this done?\u201d Mr. Kudlow said the president asked. Mr. Kudlow said he responded that if Mr. Trump did not mind, he would like to involve Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, whose job is to negotiate trade pacts.Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Kudlow in the past whether he should explore rejoining the pact, he said, adding that he had always encouraged it. But the president\u2019s decision to say so publicly on Thursday was entirely unplanned.\u201cThere\u2019s out of the blue, and there\u2019s, I guess, out of the dark, navy blue,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. This, he said, was \u201cdark, navy blue.\u201dIt was Mr. Kudlow who told the president on Tuesday that he might want to consider publicly praising Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, after days of aggressive rhetoric against China that included a threat of an additional $100 billion in tariffs, on top of the $50 billion already threatened, if China failed to change its trade practices.At an impromptu meeting in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump seemed to like the idea, and John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, chimed in that he should do it by tweet, \u201cfor maximum impact,\u201d Mr. Kudlow recalled. A round of \u201cwordsmithing\u201d ensued with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who was also on hand, and Mr. Kudlow said the result was significant.\u201cIt was huge,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, \u201cbecause now these two guys are, shall we say, communicating in a positive way.\u201dThere is no evidence that either Mr. Xi\u2019s speech or the presidential tweet has led to any substantive progress in averting the prospect of tariff tit for tat that could have grave consequences for the United States. And Mr. Kudlow \u2014 a \u201cfree-market guy\u201d who conceded he generally abhors the idea of tariffs \u2014 did not claim to have averted a trade war with his advice. But the episode seemed to suggest that Mr. Kudlow, at least for now, has the standing with Mr. Trump to exert his influence at crucial moments on the president\u2019s message.What is less clear is how he will affect policy.\u201cPeople are giving me \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios where everything goes wrong and the sky falls, so the happy warrior says, \u2018No, wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to say we won\u2019t have tariffs \u2014 everything\u2019s on the table in these negotiations \u2014 but I am here to say we don\u2019t know yet.\u201dMr. Kudlow also did not pretend to know, from moment to moment, whether Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and behavior reflect a president winging it, or one playing out a grand strategy. \u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.While he said he had read about tensions within the White House economics team, Mr. Kudlow dismissed them cheerfully as \u201cpre-Kudlow.\u201d His predecessor, Gary D. Cohn, a Democrat and former Goldman Sachs executive whom Mr. Trump and his supporters derisively branded a \u201cglobalist,\u201d feuded with Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council, and a longtime China skeptic.Mr. Kudlow, a longtime Republican who was once a Democrat and who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and helped write his tax cut framework, said he got along well with Mr. Navarro, who was a frequent guest on his television program, even though they disagreed on some policy matters.Mr. Kudlow said he had broken the ice with Mr. Navarro in a telephone call shortly after he had accepted his White House job.\u201cOne of the first things I did was dial him up and say, \u2018Peter, this is your pal, Larry,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201c\u2018Did I ever cut you off on the air?\u2019 And he thought about it.\u201dAmong Mr. Kudlow\u2019s challenges is to keep a president who tends to stray off-script disciplined about promoting the effects of the tax cut enacted last year, which Republicans regard as their best hope of averting crushing losses in this year\u2019s midterm elections.Mr. Trump went rogue last week in West Virginia, tossing aside prepared remarks about the tax measure that he deemed \u201cboring\u201d and indulging in a lengthy rant against illegal immigration. But he stayed on message Thursday in the Rose Garden, with Mr. Kudlow looking on.Mr. Kudlow said the president was open to a second round of tax cuts whose details were \u201cnot nailed down,\u201d but could include making the personal income tax reductions and some business investment incentives permanent.\u201cThe president looks on it favorably, but nothing\u2019s coming to fruition,\u201d said Mr. Kudlow, who added that he had not focused on the endeavor.He was similarly vague about the infrastructure initiative, which has languished without a concerted campaign by the White House to make the case for it, and amid bipartisan concerns on Capitol Hill that the $200 billion Mr. Trump proposed over a decade is nowhere near sufficient.\u201cHe\u2019s very keen on it \u2014 very keen,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said of the president\u2019s view of the infrastructure plan. \u201cBig priority here. And some people believe there could be a bipartisan deal.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Larry Kudlow\u2019s party affiliation. He is not a lifelong Republican; he was once a Democrat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where Companies Welcome Refugees, the More, the Better", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "In a tight labor market, positions in poultry plants and lumber mills can be tough to fill. But that spells opportunity for recruiters like Ray Wiley.Supported byYet companies that turn to labor recruiters like Ray Wiley tend to have an especially tough time: The jobs they offer are in out-of-way places; the work is low-paid and disagreeable; and native-born Americans, particularly white men, are generally not interested.The economy is on solid footing in the ninth year of the recovery, and even entry-level workers have more options. So in Atlanta, San Diego and other cities, Mr. Wiley\u2019s company, East Coast Labor Solutions, finds workers, primarily refugees from war-ravaged countries who don\u2019t speak English. Other candidates include Puerto Ricans discouraged by the island\u2019s lack of jobs, as well as immigrants \u2014 here legally, he emphasizes \u2014 who have no problem passing a drug test.\u201cI\u2019m ready to go right now,\u201d said Ronald Johnson, 37, who showed up one afternoon with two friends at Labor Solutions\u2019 bare, second-floor office in Silver Spring, Md. He had heard from others in his community of Sierra Leone refugees that this agency could immediately place anyone willing to move to a nearby state. \u201cI want to go where they pay the most money and charge the least for rent.\u201dWithin an hour, all three men agreed to move to a rural town they had never heard of, to take a job they had never done before.But long before complaints about the North American Free Trade Agreement or steel imports from China commanded headlines, a domestic version of this pattern was already playing out in some industries. And as the pay changed, so did the face of the work force, once dominated by white males. Women, immigrants and people of color now hang chickens on hooks or hack them into parts on an assembly line. They are paid about half of what their counterparts earned four decades ago (after taking inflation into account), and have fewer benefits and protections. Such conditions don\u2019t foster long-term stability. In some plants, employers have to replace up to 70 percent of their staffs every year.Reducing that churn has become harder as the unemployment rate has dropped and several cities have raised the minimum wage.Haimonet Demcasso, the recruiter, explained, in two languages, the broad outlines of the jobs. The poultry-plant work pays roughly $11 to $13 an hour in small towns in Virginia and West Virginia. Labor Solutions would transport the recruits, find apartments for them to share, help fill out paperwork, and advance them the money to cover their travel, the first month\u2019s rent, the security deposit, heavy work boots and home essentials. They could pay it back out of their paychecks with no interest at a rate of $60 a week.They are paid the same as other plant workers, but they are employees of Labor Solutions for up to a year, until they\u2019ve repaid their loans.More details about the job itself would come once they went through orientation at the plant, Ms. Demcasso said.For Mr. Johnson, who had recently lost his job as a van driver and was already dodging calls from debt collectors, upfront money made the difference. \u201cFor me to rent an apartment, I need a boatload of money,\u201d he said.His wife, Elizabeth, was more skeptical when she heard about the deal. An apartment and two jobs just waiting for them? Money up front? There were plenty of unscrupulous recruiters who made all kinds of promises and deceived trusting job seekers \u2014 a cruel and sordid side of the industry that Mr. Wiley acknowledged is all too common.\u201cI was dragging my feet,\u201d Ms. Johnson said. But after coming up for a day to check the area and the classrooms her two children would attend in Woodstock, Va., she was convinced. \u201cI loved the school just by looking at it,\u201d she said. Most important, she saw no signs of the drugs, violence and bullying that plagued the White Oak neighborhood of Silver Spring, where they were temporarily doubled up with family. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no roaches and mice or rats.\u201dMr. Wiley said that when he started working with refugees, mostly Burmese, in 2008, he didn\u2019t offer money and support, but he soon realized that the job placements wouldn\u2019t last without it. Resettlement agency assistance was temporary and many job seekers didn\u2019t speak English. So he hired case managers to translate, help with school enrollment, drive recruits to the supermarket, find English classes and more.Berhane Teklay, who once hung live chickens upside down in a plant, handles the 30 or so workers Mr. Wiley has placed in Woodstock.\u201cYou need somebody to help you get into the system,\u201d Mr. Teklay said, and that\u2019s what Labor Solutions does. For refugees who can\u2019t speak English well or drive a car, he said, a job in a meat-processing plant is about the best they can do.Fluent in Arabic, Amharic, Tigrinya and English, Mr. Teklay acts as interpreter, administrator, real estate agent, loan office, complaint bureau and overall fixer.For a year, he helped Waleed Kanuo, Elfadil Daoud and Ali Hamid, refugees from Sudan, settle into an apartment in Woodstock and navigate the system, until they transferred to working directly for the poultry-plant operator. Gathered in the living room of the sparsely furnished apartment they share, all three said they were saving money and grateful to Labor Solutions for finding them a job.For others, the experience is more mixed.Mr. Kabba, for instance, said he had not known that he would have to pay an additional $25 every week for the daily mile ride from a co-worker to and from the plant. Nor did he understand that he would be working for Labor Solutions and not the processing plant directly, which he said makes it more difficult to switch departments, and means he is not yet eligible for the health benefits or 401(k) plan.At the same time, plant conditions are regimented and unforgiving, with 30 minutes for lunch and two 10-minute bathroom breaks that workers said don\u2019t include time to change out and into cumbersome protective garb. And small infractions can lead to firing.But as a friend of Mr. Kabba\u2019s says, that\u2019s the way it is in America: They tell you all the sweet stuff, and not the salty. \u201cIt\u2019s a job,\u201d Mr. Kabba said of the $11.70-an-hour work, which pays a $1-an-hour bonus if he\u2019s on time every day of the week. \u201cYou can\u2019t pick and choose.\u201d And he loves Woodstock\u2019s quiet.Teddy Marchant, 32, a former housemate of Mr. Kabba\u2019s, did not. Within a couple of days, he realized that the small town, without so much as a movie theater, wasn\u2019t for him. He needed the cash, he said, but \u201cif I had my way, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be here.\u201d He soon left.Ms. Johnson had time to check out the place but not the $11-an-hour job she was promised. \u201cI had no idea of what I was going to see,\u201d she said.When she walked into the plant, it was a shock. \u201cOh, my God, I saw chickens \u2014 lots and lots and lots of chickens, 350,000 chickens a day,\u201d she said, still shaking her head at the looping conveyor belts crowded with birds. \u201cIf you scratch your face or bend down, you might miss a couple of chickens.\u201dShe clocked in at 5:30 a.m. and rotated hanging up the dead chickens, cleaning out guts and cutting off legs, wings and backs to ready the meat for packaging, she said.It is physically demanding, repetitive and smelly, Ms. Johnson said.A smell that her husband noted was also \u201cthe smell of money.\u201dMr. Johnson, who was born in Libya and lived in Sierra Leone before moving to the United States 16 years ago as a refugee, was initially the most enthusiastic about the job. In November, he was jogging with his children in the morning, thinking about getting a second job to build up savings, and dreaming about a music studio where he could compose and record the music that played endlessly through his head.But by January, he was out of a job for a violation of the processing plant\u2019s policy. A couple months later, Ms. Johnson also left the plant after finding another local job.The work is not for everyone, Mr. Wiley concedes. But he maintains that for many refugees, including Mr. Teklay, his Woodstock branch manager, it provides a foothold.\u201cThey want the American dream, and they don\u2019t mind starting off on the bottom,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unskilled work in the U.S. that Americans will not do, and these people are doing it.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Annoyed About Russian and Chinese Currencies. Should He Be?", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s comment doesn\u2019t align with the realities of global currency markets.President Trump decided to weigh in on currencies and interest rate policy Monday morning. Sort of.Here is his tweet:Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!His message isn\u2019t consistent with where things stand in global currency markets. And it\u2019s vague. It\u2019s not at all clear what signal he\u2019s sending about a preferred policy.Let\u2019s unpack it. The comment about Russia is curious. While Russia is of course an important geopolitical player, its sclerotic economy and isolated financial system mean that it\u2019s not an important player in global commerce.For example, the United States\u2019 trade with Russia is a rounding error \u2014 $17 billion worth of imports in 2017 (Chinese imports were 31 times that high). And the ruble is not on the radar of currency traders, the way that, say, the British pound or Swiss franc is. As President Trump threatens a trade war, China could use further devaluation of its currency as a tool of retaliation, though doing so would create risks to Chinese financial stability. This clause of the tweet suggests these devaluation games are happening as the United States raises interest rates.It is true that the Federal Reserve has been gradually raising interest rates in the last couple of years, and that you would generally expect higher rates to cause a currency to strengthen, which in turn can damage a country\u2019s export sector.The reasons for this are much debated in international economic circles. But a key driver seems to be an improving global economy that is increasing the appeal of other currencies.The Fed sets interest rate policy based on what it sees as the interests of the United States economy, with currency levels one of many factors that are considered. So it is certainly possible for tighter Fed policy to trigger a stronger dollar, undermining the American export sector. There\u2019s just no real evidence that\u2019s what is happening in 2018.The president is crystal clear that he thinks the current arrangements of global currencies and trade are deeply flawed. He has yet to make clear what his ideas are to improve them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cars That Will Get Your Grad Down the Road of Life", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe only thing more tearful than the goodbyes of dropping a freshman off at college are the four years of tuition, rent, food and books that follow. The College Board pegs the average annual cost, over all, at in-state institutions at $25,290. If your student is turning the tassel this spring, congratulations. Your checkbook deserves a well-earned breather.It might have to endure one last flogging, though.Should that sheepskin result in a job (and let\u2019s hope so!) a vehicle may be needed. Or maybe you have a high school graduate who will be commuting to college, or one diving straight into the working world. Sending them off with a solid automobile is a terrific \u2014 albeit extravagant \u2014 graduation gift. Even if it\u2019s simply a hefty down payment to get them started, think of it as a final investment. One that means that maybe they\u2019ll come back only to visit, not to move back in.First, determine whether they\u2019re getting a new, used or leased vehicle. Buying new provides the security of knowing that the car wasn\u2019t abused, plus a warranty and the possibility of no-cost maintenance. That\u2019s reassuring if they live thousands of miles away. Going with a low-mileage two- or three-year-old car can be a great value, one that eliminates the sting of instant depreciation. If that\u2019s your route, buying a certified pre-owned car adds peace of mind. Leasing typically offers more car for a lower monthly payment, but an early-career job switch out of state can complicate matters.Next, get educated on brands and reliability. Ten years ago, the sage advice was to stick with Japanese cars, especially used models. These days, not so much. If you check the popular top-10 lists from Consumer Reports, J.D. Power and U.S. News and World Report, you\u2019ll find a mix of manufacturers from America, Europe, Japan and South Korea. Like students switching majors, you have options.There are excellent choices for less than that $25,290 average annual education cost. For simplicity\u2019s sake, all cars mentioned are new 2018 models, and the listed retail price includes destination charges and an automatic transmission. Tax and registration are not included \u2014 you can count on them adding about 12 percent to the cost, depending on your state.If you\u2019re going for a used version of any of these recommendations, make sure you\u2019re buying the same generation model. The Kia Soul, for example, was redesigned for 2014. A 2013 Soul is vastly different from the current generation in engineering and refinement.And the Soul is an excellent choice. Nothing in this price range swallows up Ikea and Goodwill finds quite like Kia\u2019s boxy crossover. There are three engine choices, but skip the base model with its 1.6-liter four cylinder at $18,695 and invest in the Plus model. At $21,295, it adds a more powerful 2-liter four-cylinder engine and an excellent touch-screen interface that includes Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Youth is impatient, but it doesn\u2019t need the turbocharged engine that powers the \u201c!\u201d model. Not on your dime, at least.Honda\u2019s HR-V crossover ($21,445, or $22,845 with all-wheel drive) is a roomy choice that earns honors for a clever storage space under the rear seat. The cushions fold upward, creating the perfect place for a dog to travel. Backpacks (or briefcases) can be stashed there when friends ride along.The new Hyundai Kona ($20,480, or $21,780 with all-wheel drive) is also a top pick. It lacks the HR-V\u2019s trick back seat, but it adds a stylish interior, refined driving dynamics and Hyundai\u2019s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. It also includes five years of free roadside assistance, so you won\u2019t be jumping a dead battery or changing a flat tire.Another model worth a look? Toyota\u2019s C-HR ($23,495).Those compact crossovers are mighty handy, but their popularity has a side benefit: Since buyers prefer S.U.V.s these days, great deals can be had on hatchbacks, which offer much of the same utility at a lower ride height. Honda\u2019s Fit has the same clever back seat as the HR-V and costs just $17,880 while easily gobbling up bikes in the back, as long as the seats are folded down. Enthusiastic drivers may shy from its continuously variable transmission, but it\u2019s hard to beat the practical and frisky Fit. And there\u2019s always the manual gearbox.Unlike their taller cousins, hatchbacks typically aren\u2019t available with all-wheel drive \u2014 a feature that could prove invaluable for grads who end up in the Snow Belt. But there are a few. Subaru\u2019s Impreza 5-Door is an excellent value at $20,355, and its fraternal twin, the Crosstrek ($23,710), adds ground clearance and protective cladding. Subarus are powered by Boxer engines, whose pistons fire horizontally rather than vertically. That allows them to be mounted deep in the engine bay, which lowers the car\u2019s center of gravity and improves handling.If your son or daughter graduated with a degree in environmental studies, consider a hybrid hatchback: the Hyundai Ioniq Blue ($23,085). The Environmental Protection Agency rates its average fuel economy at 58 miles per gallon, which is 6 m.p.g. higher than Toyota\u2019s Prius. (The Prius pushes just past the price limit at $25,580, but consider it if you\u2019re feeling flush.)Some people prefer sedans and the security of a lockable trunk. In that case, the Honda Civic sedan is pretty much a slam dunk at $20,530. It\u2019s roomy and refined, allowing it to grow along with your grad. A bonus? The Civic is enjoyable to drive when chucked hard into the corners.The Chevrolet Cruze ($20,400) is stylish, especially comfortable and frequently overlooked.One important note on a popular model: The current Toyota Corolla ($19,495) is built on an aging platform that\u2019s being replaced soon. But with the next generation of the already affordable Corolla on its way, perhaps there will be bargains available on 2018 models.Like your kid, automobiles have become much smarter in the last four years. Technology like automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection plus adaptive cruise control have left the ivory towers of Mercedes-Benz and Volvo to hardworking offerings.These active safety technologies and more, including lane-departure alert and automatic high beams, are standard equipment on the Corolla and the C-HR, where the system is called Toyota Safety Sense, or TSS. The Civic gets its Honda Sensing safety features, including automatic braking, adaptive cruise control and lane assist, standard in most models. Subaru makes its similar EyeSight system available at extra charge in the Crosstrek and the Impreza.It\u2019s worth doing your homework to compare safety systems, since the technology varies from manufacturer to manufacture. Even within Toyota, the Corolla sedan\u2019s TSS-P system offers more features than the TSS-C system found in the Corolla iM hatchback ($20,485).Finally, since money is always an issue, check with your insurance carrier to see if one automobile choice is significantly more costly to cover than another. And don\u2019t forget to school your grad on the importance of proper maintenance. The last thing the office newcomer needs is a car that won\u2019t start because it hasn\u2019t had an oil change. Ever.A good education, whether its college or street smarts, pays dividends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Today, the answers are increasingly nuanced, characterized by a cycle of changes in the workplace \u2014 in large part catalyzed by tech \u2014 that provoke the anticipation of even more change. No longer is there a simple binary view of the old, traditional way of doing work typified by corner offices and strict dress codes, and the new, modern worker that does what they want, from wherever they are.A more enlightened view of how work is evolving takes cues from more than a century of office culture, while also incorporating cutting-edge advances in collaboration. These forces may seem paradoxical, even oppositional, but they can also be complementary. We\u2019ll take a look at how some of the most drastic changes in the modern workplace have evolved to redefine what it means to work smarter.The truth is, except for a blip from 1995 to 2005, overall productivity in Western economies has been largely stagnant for the past 50 years. Workers may feel more free, but, at least according to traditional measures, they\u2019re not producing much more.And for many workers, separated from the interpersonal exchange of traditional offices, mobility has left them feeling disoriented. People want autonomy but, it turns out, they still crave structure and social interaction.After IBM sold its PC manufacturing division, for example, it encouraged its employees to work from wherever they wanted. Eventually, those employees quipped that IBM stood for \u201cI\u2019m By Myself.\u201d They wanted an office to go to \u2014 at least part of the time.\u201cThat\u2019s the surprise,\u201d said Arvind Malhotra, a professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina who has studied workforce dynamics for over 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a tacit admission that human contact has value in building organizational culture.\u201dIronically, the workers who most expect mobility \u2014 younger employees \u2014 are most adversely affected by it. One of the greatest causes of workplace anxiety, according to Malhotra, is a lack of mentorship.\u201cAround 2001,\u201d Malhotra said, \u201cI started to hear young employees saying, \u2018I feel like my boss doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m working on really good stuff\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m not getting the one-on-one time with my mentor.\u2019\u201dOn-the-job training is most intense in the early years of a career. Working from a cafe might result in great coffee options, but it robs young workers of crucial learning opportunities and mentorship when they need those most.Albert H. Segars, Malhotra\u2019s collaborator and the PNC Distinguished Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina, said he believes, at least in the case of millennials, there\u2019s a sociological factor involved: One of the things that make millennials different from other generations is a deeper level of parental involvement.Source: Gallup\u201cParents were deeply engaged with their well-being: the things millennials did or did not do growing up,\u201d Segars said. \u201cWhen they can\u2019t get that at work, they get frustrated and think nobody is interested in them. When they do get it, it\u2019s amazing what they can do. But they need some of the structure and feedback found in traditional workplaces.\u201dNewer collaboration technology, however, can enable the very feedback loops young workers are missing, said Lisette Sutherland, an expert on working remotely and the author of the upcoming book \u201cWork Together Anywhere.\u201d\u201cYou have to make communicating with each other so easy that it\u2019s like talking to someone right next to you,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cIt sounds really simple, but most multinational  workers don\u2019t even have headsets. Another big part of it is turning the video on. People don\u2019t realize how much team building you can do just by turning on the screen.\u201dSutherland said that the richer, real-time interface provided by a new wave of technological advances will help quell the isolation people feel when working at home. Robotic cameras that move through the halls of an office and pivot to look around a conference room will help remote workers feel more connected. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is replicate the human experience as much as possible,\u201d she said.At a minimum, companies should supplement face-to-face leadership by teaming younger workers with digital mentors \u2014 someone in the organization with whom they can chat regularly for guidance and support \u2014 to eliminate anxiety fueled by greater mobility.The arrival of millennials and other digital natives in the workforce over 15 years ago triggered some anxiety among older generations \u2014 how could they ever catch up? \u2014 but simultaneously generated high expectations.Indeed, 15 years ago young people entering the workforce had their own ideas about the future of work. They assumed their fluency with mobile devices and remote communications would free them to work on meaningful projects at their own discretion.In fact, the democratization of data \u2014 and their familiarity with how to access it \u2014 did allow younger employers to fuel their ambitions with information. Prior to digitalization, the ability to access information signaled power; in the new workforce, it signals ability.As early as 2015, millennials made up the majority of the global workforce, a trend expected to continue beyond 2025. Generation Z (not included in this graphic because of limited data available) will grow to become the demographic shaping the workplace.2015Source: Pew Research CenterBut as young workers forged new pathways, older managers struggled to evaluate their performance. The younger employees\u2019 autonomous, remote work demanded new schemes for effective monitoring. Historically, much of how work got done depended on who knew whom in the organizational hierarchy, Malhotra said. But new ways of working meant managers had to promote group performance while also recognizing individual rewards \u2014 a dynamic most companies still struggle with.Younger workers clearly suffer from the waning of traditional monitoring and management. In a recent Gallup poll, only 21 percent of employees strongly agreed that their performance is managed in a way that motivates them to do outstanding work.Also, technology that allows people to share information with exactly the co-workers they want to \u2014 eliminating the endless CC\u2019ed email chains, for instance \u2014 builds confidence in virtual communications. Providing intuitive, clear, seamless sharing tools helps workers of all ages become more comfortable in the way they interact. This allows firms to create teams of multigenerational workers, optimizing the skill sets of each generation and forging a functional melting pot for the ages.In the next wave of automation, robots will take on the routine, freeing humans to handle only the exceptions.But new weaving machines did not condemn England\u2019s textile workers to massive unemployment \u2014 any more than ATMs mothballed bank tellers in the 1980s. (In spite of ubiquitous robotic cash dispensers, there are more human bank tellers today than ever.)\u201cFor 200 years, there has been the fear the machine will replace people,\u201d said Harry Holzer, the LaFarge SJ Professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened because the economy always has ways of generating new jobs to replace the ones that go away.\u201dThe benefits of automation are underestimated in the public imagination, Holzer said, while the negatives are generally overblown.\u201cThis prediction of doom and gloom, the fear of artificial intelligence that can do vastly more than machines in the past, so far we see very little evidence of this happening,\u201d Holzer said. \u201cMachines will do some of the tasks that workers did. That might free people up to be more complementary to machines than they used to be.\u201dHistorically, automation has replaced physically repetitive jobs, particularly in manufacturing. New automation featuring machine learning will affect different employee skills sets, augmenting many. Future workers will need to cultivate more social, emotional, creative and logical capabilities to work productively alongside machines.Net change in work hours due to automationSource: McKinseyThe next wave of automation will do even more routine tasks, allowing workers to pay attention to exceptional tasks.

In the future workplace, winners and losers will be determined by the ability of companies to identify and adopt technologies that facilitate digital leadership and mentorship to enable seamless feedback.\u201cThe technology that enables us to fulfill our capacity as individuals and then fulfill our role on a team is of maximum value,\u201d Segars said.Get the Practical Guide to the Modern WorkplaceThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "California Today: Remembering the Legacy of a Liberal Judge", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.We talked to two experts who clerked for Judge Reinhardt to tell us a little bit about him and his legacy: Jeffrey Fisher, a professor at Stanford Law School and Joshua Matz, a constitutional lawyer based in Washington.The questions and their answers have been edited for length and clarity.Q: What was Judge Reinhardt like? Q: What were some of his most famous opinions? Two years after vacating an opinion by Judge Reinhardt forbidding states from banning same-sex couples from marrying, the Supreme Court adopted just that constitutional rule.Q: Can you give us a layman\u2019s explanation of the Ninth Circuit and tell us why it\u2019s important? Because California and other western states continually innovate everything from the economy to social policy, the Ninth Circuit tends to hear an outsized portion of \u201cbig\u201d cases. It is no accident, therefore, that Judge Reinhardt found himself so often on panels asked to resolve cutting edge legal issues.Q: Who decides who will replace Judge Reinhardt \u2014 and how does it happen? There are several vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, now including Judge Reinhardt\u2019s seat. We can expect that over the next year, or less, President Trump will nominate judges to fill most of those positions. However, at this point it is impossible to predict who he will nominate to replace Judge Reinhardt.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)On a Saturday in December, Micheal Brown logged on to Stanford\u2019s admissions portal to check for an early decision.Stanford, though, would prove to be just the first of 20 highly selective colleges he\u2019d get into.

{"Headline": "His Father Aided a Dictator. Paraguay Elected Him President.", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byASUNCI\u00d3N, Paraguay \u2014 Paraguay\u2019s governing Colorado Party won Sunday\u2019s presidential election as Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez, a conservative former senator, defeated his rival, Efra\u00edn Alegre, a former lawmaker from a center-left coalition.Mr. Abdo Ben\u00edtez\u2019s presidential bid evoked memories of Paraguay\u2019s dictatorship from 1954 to 1989 because his father was the personal secretary of Alfredo Stroessner, the despotic military leader who ruled the small South American nation during those years.The election extended the Colorado Party\u2019s dominance in Paraguayan politics and solidified the rightward political shift in South America.Mr. Abdo Ben\u00edtez belongs to a more conservative wing of the party than the departing president, Horacio Cartes. His election follows transitions of power in Argentina, Brazil and Chile, where conservative or center-right leaders have defeated socialist parties in recent years.The party has held on to the presidency since 1945 with the exception of an electoral defeat in 2008 by Fernando Lugo, who was impeached and removed from office in 2012.Election officials declared Mr. Abdo Ben\u00edtez\u2019s victory shortly after 9 p.m., after more than 96 percent of votes had been tallied. He won by about four percentage points, an outcome far closer than polls had suggested.Mr. Abdo Ben\u00edtez struck a conciliatory tone as he thanked supporters on Sunday night. \u201cWe have built a project that touched the heart of the people and that seeks unity for Paraguay,\u201d he said.There was significant overlap in the initiatives that both candidates campaigned on. Mr. Abdo Ben\u00edtez and Mr. Alegre vowed to strengthen the country\u2019s judiciary with the aim of making Paraguay more attractive to foreign investors. And they promised to overhaul the tax system to improve the economy.The candidates also backed a gender parity bill aiming to pave the way for women to play a more prominent role in politics. They also oppose legalizing abortion and same-sex marriage.The lack of radical policy differences made for an election in which the biographies and personal style of the presidential hopefuls loomed large.During the campaign, Mr. Abdo Ben\u00edtez, a former president of the Senate, did not overtly pay homage to the era when the country was ruled by a dictatorship.But he refrained from disavowing the abuses carried out by the junta during the region\u2019s longest military dictatorship, which included rape, forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions.Mr. Abdo Ben\u00edtez, 46, appeared keen to elicit the memory of his father, Mario Abdo, on Sunday morning after he cast his ballot. Trailed by reporters, the candidate visited the family mausoleum where his father is buried in Asunci\u00f3n\u2019s Recoleta cemetery.The dictatorship is an abstract idea for many voters in this country of nearly seven million people, where the median age is 25. But the candidacy of Mr. Abdo Ben\u00edtez clearly rattled young liberals.On Friday night, at a concert featuring psychedelic cumbia and feminist reggaeton at a colonial house in Asunci\u00f3n, Pedro Lezcano, a percussionist, grabbed the microphone and said, \u201cIf your folks are Colorados, hide their c\u00e9dulas,\u201d a reference to the national identity cards required for voting. Attendants clapped and started yelling, \u201cDictatorship never again!\u201dBut some young voters said they favored Mr. Abdo Ben\u00edtez because of the stories they have heard about life under military rule.\u201cI didn\u2019t live through the dictatorship, but I know that life was good, and I think we could use another period like that,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, a 19-year-old medical student, said on Sunday night. \u201cThere are too many thieves and assaults, and it wasn\u2019t like that before.\u201dParaguay\u2019s economy has been among the top performers in the region in recent years, even as neighboring Brazil weathered a brutal recession. But the landlocked country remains one of the continent\u2019s poorest and least equitable in terms of wealth.Despite those factors, Mr. Alegre, a former congressman and minister in the Lugo government, said leftist parties had struggled to mount a strong challenge to the governing party because its allies across government give it a built-in advantage.\u201cThere are three or four generations of public servants who are Colorados, 95 percent of government officials are Colorados,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a result of the dictatorship years and successive clientelist governments.\u201dSanti Carneri reported from Asunci\u00f3n, and Ernesto Londo\u00f1o from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Unveils Tariffs on 1,300 Chinese Products", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will place a 25 percent tariff on Chinese products like flat-screen televisions, medical devices, aircraft parts and batteries, outlining more than 1,300 imported goods that will soon face levies as part of a sweeping trade measure aimed at penalizing China for its trade practices.The Trump administration said that its analysts had identified products that benefit from these policies but refined the list to remove goods that were likely to cause disruptions to the United States economy or consumers.The designation of targeted products will be followed by a comment period in which American companies can provide feedback to the Trump administration on the product choices. The administration will hold a public hearing on the submissions on May 15 in Washington, and companies will have until May 22 to file final objections.Business groups, concerned about the effect on companies and workers, swiftly criticized the move.\u201cUnilaterally imposing $50 billion of new tariffs without a long-term strategy that leads to economic reforms in China will only hurt America\u2019s businesses, workers, and families,\u201d the Business Roundtable, a corporate trade group, said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the administration should work with U.S. allies on an approach that advances meaningful reform in China without imposing significant harm on America\u2019s economy.\u201dJay Timmons, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that American manufacturers were concerned about the trade relationship with China, including intellectual property theft, counterfeit goods and unfair subsidies, but also that tariffs were not the best response.In a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in the United States condemned the tariffs. \u201cSuch unilateralistic and protectionist action has gravely violated fundamental principles and values of the W.T.O.,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt serves neither China\u2019s interest, nor U.S. interest, even less the interest of the global economy.\u201dThe Chinese would resort to \u201cmeasures of equal scale and strength against U.S. products in accordance with Chinese law,\u201d the statement said.Financial markets fell sharply on Monday as China imposed its own retaliatory tariffs on American products but regained most of their lost territory on Tuesday.President Trump, who has repeatedly promised tough action on China\u2019s trade practices, said Tuesday that he intended to get along with China but that its unfair trade behavior had gone on too long. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we can live with,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House, adding, \u201cI campaigned on that.\u201dTrump advisers have criticized past administrations for allowing China to receive the benefits of global trade while continuing to break the international trade rules imposed by organizations like the World Trade Organization \u2014 a charge China denies.\u201cThe administration is rightly focused on restoring equity and fairness in our trade relationship with China,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, an executive vice president and the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cHowever, imposing taxes on products used daily by American consumers and job creators is not the way to achieve those ends.\u201dThe Coalition for a Prosperous America, an organization that has supported the president\u2019s trade agenda, called the China action a shift from \u201cna\u00efve\u201d to \u201cstrategic\u201d trade. \u201cThe age of appeasement must end,\u201d said Paola Masman, the group\u2019s media director.But the administration\u2019s trade measures are prompting concern among many American companies, who are wary of Beijing\u2019s response.Dan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association, said the group was still reviewing the tariff list but would almost certainly file comments with the administration.Farming communities, one of the country\u2019s largest exporters and a solid base for Mr. Trump, are among the most vulnerable. Chinese tariffs of 25 percent will particularly hurt American pork farmers, who sent more than $1 billion worth of products to China last year.Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said American farmers were already struggling to make ends meet. \u201cIncreasing tariffs on exports will harm Iowa producers and undermine the rural economy,\u201d Ms. Ernst said. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that we can pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness, rather than reduce our access to foreign markets.\u201dNatalie Kitroeff and Ben Casselman contributed reporting from New York, and Keith Bradsher from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Economic Miracle in Hungary, or Just a Mirage?", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySIKLOSNAGYFALU, Hungary \u2014 In seeking re-election, Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, claims to have conjured an economic miracle since taking office eight years ago. One village shows he is right \u2014 and wrong.After winning power in 2010, Mr. Orban implemented a vast workfare program in which menial tasks have been given to hundreds of thousands of jobseekers \u2014 including 73 of the 472 residents of Siklosnagyfalu, a village near the southern border.As a result, there are roughly half as many jobseekers in the village as there were before Mr. Orban took office. (Over the same period, the national unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent from 11.4 percent.)But the woolly nature of the jobs program in Siklosnagyfalu and hundreds of similar towns has left critics asking whether all is really as it seems \u2014 and whether workfare participants are really working.In the summer, program participants in Siklosnagyfalu are kept busy, said Gyongyi Orgyan, who takes part in a farming project.But in winter, \u201cthere really isn\u2019t that much work,\u201d said Ms. Orgyan, 56. \u201cThere are days when we don\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cPeople feel that they have a much better life in terms of the economy,\u201d said Istvan Lovas, a radio host and one of Mr. Orban\u2019s most prominent supporters. \u201cWhatever figures you look at, they are clearly improving.\u201dIn many cases, that is true. Government debt, as a proportion of Hungary\u2019s gross domestic product, has fallen more than 6 percentage points since 2010. The country\u2019s credit ratings have improved. The budget deficit has roughly halved. Growth has almost quadrupled. Wages have risen by more than 10 percent. Though still high, deprivation has fallen by nearly half \u2014 not least in places like Siklosnagyfalu, where villagers benefit from their workfare wages. Officially, unemployment has dropped by nearly two-thirds.\u201cHungary has been on the right track,\u201d Mihaly Varga, the economy minister, said in an email that cited most of these positive developments. \u201cNow everyone who is capable of work and wants to work can find a job.\u201dBut critics argue that things are not as rosy as the traditional macroeconomic measures suggest.Mr. Orban\u2019s successes have also partly been the result of factors beyond his control.Europe also functions as a pressure valve for the Hungarian labor market. The government says 730,000 new jobs have been created since 2010 \u2014 but that includes as many as 350,000 Hungarians who have found work elsewhere in the European Union, said Janos Kollo, research director of the Institute of Economics at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.Mr. Orban has also benefited from the global economic revival.\u201cThe Hungarian government was like any other government,\u201d said Istvan Madar, a senior analyst at Portfolio, a Hungarian financial journal. \u201cThey had some special methods, some unorthodox measures, but the overall Hungarian government economic performance was no better than any other regional government.\u201d\u201cIt was a completely unlawful blackmailing of the population,\u201d said Balazs Romhanyi, an economic analyst who at the time was chief of staff at the Hungarian Budget Council, a state body that monitors state expenditure.(Mr. Varga, the economy minister, justified the decision by arguing that the private pensions were \u201ctoo costly,\u201d and that the new system had been more \u201cstable and predictable.\u201d)The highlight of Mr. Orban\u2019s apparent economic success \u2014 the fall in unemployment \u2014 also fades under scrutiny.In 2017, more than 200,000 Hungarians \u2014 nearly 4 percent of the country\u2019s work force \u2014 participated in the government\u2019s workfare program, and were therefore counted as employed.But labor economists questioned their inclusion, since many were doing work that did not really need to be done. In Siklosnagyfalu, for example, 25 workfare participants are allocated to work all year on five hectares, or about 12 acres, of public farmland \u2014 work that requires neither that many people, nor such a permanent assignment.\u201cIn really small settlements, there are no real jobs,\u201d said Gyorgy Molnar, a specialist in workfare at the Institute for Economics at the Hungarian Academy of Science. \u201cThe majority of people are working for one or two hours and then going home.\u201dHe estimated that the real unemployment rate in 2017 was 7.3 percent \u2014 lower than when Mr. Orban entered office, but far higher than the official rate of 4.2 percent.The program also makes participants more dependent on both on their local mayor, who decides work assignments, and on Fidesz, the party that expanded workfare.Though the workfare program may skew national employment figures and exacerbate feudal dynamics in the countryside, it has nevertheless improved lives in Siklosnagyfalu.Participants are paid approximately $175 a month \u2014 less than half the minimum wage, but roughly double what was paid out in unemployment benefits. Four Siklosnagyfalu residents said they could now afford to pay for heating in the winter and to buy meat more regularly.\u201cThis little bit of money goes a long way in this village,\u201d said Eva Petrovics, 60, who helps to clean the village nursery school. \u201cThe fridge is full now.\u201dThe program has also helped to spruce up the village. Since 2012, workfare participants have built a small bridge, added a drainage system, and renovated the town hall and sports fields. The terms of the program have also allowed Mr. Kosztics to buy farming machinery for the village, including a new tractor and plow.\u201cYou can say a lot of things about the workfare program, but one thing is certain,\u201d Mr. Kosztics said. \u201cFor municipalities like this one, it means survival.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the number of Hungarians who have found work in the European Union. It is as many as 350,000, not roughly 350,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets That Climbed the Trump Bump Are Tumbling Down From It", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump Bump is becoming the Trump Slump.In the first year of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, ebullient investors propelled stock markets to one record high after another. And Mr. Trump was the bull in chief, celebrating the record-breaking march as validation of his economic policies.Those days are done.Even after a fast start to 2018, stock markets finished the first quarter down for the year \u2014 the first quarterly decline since 2015. It suggested that a period of calm and steadily rising markets had given way to a turbulent new era with a bearish bent.The plunge continued Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index sinking 2.2 percent. Investors jettisoned shares of financial, technology and many other businesses, spooked at least in part by a tweet from Mr. Trump aimed at one of the country\u2019s biggest companies: Amazon.Monday\u2019s decline left stocks down more than 4 percent so far in 2018. They are now down more than 10 percent from their peak in late January. That means the market has entered a so-called correction \u2014 a term used to indicate that the downward trend is more severe and lasting than simply a few days of bearish trading.The stock market is still up more than 20 percent since Nov. 8, 2016, the day Mr. Trump won the White House \u2014 a roller-coaster ride driven in part by expectations about what a Trump presidency could bring to Washington.At first, the prospect of Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress thrilled investors. They anticipated a wave of regulatory rollbacks and the slashing of corporate and personal tax rates. Many of those dreams have been realized, culminating in Mr. Trump signing a huge tax cut into law in December. When the S.&P. 500 notched its high-water mark of 2872.87 on Jan. 26, it represented a roughly 325 percent increase since the bull market began in March 2009.But since February, a toxic stew of factors \u2014 many but certainly not all of them emanating from Washington \u2014 has polluted what had been the market\u2019s placidly rising waters. And there\u2019s little prospect of the messes dissipating anytime soon.First there was the risk that the economy might be growing too fast, which could prompt central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected. Then there was the risk of a trade war ignited by the White House imposing tariffs on certain products, an action that quickly prompted countries like China to erect trade barriers of their own. Next came the threat of a government crackdown on technology companies, after revelations of their misuse of customer data.Monday\u2019s dose of unnerving news was a presidential tweet aimed at Amazon, which Mr. Trump accused of hurting the United States Postal Service. Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the company has been going on sporadically since before he became president, but the onslaught has accelerated lately. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that the Post Office loses money by working with Amazon \u201cand this will be changed.\u201dIn the face of these factors, the optimism of just two months ago has all but evaporated.\u201cIt certainly adds to uncertainty, and the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at Ned Davis Research, a stock market research firm.One thing is clear: The days of calm markets marching steadily higher, shattering one record after another, are gone for now. That carries risks for Mr. Trump, who spent the first year of his presidency as a stock-market cheerleader but in recent months has been mostly silent about the market\u2019s gyrations.It also could be a danger for the United States economy. Academic research suggests that long-term market declines can rub off on consumers, leading them to feel less affluent and therefore spend less money. That is bad news for an economy that hinges largely on zesty consumer spending.The market\u2019s decline over the past two months has been broad based. Six of the 11 sectors included in the S.&P. 500 index are down more than 10 percent from the market high in late January.On any given day, a particular sector might be clobbered. One day it could be industrial companies such as Boeing or Caterpillar, which export lots of products and therefore could be harmed in a trade war. Another day could bring declines to technology companies like Facebook and Twitter, whose profits are vulnerable to tougher government regulation of social media networks. The next day it could be energy and financial companies, whose fortunes would be diminished if the economy slows.On Monday, just 13 stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose.The meat producer Tyson dropped more than 6 percent, after China imposed duties on pork and fruit from the United States in response to the tariffs that the Trump administration has imposed on products imported from China. China is one of Tyson\u2019s most important export markets. Lean hog futures \u2014 which reflect the anticipated prices of pig carcasses \u2014 were down 3.9 percent.After Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint about Amazon, it too, was a big loser, falling 5.2 percent. Other giant tech firms were sucked into the downdraft. Microsoft dropped 3 percent. Facebook tumbled 2.8 percent, bringing its year-to-date decline to 14.4 percent. And Intel dove 6 percent after a Bloomberg News report that Apple was planning to use its own chips in its computers instead of Intel processors.And Tesla, reeling amid doubts about its ability to churn out electric vehicles, tumbled more than 5 percent.The tech sector has been the epicenter of stock market pain in recent weeks, hurt by concerns about trade friction with China \u2014 a key market and supplier for tech firms \u2014 and fears of tighter government regulation. Even before Monday\u2019s fall, some $457 billion had been wiped off the sector\u2019s total market value.\u201cPeople think that tech is going to go from the Wild West to a much more regulated, scrutinized environment,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Even the shares of financial institutions \u2014 the companies that would most likely benefit from a looser regulatory environment favored by Republicans \u2014 have been battered. The sector dropped 2.1 percent Monday, with investors worried about an unfavorable lending environment.For markets, nothing is for sure. They could rebound mightily later this week and shake off jitters about a trade war. But some observers believe conditions may have to get worse before they can get better \u2014 and there could be more declines before that happens.\u201cIn order for the market to bottom, there probably has to be more consternation and more pessimism about the current environment,\u201d said Mr. Clissold, of Ned Davis Research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modi May Pay the Price as India\u2019s A.T.M.s Run Out of Cash Again", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 For the second time in 18 months, India has a shortage of cash. And like last time, economists say, it\u2019s primarily the government\u2019s fault.Empty A.T.M.s and bank restrictions on withdrawals have been reported in eight states this week, and some bank managers said the cash crunch had been building for months.On Monday, Sampath Kumar Lohati drove his scooter around Warangal, a city in the south Indian state of Telangana, for more than four hours trying to withdraw money.\u201cI tried at least 50 to 60 A.T.M.s,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut I could not find any cash.\u201d Mr. Lohati, an insurance agent, finally got money on Tuesday after an A.T.M. near his home was refilled.Most Indians work at informal jobs that operate almost entirely in cash, from roadside food stands to day laborers. People in such jobs had already seen some work dry up because of the shock 2016 demonetization, as well as the imposition of a cumbersome national tax on goods and services in 2017 that has sought to formalize transactions that had previously been off the books.Depending on how long it lasts, the current cash crunch will further dent the incomes of those workers, who are a critical part of the voter base of Mr. Modi\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party.\u201cIf this kind of shortage is there and the unorganized sector gets hit again, which it will, if the cash shortage persists, then there has got to be fallout from that,\u201d said Arun Kumar, a professor at the Institute of Social Sciences in New Delhi who studies public finance and the illicit economy. \u201cThat will be very damaging to the ruling party.\u201dEconomists say that the cash shortage has no single cause, but rather is the result of a combination of factors.Meanwhile, hoarders and black market operators started stockpiling 2,000-rupee notes, worth about $30 each. Rather than expanding the supply to compensate, the government decided to stop printing the high-value bills, forcing banks to fill A.T.M.s with lower denomination notes, which run out more quickly.Public faith in the safety of India\u2019s banks has also faltered over the past year, prompting people to keep more cash at home.The Modi government, warning of a growing problem with bad bank loans, last fall pledged $32 billion in taxpayer funds to bail out weak lenders. It also proposed legislation that could force depositors with more than $1,500 in an account to take a loss if their bank failed.\u201cMany people got scared,\u201d said Radha Rani, a senior manager at Indian Bank, another state-owned bank, in Warangal. \u201cThey are keeping money in their houses or investing in real estate. They have fear of losing money if deposited in the bank. So many people directly told us that.\u201dG. Ravinder, 55, an architect and consultant in Warangal, said that he had issued paychecks to the laborers working on his projects but that they had been unable to cash them.His bank, the State Bank of India, the country\u2019s largest bank, will not allow him to withdraw enough cash from the branch either. \u201cI went to the bank to withdraw 40,000 rupees, but they said, \u2018Sorry, we can give you only 20,000 rupees,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo how do I do my work?\u201dThe harvest and marriage seasons are looming, increasing demand for cash. If the shortage is not quickly eased, more customers will demand their money, potentially causing a much bigger problem: a bank run.\u201cWe have deposited our own money in the bank with the assumption that whenever we need money, we can get it from the bank. When banks are not giving money, then people are scared that bank deposits are not safe,\u201d Mr. Ravinder said. \u201cThat is why people are withdrawing their money from the banks.\u201dHari Kumar reported from New Delhi, and Vindu Goel from Mumbai.Advertisement"}

The Trump administration\u2019s effort to loosen financial regulation is moving forward on several fronts, but the changes to the leverage ratio would arguably put the deepest dent in the post-crisis overhaul.Under the adjustment, the ratio would fall for all of the eight big banks that are subject to it. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs stand to enjoy some of the biggest declines.Compared with the current rules, the new leverage ratio would reduce capital required at the eight banks by around $86 billion. But other capital rules would, for the time being at least, prevent the banks from cutting their capital by that amount.Not all regulators support the proposed adjustment.The new leverage ratio swaps a fixed capital requirement for one that is in part based on a bank\u2019s size and reach in the global financial system.Critics of the current leverage ratio said it was causing banks to reduce certain important activities.- Peter EavisBut they are dragging them lower on Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points, or 2.1 percent, while the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slid more than 1.5 percent. For the Dow, Tuesday\u2019s move lower push the blue-chip index back down more than 10 percent. If its losses hold through the close, it will mark the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive down day, its longest such streak since 2017.Disappointing earnings from some of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies are weighing heavily on stocks.\u2022 Despite a 73 percent jump in Alphabet\u2019s net profit, shares fell more than 4 percent as Wall Street analysts raised concerns that a jump in capital spending could crimp profitability\u2022 Travelers is off 4 percent after its earnings missed expectations.In all, Apple, 3M, Travelers and Caterpillar have accounted for 260 points of the Dow\u2019s decline.ContextAs of Friday, with 17 percent of companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported, profits were on pace to rise more than 18 percent, the high quarterly rate in seven years. So far, 80 percent of companies in the indexes have reported have beaten expectation.Peter Eavis\u2019s takeDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note broke through 3 percent early Tuesday, the first time since 2014 that the benchmark borrowing rate has carried a \u201cthree handle.\u201d Big picture, there\u2019s not much news here. Rates are rising on the back of solid global growth and a Federal Reserve that continues to gradually raise rates this year.No news, however, doesn\u2019t mean no worries. Nearly a decade after the worst of the Great Recession, no one knows exactly how reliant the American economy has become on rock-bottom interest rates. With average 30-year fixed mortgage rates now topping 4.4 percent, housing data has been persistently soft in recent months. And residential real estate is expected to be a drag on first quarter G.D.P. numbers when they\u2019re published on Friday, suggesting that if rising rates are no reason to panic, they shouldn\u2019t merely be shrugged off either.A number of prominent bond investors have long eyed the 3 percent level. Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and manager of one of the largest U.S. bond funds, warned that hitting 3 percent would trigger bear market for bonds.A similar move higher in February caused stocks to tumble. So far, though, equities have taken Tuesday\u2019s climb above 3 percent in stride. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are essentially flat in early trading.That stunning conclusion, from a new study, could shake up discussions in boardrooms and C-suites everywhere. (The study tracked compensation at 2,282 companies from 1996 to 2014.)One of the most interesting theories about why women may have bridged the pay divide at the highest levels has been offered by previous studies and experts: that a premium has been applied because there is such a limited supply of women in the chief executive role. Some readers may find that an offensive idea on its face \u2014 that women in effect are being overpaid because of their scarcity \u2014 but it\u2019s one that has gained currency among some academics.Shares in Shire jumped in Tuesday trading, reaching 3,977.20 pence by late trading London time.\u2014 Michael de la MercedWhat does this mean for Uber?\u2022 Uber sold its business in China to Didi in 2016. As part of the deal, Uber and investors in its UberChina took a 20 percent stake in Didi and Didi invested $1 billion in Uber.ESL\u2019s argument: Buyers offering \u201cacceptable\u201d prices for the businesses haven\u2019t emerged, and Sears needs the cash for its self-help plan. Mr. Lampert, chairman and C.E.O. of Sears, would recuse himself from any board discussions over the bids, and a majority of Sears\u2019s non-ESL shareholders would have to approve any plan.Critics\u2019 argument: Mr. Lampert is trying to keep Sears\u2019s best assets for himself if the company files for bankruptcy protection, a fate most of the retail world think is a given. \u201cHe has been taking productive assets out of the company since Day 1,\u201d Mark Cohen, a former Sears executive, told the NYT.Sears is burning through more than $1 billion of cash a year and its sales continue to decline.The deals flyaroundWhat might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers (median compensation: $28,466) more? If labor markets continue to tighten, the question soon won\u2019t be hypothetical.Since Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose its total compensation expense, Peter Eavis did some math. Multiplying that median pay number by the total number of employees gives a (hypothetical!) comp expense of $16.1 billion. Two more sums:By comparison, a 10 percent raise at Walmart would have cut annual pretax profit by 28 percent, and a 20 percent raise is a 56 percent hit.\u2022 Mr. Palihapitiya: Bet on Box.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Lawmakers Kill Housing Bill After Fierce Debate", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 Just before a committee of California state senators voted on a landmark bill to ramp up housing production by overriding local resistance, legislator after legislator talked about a dire affordable-housing crisis that demanded bold action and a marked increase in new building.Then they killed the bill.The vote here on Tuesday evening highlighted the emergence of California\u2019s housing and homeless problem \u2014 and the fraught question of how to address it \u2014 as a potent election-year issue that promises to dominate the state\u2019s politics for years.During the public comment period, supporters told of how housing costs were chasing businesses and the middle class out of the state. They said the bill would help stop the bleeding.Later, a long line of opponents portrayed the bill as a threat to neighborhoods and low-income residents and at one point began chanting: \u201c827, what do we say? Kill the bill, kill the bill.\u201dDespite the disagreement, there was a broad consensus \u2014 among senators on the raised dais, among the constituents and lobbyists in the room \u2014 that housing costs remain a central issue.\u201cThis issue isn\u2019t going away,\u201d Mr. Wiener said.Some of the fiercest opposition came from local governments arguing that the bill would strip them of land-use decisions. The bill was also opposed by groups concerned about gentrification in neighborhoods already pummeled by rising rents.\u201cThis bill will exacerbate an already perilous situation for tenants throughout the state,\u201d said Damien Goodmon, director of Housing Is a Human Right, a division of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles. \u201cWe need to be talking about protective measures\u201d like rent control.And yet, despite broad agreement that the state will probably need to house more of its population in places where infrastructure has already been developed, there seems to be little consensus on how to go about that. Mr. Wiener\u2019s bill split a number of constituencies, largely over just how far to go in prodding localities to build more housing.Even with the committee action, the idea of state intervention in what has historically been a local problem is unlikely to go away. Mr. Wiener vowed to bring back the bill. So this may be remembered as the start of a long negotiation over how to make cities less hostile to new construction.Adam Nagourney contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Is About to be Hit With $1 Billion Fine: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Regulators are about to hit Wells Fargo with a $1 billion penalty.\u2022 The European Union is prepared to offer some trade concessions.\u2022 Two big drug makers have shown interest in bidding for Shire.\u2022 How the Time Warner C.E.O. did on the stand yesterday.\u2022 Dates to watch in the U.S.-China trade fight.The basics:\u2022 It would be the most stringent action taken against a bank by the Trump administration.\u2022 The action is said to punish Wells Fargo for forcing customers to buy auto insurance they didn\u2019t need, improperly charging mortgage customers and for having inadequate compliance practices.The misdeeds at Wells Fargo showed that the bank\u2019s sales culture had degraded. Bank employees, eager to meet sales goals, had been opening accounts for customers without their consent. Other misdeeds were revealed as well.The scandals were particularly surprising because Wells Fargo, with its focus on traditional lending, was widely viewed as a worthy alternative to the Wall Street-focused institutions at the center of the financial crisis of 2008. Wells Fargo\u2019s steady revenue growth and its habit of invariably beating earnings forecasts lulled investors into a false sense of confidence and led them to pile into Wells Fargo\u2019s stock.\u2014 Peter EavisCritics\u2019 cornerNow would not seem like the ideal to start a venture capital firm that aims to help U.S. start-ups break into the Russian market, given the political tensions between the two countries.The firm said on Thursday that it has opened for business in the U.S. with a $200 million fund, its second, for investing in a variety of industries, from A.I. to fintech. And it has hired a veteran of Silicon Valley, Anurag Chandra, to help in that mission.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, said in an interview that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. Declining to comment on politics broadly, he said that Russia \u2014 which remains one of the biggest markets for apps worldwide \u2014 will remain a compelling destination for start-ups.\u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dFort Ross\u2019s team is betting its contacts in Russia and knowledge of the market will help attract U.S. start-ups. Mr. Orlovski was previously the chief digital officer at Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest bank, and maintains connections in that region, including through his former employer.For one of Fort Ross\u2019s existing investments, the social trading start-up eToro, the investment firm introduced the portfolio company to a local player in Russia to help it crack that market.Fort Ross began raising its latest fund in the fall, drawing investors from Russia and the Middle East. (Mr. Orlovski said that the investors are primarily family offices and wealthy individuals, though he does eventually want to branch out into traditional money sources like U.S. pension funds.) But the goal, he added, was to make the firm better-known in Silicon Valley, a task he argued would not be hampered by his background or focus.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like we are a second- or third-tier venture firm just because I\u2019m personally from Russia or because we have connections to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cOne year, or a couple of years ahead, we want to be a bigger player in the community of V.C.s here.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe European Union, with its $16 trillion economy and its reputation for toughness in trade negotiations, could be the immovable object that stymies President Trump\u2019s combative trade agenda.But that outcome is looking less likely.According to the Journal, the European Union is prepared to reduce tariffs on United States cars and industrial machinery, among other goods. The newspaper also reported that the bloc might offer to join the United States in pressuring China to relax its trade and investment rules. (In return, the European Union is reportedly asking for European companies to be given access to United States government procurement contracts.)The Trump administration apparently proposed the punitive tariffs as a way to secure compromises from trading partners, and bring them into an alliance against China. If the European Union bends to this strategy, rather than rejecting it outright, it would be a notable gain for Mr. Trump.\u2014 Peter EavisTakeda Pharmaceutical disclosed on Thursday that it has bid for more than $60 billion for the Irish drug maker Shire, though the offer was rejected. But it may have competition in the form of Allergan, which said on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire.Still the disclosures, following weeks of speculation, again raises the prospect of consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry. Drug makers have long looked to big takeovers to broaden their product portfolios.For Takeda, which is based in Osaka and whose products include treatments for acid reflux and for cancer, a big takeover would give it both more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint.But Shire, which is headquartered in Dublin and is best known for producing Adderall, would be its biggest takeover by far. (Its next-biggest acquisition was the $13.7 billion purchase of Nycomed seven years ago.)Takeda\u2019s main competitor may be Allergan, the maker of Botox, is a veteran acquirer, having been built up through numerous mergers over the years.Under the terms of that offer, Shire shareholders would own just over half of the combined company.Takeda and Shire said that they are in discussions, which could lead to yet another revised bid.Yet for both Takeda and Allergan, a deal for Shire could prove financially risky, since each company would need to borrow significant amounts of debt to finance a transaction.Under British takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to decide whether to continue pursuing Shire. Allergan has until May 17 to do the same.Advising Takeda are Evercore Partners, JPMorgan Chase and Nomura. Advising Shire are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Mr. Lohr:The rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday that the statue known as \u201cFearless Girl\u201d will soon be moved from its spot at the southern tip of Broadway to a spot facing the New York Stock Exchange.And if the city has its way, the bull will eventually go with her.\u201cSo after deciding to allow the sculpture \u2014 placed temporarily at the spot \u2014 to remain for a year, city officials came to the conclusion that the number of pedestrians spilling into the streets created a safety hazard.\u201dDuring his court testimony in Washington yesterday, the Time Warner C.E.O. argued that his company\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion sale to AT&T was necessary, given the \u201ctectonic changes\u201d in the media world wrought by Netflix and Amazon.Among the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.Lawyers for the Justice Department, which has sued to block the deal, grilled him about an internal document from last year showing plans to create digital products even without AT&T.Randall Stephenson of AT&T could take the stand today.On May 1, exemptions to the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum expire.On May 22, the public comment period ends for another $50 billion worth of tariffs, and the Trump administration can announce a final list of targets.And Aug. 18 is potentially the deadline for the administration to act on an investigation into Chinese trade practices. But there\u2019s a provision for a 180-day delay after that.Key caveats: President Trump has the power to pursue trade policy almost at whim. And a W.T.O. proceeding against China could take years.The politically minded bank already adopted principles for limiting firearm sales laid out by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. Now it\u2019s using its position as a (small) shareholder in Sturm, Ruger to urge the gun maker to adopt six Everytown principles.Among them: Supporting mandatory background checks for all sales; binding sellers to a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech. If Ruger doesn\u2019t support those principles, Amalgamated would withhold votes for Sandra Froman, a Ruger director who\u2019s also on the N.R.A.\u2019s board.The tech flyaroundAs the firm moves more into consumer businesses \u2014 pushing its Marcus online lending platform, buying Adam Dell\u2019s budget-planning app \u2014 it is looking less like a traditional investment bank and trading house and more like a one-stop shop.

{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Promotes Openness at a China Forum Rife With Restrictions", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOAO, China \u2014 The International Monetary Fund chief praised his openness. A senior British banker lauded his authoritarian rule. The Philippine president said he loves the man.Plaudits from foreign leaders like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, as well as leading figures of the economic and diplomatic world, have helped to cement this image.\u201cI congratulate you, Xi Jinping, for this new life that you have identified, for the openness that you have celebrated and advocated,\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech, \u201cfor the innovation and inclusiveness that you have encouraged.\u201dYet even as Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Xi talked about that openness, forum attendees were unable to use Google, log on to Facebook or post to Twitter about the event unless they found a way to bypass China\u2019s army of internet censors. In fact, aspects of the forum stand in stark contrast with the many ways China remains closed and intransigent.To some of the more cynical China watchers, there is a sense that the pledges Mr. Xi offered to the forum, and the world, may amount to less than they appear.The timing of reducing trade restrictions may not matter. China\u2019s tariffs in the automotive sector, for example, have already been successful in getting foreign companies to shift a large part of their supply chains to China, where they make most of the cars they sell in the country. In this respect, Mr. Xi\u2019s gesture is seen as too little too late. For many years, Chinese officials have said that they would reduce protectionist policies in the automotive industry when they are ready to move into Western markets in order to prevent the possibility of reciprocal tariffs.There was no chance for political maneuvering at the forum, though, as no American officials were present.On Wednesday, China\u2019s central bank governor, Yi Gang, also partly fleshed out how China plans to open the country\u2019s financial services sector to foreign investors.Mr. Yi did not go into details, but he said that restrictions on foreign insurers and on foreign ownership of securities would be loosened by the end of June. He added that China planned to create a connected stock market between Shanghai and London that would allow investors in either market to invest in the other, despite China\u2019s tight control on the flow of money over its border.\u201cThere is clearly a lot of room for improvement when it comes to opening up and creating level playing fields between China and the rest of the world,\u201d said Hans-Paul B\u00fcrkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group.\u201cChina is wonderful for us in business,\u201d Gerry Grimstone, deputy chairman of the British bank Barclays, told Bloomberg television on the sidelines of the forum. \u201cThe fact that Xi is prepared to give such strong authoritarian guidance within the context of a market economy is great for companies like mine.\u201dMany of the nearly 2,000 members of the news media \u2014 a figure cited by Boao organizers \u2014 who came to this sunny island for the three-day conference have dutifully carried similar messages of a strong and responsible China.Transcripts and state media clips were quickly available for those who missed out on any panels, and social media was overwhelmed with quotes from dignitaries and corporate executives about China\u2019s new position on the global stage.Mr. Duterte helped to set the tone just before heading to Boao, telling reporters back home: \u201cI need China. More than anybody else at this point, I need China.\u201dHe added: \u201cI simply love Xi Jinping. He understood, he understands my problem and is willing to help, so I would say thank you, China.\u201d\u201cChina will open up more to the whole world, but if America carries on with its protectionist measures, the U.S. will be left out,\u201d said Li Daokui, director of the Center for China in the World Economy at Tsinghua University.Should Mr. Trump follow through with threatened tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese exports, there would be an impact on the Chinese economy, said Xu Sitao, chief China economist for Deloitte China.\u201cIn the end, the effect will be some tax on the economy,\u201d Mr. Xu said.The telecommunications sectors, and specifically telecom equipment, would bear the brunt of the tariff, he added.If that spurred any concern among China\u2019s technology entrepreneurs, though, few expressed it at the forum. They broadly warned that closing borders would stifle innovation, but did not specify how a trade dispute with the United States could affect their bottom line.Shen Wei, president and chief executive of Vivo, a Chinese software company, urged companies like his to be more open with their technology. \u201cWe cannot survive without each other,\u201d he said.Baidu, China\u2019s biggest internet search company, has been a beneficiary of previous attempts by the Chinese government to protect domestic companies. Speaking at the Boao forum, Zhang Yaqin, Baidu\u2019s president, urged the United States to be more open and said that his company had not felt much impact from the growing trade tensions.\u201cI have not seen a significant influence on our basic work,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.\u201cI do not want to see this trade dispute escalate,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it will not affect the development of technology.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing, and Cao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}

And all those fans with passionate expressions of disbelief might want to share that with other people. So we offer free, specific space for fans of television to engage with other fans in real time.\u201dMs. Twinamaani, 29, attended Kean University in New Jersey, majoring in film and literature, but left one semester short of graduation when her money ran out. When her younger sister had a stroke in 2016, she quit her restaurant and post office jobs to take care of her sister\u2019s son \u2014 in addition to her own son, who is now 5. When her sister recovered, Ms. Twinamaani went back to work, first at a drugstore and then on the night shift packing boxes at Blue Apron\u2019s fulfillment center in Linden, N.J.\u201cWhen I was a kid I was always messing around with HTML and CSS for my Myspace page,\u201d she said. \u201cMaking websites has been in the back of my mind.\u201d She decided to look for a coding boot camp \u2014 an intensive course to learn the skills of web or smartphone app development.At the same time, Mr. Papas at Blue Apron was also looking for boot camps. He said that the company employed a thousand workers, the majority black or Latino, in the Linden center. \u201cLots of them are very smart, motivated and driven, but they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to pursue careers in different fields,\u201d Mr. Papas said. Training those with talent to be software engineers could bring needed ability and diversity to the company\u2019s largely white and Asian staff of 132 software developers in Manhattan.\u201cIt was difficult to find a boot camp taking people who didn\u2019t have a college education, or coming from underserved backgrounds, and giving them tools,\u201d Mr. Papas said.Then he found Access Code, a 10-month boot camp run by an organization called C4Q (formerly Coalition for Queens), which was designed to do exactly that. It offers a day or a nights-and-weekends program.\u201cNearly 70 percent of Americans don\u2019t graduate from college,\u201d said Jukay Hsu, C4Q\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cWhat are the meaningful pathways to advance their careers and create the companies of the future?\u201dBy June, the five-year-old program will have 483 graduates, all previously low-income. Half are female, half lack a college degree. Sixty percent are black or Latino, and 40 percent are immigrants.Instead of demanding traditional credentials, the program evaluates applicants as they solve logic puzzles and spend two days learning basic coding. One in 10 is accepted. C4Q says that upon entering, those students are earning an average of $18,000 a year, but when they graduate and find work in software engineering \u2014which almost all do \u2014 they make an average of $85,000.To finance this program, C4Q has experimented with different models. Originally, it charged students a price subsidized by philanthropy. Then it was free. But Mr. Hsu felt that the need for job training was spread among far too many people for donors to cover it all. Today, students pay nothing until they graduate and get a high-paying tech job. Then they pay C4Q 12 percent of their salary for three years.C4Q has also set up a \u201cjob-outcomes bond\u201d to finance the up-front costs. Two investors put up $750,000. They\u2019ll be repaid if enough students are paying tuition \u2014 in other words, if Access Code succeeds.The other is Ms. Twinamaani. She switched to a day job in Blue Apron\u2019s kitchens and commutes to Access Code in Queens at night and on the weekend \u2014 a three-hour, $20 round trip.Alongside tech skills, Access Code teaches students how to work in a corporate culture. They visit tech companies and meet engineers. And they grapple with the ways they might sabotage themselves.In the kitchens, Ms. Twinamaani\u2019s salary was just over $20,000. As a Blue Apron software engineer, she\u2019ll make at least $85,000 and potentially closer to six figures, Mr. Papas said. The first thing she intends to do is move her sister and their children out of their basement apartment in Elizabeth. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream to live in a place where my son can go outside and play on the lawn,\u201d she said.Boot camps are for adults who want to change jobs. But part of the struggle is getting a wider group to see a tech career as an option from the beginning. Several people I interviewed told me, \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\u201dThe giant in that field is Girls Who Code; about 90,000 girls, from every state, have joined its afterschool clubs or taken summer courses, where they develop websites and apps to attack a problem they care about.Girls make up 20 percent of high school computer science classes, and there is likely to be only one black girl, if any. \u201cAt every stage of the pipeline it\u2019s leaky for women and people of color,\u201d said Ms. Saujani of Girls Who Code.Her organization is big enough and successful enough that it is changing the numbers. \u201cWe\u2019re on track to reach gender parity by 2027,\u201d said Ms. Saujani. \u201cWe\u2019re filling the pipeline with talent.

{"Headline": "Why We Should Be Optimistic About Retail", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewAs consultants who have lived and breathed retail for more than 25 years, we\u2019re pained by such headlines, but we remain believers in the industry. Traditional retailers have already made meaningful progress addressing one of their three biggest problems \u2014 too many stores \u2014 and have begun to address the other two: the high level of debt on their balance sheets and the rise of digital retailing. We\u2019re also optimistic about the industry\u2019s prospects because of its long history of successful reinvention.Retail has been in a constant state of renewal since the earliest days of commerce. Artisans were disrupted by merchants, who were disrupted by bazaars and spice-route traders. Pushcarts disrupted stand-alone stores. The Sears Roebuck catalog of 1893 disrupted the first era of brick-and-mortar retail. Malls disrupted the town square; superstores and category-killers disrupted the local five-and-dime. And now, off-price, dollar stores, fast-fashion and online players are shaking up the industry. Through it all, retail has survived.The disrupter du jour is, of course, Amazon \u2014 which collected more than 40 cents of every dollar spent online last year.Few retailers have figured out yet how to compete effectively with Amazon, but some perspective is necessary. Just 8.9 percent of retail sales in the United States last year were made online \u2014 including Amazon. Said differently, 91.1 percent of the $5.7 trillion consumers spent at retailers last year still passed through brick-and-mortar locations. Yes, the share of retail sales taking place online will continue to increase for some time \u2014 but not forever.Here are three reasons to be confident in the industry\u2019s prospects:First, while bankruptcies and store closings are certainly painful, they are helping whittle away at retail\u2019s overcapacity problem. Last year the United States had 23.5 square feet of retail space per person, according to Morningstar. That compares with 16.4 square feet in Canada and 11.1 square feet in Australia, the next two countries with the most retail space per capita. And compared with Europe or Japan, America has nearly six times as much retail space per capita. No industry can survive with that kind of crushing overcapacity for long \u2014 and retail has now awakened to that fact.Second, the industry is beginning to reduce its debt levels. True, an average of $5 billion per year in high-yield retail debt is set to come due between 2019 and 2025, according to Fitch Ratings. That\u2019s on top of this year\u2019s $1.9 billion. More and more lenders are valuing a retailer with an inelastic balance sheet less than a retailer that has more options. Add to that the benefits of a growing economy, rising wages for consumers and the benefits to retail from the new tax law, and we just may have a recipe for a retail renaissance.Third, as Peter Drucker famously said: \u201cThe purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two \u2014 and only two \u2014 basic functions: marketing and innovation.\u201dThe marketing part will be easy for retail \u2014 it\u2019s in its D.N.A. The innovation part will be tougher, and there will be many more setbacks along the way (including companies trying to beat Amazon at its own game).But we see the innovative experiments going on in retail today \u2014 the \u201cexperiential\u201d stores appealing to those craving experiences as much as things, the \u201cshoppertainment\u201d malls combining entertainment with spending, the back-to-the-future \u201clocal\u201d retail that eschews universal brands in favor of more curated offerings \u2014 and this gives us even more confidence.Don\u2019t bet against retail; the destruction it\u2019s going through now is, as in the past, of the creative variety.Mr. Bines and Mr. Bassuk are the global co-heads of retail consulting at AlixPartners LLP.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Charles Zwick, Who Balanced Budget Under Johnson, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles J. Zwick, who as President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s last budget director helped engineer the only federal surplus posted within a span of nearly four decades, died on Friday at his home in Coral Gables, Fla. He was 91.The cause was cancer, his wife, Barbara, said.Mr. Zwick managed to reconcile these competing forces with an income tax surcharge.\u201cWhen you couldn\u2019t support both guns and butter without an increase in taxes, then you were in trouble,\u201d Mr. Zwick said in 1968 in an interview for the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library.Fueled by a booming economy, the surcharge resulted in a $3.2 billion surplus for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, by which time Richard M. Nixon was in the White House. It was the only surplus generated by the federal budget from 1960, the last full year of the Eisenhower administration, to 1998, under President Bill Clinton.Mr. Zwick\u2019s assistant budget director, Peter A. Lewis, also gave credit for the surplus to what he described as Johnson\u2019s uncomplicated formula for bankrolling federal disbursements.\u201cRather than closing this or that loophole,\u201d Mr. Lewis said in a telephone interview, \u201cat the end of your tax form you just added 10 percent.\u201dCharles John Zwick was born on July 17, 1926, in the Plantsville section of Southington, Conn., to the former Mabel Rich and Louis Zwick, a farmer who raised vegetables and flowers.\u201cThen we grew what is known as the last crop of every farm in Connecticut, a housing development,\u201d he said in 2000. \u201cThat was the end of the Zwick farm.\u201dHis mother sent him off to the University of Connecticut, where the only A grade he received as a freshman was in economics.\u201cI said, \u2018Gee, that is pretty good. Maybe that is what I ought to be, an economist,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Zwick recalled.When his father was seriously injured in a tractor accident, he returned home to run the farm for several years.\u201cThat was enough for me to decide I did not want to be a farmer full time,\u201d Mr. Zwick said.He enlisted in the Army and served in Japan after World War II, then completed his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in agricultural economics in 1950 and 1951 at the University of Connecticut. He later earned a doctorate in economics from Harvard.His first wife, the former Joan Cameron, died in 2005. He is survived by their two children, Bob and Janet E. Zwick, and his wife, the former Barbara Collingwood.Mr. Zwick was a researcher at the RAND Corporation from 1956 to 1965, heading its logistics department and studying urban transportation and Air Force efficiency. He came to the attention of the Johnson administration during the Vietnam War as leader of an on-site RAND study of the so-called pacification program to win popular support for the South Vietnamese government. The study concluded that the program was failing because the government\u2019s leadership was not indigenous.He was named assistant to the budget director, Charles L. Schultze, in 1966 and succeeded him in 1968.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Failures of Anti-Trumpism", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistWACO, Tex. \u2014 Over the past year, those of us in the anti-Trump camp have churned out billions of words critiquing the president. The point of this work is to expose the harm President Trump is doing, weaken his support and prevent him from doing worse. And by that standard, the anti-Trump movement is a failure.We have persuaded no one. Trump\u2019s approval rating is around 40 percent, which is basically unchanged from where it\u2019s been all along.We have not hindered him. Trump has more power than he did a year ago, not less. With more mainstream figures like H. R. McMaster, Rex Tillerson and Gary Cohn gone, the administration is growing more nationalist, not less.We have not dislodged him. For all the hype, the Mueller investigation looks less and less likely to fundamentally alter the course of the administration.On trade, immigration, entitlement reform, spending, foreign policy, race relations and personal morality, this is Trump\u2019s party, not Reagan\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s.A lot of us never-Trumpers assumed momentum would be on our side as his scandals and incompetences mounted. It hasn\u2019t turned out that way. I almost never meet a Trump supporter who has become disillusioned. I often meet Republicans who were once ambivalent but who have now joined the Trump train.Even in blue states, Republicans refuse to criticize the man. In districts across Southern California, 11 Republican House candidates were asked about their positions on various issues. Seven of them refused to answer any question concerning Trump, and the four who did were strongly supportive.Democratic anti-Trumpers had better hope they win in 2020, because their attacks have only served to entrench Trumpism on the right. Meanwhile, if Republican never-Trumpers were an army, they\u2019d be freezing their buns off in Valley Forge tweeting over and over again that these are the times that try men\u2019s souls.Why has Trump dominated? Part of it is tribalism. In any tribal war people tend to bury individual concerns and rally to their leader and the party line. As late as 2015, Republican voters overwhelmingly supported free trade. Now they overwhelmingly oppose it. The shift didn\u2019t happen because of some mass reappraisal of the evidence; it\u2019s just that tribal orthodoxy shifted and everyone followed.Trump opponents, the academics say, are open-minded and value independence and novelty. Trump supporters, they continue, are closed-minded, change-averse and desperate for security.This analysis strikes me as psychologically wrong (every human being requires both a secure base and an open field \u2014 we can\u2019t be divided into opposing camps), journalistically wrong (Trump supporters voted for the man precisely because they wanted transformational change) and an epic attempt to offend 40 percent of our fellow citizens by reducing them to psychological inferiors.The main reason Trump won the presidency is that tens of millions of Americans rightly feel that their local economies are under attack, their communities are dissolving and their religious liberties are under threat. Trump understood the problems of large parts of America better than anyone else. He has been able to strengthen his grip on power over the past year because he has governed as he campaigned.Until somebody comes up with a better defense strategy, Trump and Trumpism will dominate. Voters are willing to put up with a lot of nonsense for a president they think is basically on their side.That is the advice we anti-Trumpers still need to learn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deficits Don\u2019t Matter", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistI\u2019m of two minds about this reconsideration. On the one hand, there is some unavoidable arithmetic at work here. The deficit can\u2019t simply get larger and larger over time, without some serious economic consequences. If every president ran up the deficit as much as George W. Bush did, financial markets would at some point begin to punish the United States government, out of a legitimate fear that it wouldn\u2019t be able to repay its debts. Borrowing would become more expensive for this country, and our economy would suffer.\u201cRising deficits forever\u201d just isn\u2019t a serious economic position. And we should be grateful that one of our two political parties understands as much and has acted responsibly to reduce the deficit.On the other hand, I agree that Democrats and many independents have worried too much about the deficit in recent years. (And many Republicans have wrongly warned about the evils of deficits, even if they haven\u2019t done anything to address those evils.)It seems clear that the federal government can run larger deficits than many observers thought \u2014 without spooking the markets. It\u2019s also clear that our country has some big problems, more serious than the deficit, that government spending could alleviate: inequality; outdated infrastructure; a shortage of high-quality preschool, K-12 and higher education; a shortage of clean-energy research and subsidies; and so on.By all means, the next Democratic president should make these issues a top priority \u2014 and not worry, in all likelihood, about increasing the deficit along the way. If a future Republican president is instead left to deal with that deficit, that would only be fair, after the last 40 years. Ultimately, though, the deficit is not an artificial construct dreamed up by centrist pundits. It matters.Advertisement"}
