{"Headline": "Remington\u2019s Bankruptcy Stalls Ruling in Sandy Hook Families\u2019 Suit", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lawsuit brought by family members of those killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has been watched closely over years of winding its way through the court system. But a new hurdle stands in the way of a much-awaited ruling.The case is now before the Connecticut Supreme Court, where families brought an appeal with the aim of bringing the case to a jury trial. Remington\u2019s bankruptcy does not guard the company from potential liability, but it has stalled the court from issuing a ruling on the lawsuit until the company emerges from the process. The court has been weighing the case after hearing oral arguments last year.The families\u2019 lawyers contend that the bankruptcy will ultimately have little influence on the case\u2019s viability. \u201cThe bankruptcy proceeding doesn\u2019t affect our claim,\u201d said Katie Mesner-Hage, one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, nine families who had a relative killed and a teacher who was shot and survived. \u201cThe only thing the process does is delay it to some degree.\u201dThe case, amid recurring episodes of deadly mass violence, has drawn an intense response. When the lawsuit reached the Connecticut Supreme Court, gun control advocates, school officials and emergency doctors who treated victims of assault rifle fire submitted amicus briefs in favor of the lawsuit. Gun-rights organizations also weighed in, including the National Rifle Association, which argued that the case stood to \u201ceviscerate\u201d the gun companies\u2019 legal protections.Remington will remain in business as it reorganizes and unloads hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, according to court records. The process could be expedited because the company is using a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy, which could be completed as early as May. Remington\u2019s lawyers did not respond to messages seeking comment.Remington, which has about $950 million in debt, began hinting this year that it was likely to file for bankruptcy. Before the 2016 presidential election, the gun industry had maintained a robust manufacturing operation. But gun sales have plummeted since President Trump won the election; many attribute the decrease to gun buyers believing that the Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress would be less inclined to pursue tougher gun-control measures.Remington recently hired Lazard, a financial advisory firm, as the company devised its restructuring plans and searched for financing for its reorganization. Lazard approached more than 30 potential lenders on Remington\u2019s behalf before finding financial companies willing to give them a loan, according to court filings. A Lazard representative wrote that many lenders \u201cindicated that they were reluctant to provide financing to firearms manufacturers.\u201d And even some of the ones who ended up lending Remington money had their names redacted from court documents.Susheel Kirpalani, a bankruptcy lawyer who has been consulting the Sandy Hook families\u2019 legal team, said that he and others had been scouring Remington\u2019s voluminous filings and disclosure documents, looking for anything in the complex financial transactions that might affect the Sandy Hook lawsuit. The company\u2019s filings indicate that creditors, including the Sandy Hook plaintiffs, would be \u201cunimpaired\u201d by the Chapter 11 process, which means that the lawsuit can resume after the reorganized Remington emerges from bankruptcy.Even so, beyond the bankruptcy, the Sandy Hook lawsuit has faced long odds of success.Congress granted gun companies industrywide immunity from blame when one of their products is used in a crime. But the law, enacted in 2005, includes exceptions for sale and marketing practices that violate state or federal laws and instances of so-called negligent entrustment, in which a gun is carelessly given or sold to a person posing a high risk of misusing it.The lawsuit argues that Remington \u2014 along with a wholesaler and dealer, which were also named in the suit \u2014 erred by entrusting an untrained civilian public with a weapon designed for maximizing fatalities on the battlefield. It also asserts that the companies relied on advertising, with messages of combat dominance and slogans like \u201cConsider your man card reissued,\u201d that appealed specifically to disturbed young men like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman.The gun companies contend that federal law shields them from the families\u2019 claims, and a lower court judge agreed, dismissing the lawsuit in 2016.Still, the families believe that the companies bear a measure of responsibility. \u201cThe families\u2019 ultimate goal in filing the lawsuit is accountability,\u201d Ms. Mesner-Hage said.Advertisement"}

First, Mr. Trump said he was imposing tariffs against steel and aluminum imports from a range of countries. Then came announcements of actions against China that included tariffs on a large number of products.Very few restrictions have come into effect, though. President Trump has allowed temporary exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs. The moves against China have to go through a public comment process before they can take place.Investors, executives and farmers who have concerns about the economic impact of the trade actions may like that little has so far happened. And they may hope that Mr. Trump uses the leeway he has under trade law to step back from his threats. But supporters of tougher trade policies will be watching closely to see if Mr. Trump actually carries them out.In the coming months, there are a number of important dates at which the Trump administration has to decide whether it wants to retreat, delay, negotiate, fight on or escalate. To help assess the stance of the United State in this trade standoff, DealBook has compiled these dates.Before looking ahead, it\u2019s important to note that the Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on some countries.Much remains up in the air, though.\u2014 Peter EavisOne of Wall Street\u2019s biggest (and nerdiest) contests is between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

From 2010 until 2017, Morgan Stanley\u2019s annual return on equity was stronger in only two of those eight years, and those two years were not good ones for Wall Street overall.A big test was going to be how these banks fared in unambiguously good conditions, like those that existed in the first quarter of this year, when trading activity was strong and the economic outlook bullish. Goldman\u2019s return on equity in the first quarter was 15.4 percent, compared to 14.9 percent for Morgan Stanley.In other words, Goldman clinched the bragging rights. But with some rounding, they both achieved a 15 percent return.\u2014 Peter EavisThe Wall Street firm reported record revenue and profit for the first quarter driven by a jump in trading and the new tax law.\u2022 Morgan Stanley reported profits of $2.58 billion, up 40 percent from a year ago.

{"Headline": "Nordstrom Opening a New York Store as Other Retailers Close Theirs", "Date": "2018-04-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Nordstrom family has run stores for more than a century, first selling shoes in the Pacific Northwest and later introducing fashion-forward clothing to wealthy suburbanites across the country.But the Nordstroms, one of the last remaining dynasties of American retailing, had never made a big bet in nation\u2019s retailing capital until now.On Thursday, Nordstrom will open its first full-line store in Manhattan, a sleek, three-floor home to men\u2019s clothing, shoes and grooming supplies at 57th Street and Broadway.But the Nordstroms think they can buck the trend, even as many investors on Wall Street have grown wary of brick-and-mortar retailing.Last week, with seven days before the doors were to open, the new store buzzed with contractors installing wiring and sales staff getting trained on shoe styles and online pickup.The racks were hung with a mix of runway fashion pieces and the shelves were filled with stacks of Levi\u2019s jeans. Large windows flooded the aisles with natural light. By a front entrance, there was a Comme des Gar\u00e7ons jacket festooned with a furry ladybug pattern priced at a cool $5,023. And there was a pair of sparkling blue and red Gucci loafers with an $830 price tag.But there were also Samuelsohn suits starting at about $1,000, Vans sneakers for about $50 and Adidas slides for $20.Nordstrom created a mock-up of the new men\u2019s store in an industrial area outside Seattle, accessible only to employees, as it tried to figure out how best to appeal to both New York\u2019s fashion mavens and more down-to-earth shoppers on lunch break.\u201cWe know a market like New York doesn\u2019t need just another place to buy a pair of pants,\u201d said Peter Nordstrom, a company co-president and a great-grandson of the co-founder John W. Nordstrom.The store may serve as a test case for whether department stores have a future, as people more frequently shop online. To compete, Nordstrom is aiming to combine cutting-edge technology with old-school in-store service.Rag-snapping shoe shiners will work on the bottom floor, while digital screens in the suit section will display custom-made jackets on an avatar of the shopper. There will be 16 tailors on staff \u2014 part of the largest network of tailors in North America.The company plans to open an even larger women\u2019s store, totaling seven stories, across from the men\u2019s store in the fall of 2019. And Nordstrom already operates two Nordstrom Rack stores \u2014 a line of discount stores that has flourished among bargain hunters \u2014 in Manhattan.One reason the company is making such a big investment in Manhattan: Other similar businesses find that their Manhattan stores are among their best performing \u2014 despite all of the city\u2019s recent retail turmoil.But opening large, cutting-edge stores in one of the priciest real estate markets \u2014 and most competitive retail environments \u2014 in the world is a costly endeavor. \u201cIt is definitely risky, there is no question about it,\u201d said Joel Bines, global co-head of retail at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. \u201cYou need to have nerves of steel to attempt to run a large-scale profitable shopping destination in Manhattan.\u201dNordstrom must also answer to Wall Street, where investors easily get impatient with companies that make long-term investments at the expense of profits.\u201cWe have heard this story before,\u201d the analyst wrote in a research note.Last June, the family \u2014 which founded the company as a shoe store in 1901 \u2014 sought shelter from the stock market.Peter Nordstrom and his brothers Erik and Blake, the company\u2019s three co-presidents, and their father, Bruce Nordstrom, the company\u2019s former longtime chairman, and a few other family members set out to acquire all of the company\u2019s shares and take the retailer private.\u201cThe whole world is changing,\u201d Erik Nordstrom said in an interview. \u201cIt is not a time to milk the business and take the proceeds and just keep them.\u201dFor months, the family group \u2014 which owns about 30 percent of the shares \u2014 went looking for financing, but a rash of retail bankruptcies \u2014 including Toys \u201cR\u201d Us \u2014 raised fears on Wall Street that brick-and-mortar retailers were perilous investments.In the interview, Erik Nordstrom said \u201cthere is some disappointment\u201d in the failed privatization process.\u201cWe are not interested in taking the company private just for the sake of taking it private nor would we put this massive burden of debt on the company to do it because it served our own interests,\u201d he said.Peter Nordstrom left open the possibility that they could revive the effort down the road. \u201cI think our family wants to reserve the right to continue to do what we think is in the best interest of the business,\u201d he said.This week, the family said it is focused on opening the new store. Bruce Nordstrom searched years ago for a place to open a New York store, but could never find the right opportunity.\u201cIt is really a subject that has spanned the generations,\u201d Erik Nordstrom said.Nordstrom considered locating its new store in the Hudson Yards development, on the Far West Side. But it settled on the immediate area around Columbus Circle, near the retail shops in the Time Warner Center and a hive of ultraluxury apartment construction.Initially, Nordstrom planned to open a combined men\u2019s and women\u2019s store that would be part of a new building, but decided to open a dedicated men\u2019s store when a large space \u2014 previously occupied by several banks, a struggling discount retailer and a muffin shop \u2014 opened up nearby.Nordstrom signed the lease for the men\u2019s store property in late 2015. Faith Hope Consolo, a retail broker at Douglas Elliman, said rents were generally higher then. But Nordstrom may have gotten a deal, she said, because of the size of the property. A Nordstrom spokeswoman declined to comment on the terms of the lease.The women\u2019s store, meanwhile, will be constructed from the ground up in the new building.\u201cWe feel like we can go in there and we can do our thing and have a chance to be successful,\u201d Peter Nordstrom said. \u201cIt may be the hardest thing we\u2019ve ever had to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Wants to Close Trade Gap, but Leaves Export Agency in Limbo", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "The Export-Import Bank has been effectively crippled, and big business groups are angry that the board of the bank has been left completely vacant.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As trade tensions mount, an 84-year-old Washington institution could have been a powerful tool for President Trump. The institution, the Export-Import Bank, was created to help American companies compete overseas and bolster exports by providing cheap government-backed loans.But the institution, which once financed multibillion-dollar projects, has been effectively crippled by the Trump administration. The bank has been without a chairman since Mr. Trump took office and the last of the bank\u2019s five board members quit in March. Since 2015, it has not had the quorum of at least three members it needs to finance deals or projects worth more than $10 million.The effective shuttering of the bank has put American manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric at a global disadvantage, prompting a frenzied lobbying campaign by business groups worried that the White House is undermining its own trade goals.\u201cThe Export-Import Bank plays a vital role in supporting American companies as they work to sell their products to customers across the world,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cBut as long as the seats remain vacant, U.S. businesses are at a disadvantage relative to global competitors.\u201dIn the past, the bank had been used by large corporations like Boeing and General Electric, which received loan guarantees to sell products like airplanes, satellites and industrial equipment to developing countries, lifting sales and supporting American jobs. It has provided loan guarantees to overseas airlines looking to buy American-made jets and helped organizations like the Environmental Chemical Corporation build water facilities in Africa.Proponents of the bank, including some lawmakers, argue the institution could be a powerful weapon for a president who wants to increase domestic manufacturing and narrow the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports overseas.Ex-Im provides the kind of government subsidies that other nations regularly use to help domestic companies compete abroad. Mr. Trump regularly blames those subsidies for a flood of cheap imports, saying they exacerbate the United States trade imbalance.To business groups, manufacturers and veterans of the bank, Mr. Trump appears to be undermining his own trade aspirations by leaving Ex-Im in the lurch.\u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s really being well served,\u201d said Fred P. Hochberg, the most recent chairman of the bank, who departed in 2017. \u201cIf you want to be able to reduce trade deficits and you want to be able to export more, particularly capital goods, that\u2019s what an Export-Import Bank does.\u201dIn recent years, the bank has been barely functional. According to its most recent annual report, Ex-Im authorized just $3.4 billion of mostly short-term export credit in 2017. That is down from the $20 billion that it authorized in 2014, the last year that the bank was fully operational. The report points out that China provided $34 billion in medium- and long-term financing for its exports in 2016, underscoring the competitive disadvantage that the United States faces.The bank\u2019s crippling has been costly for both companies and their workers, including Boeing, which Mr. Trump has hailed as an emblem of American innovation. In the last two years, two deals involving the sale of its commercial satellites have been canceled and one was significantly delayed given the lack of a quorum at Ex-Im. The stalling of these deals alone has cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cRestoring the Export-Import Bank to full strength is the single best thing Washington can do right now to build on the economic momentum of tax reform, shrink our trade deficits and level the playing field so American workers can win,\u201d said Tim Keating, Boeing\u2019s executive vice president for government operations.\u201cCountries in Europe and beyond have been luring U.S. manufacturers to set up shop overseas to take advantage of foreign export financing because the U.S. system is effectively broken,\u201d Mr. Timmons said. \u201cManufacturers in the United States have lost billions of dollars in deals, and tens of thousands of American workers have lost opportunities for well-paying jobs supported by the exports that the Ex-Im Bank could have helped secure.\u201dAt a congressional hearing last week, Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, pressed Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, about the fate of the bank and argued that not using its financing amounted to a lost opportunity. He suggested that some in the Trump administration wanted the bank to collapse.\u201cThe president says he wants to see the trade deficit shrink, here\u2019s a way we can do it,\u201d Mr. Dent said.In an interview after the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin would not say when the president would nominate a new leader for the bank, or whether some of his colleagues were rooting for its demise, but he insisted that Mr. Trump supported keeping the bank alive.\u201cThe president does want it to function,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\u201cSo instinctively you would say it\u2019s a ridiculous thing, but actually it\u2019s a very good thing and it actually makes money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it actually could make a lot of money.\u201dBut the White House has done little to advance its nominees and politics continue to be an obstacle. Conservatives have traditionally disliked the bank because they argue that it amounts to corporate welfare and rewards rich corporations that do not need taxpayer assistance.\u201cThey distort markets, impose risk on taxpayers and they\u2019re bad policy for everybody,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of Ex-Im and favors private financing alternatives.Mr. Toomey has used procedural tactics to delay the nomination of the remaining nominees to the bank\u2019s board. He said he wanted Mr. Trump to pick a \u201creformer\u201d like Mr. Garrett, who does not believe in the current mission of the bank. And he said he hoped that the president would urge other countries to unwind their export financing banks as part of his trade negotiations.Democrats who support the bank are growing increasingly impatient.\u201cOne of the best things we can do to help the economy support jobs is to get Ex-Im fully functioning as soon as possible,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and \u201cthe full Senate should immediately confirm the bipartisan nominees so we can continue to support American businesses, manufacturing and jobs.\u201dAction does not appear to be forthcoming. An aide to Mr. McConnell said that votes on Mr. Trump\u2019s other nominees would not be held until he names a new chairman.For now, Ex-Im is ambling along. Veterans of the bank say that career employees are increasingly heading for the exits. Atop the bank\u2019s website is an image of its boardroom, with five empty chairs.This week, Ex-Im will hold its annual conference in Washington, but considering the circumstances, the gathering is unlikely to be a festive event.\u201cWho are you going to get to speak?\u201d Mr. Hochberg wondered. \u201cI want to know what they are going to say.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sex Abuse Scandal Casts Shadow Over Nobel Prize for Literature", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA schism in the Swedish Academy, which has awarded the prize since 1901, erupted into the open last week, the culmination of a scandal that stretches back to November, when the newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported that 18 women had accused Jean-Claude Arnault, a major cultural figure with close ties to the academy, of sexual assault and harassment.Mr. Arnault is married to the poet Katarina Frostenson, a member of the academy, and together they run a private cultural club, called the Forum, that has received money from the academy.The newspaper reported that Mr. Arnault had mistreated women at the club and at academy-owned properties in Stockholm and Paris over a 20-year period. It also reported that Mr. Arnault had leaked information about the prize committee\u2019s confidential deliberations seven times since 1996.The Swedish police have opened an investigation, although the authorities have warned that some allegations are too old to act on. The academy has severed all ties with Mr. Arnault and with the club, and hired a law firm to review its past links to him.Mr. Arnault denies the accusations, and Ms. Frostenson has refused to step down from the academy, despite calls for her to do so. In a recent closed-door vote, eight members voted to keep her on the board and six voted to oust her. (Ms. Frostenson did not vote.)Three of the members who voted to oust her \u2014 Klas Ostergren, Kjell Espmark and Peter Englund \u2014 then announced that they would no longer work with the academy. A fourth member, Sara Stridsberg, has also threatened to leave.There is no formal provision for members to resign from the board and be replaced. Even before last week, two of the academy\u2019s 18 members long ago stopped taking part and have not been replaced: One left in 1989 as part of a protest over the academy\u2019s response to threats made against the writer Salman Rushdie, and another stopped taking part in 2015, saying that she did not feel she fit in.\u201cConfidence in the Swedish Academy has been severely damaged,\u201d the Nobel Foundation, which manages the financing and administration of the Nobel Prizes, said on Wednesday in an extraordinary public rebuke. \u201cIt is not yet possible to say how this will damage the Nobel Prize.\u201dThe foundation said that the academy needed to ensure the confidentiality of the prize deliberations; that the process for this year\u2019s literature prize must be \u201cexecuted in a trustworthy fashion\u201d; and that suspected crimes should be \u201creferred to and handled by the justice system.\u201d\u201cIt takes a long time to repair damaged confidence,\u201d the foundation added. \u201cThe Swedish Academy\u2019s members must now put their mission before their individual interests to restore faith in the Academy\u2019s important work with the Nobel Prize in Literature.\u201dKing Carl XVI Gustaf also weighed in, saying in a statement: \u201cThe conflicts which have arisen within the Swedish Academy are deeply unfortunate and risk seriously damaging the Academy\u2019s important functions.\u201dThe academy, founded in 1786 by King Gustav III, has 18 members who are elected for life terms. The current king said he might have to invoke his monarchical authority to alter the academy\u2019s rules to provide for the replacement of members who leave the board.Worsening the scandal, new evidence has emerged showing that as early as 1996, a textile artist, Anna-Karin Bylund, complained to the academy\u2019s top administrator at the time, Sture Allen, about sexual harassment by Mr. Arnault. Mr. Allen, who remains a member of the academy, has said he did not act on the letter because \u201cthe contents of the letter didn\u2019t seem important.\u201dOn Wednesday, Ms. Bylund told Dagens Nyheter that Mr. Arnault had sexually assaulted her in the early 1990s. His lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The controversy has exposed deep rifts within the academy. One member, Horace Engdahl, an admirer of Mr. Arnault, has called his three colleagues who left \u201ca clique of sore losers\u201d who should not have aired the internal disagreement in the public. \u201cThese sorts of indiscretions are more damaging to the academy than a Nobel Prize decision that has leaked out a few days too soon,\u201d he said.Mr. Engdahl has also criticized the academy\u2019s administrator, Sara Danius, the first woman to occupy that post. Ms. Danius, whom supporters describe as a force for reform and modernization, was behind the decision to hire the law firm. She has said little in public since the controversy erupted.As Mr. Engdahl\u2019s comments rippled through the Swedish press this week, his ex-wife, Ebba Witt-Brattstrom, also rose to criticize him. She called the academy \u201cincredibly patriarchal\u201d and said that Ms. Danius was being bullied for being an outspoken woman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Votes to Ease Restrictions on Auto Lending Discrimination", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted on Wednesday to overturn an Obama-era rule that restricted automobile lenders from discriminating against minorities by charging them higher fees for car loans, in the latest attempt by Republican lawmakers to roll back financial regulations.Republican lawmakers, along with one Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, seized on the Congressional Review Act to overturn guidance issued in 2013 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The 1996 law gives Congress the power to nullify rules formulated by government agencies but has primarily been used to void recently enacted rules.Republicans have long derided the consumer bureau, created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, for exceeding its authority, and President Trump\u2019s pick to lead the agency on an interim basis, Mick Mulvaney, has largely frozen its rule-making and enforcement.Democrats and consumer watchdogs criticized the move and warned that Republicans were making broader use of the Congressional Review Act to advance their deregulatory agenda.\u201cBy voting to roll back the CFPB\u2019s work, senators have emboldened banks and finance companies to engage in racial discrimination by charging millions of people of color more for a car loan than is justified,\u201d said Rion Dennis of Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group. \u201cLawmakers have also opened the door to challenging longstanding agency actions that are crucial to protecting workers, consumers, civil rights, the environment and the economy.\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, warned that rescinding the guidance would lead to a flood of unfair, predatory lending.\u201cThis truly repugnant resolution ignores the unacceptable, undeniable truth that consumers\u2019 interest rates are regularly marked up based on their race or ethnicity \u2014 a disgusting practice that continues to run rampant across the country,\u201d he said.The Department of Justice can still bring lawsuits against auto lenders for discriminatory practices, even if the guidance is nullified. However, legal experts say the government could be less successful in bringing such cases without the guidance from a government agency saying the practices are viewed as improper.The settlements rankled Republicans who argued that the consumer bureau was using \u201cjunk science\u201d to make the case that auto lenders were discriminating against customers on the basis of race.But business groups and Republicans cheered the move, saying it would ease lending restrictions for car purchases.\u201cThe legislation is a measured response to the CFPB\u2019s attempt to regulate the $1.1 trillion auto financing market, avoid congressional scrutiny by issuing \u2018guidance,\u2019 and impose a new policy without necessary procedural safeguards,\u201d said Peter Welch, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association.Mr. Toomey hailed the rollback of the auto-lending restrictions as the repeal of an \u201cill-conceived regulation\u201d and a sign that Congress was ready to reassert control over government agencies that have exceeded their authority.\u201cAny guidance, in fact any rule-making, ultimately, should be subject to congressional review,\u201d Mr. Toomey said.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the auto lending restrictions epitomized the consumer bureau\u2019s rogue approach under its previous leadership. He said that the bureau had abused and exceeded its legal authority in trying to prevent discrimination in auto lending.\u201cI look forward to finally repealing this harmful and flawed bulletin very soon,\u201d Mr. Hensarling said.Advertisement"}

Last year, seniors from La Ca\u00f1ada High School, one of the highest rated in the state, fanned across the country to M.I.T., the University of Michigan and Yale.But 18-year-old Annie Shahverdian, the daughter of a commercial real estate agent and a nursing administrator, started her higher ed journey closer to home, 15 minutes down the road at the local community college. To save money, she is planning to spend two years at Pasadena City College, a two-year public institution, before heading to what she hopes will be a top four-year university where she will earn her bachelor\u2019s degree.\u201cMy parents don\u2019t want to just throw money around now,\u201d Ms. Shahverdian said as she walked across Pasadena\u2019s 53-acre campus, heading toward her English class. \u201cI\u2019m getting a great education at a fraction of the cost.\u201dCommunity colleges have long catered to low-income students who dream of becoming the first in their families to earn a college degree. And for many, that remains their central mission. But as middle- and upper-middle-class families like the Shahverdians face college prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, more of them are looking for ways to spend less for their children\u2019s quality education.\u201cThis is about social norms,\u201d said Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple University in Philadelphia. \u201cMore middle-class parents are saying, I\u2019m not succumbing to the idea that the only acceptable education is an expensive one.\u201dIn recent years, Pasadena City College has had a 320 percent increase in students whose parents make more than $100,000 a year, to 828 students last year from 197 in 2007. And it\u2019s not alone.A 2017 study that looked at tax records and college attendance data found that hundreds of two-year colleges are now magnets for well-off students, with many \u2014 like Williston State College in North Dakota, and Colorado Northwestern Community College in Rangely \u2014 having clocked notable increases. More recently, colleges like Northern Virginia Community College have reported their own increases. The number of first-time students there whose family income is $60,000 or above rose 69 percent, to 6,104 this past year from 3,610 in 2010.Ms. Shahverdian is taking advantage of a free-college program Pasadena began, as it waits for the state to fund Mr. Brown\u2019s plan.And this fall, Princeton will join a growing group of selective colleges that are focusing more on transfer students. The initiative is directed at attracting more low-income students, but middle-class ones are also likely to see benefits.To lure students, some two-year colleges are starting to look a lot like their four-year peers, offering study abroad programs, modern dorms and renovated cafeterias.\u201cWe don\u2019t have lazy rivers and climbing walls,\u201d said Scott Ralls, the president of Northern Virginia Community College, which consists of six campuses outside of Washington that have become magnets for the area\u2019s middle-class students. But the college does have an honors program, a hockey team and a new 80,000-square-foot fine arts center, with a campus bookstore, a fitness center and a multipurpose gym.As for Pasadena, the outdoor Olympic-size swimming pool is hard to miss, along with sign-up sheets for tennis and fencing, and coding clubs. Nearby, students can grab coffee at the campus espresso bar.\u201cWe want to serve everyone in this community,\u201d said the school\u2019s superintendent-president, Rajen Vurdien. That includes a club that supports students who have recently been released from prison, a club to aid recently arrived immigrants and a tutoring collective. There are signs for the campus food pantry and pamphlets for the free dental clinic.Ariana Woodworth, a first-year student who graduated last year from South Pasadena High School and wants to transfer to the Parsons School of Design in Manhattan when she finishes at Pasadena City College, says being thrown into the melting pot that is community college has been an important plus. Her high school was mostly middle class and wealthy.Still, going 15 minutes from home for college, while many of her classmates were heading across the country, \u201ctook a toll.\u201d\u201cIt was rough,\u201d she said.And not everyone thought it was a great idea. Ms. Shahverdian said one classmate at La Ca\u00f1ada told her: \u201cOh, that\u2019s good for you. But I would never be able to do that.\u201dNshan Boiadjian, 20, is expected to graduate in May from Valencia College in Orlando, Fla., with his associate degree in general studies. \u201cA lot of people think if you don\u2019t go to a big, hot-shot university, your education is garbage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201dA self-proclaimed \u201ctalker,\u201d Mr. Boiadjian said he benefited from the small class sizes common at Valencia and the engaged teachers whose focus was their work in the classroom, not their research. Few community college professors do outside research.He recalls spending hours after one mythology class debating the origins of Buddhism with a professor and several other energized students. \u201cWe went on and on.\u201dValencia has recently become one of a growing number of community colleges to administer a bachelor\u2019s degree, and Mr. Boiadjian has decided to stay on.Mia Fleming, an international business major at Pepperdine University, thinks she knows why. During her two years at Merced College, a 15,000-student commuter college north of Fresno, she saw how a lean roster of guidance counselors made it challenging to stay focused and motivated. She said she needed to \u201creally seek out\u201d good teachers.Nicole Figueroa is in her third year at Pasadena as a communication studies major, and she hopes to become the first person in her family to get a four-year degree. She has no issues with attending a community college that serves middle-class students, as long as administrators do not lose sight of their work with low-income ones. The school offers an abundance of key services, she said, but needs to get better at \u201cputting them out there.\u201dMiddle-class parents who send their children to community colleges say it can send a powerful message to them about personal finance.John Riordan is a management consultant from a Washington suburb, with Northern Virginia Community College down the road from his house. One of his sons is there now and has his sights on a degree from the University of Virginia. Mr. Riordan\u2019s daughter will begin community college in the fall. He says it is valid to debate the merits of the University of Virginia for two or four years and suspects that four may be better.\u201cBut do a cost-benefit analysis. Is it 20 times better?\u201d he said.Lynn O\u2019Shaughnessy, the author of \u201cThe College Solution: A Guide for Everyone Looking for the Right School at the Right Price,\u201d cautions that saving money can come with some unknown costs.While many community colleges have clearly marked pathways to graduation and transfer agreements with highly prestigious four-year schools, not all do. And some students discover that the two years of classes they took \u201csaving money\u201d need to be retaken when they transfer to a four-year school.Byria Hamblin, a graduate of Lone Star College, near Houston, did not let that happen during her two years there, and she is a now a political science major at Tulane University in New Orleans. Ms. Hamblin, an award-winning debater in high school, said she had always thought she would go straight to a four-year school. But the prices blew her away.While at Lone Star, she was agitated by Instagram photos of her high school classmates. One friend went to Columbia University and spent a lot of time \u201cliving an urban lifestyle,\u201d and another went to George Washington University in Washington, where he explored the capital. When classmates were home for breaks, they were not always kind about her choice.But once Ms. Hamblin got to Tulane, which costs more than $50,000 a year, the tables turned. When she tells her new friends there where she spent her first two years, she often hears, \u201cI really should have done that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Federally Financed Ghettos", "Date": "2018-04-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.FEDERALLY SPONSORED SEGREGATIONThe same toxic pattern prevailed under Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, when the government created the first public housing projects for nondefense workers, building separate projects for black people, segregating buildings by race or excluding African-Americans entirely. Particularly telling is the fact that racially integrated communities were razed to make way for Jim Crow housing.Government at all levels embraced racial covenants that forbade even well-to-do African-Americans from purchasing homes outside of black communities. Cut off from homeownership \u2014 the principal avenue of wealth creation \u2014 African-Americans lost the opportunity to build the intergenerational wealth that white suburban families took for granted. The vast wealth gap that exists today between whites and African-Americans has its roots in this era.The housing act put the federal government on record as supporting open housing and prohibiting the pervasive discrimination that had locked most African-Americans out of decent accommodations and homeownership. But the version that passed in 1968 had been declawed \u2014 stripped of enforcement provisions that would have given HUD strong authority to root out discrimination. Nearly a quarter-century would pass before Congress strengthened the law. So during that time, African-Americans were left subject to the harsh discrimination the original act was supposed to preclude.This progressive sounding law \u2014 which requires entities that receive federal money to \u201caffirmatively further\u201d fair housing goals \u2014 was consistently undermined by officials of both parties who had little appetite for confronting entrenched segregation.That realization came home with particular force to George Romney, Richard Nixon\u2019s HUD secretary, who initially took the law at its word and tried to enforce it by turning down grant applications from communities that continued to segregate themselves racially.THE NEXT FAIR HOUSING FIGHTThe common-sense rule rightly breaks with the laissez-faire approach of the past, making it clear that compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws means abandoning the strategy of dumping affordable housing in ghettos \u2014 and giving poor residents access to areas that offer greater opportunity. To that end, communities that receive HUD money are being asked to consider data on segregation and concentrations of poverty when making affordable housing decisions.The fact that Congress has not overturned the rule reflects a growing awareness on both sides of the aisle that ghettoizing poor people is counterproductive \u2014 and that the country has an interest in giving low-income families access to areas that further opportunity. Later this month, for example, the House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on a draft bill that would increase mobility for families receiving federal housing vouchers, improving their job and educational opportunities.This brings us back to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which was intended to break down the walls around the country\u2019s ghettos so that at least some people could forge successful lives elsewhere. If the country keeps betraying this landmark law, it will continue to squander a powerful tool for reducing lethal concentrations of poverty and for opening the door to upward mobility for the poor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Profit Swells to $1.6 Billion, Lifted by Its Cloud Business", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, long ago figured out how to keep Amazon\u2019s sales figures shooting skyward. Now he is doing the same with profit.The company, which once seemed to have only a passing interest in turning a profit, said its net income for the first quarter more than doubled. Although Amazon is best known as an internet shopping destination, its cloud computing and advertising businesses were big contributors to the jump in profit.Mr. Bezos singled out the performance of the company\u2019s cloud computing business \u2014 known as Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. \u2014 referring in a statement to a \u201cremarkable acceleration\u201d in growth in the segment for a second consecutive quarter.Amazon often boasts of its commitment to lowering prices \u2014 part of the reason its profits have been so limited until now \u2014 but on Thursday it announced a price hike for one of its most important offerings. The company said it was raising the price of its Prime membership service 20 percent, to $119 from $99. Prime memberships include two-day shipping at no extra cost, a video streaming service and other benefits.Amazon\u2019s shares surged 7 percent in after-hours trading following the release of the quarterly news.The company reported that its net income for the first quarter, which ended March 31, was $1.63 billion, or $3.27 per share, compared with net income of $724 million, or $1.48 per share, in the same period last year. Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, up from $35.7 billion a year earlier.The average estimate of financial analysts, compiled by Thomson Reuters, was for revenue of $49.87 billion and earnings of $1.27 a share.\u201cThis was an unusually strong quarter for Amazon, where results came in both better for revenue and profits across the board,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Like Facebook, which has faced a grilling in Congress over its data protection practices, Amazon has faced criticism in Washington. President Trump has regularly slammed the company, saying it was killing jobs and not collecting enough taxes.But as with Facebook\u2019s users, Amazon\u2019s customers have apparently not been swayed by criticism of politicians, though many of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks happened after the end of the quarter.Amazon\u2019s revenue received a big lift from the company\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods Markets last year. The company\u2019s physical stores business, most of which is from Whole Foods, added $4.26 billion in revenue for the quarter.Revenue from A.W.S., meanwhile, rose 49 percent to $5.44 billion from the same period a year earlier.That increase is larger that what the A.W.S. business was seeing just a few quarters ago. It is unusual to see revenue growth increase significantly at Amazon\u2019s size and in a hypercompetitive market, and it seems to have prompted Mr. Bezos to single out the business in his statement.Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said, \u201cThat\u2019s rare to see him say something like that.\u201dThe increase in the cost of Prime memberships came shortly after Mr. Bezos announced, in the company\u2019s annual shareholder letter, that Amazon had more than 100 million Prime subscribers globally. During the first quarter, revenue from subscription services, including Prime, jumped 60 percent to $3.1 billion.Amazon said the price on Prime will go up on May 11 for new members, and starting June 16 for renewals of membership for existing members. The company said the increase, the first for its annual plan in four years, was the result of significantly increased costs for the service.Those include the billions of dollars that Amazon has poured into financing new television shows and movies which have been added to its video streaming service. On Thursday, it announced with the National Football League a renewed agreement for Amazon to exclusively stream Thursday night football games to Prime subscribers.In a call with financial analysts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said that four years ago, Prime members could receive free two-day shipping on about 20 million products from Amazon. Now that figure is 100 million.\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of new features that we\u2019ve continually added to the Prime program,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said. \u201cIt\u2019s much different than it was in 2014.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 52 Places Traveler: In Los Cabos, Beaches Abound, but So Does Generosity", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlace 10The southern tip of Baja California, Mexico, turned out to be like an immersive choose-your-own-adventure novel. Here are a few of those turns, and the resulting ups and downs.I sped along a two-hour inland drive from touristy San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo, until paved highway gave way to dirt roads and dust and the coast came into view. Within an hour of parking, I was snorkeling with sea lions in Gulf of California waters containing the oldest of three coral reefs on the west coast of North America. \u201cWhen I thought of Baja and Cabo San Lucas, I just thought it would be party people and filled with Americans,\u201d said Luis Roberto D\u00edaz Flores, a 24-year-old brand content producer from Mexico City I met snorkeling. He was vacationing with friends in La Paz, the state\u2019s capital city, two hours north of Los Cabos. \u201cBut for the four days we\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve just been surprised over and over again. To me, the places I\u2019ve seen here are probably in my top five that I\u2019ve ever experienced in my own country.\u201d My directive was to explore the peninsula\u2019s lesser-known East Cape \u2014 but I got greedy. The only time I\u2019ve been to Baja was when I was 12 and, this time around, I wanted to gobble up the whole coastline. That included a visit to the beaches of Todos Santos, an artsy town on the west coast that was not at all on the itinerary. The pit stop, as they are sometimes wont to do when you\u2019re not paying attention, turned into five hours. Here is where my choose-your-own-adventure theory of Baja began. Every dirt path I turned down had unmarked forks in the road, which led to different unmarked forks. One choice took me to a steep, winding hill road with grooves so deep I thought my tire would get wedged in one. Another took me into a den of snarling dogs. \u201cWe\u2019re going to another beach. You\u2019re welcome to come with us,\u201d said Mr. D\u00edaz Flores, the vacationer from Mexico City I had met on my snorkeling jaunt. He and his friends had gotten a tip about a hidden haven toward the northern exit of the park. A dirt road led us to a stretch of sand and a sign for Playa Miramar. Clusters of tents overlooked gently rolling surf. Towels and swimsuits were draped across every surface of a pickup truck to dry. By no design, I\u2019d come to Mexico on Semana Santa, or Holy Week, when most of the country, including my new friends from Mexico City, happened to be on break. What Mr. D\u00edaz Flores and I found after a little asking around was a heartening makeshift town of Cabo San Lucas locals. All echoed the same sentiment, that they had driven two hours from their homes because this is the closest swimmable camping beach available to them. Many of the beaches along the Hotel Row of their city and San Jos\u00e9 were private, and the ones that weren\u2019t had strict no swimming or camping policies because of fierce waves and riptides. What had struck me most about Baja, beyond even the beaches, was a spirit of generosity that reminded me of being back home in New Mexico. I saw that generosity in drivers who were constantly stopping their cars in the middle of a highway to allow me to make a left turn. Or my waiter at Flora Farms, Jorge Solano, who invited me to go to La Baladra Beach with his entire family. Or a plumber on a camping holiday at Playa Miramar who gave me his name and number and invited me to his niece\u2019s quincea\u00f1era next year \u2014 an invitation that I soon lost to a gust of wind. Anyone in Cabo, if you know a plumber named Oscar, please tell him I\u2019d be honored if he\u2019d get in touch. Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: ChileAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hungary Election Was Free but Not Entirely Fair, Observers Say", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe ubiquitous overlap between government information and ruling coalition campaigns, and other abuses of administrative resources blurred the line between state and party,\u201d he said.They were often placed next to campaign-financed posters featuring a photoshopped image of the Hungarian-born American billionaire and frequent Orban target, George Soros, embracing the opposition candidates.While taking the government to task for the way the campaign was conducted, including not allowing civilian monitors, the O.S.C.E. found no problems with the execution of the election itself, where more than 8.3 million people were registered to vote.Asked about multiple reports of irregularities in the local news media, Mr. Wake said that his group\u2019s mission was limited to looking at the technical issues that relate to counting votes and tabulating results.On the national voting list, Fidesz secured more than 49 percent of the vote, with some 2.6 million voting for the party and its Christian Democratic allies. That was roughly the same as the seven largest opposition parties combined.Fidesz also won convincingly in local elections, securing a two-thirds majority in Parliament, which will give the party a free hand to pursue still deeper legal and constitutional changes that have already given it firm control over courts and other state institutions.A first step may be a \u201cstop Soros\u201d law that would allow the government to impose financial and other penalties on nongovernmental organizations that assist asylum seekers and refugees.Already, Mr. Orban\u2019s harsh talk about immigrants has been matched by policies to close off the country. Over the last three years Mr. Orban has systematically curtailed the ability of people to seek asylum here.Where there was once a wall built by the Communist rulers seeking to keep Hungarians from leaving the country, he has erected a steel-and-wire fence to keep people from entering the country. He created two \u201ctransit zones\u201d at the Serbian border, barred to the news media, where those seeking asylum must pass.The country now only allows five asylum seekers to be processed at each location every week, and that is just the start of a cumbersome process meant to make this country as unwelcoming as possible.The reaction of human rights advocates and nongovernmental organizations, often the target of government attacks, to Mr. Orban\u2019s victory was swift and defiant.Amnesty International\u2019s Europe director, Gauri van Gulik, said the group was steadfast in its resolve to work to expose abuses.\u201cWe will continue to push back against attempts to stoke hostility toward refugees and migrants and will continue to speak up for groups that support and defend them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will not be cowed by those who attempt to muzzle Hungary\u2019s critical voices and to create an atmosphere of fear.\u201dThere is little doubt that Mr. Orban\u2019s victory presents an even stiffer test for the European Union, which will now have to deal with a vastly empowered Hungarian leader who has already challenged many of the bloc\u2019s core democratic principles.The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, will write Mr. Orban to congratulate him on his \u201cclear victory,\u201d said the commission\u2019s spokesman, Margaritis Schinas.But he added: \u201cThe European Union is a union of democracy and values. President Juncker and the Commission feel that defending these principles and defending these values is the common duty of all member states with no exception.\u201dHowever, Mr. Orban\u2019s victory was cheered by other world leaders with a similar outlook.Jaroslaw Kaszynski, the leader of Poland\u2019s governing party, visited Mr. Orban in the closing days of the campaign and made his admiration clear.\u201cYou can\u2019t think about Europe\u2019s future without remembering Viktor Orban, without remembering Hungary, Fidesz,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cOur current friendship is also a shared road, a shared road toward our nations being independent, capable of deciding about our own future, our own internal affairs.\u201dMr. Kaszynski said that the two countries were not against Europe, rather they were \u201cpointing Europe in the right direction.\u201dIn Germany, the parliamentary leader of the far-right AfD Party, Beatrix von Storch, tweeted a picture of herself with Mr. Orban and a simple message: \u201cCongratulations, Viktor Orban! A bad day for the EU, a good one for Europe.\u201dGeert Wilders, the far-right leader in the Netherlands, congratulated Mr. Orban on Twitter, calling the vote \u201ca well deserved victory!\u201d France\u2019s Marine Le Pen suggested that the Hungarian election could be the start of a nationalist wave across the continent.\u201cA great and clear victory by Viktor Orban in Hungary: the reversal of values and the mass migration of the E.U. have once again been rebuffed,\u201d Ms. Le Pen tweeted. \u201cNationalists could gain a majority in the next European Parliament elections in 2019.\u201dHowever, it remains to be seen if Mr. Orban\u2019s success can be replicated elsewhere. As the O.S.C.E. report noted, his campaign was conducted in an environment that gave his party clear advantage.The O.S.C.E issued a milder criticism of his campaign four years ago, saying that the governing party had a built-in advantage because of biased media coverage, restrictive campaign regulations, and the blurring of the line between the political party and the state.So it was unlikely that the group\u2019s criticism this time would compel the party to make any changes to the way it has used the power of the state for its own purposes.\u201cA number of the issues are indeed the same,\u201d Mr. Wake said.\u201cThe response to our previous recommendations was extremely limited,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cIt was a missed opportunity.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Jersey Becomes a Key Battleground in Race for House Control", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOMS RIVER, N.J. \u2014 The tables inside the hotel room were full and Andy Kim, the candidate responsible for filling them, was pleasantly surprised. It was a weeknight fund-raiser after all, rescheduled once already, for this relatively unknown Democratic challenger in a Republican district and a thick fog on Route 37 had obscured the tiny sign directing drivers to the hotel.\u201cSeven months before Election Day this is not normal, to be able to pack a room on a weekday,\u201d he told a crowd of about 150 supporters, each of whom contributed at least $10 to listen to Mr. Kim and snack on donated croissants.In New Jersey, which has been described by Democrats and Republicans as the most suburban state in the country, the revolt has been especially muscular and has put into play Republican-held congressional seats that until this year had hardly been on the Democratic radar. Voters have grown increasingly angry with Mr. Trump, viewing many of his actions as damaging the state\u2019s fortunes.As a result, New Jersey has become a key focus of the party\u2019s effort to win the 24 seats it needs to retake the House. National leaders, outside groups and statewide officials have launched a concerted effort targeting four of the five New Jersey districts held by Republicans, including the Third Congressional District where Mr. Kim is running.Super PACs and labor groups are mapping out plans for New Jersey, though they are mostly waiting until after the party primaries in June before making official endorsements or announcements about resources devoted to the races.\u201cWe view New Jersey House races as some of the best pickup opportunities in the country,\u201d said Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Priorities USA, one of the largest progressive super PACs, \u201cand are keeping an eye on them as we decide where to play in the future.\u201dStill, despite the Democratic mobilization motivated by Mr. Trump, Democrats in New Jersey face a difficult road. Mr. Kim, for example, is seeking to unseat Representative Tom MacArthur, a wealthy self-funded Republican who has been so well entrenched in his district that the Democrats barely put up a fight in 2016. No matter the anger at the White House, Mr. MacArthur can count on strong support from reliably Republican areas like Ocean County and the Cook Political Report has continued to rate the district as \u201clikely Republican.\u201dBut all those headwinds have not dampened the enthusiasm or financial support for Mr. Kim\u2019s long-shot effort in this district, which cuts across the southern part of the state, from Burlington County to Ocean County. As of April 1, the first-time candidate with a background in national security has raised over $1.1 million with donations trickling in from all 50 states.Mr. MacArthur does have some vulnerabilities, having voted with Mr. Trump more often than anyone else in the state\u2019s delegation.In the Third District, some voters say their dislike for Mr. Trump has colored their view of Mr. MacArthur, who voted in favor of the tax law and was instrumental in the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cMy problem with MacArthur is that he\u2019s not protecting us, with health care and taxes and guns, he\u2019s doing affirmative damage to me and this district,\u201d said Susan Lavine, 64, a small-business owner from Moorestown, N.J. Ms. Lavine said she voted for Mr. MacArthur in the past two elections because, \u201cI thought he was a moderate.\u201d But she has since changed her mind and is now supporting Mr. Kim.\u201cThose are the kinds of issues that voters in Burlington look to as to what defines moderate for them, as opposed to some group in Washington,\u201d said Chris Russell, a strategist for the MacArthur campaign.Mr. MacArthur\u2019s political team also noted that the Republican who lost to Gov. Philip D. Murphy last year, Kim Guadagno, won the district by the same margin Mr. Trump did in 2016, which Mr. MacArthur\u2019s campaign said shows that the district remains loyal to the G.O.P.\u201cHaving your own brand, and having people know who you are is extremely important,\u201d said Matt Gorman, the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He said well-known incumbents are also able to run on issues, rather than simply against the president, as they work to galvanize voters. \u201cThat\u2019s why people like Lance and others were able to win seats in districts that Clinton won in 2016,\u201d Mr. Gorman said.Nonetheless, Mr. Kim has enjoyed widespread support, including the endorsement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., underscoring the shifting political dynamics in New Jersey.For the first time in about a decade, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is focused on more than two Republican-held seats, its typical strategy, and is taking aim at all five, though the seat held by one Republican, Chris Smith in the Fourth Congressional District, is considered safe.Mr. Biden announced recently that he was also endorsing Mikie Sherrill, the Democrat running in Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s district.Besides a national mobilization to win Democratic seats in New Jersey, candidates are also benefiting from Mr. Murphy\u2019s determination to strengthen his party\u2019s dominance in the state. He appointed the former finance director of his campaign, Liz Gilbert, to be the state Democratic Party\u2019s executive director and he has directed the state party to invest more heavily in this year\u2019s elections than it customarily would.\u201cHe didn\u2019t want that to end in November when he won election,\u201d Ms. Gilbert said of Mr. Murphy\u2019s desire to keep his political machine cranking. \u201cHe wanted it to be part of his governing as well.\u201dAt the fund-raiser for Mr. Kim, the optimism that the state\u2019s suburbs were tilting in the Democrats\u2019 favor was palpable.\u201cIn Toms River, where it\u2019s totally Republican all the time, Democrats just picked up three council seats,\u201d said Barbara Ann Reilly, the president of the Brick Democratic Club, referring to elections last year. \u201cI even had a group of Republicans that came to my fund-raiser and sponsored a table.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a state senator. He is Jeff Van Drew, not Chris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blockchain Will Be Theirs, Russian Spy Boasted at Conference", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last year, representatives of 25 countries met in Tokyo to work on setting international standards for the blockchain, the technology that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin and has ignited intense interest in corporate and government circles.Some of the technologists at the meeting of the International Standards Organization were surprised when they learned that the head of the Russian delegation, Grigory Marshalko, worked for the F.S.B., the intelligence agency that is the successor to the K.G.B.They were even more surprised when they asked the F.S.B. agent why the Russians were devoting such resources to the blockchain standards.\u201cLook, the internet belongs to the Americans \u2014 but blockchain will belong to us,\u201d he said, according to one delegate who was there. The Russian added that two other members of his country\u2019s four-person delegation to the conference also worked for the F.S.B.Another delegate who had a separate conversation with the head of the Russian group remembers a slightly different wording: \u201cThe internet belonged to America. The blockchain will belong to the Russians.\u201dBoth of the delegates who recounted their conversations did so on the condition of anonymity, because discussions at the International Standards Organization, or I.S.O., are supposed to be confidential. Neither the Russian organizations overseeing the delegation to the I.S.O. nor the Russian delegates responded to requests for comment.The sentiment expressed by the Russian delegate is as clear a sign as any of the significance that some governments are assigning to the blockchain \u2014 a technology that is now being applied to things as varied as financial trading and voting \u2014 and the degree to which it is becoming a subject of geopolitical battles.The Russian interest in the normally wonky technical sessions has caused concern among other delegations, who worry that individual countries could push standards that would make the security of the blockchain technology vulnerable to surveillance and attack.The I.S.O., based in Geneva, was created in 1947 to ensure that important technologies are built or measured in the same way all over the world. Over the years, it has created standards for food safety, film sensitivity and much more.Russia is not the only country sending high-powered delegations to the I.S.O. technical committee focusing on blockchain standards, which got its start last year. The 25 countries with committee delegations sent over 130 people to the last meeting to discuss matters like a common method for security. China sent officials from the finance ministry while the United States had delegates from IBM and Microsoft, according to participants.\u201cIt is a very sought-out technology today, because it really does create the foundation for the future that is coming,\u201d said Gilbert Verdian, the head of the British delegation working on blockchain standards at the I.S.O. and the founder of the company Quant Network. \u201cTo get behind it and back it now is going to put people at an advantage, either politically or economically.\u201dThe original blockchain is the shared database on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. It is kept by a distributed network of computers managed by many people, rather than one central authority. While there are now many virtual currencies, each with its own blockchain, there are also many government and corporate efforts looking at ways to use blockchain technology to securely record other kinds of data.There are still significant questions about whether the technology will live up to expectations \u2014 and few projects have proceeded beyond the pilot stage aside from virtual currency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Within the young blockchain industry there is a widespread belief that the companies and countries that establish an early lead could guide the direction of the technology, for both commercial and national security purposes.Emma Channing, a lawyer who frequently works with blockchain start-ups, recently raised an alarm about the intrigue at the I.S.O. standards group.Ms. Channing said she was worried that countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity.\u201cIn the context of software it is the perfect Trojan,\u201d said Ms. Channing, a co-founder of the Satis Group, an American company that advises blockchain projects. \u201cIf something gets buried in it, these things will get adopted wholesale \u2014 and won\u2019t be questioned on the way in.\u201dMs. Channing recently emailed dozens of blockchain experts, trying to get them to volunteer as representatives to the I.S.O. delegations in their countries, so that the process does not become dominated by a few countries.The chairman of the I.S.O. blockchain committee, Craig Dunn, rejected the idea that any country could shape the process. While I.S.O. proceedings are generally confidential, new standards must go through many stages, with many rounds of voting \u2014 first with smaller working groups and then with full national delegations.\u201cThere has to be agreement and consensus across the member countries to take a standard forward,\u201d said Mr. Dunn, who is also the head of the Australian delegation to the committee.Another member of the Russian delegation, Alexey Urivskiy, told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti last year that the delegation at the I.S.O. committee was supposed to get Russian cryptographic algorithms into the standard. The Vedomosti article said that the head of the Russian I.S.O. delegation, Mr. Marshalko, was affiliated with the F.S.B.Russia is not the only country pushing hard on the blockchain. Many Chinese government offices have been public about their interest in taking advantage of the blockchain technology for tasks like tracking people and products moving through industrial supply chains.At the I.S.O. meetings last fall in Tokyo, the Chinese government sent one of the largest delegations, with at least nine people, including representatives from the finance ministry and the Chinese central bank, according to a delegate from another country who met the Chinese participants.The United States delegation was led at the last meeting by a Microsoft employee and included a delegate from IBM. Microsoft and IBM are two of the global companies that have pushed hardest to develop blockchain technology.At the first meeting of the I.S.O. blockchain group, the Russian delegation led a study group on security and privacy issues, which caused discomfort among some delegates from other countries, according to the two delegates who spoke to The New York Times. At a second meeting, oversight for these issues was transferred to a working group led by France.Mr. Verdian, the head of the British group, said lots of delegations were jockeying to get an edge on the new technology.\u201cIt will change how our society can operate, but at the same time, in harnessing this technology people might want to leverage that for their own gain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all owe it to each other to do it right so that it benefits all of us rather than a few.\u201dOleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renaissance Tapestries Are Out. But Today\u2019s Are Having a Renaissance.", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTANSTED MOUNTFITCHET, England \u2014 What was the most expensive form of art in the early 16th century? Having Michelangelo paint your ceiling, surely?Requiring huge amounts of time, skilled labor and luxury materials to produce, tapestries were the ultimate prestige art form in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance.But now these historic hangings sell for much less than they originally cost, and sometimes for less than they were selling even 40 years ago. As is generally now the case with old master paintings, the prices for historic tapestries have fallen below the levels of their contemporary equivalents.In 1979, when the Burns family sold North Mymms Park and its contents, all 19 had been offered by Christie\u2019s. The tapestries were then bought back by the estate\u2019s next owner, to preserve the decorative scheme.On Wednesday, the five \u201cLabors\u201d sold for a seemingly impressive total of 478,000 pounds with fees, or about $680,000, led by the \u00a3146,400 given for a tapestry of Hercules and Atlas. It was bought online by a London dealer, who acquired nine tapestries in the sale. But in 1979, that same partial set was sold by Christie\u2019s for \u00a3104,000, equivalent to about $800,000 in today\u2019s money.An 18th-century Brussels tapestry of a village festival, also formerly owned by Mr. Morgan, sold for \u00a39,760. At the Christie\u2019s auction 40 years earlier, it achieved a top price of \u00a328,000.\u201cThey\u2019ve gone down substantially,\u201d said Penny Bingham, a specialist valuer whom Sworders consulted for the North Mymms Park auction.\u201cPeople want instant color, and they\u2019re generally less interested in wall hangings and textiles,\u201d she added, noting that potential buyers were concerned about tapestries\u2019 colors fading.\u201cIncreased computing power means you can do things you couldn\u2019t do before,\u201d said Adam Lowe, the founder of Factum Arte, which facilitates and produces artworks using a range of new and established techniques. \u201cArtists are getting really excited by tapestry and are trying to push what can be done with the medium,\u201d added Mr. Lowe, who points out that the Jacquard loom\u2019s early-19th-century punch-card technology prefigured modern computing.\u201cThe looms have become so sophisticated in the last 10 years,\u201d said Mr. Horsfield, who immerses himself in the painstaking process of turning a large-scale photograph into data, then into an even bigger, unique tapestry. \u201cI can make it look exactly like a photo. It doesn\u2019t look like a tapestry. It doesn\u2019t have that materiality.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re so expensive to make,\u201d he added, noting that the weaving alone of a single tapestry panel could cost more than \u20ac25,000.\u201cBig things are back,\u201d Mr. Booth-Clibborn said, referring to the renewed commercial appeal of large contemporary tapestries now that \u201ccollectors are creating warehouse-style private museum spaces.\u201dUnique, hand-woven tapestries made today in the tradition of Leo X\u2019s Sistine hangings are, by contrast, almost a different medium.One of just two tapestry studios left in Britain, Dovecot would not divulge the cost of the commission, but it did say that just one meter, or close to a yard, of its tapestry costs \u00a325,000 to weave. Mr. Ofili\u2019s Trinidad-inspired landscape covers 20.7 square meters, or almost 223 square feet, implying a cost of more than \u00a3500,000 for a commission the company said would \u201csupport endangered skills and nurture talent.\u201dBut how can you tell the difference between hand- and machine-woven tapestries, other than price?\u201cThere\u2019s more life to them, a bit more expression,\u201d said Naomi Robertson, one of Dovecot\u2019s master weavers, who chooses colors by eye and mixes dyes by hand. \u201cWe see ourselves in a 50-50 relationship with the artist. We\u2019re expressing ourselves as we weave. We blend the colors and find the language to create the work.\u201dTapestry is once again gaining value in the art world. But as with so much else in that world, it\u2019s out with the old and in with the new.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banker Finds He Has \u2018Even More Enemies Than I Thought\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIGA, Latvia \u2014 The governor of Latvia\u2019s central bank, a pillar of Europe\u2019s financial system for years and a zealous champion of austerity, has long been lambasted by his critics as a heartless enforcer of economic dogma. In a play that recently ended a long run at the National Theater, his character is stabbed to death onstage.\u201cThe same thing is happening to me in reality,\u201d Europe\u2019s longest-serving central bank chief, Ilmars Rimsevics, said in an interview last month just after the Latvian Parliament voted 55 to 0 asking him to resign because of a swirl of corruption allegations.At the center of a tumultuous real-life drama that has left him under investigation on suspicion of taking bribes and has destroyed the country\u2019s biggest locally owned private bank, Mr. Rimsevics, never a popular figure, has been taken aback by all the hostility. \u201cI have even more enemies than I thought,\u201d he said.Since then, his home has been burgled by unidentified intruders and he has struggled to defend himself against what he describes as a conspiracy by crooked bankers who want him in jail because he threatened their profits from highly risky money laundering deals.About the only person to defend him publicly is his ex-wife, Lyga. A family, she said, even a divided one, should look out for its own.Rules protecting the central bank from political meddling make it difficult to unseat Mr. Rimsevics, who denies any wrongdoing and has refused to quit. Even his underlings in the central bank, known as Latvijas Banka, seem to want him gone. They decided recently to bar him from using his office, the bank\u2019s computer system, staff cars and other facilities.He \u201chas few to zero friends,\u201d said Morten Hansen, the head of the economics department at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga.After weeks of silence, the European Central Bank, on whose governing council Mr. Rimsevics sits but whose meetings he cannot attend because he is barred from leaving Latvia, this month offered a timid gesture of support. It asked the European Union\u2019s top court to weigh in on whether the \u201csecurity measures\u201d imposed on him violated rules protecting the independence of European central banks.The standoff is unlikely to end soon. The European court rarely makes swift decisions and Latvia\u2019s Corruption Prevention Bureau, which is leading the investigation into Mr. Rimsevics, has said that the case would not be handed over to prosecutors for months.Mr. Rimsevics attributes his troubles to what he says was his hard line against Latvian banks that profit from taking deposits from and moving funds for nonresident clients, mostly citizens of former Soviet lands. \u201cThey are taking their revenge,\u201d he said.The American bombshell, which the bank insists was the result of \u201cfalse information,\u201d but that supported what many have long suspected, was followed quickly by an even more shocking blast \u2014 the news that Mr. Rimsevics, a man so powerful and seemingly immovable that he was known as \u201cthe king,\u201d was under investigation for taking bribes.Officials say the two events are not connected, but Mr. Rimsevics insists they both flow from the same source \u2014 the dirty shenanigans of Latvia\u2019s \u201cnonresident\u201d banking sector.He said it was no coincidence that anticorruption investigators first raided his central bank office and his home a few hours after he declined a request from ABLV bank for a billion euros in \u201cliquidity support\u201d to help survive a bank run caused by the Treasury Department report. \u201cThe two things are absolutely connected,\u201d he said, claiming that he is the victim of a \u201cbig plot\u201d by dodgy bankers.Latvia\u2019s finance minister, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, a chess grandmaster well versed in elaborate gambits, derided Mr. Rimsevics\u2019s conspiracy theory. \u201cI know this is his line of defense,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a free country so he can say whatever he wants.\u201d Yet, she added, \u201cHe is not a victim. He is a suspect.\u201dAlso skeptical about Mr. Rimsevics\u2019s claims of victimhood is Ainars Latkovskis, the chairman of the Latvian Parliament\u2019s Defense, Internal Affairs and Corruption Prevention Committee. Mr. Latkovskis said his committee had long pushed for tighter controls on banks like ABLV but, speaking in the chamber where the committee has discussed ways to toughen measures against money laundering, he said, \u201cwe never saw him here in this room.\u201dJohn Christmas, a banker who worked with Latvia\u2019s now defunct Parex bank, said Mr. Rimsevics had, at times, shown concern about money laundering. He remembers meeting the central bank chief in 2004 and getting an earful about Parex. \u201cHe started cursing that Parex was a criminal organization,\u201d Mr. Christmas said.All the recent tumult, accompanied by purported death threats and accusations of Russian meddling, has delivered a sharp blow to Latvia\u2019s image as a placid and predictable country firmly anchored in the West, a counter-model of post-Soviet development to that offered by Russia.The evidence against Mr. Rimsevics for bribetaking has not been revealed, and the only accuser to come forward so far is Grigory Guselnikov, the Russian owner of Norvik, another Latvian bank focused on nonresident clients. Speaking by telephone from London, where he lives, Mr. Guselnikov said he had been asked to pay 100,000 euros, around $125,000, in bribes a month by an intermediary sent by Mr. Rimsevics. He also accused the central banker of having once worked for the Soviet K.G.B.Mr. Guselnikov\u2019s accusations, said Mr. Rimsevics, \u201care total, total lies.\u201dLatvia\u2019s Defense Ministry, in a statement in response to the crisis rocking the country\u2019s financial world, claimed that the tiny Baltic nation had fallen victim to a \u201cmassive information operation from outside\u201d that was \u201cidentical in structure and execution\u201d to operations linked to Russia that preceded elections in France, Germany and the United States.Marshall Billingslea, an assistant secretary at Treasury, visited Riga last month to again press officials to curtail Latvia\u2019s shady nonresident banks and assure them that Washington has evidence that ABLV not only laundered dirty money but \u201cused bribery to influence Latvian officials when challenging enforcement actions and perceived threats to their high-risk business.\u201dThe bank has categorically denied paying bribes and has cast itself, like Mr. Rimsevics, as a victim.The finance minister, Ms. Reizniece-Ozola, said the Defense Ministry statement portraying Latvia as a victim of a Russian-inspired hybrid war did not mean to suggest that Moscow is to blame for all the troubles that have engulfed Mr. Rimsevics and ABLV bank. It was, she said, simply a reminder of the tense geopolitical backdrop to the banking crisis at a time when Russia is working hard to undermine NATO and the European Union, both of which Latvia has belonged to since 2004.Only 6 percent of ABLV\u2019s deposits, which totaled $3.2 billion at the end of 2017, came from Latvians. The largest share \u2014 43 percent \u2014 was from Russians.The problem, said Ms. Reizniece-Ozola, is not that depositors are Russian but that \u201cwe don\u2019t really know who they are,\u201d as most operate through layers of opaque shell companies.Over the years Latvian banks, particularly ABLV, have figured in scandals involving crime-tainted money. These include the transfer of funds stolen by corrupt Russian officials exposed by Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in a Moscow prison in 2009; money from a $1 billion bank heist in Moldova in 2014; and billions of dollars transferred out of Russia in what the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project called the \u201cRussian laundromat.\u201dAfter long denying that Latvia had a serious problem and arguing that the country was merely utilizing its \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d as Russia\u2019s neighbor but part of Europe, the authorities and even some banks have tried to end the free-for-all. They have imposed tougher anti-money laundering controls and are at least paying lip service to the idea that crime-tainted money should be shunned.\u201cIt is clear that the credibility and reputation of the financial sector has been damaged,\u201d said Sanda Liepina, the new chairman of the Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, which for years played down accusations of money laundering. Control measures introduced starting in 2015, she said, \u201cshould have been taken four or five years earlier.\u201dMr. Rimsevics, the beleaguered central bank chief, says he, too, \u201cfelt uneasy about what has been going on for years\u201d in Latvian banks catering to Russians, but when he tried to curb their shady activities, ABLV, Norvik and other banks \u201c complained about me big time.\u201dHe said he had even received text messages on his cellphone warning that he would be shot if did not ease up.Whatever the truth of that, one thing seems clear: Latvia\u2019s role as the \u201cSwitzerland of the Baltics,\u201d a business model eagerly cheered by European and American consultants and officials in the early 1990s, seems over.\u201cThis is really yesterday\u2019s business,\u201d Ms. Reizniece-Ozola said. \u201cThe sooner the banks themselves understand that, the better.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the assistant Treasury secretary who visited Riga last month. He is Marshall Billingslea, not Billingsea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israeli Leader Is Forced to Retreat on African Migrant Deal", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 In a head-spinning turnaround, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel announced on Monday that he had reached an extraordinary deal with the United Nations refugee agency to resettle thousands of African asylum seekers in Western countries. Within hours Mr. Netanyahu suspended the deal after coming under heavy criticism from his coalition partners.The flip-flop appeared to reflect Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fear of losing support from those partners or from his right-wing constituency, who call the asylum seekers infiltrators and want them gone. His opponents on the left described the prime minister\u2019s behavior as an embarrassing and cowardly surrender under pressure.If the deal with the United Nations refugee agency bought Israel some international good will, diverting attention from Friday\u2019s flare-up along the border with Gaza when Israeli forces killed at least 15 Palestinians and wounded many more, the effect was short-lived.The agreement with the United Nations was meant to replace a contentious Israeli plan that had offered the migrants a stark choice: forced deportation to Africa or prison. That plan fell through after Rwanda, the African country meant to receive the deportees, announced that it would accept only those who left Israel voluntarily.In the afternoon, in a televised news conference, Mr. Netanyahu triumphantly announced the new deal, under which the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees committed to persuading countries in the West to take at least 16,250 migrants over five years, while Israel would grant official status as temporary residents to most who remained.Estimates of the population of African asylum seekers in Israel, mostly from Eritrea and Sudan, range from 35,000 to 39,000.But the agreement to let many stay in Israel drew harsh criticism from some of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition allies, who were taken by surprise. Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the far-right Jewish Home party, said the deal would \u201cturn Israel into an infiltrator\u2019s paradise.\u201dMr. Netanyahu backtracked.He said he was suspending the deal with the United Nations refugee agency pending a meeting on Tuesday morning with the veteran residents of south Tel Aviv, where many of the African migrants are concentrated, and that he would then review the understandings reached with the agency.The European Union\u2019s delegation in Israel was incredulous.The New Israel Fund accused Mr. Netanyahu of lying, saying the organization, which has offered support for the asylum seekers in Israel, \u201chad nothing to do with Rwanda\u2019s decision to refuse to participate in the Prime Minister\u2019s cruel mass deportation plan.\u201d\u201cIt is pathetic, shameful, and a stain on Israel in the global arena that the Prime Minister would blame Israel\u2019s human rights defenders for his ineptitude and his immoral policies,\u201d the New Israel Fund said in a statement.Earlier, at the news conference, Mr. Netanyahu revealed details of the new deal.\u201cThe agreement states that for every person who leaves, one will stay,\u201d he said, noting that the refugee agency would be financing the departure. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good solution, a proper solution.\u201dThe plan was to be carried out in three phases, with the first 6,000 migrants expected to leave over the next 18 months.William Spindler, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency in Geneva, said there was no agreement in place with other countries to take any of them. He said that the agency would need countries to come forward with offers, but that \u201cwe are confident we will be able to find places for these 16,000 people.\u201dMr. Netanyahu explained to the Israeli public that he had come to the arrangement with the United Nations after it became clear that sending the migrants to Rwanda was no longer an option. \u201cWe were in a catch,\u201d he said, \u201cmeaning they would all have remained here.\u201dAs part of the new plan, the Israeli government and the United Nations refugee agency said they would encourage a more balanced distribution of the asylum seekers who remain in Israel. That effort would include vocational training, job placement, and help with integrating into new communities.The issue of the African asylum seekers has long roiled Israeli society.From 2005 until 2012 about 60,000 surreptitiously crossed into Israel over the once-porous border with Egypt. Under international conventions, Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers could not be sent back to their home countries, where they could face persecution.Anger built up among many longtime residents of south Tel Aviv, who complained that the migrants had brought crime and made their neighborhood unlivable. Other Israelis volunteered to help the migrants. Many passed through a remote detention center in the Negev desert.The government stopped the flow by building a steel barrier along the border and by making life for the migrants in Israel increasingly uncertain and uncomfortable. Few asylum seekers have received refugee status. Government ministers routinely call them \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and economic migrants who threaten Israel\u2019s future as a Jewish state.At least 20,000 have left Israel, and Mr. Netanyahu said he had made it his mission to deport the rest.Stickers appeared in pubs, cafes and other establishments saying, \u201cThis business opposes the expulsion of asylum seekers,\u201d and citing biblical verses like Leviticus 19:34: \u201cThe stranger who resides among you shall be to you as one of your citizens; you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\u201dNick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva.Advertisement"}

As he\u2019s shown, those skills are certainly transferable.I\u2019m supposed to feel better about the tax bill I\u2019ll be paying this time next year, with lower rates. But I\u2019ll take a hit under the new deduction limits on state and local taxes. And since you\u2019re getting rid of the individual mandate, my health care premiums will go up as well. Thanks, non-Obama.All of this would be fine if I felt better about our shared enterprise, which is looking sketchier and more gangster-like by the day. If you could, please don\u2019t spend my money on the personal vendettas, institutional lies and attempts to protect the criminals associated with Trump.It\u2019s one thing for the president\u2019s personal fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to threaten to \u201ccome at you, grab you by the neck\u201d when not involving government service. But once you start using public money from the executive branch to bully law enforcement into backing off its investigations of thug life, then you\u2019ve made me a co-conspirator.I want to be proud of how my money is spent, not afraid that it can and will be used against me.The biggest stuff \u2014 gazillions for defense, massive subsidies for agriculture conglomerates, a down payment on the vanity border wall \u2014 just seems beyond my capacity for targeted outrage.Because of Pruitt\u2019s paranoia, his security detail costs about $3 million a year. Do you know how many trails the National Park Service could repair with that? Well, of course you do, you\u2019re The Government. And those millions don\u2019t include the door \u2014 $2,460 to replace \u2014 that was broken down when Pruitt\u2019s bodyguards mistook an afternoon nap for a medical emergency. Which raises the question: Why are they guarding his naps?If Pruitt truly needed dictator-level security and motorcades, he wouldn\u2019t fly coach when he\u2019s traveling on his own dime. He gouges us because Trump thinks he\u2019s doing an outstanding job not enforcing clean air and water laws.What would make me feel a little better is if someone there in The Government would finish Trump\u2019s audit so he can release his tax returns, as promised two years ago. When you audited me, I sat down with a nice lady and a calculator, and we finished up before my coffee got cold. But then, I didn\u2019t have nearly as many cryptic business expenses marked \u201cother.\u201dIf any problems arise with my return, please contact Mark Zuckerberg, as he knows more about me than I do.Sincerely, A Taxpayer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Says Trump and Cohen Can\u2019t Yet Review Materials Seized by FBI", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA federal judge in Manhattan indicated on Monday that she was not prepared to grant President Trump exclusive first access to documents seized in F.B.I. raids on the office of his personal lawyer, and said that she was considering appointing an independent lawyer to assist in reviewing the seized materials.Feeling her way toward a resolution of the high-stakes clash involving Mr. Trump and the federal prosecutors investigating the lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, the judge, Kimba M. Wood, did not grant Mr. Trump\u2019s request to review the trove of materials ahead of prosecutors. But she also decided that prosecutors would not immediately have access to the materials and that Mr. Trump would ultimately receive copies of the documents that pertain to him.Lawyers for Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, and prosecutors with the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York, had asked Judge Wood for the right to look at the documents in order to determine which among them might be protected by attorney-client privilege. That step is important because it could affect which documents prosecutors can ultimately use in the investigation.While Judge Wood did not formally rule on which side should get the initial look and said that discussions would continue, she added that she trusted the prosecutors.\u201cI have faith in the Southern District U.S. attorney\u2019s office that their integrity is unimpeachable,\u201d Judge Wood said.From the moment he entered the White House, Mr. Trump has had his share of trouble with federal courts around the country, where judges have ruled against him on policy issues like immigration and transgender soldiers, as well as on possible conflicts of interest involving his businesses.But the matter before Judge Wood touched on a much more intimate issue for the president, involving one of his closest relationships and potentially inching him closer to personal legal jeopardy.Mr. Cohen served for more than a decade as a trusted fixer for Mr. Trump, and during the campaign had helped tamp down brewing scandals about women who claimed to have had affairs with him.A flow chart that shows how Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer saw to it that a porn star and a former Playboy model received payments after alleging affairs with Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen, who had not appeared at an initial hearing in the matter on Friday, showed up on Monday at the direction of the judge. After greeting a gaggle of reporters seated in the jury box, he sat quietly between his lawyers at the table usually reserved for defendants, saying nothing during the hearing.The seized documents could shed light on the president\u2019s relationship with a lawyer who has helped navigate some of Mr. Trump\u2019s thorniest personal and business problems.One of those problems involved Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film star better known as Stormy Daniels, who has claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump and has accused Mr. Cohen of paying her $130,000 to keep silent.Moments before the hearing began, Ms. Clifford swept into the courtroom with her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, and took a seat in a folding chair against one wall. Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford have been sparring for weeks in the media, but confronting one another for the first time in court, they did not appear to share so much as a glance.The government had asked that it be able to use a special group of prosecutors not involved in the investigation \u2014 known as a \u201ctaint team\u201d \u2014 to review the seized materials and determine whether any seemed to violate the attorney-client privilege.During the hearing, Judge Wood, after saying that she considered a taint team \u201ca viable option,\u201d also explained why she was considering appointing an independent lawyer, known as a special master, to assist in the review.\u201cIn terms of perception of fairness,\u201d she said, \u201cnot fairness itself, but perception of fairness, a special master might have a role here. Maybe not the complete role, but some role.\u201d\u201cMy interest is in getting this moving efficiently and speedily,\u201d the judge added.Once the hearing ended, a chaotic scene unfolded on the street outside the courthouse. Mobbed by reporters, Ms. Clifford attacked Mr. Cohen, saying that for years \u201che has acted like he is above the law.\u201d\u201cMy attorney and I,\u201d she added, \u201care committed to making sure that everyone finds out the truth.\u201dAfter that, she hopped into a black sport utility vehicle and was quickly driven away.Sean Piccoli, Ashley Southall and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kushners \u2018Negotiating Now,\u2019 Over Sale of Flagship Building", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpeculation over the fate of the Kushner Companies\u2019 flagship Fifth Avenue office tower has replaced Monopoly as the favorite parlor game of the real estate set.The Kushners have attracted enormous public attention because of their connection to President Trump. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, was chief executive of the company until he joined the White House last year as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s key advisers.On Friday, Vornado Realty Trust, the Kushners\u2019 partner in 666 Fifth Avenue, a 41-story office tower between 52nd and 53rd Streets, said that it had reached a \u201chandshake\u201d deal to sell its interest in the building to the Kushners.But how much the Kushners were paying and where the money might be coming from \u2014 the company, now led by Jared\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, has been in a very public, three-year hunt for an investor to take over part of the building\u2019s $1.4 billion mortgage \u2014 was still unclear.In an interview on Monday in his office on the 15th floor of the building, Charles Kushner declined to share details. \u201cWe\u2019re finalizing a contract, which we\u2019re negotiating now,\u201d he said. Mr. Kushner sat with his wife, Seryl, and the president of his namesake company, Laurent Morali.Mr. Kushner acknowledged that he had abandoned plans to demolish the existing aluminum-clad office tower to make way for an 80-story, ultraluxury skyscraper designed by the architect Zaha Hadid. The tower was to include a lush retail mall, a high-end hotel and the pricey apartments, at a prime location in the city.That will not be built, he said on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a knockdown,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the original plan.\u201dSo what is going to happen?\u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re weighing our options.\u201dAccording to real estate executives who have spoken to the developer but who requested anonymity for fear of becoming embroiled in a dispute potentially involving Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner plans to upgrade the office space at the base of the building and is considering converting the top floors into condominiums.But, anything Mr. Kushner does at 666 Fifth \u2014 renovate and sign new leases for the office space, create condominiums or some combination of the two \u2014 could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, at a time when most analysts say the building may not be worth as much as its mortgage.\u201cIt\u2019s tough. It\u2019s an iconic asset in a prime location, but it probably needs a substantial investment to compete with newer, shinier office product at Hudson Yards, downtown or near Grand Central,\u201d John P. Kim, a real estate analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said of 666 Fifth.Stephen B. Siegel, chairman of global brokerage at CBRE Group, a real estate company, said, \u201cIt\u2019s an eminently leasable office building, if updated to modern standards, from the lobby to the elevators.\u201dBut upgrades cost money, potentially $200 million, Mr. Siegel said.As for luxury condominiums, Jonathan J. Miller, a residential real estate appraiser, said that the challenge is that \u201cthe high end of the residential market has been overbuilt since 2014.\u201dVery few Midtown office buildings trade hands so it is difficult to make a comparison between 666 Fifth and other deals. But real estate executives say that the building, which has a 30 percent vacancy rate, is worth anywhere from $800 a square foot to $1,000 a square foot, or as much as $1.4 billion \u2014 the amount of the mortgage.The clock is ticking on that loan, which comes due in February. Revenue from the building only covers about half of the annual payments, according to a financial report by Trepp, which tracks real estate debt.If he refinanced, Mr. Kushner could probably get a new mortgage at a lower interest rate than the current 6.3 percent. But experts say that Mr. Kushner would only be able to finance about 80 percent of the building\u2019s value, or about $1.12 billion.He must also pay off his partner, Vornado Realty Trust, as much as $89 million. In 2012, when it became a partner in the building, Vornado agreed to invest up to $80 million in it at 11 percent interest. If bought out, Vornado would no longer be liable for its share of the mortgage, which amounts to $699 million, according to BMO Capital Markets.Vornado, however, would retain ownership of the building\u2019s most valuable asset, most of the Fifth Avenue retail shops. Vornado declined to comment on Monday.The Kushners\u2019 purchase of the building in 2007 for $1.8 billion announced their arrival into the rarefied ranks of New York real estate.But the leap into Manhattan from New Jersey, where the company owned a vast portfolio of garden apartments, has been fraught. Kushner Companies sold the valuable Fifth Avenue retail shops at the base of the building and lost some of its biggest office tenants in the recession.A year ago, Mr. Kushner and Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese financial conglomerate with close ties to the country\u2019s ruling circles, mutually agreed to terminate their discussions of a possible $4 billion deal.The deal foundered because of the publicity surrounding it, which the Chinese had hoped to avoid. But it also suffered from concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers that the deal could be a breach of federal ethics rules, because of Jared Kushner\u2019s involvement in the negotiations before he went to the White House.Brokers and real estate executives who know him say that Mr. Kushner is \u201cdetermined\u201d to get a deal done that would leave him in control of the tower, which serves as the headquarters for his real estate empire.Mr. Kushner believes that he could have struck a deal long ago if not for the shadow of the Trump administration, people close to him say.\u201cThere\u2019s a cloud because of the White House,\u201d said Arthur J. Mirante, tristate president of Avison Young, an international real estate firm, and a friend of Mr. Kushner. \u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t want to deal with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Eric Greitens of Missouri admitted to an extramarital affair with his former hairdresser. In February, he was indicted on a felony invasion-of-privacy charge. On Tuesday, the state attorney general plunged the governor even more deeply into political and legal jeopardy, saying Mr. Greitens may have committed a felony in using a charity\u2019s donor list for political fund-raising.Josh Hawley, the Republican attorney general of Missouri, said his office had evidence that Mr. Greitens had illegally obtained a donor list from The Mission Continues, a veterans charity the governor founded.\u201cHe did all of this without the permission of The Mission Continues,\u201d Mr. Hawley said at a news conference in Jefferson City, Mo. \u201cIf proven, these acts could amount to the unauthorized taking and use of property.\u201dBut Mr. Hawley stopped short of filing charges against the governor, who is also a Republican, saying that his office does not have jurisdiction to do so. Instead, he referred the matter to Kimberly Gardner, the St. Louis circuit attorney, who could decide to file charges against Mr. Greitens.Mr. Greitens, who has remained defiant in the face of widespread calls to resign, responded that the allegations were false and suggested that Ms. Gardner, a Democrat, was politically biased against him.\u201cFortunately for Josh, he\u2019s better at press conferences than the law,\u201d the governor said in a statement. \u201cAnyone who has set foot in a Missouri courtroom knows these allegations are ridiculous.\u201dJim Martin, a lawyer for Mr. Greitens, added that there was \u201cnothing close to wrongdoing\u201d in the matter.Susan Ryan, a spokesman for Ms. Gardner, said in a statement that the prosecutor\u2019s office was reviewing the evidence provided by the attorney general. \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss any specifics at this time,\u201d she said.For most of this year, Mr. Greitens, a former Navy SEAL who was elected governor in 2016, has been the target of investigations, charges that he is unfit to serve as governor and calls for his resignation or impeachment, even from members of his own party.Mr. Greitens, a father of two, has insisted that the affair was consensual and that he and his wife, Sheena, have made peace with it.Mr. Greitens faces trial on the invasion-of-privacy charge in St. Louis on May 14, and has said he views the hearing as an opportunity to clear his name. He could face up to four years in prison if convicted.Laura L\u2019Esperance, a spokeswoman for The Mission Continues, said the group was cooperating with the attorney general\u2019s investigation and did not provide or authorize the use of donor information for political or campaign purposes.On Tuesday, Representative Gail McCann Beatty, the minority floor leader in the House and a Democrat, called the attorney general\u2019s announcement \u201cmore disturbing news about what\u2019s going on with the governor.\u201d\u201cIt is time for him to resign,\u201d she said. \u201cClearly he\u2019s digging in and he\u2019s just not going to step down.

{"Headline": "Australia Shudders Amid Talk of a Chinese Military Base in Its Backyard", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Australian government has warned China against building a military base in the South Pacific following a report that the Chinese had approached the tiny island nation of Vanuatu about establishing an outpost there.But China hit back quickly on Tuesday, with a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman dismissing the report that it was seeking to put a base on Vanuatu as \u201cfake news.\u201d Vanuatu\u2019s government also said that there was no such proposal. And Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said Vanuatu had assured his government that no such request had been made.\u201cWe would view with great concern the establishment of any foreign military bases in those Pacific Island countries and neighbors of ours,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said on Tuesday.The prospect of a Chinese military base close to Australia in the South Pacific could provide a significant boost in Beijing\u2019s ability to project its power, and could also undermine the strategic dominance of Western powers in an area they have long effectively controlled.An official with the United States State Department confirmed the department was aware of the report and was seeking to determine its credibility. The United States has an enduring interest in the security and stability of the Pacific, the official added.The report comes as many Australians have become increasingly alarmed about Chinese influence in the country, with Australian politics recently thrown into turmoil over allegations that China is trying to buy its politicians and sway its elections.Experts say officials in Australia, the United States, and New Zealand are closely watching Beijing as it deepens its influence in the South Pacific through infrastructure projects and loans to smaller nations, and any effort to build military bases in the region would be particularly worrisome.\u201cIf it were to happen, and it\u2019s a huge if, it would be an aggressive move in the eyes of Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand,\u201d said Graeme Smith, a Pacific Affairs expert at the Australian National University in Canberra.Vanuatu, an impoverished nation, is considered to be within Australia\u2019s sphere of influence, with Canberra providing it with aid and investment. Australian politicians said that a Chinese base on Vanuatu would be a potential game changer strategically for the region.\u201cIt would have not only security but economic consequences for the region, and we should regard it as a wake-up call for Australia,\u201d Senator Penny Wong told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\u201cIt is not in the interest of the region \u2014 or in the interests of stability \u2014 for there to be increased competition, great power competition, in our region,\u201d she said.Jonathan Pryke, a Pacific islands expert with the Lowy Institute, noted that Vanuatu is home to a wharf built and financed by China that could conceivably be used for military purposes, particularly if Vanuatu has problems repaying the loan.\u201cThey can provide a nice bit of economic leverage over that country,\u201d Mr. Pryke added.Fairfax Media reported that Beijing had recently committed to building a new residence for Vanuatu\u2019s prime minister, Charlot Salwai, as well as other government buildings. Vanuatu has also reportedly been given hundreds of millions in development money by the Chinese.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber to Buy Jump, Maker of Electric Bicycles, After Bike-Sharing Test", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a blog post Monday morning, Uber said it reached an agreement with Jump Bikes, a provider of battery-powered bicycles, for an undisclosed sum. It would be the first acquisition for Uber since Dara Khosrowshahi took over as the company\u2019s chief executive in August.Even as Uber is backing away from some international markets, the Jump acquisition shows the company is still willing to invest in new ways to reach customers.Mr. Khosrowshahi said in an interview that Jump was \u201ca perfect fit\u201d for Uber\u2019s expanding portfolio beyond its core ride-hailing service. Uber\u2019s food delivery service, UberEats, is growing fast, and the company also aims to provide a variety of transportation options to consumers including bike sharing.Uber said that the data from its ride network allows the company to understand the best locations to place the bicycles in different cities, so they can be used more frequently.Since starting the pilot program a few months ago, Uber has found that the average distance of a ride on a Jump bike is about 2.6 miles \u2014 which is not much different from how far customers travel on average for an Uber car ride. Each bike is also being used six or seven times a day.\u201cThe utilization of the bikes has been higher than expected,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi said. \u201cPeople are using these bikes for multiple trips a day.\u201dThe bright red Jump bikes are part of a growing market for dockless bike-sharing services. Unlike the rows of Ford GoBikes available around the Bay Area or Citi Bikes in New York City, which have designated pickup and drop-off locations, dockless bikes like Jump are picked up wherever the last rider left them.Ryan Rzepecki, Jump\u2019s chief executive, started working on bike sharing almost a decade ago, initially with a company called Social Bicycles, which sold bicycles to different cities. Progress was slow. However, in the last few years, as companies sought to do for other modes of transportation what Uber did for cars, on-demand bicycles have become a hot area of investment.The company renamed itself Jump Bikes and focused on electric bicycles. It raised $10 million last fall and received permission from San Francisco to start operating a bike-sharing service with 250 battery-powered bicycles.Jump is also operating around 200 bikes in Washington, D.C., and plans to double the number of bikes there in the next few months. It also expects to expand to 500 bikes in San Francisco in September.As part of its pilot program with Uber, the Uber app presented users with a \u201cbike\u201d option in a drop-down menu. From there, the customer reserved a bicycle and was charged $2 for 30 minutes and then a per-minute fee after that.Since Jump owns the bicycles, the acquisition introduces Uber to a new business model. Unlike the cars on its ride-hailing network, which belong to the drivers, Uber will have to own and maintain the Jump bicycles. Mr. Khosrowshahi said that while it made sense for Uber to own the bicycles in the early days, other companies may want to finance the bikes in the future when the market is more mature.Advertisement"}

Jerry Brown moves through his final months in public life, an elusive signature project \u2014 the construction of two massive water tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, intended to salvage the state\u2019s water supply network \u2014 has seemed endangered. The $17 billion tunnels faced daunting costs and opposition from environmentalists and some Californians who saw it as another in a long line of water heists from the north by Southern California and Central Valley farmers.Mr. Brown insisted that in a time of climate change and drought the tunnels were essential to assure the integrity of a water system central to this state\u2019s economy, as it moves water to farms and the bustling, arid southern parts of the state.The project received a huge boost on Tuesday as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California voted to commit nearly $11 billion to help finance it. It stepped in to fill a financial void created after agriculture districts in the San Joaquin Valley refused to pay for a project, deeming it to be too expensive.The Metropolitan Water District is calculating that it will recapture the money it is investing once the 35-mile tunnels are done and it has water to sell to needy farmers.Potential obstacles lay ahead, including lawsuits and regulatory permits.

{"Headline": "One Goal of Amazon\u2019s HQ2: Learn the Lessons of Seattle", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "Amazon has surprised officials in cities vying for the company\u2019s new headquarters by asking how to avoid soaring housing costs and paralyzing traffic.Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 When 10 representatives from Amazon visited the Denver area in late January, they did what you\u2019d expect from a company scouting for a place to put its second headquarters. They toured more than a half-dozen potential sites for a new campus and talked about the technical talent available in the area.But they also did something that surprised local officials: Quiz them on how, if Amazon chooses to settle there, the company could avoid the problems it confronts in Seattle, the only hometown it has ever known.If Amazon moves in, bringing up to 50,000 high-paying jobs to town over time, how would the officials deal with traffic on its roads? And how would the company\u2019s tax dollars contribute to the creation of affordable housing in the region?\u201cI think they feel in Seattle they\u2019re the scapegoat every time there\u2019s an issue in the community and traffic,\u201d said Sam Bailey, vice president of economic development at the Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, which is managing the area\u2019s bid for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.Amazon wrapped up its visits in mid-April to all 20 finalist locations for its HQ2, as Amazon calls its second headquarters. The company is now following up with the cities, from Los Angeles to Indianapolis to Toronto, seeking further information as it narrows its search.The company has a long wish list, including plentiful flights at local airports, a stable, business-friendly government and nearby recreational opportunities for employees.But local officials did not anticipate Amazon\u2019s interest in how to tackle some of the troubles that have turned it into a polarizing symbol of Seattle\u2019s booming economy. The e-commerce giant is celebrated by many in Seattle for being the city\u2019s biggest employer and adding tremendous wealth to the area. But it is villainized by others for bringing too much change, too quickly.In Denver, Amazon and local officials talked at length about public transit options and the creation of bike lanes, said Mr. Bailey. They even discussed the possibility of Amazon financing a new light-rail station for its system, though no commitments were made, he said.In Atlanta, the company spoke to a representative of the Westside Future Fund, a nonprofit working to prevent displacement in an area being redeveloped. The fund will pay for the increases in property taxes for residents who have lived in the area since at least 2016 so that they\u2019re not priced out of their homes.In Amazon\u2019s visit to Toronto, the company discussed its potential impact on the labor market and the affordability of housing, said Ed Clark, the business adviser to Kathleen Wynne, the premier of the province of Ontario.\u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about what could be gentrification or displacement, how do we deal with that,\u201d said Aisha Glover, president and chief executive of the Newark Community Economic Development Corporation, which is involved in the New Jersey city\u2019s bid.Adam Sedo, a spokesman for Amazon, confirmed that public transport and housing affordability were important topics in conversations with the finalist locations but declined to elaborate further.While Amazon is not the only reason for all the change, it has become the most convenient target for groups worried about home prices and paralyzing traffic.\u201cThere was clearly a sensitivity both to the real and to the perceived impact when they come in to a place,\u201d Mr. Clark said, referring to Amazon\u2019s discussions in Toronto.\u201cThe pace of change has been so fast and housing supply has not kept up and the transit system has not kept up,\u201d said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research group in Seattle focused on sustainability. \u201cThere\u2019s a visceral public reaction to the whole rapid pace of change in the city symbolized by, and perhaps blamed too much on, Amazon.\u201dIn May, Seattle\u2019s City Council plans to vote on a tax \u2014 dubbed the \u201cAmazon Tax\u201d by locals \u2014 on the city\u2019s largest employers. The tax is expected to raise $75 million annually, with most of the money being funneled into building affordable housing. The remainder will go to support services for the homeless.\u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re getting massive pushback from ordinary people in Seattle,\u201d said Ms. Sawant.Growing cities with thriving local tech scenes are already grappling with affordable housing challenges, even without Amazon. Mr. Clark, the adviser involved in Toronto\u2019s bid, said it helps that Amazon isn\u2019t ducking the problem.\"To have someone coming in and worried about this issue and wanting to work with you to solve the issue is a big plus,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

If you\u2019re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.\u201dSince then, he has frozen all new investigations and slowed down existing inquiries by requiring employees to produce detailed justifications. He also sharply restricted the bureau\u2019s access to bank data, arguing that its investigations created online security risks. And he has scaled back efforts to go after payday lenders, auto lenders and other financial services companies accused of preying on the vulnerable.He concluded the speech, which included an appeal to diminish the bureau\u2019s power, by describing the two types of people he was most responsive to as a congressman \u2014 constituents and lobbyists who contributed to his campaign.Mr. Mulvaney said that trying to sway legislators was one of the \u201cfundamental underpinnings of our representative democracy. And you have to continue to do it.\u201dThe association, which invited Mr. Mulvaney to give the keynote address at its conference, strongly backs his efforts to consider the financial burdens on banks imposed by the bureau\u2019s actions.Asked about the comments, John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney, said: \u201cHe was making the point that hearing from people back home is vital to our democratic process and the most important thing our representatives can do. It\u2019s more important than lobbyists and it\u2019s more important than money.\u201dIn his remarks, Mr. Mulvaney also announced a series of moves intended to reduce the bureau\u2019s power. The agency was championed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Richard Cordray, who served as the bureau\u2019s director from its inception until last year.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything in here that says I have to run a Yelp for financial services sponsored by the federal government,\u201d he said.Mr. Mulvaney also said he would begin calling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by its official statutory name, the more obscure Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Administration officials said the rebranding was an attempt to diminish the agency\u2019s public profile.Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s political appointees at the agency have asked The Associated Press, which sets the style standard for many publications and broadcasters, to change how it refers to the bureau.\u201cI\u2019m trying to get in the habit of now saying the \u2018B.C.F.P.\u2019 It\u2019s really, really hard to do that when you\u2019ve said the C.F.P.B. for so long,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney told the bankers.The consumer bureau was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Law as a way to prevent banks and other financial companies from preying on vulnerable consumers. But the bureau has become a target of Republican lawmakers, who complain that it has unchecked power and is too aggressive in trying to punish financial firms.Advertisement"}

Why should it be?\u201cEvery time something happens, everybody\u2019s hollering,\u201d Garland Ashby, 77, the owner of an estimated 75 guns, said of the recent protests over gun control, rubbing at his cigarette stub from a park bench in this town of 4,200. \u201cA couple of months it\u2019s in the news, and then it\u2019s gone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll go away,\u201d Mr. Ashby predicted, grinding the cigarette into the mud. \u201cLike all the other times.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re looking for us to get bored,\u201d said Rosie Banks, 17, a high school junior about 40 miles east in Sterling, Va., whose bedroom includes the \u201cAm I Next?\u201d sign she hauled across the capital last month and a fish named Malcolm X. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get bored.\u201dThis has certainly not happened yet. Both before and after the march, high school students have shown themselves eager to hatch longer-term plans, with some plotting together last week through their spring breaks.In this stretch of Northern Virginia, students are trying to organize a town hall with Representative Barbara Comstock, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress, recognizing that her support from the National Rifle Association could be a drag in a district that preferred Hillary Clinton in 2016.New voter registration pushes, steered by teenagers, are well underway. Students are consulting with established (and adult-run) groups like Everytown for Gun Safety, founded and financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence \u2014 with plans to discuss how to host their own candidate events before November or start clubs at their schools.Even less politically active students in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District have learned Ms. Comstock\u2019s name. \u201cThey know who she is,\u201d said Paige Thimmesch, 16, Ms. Banks\u2019s classmate in Sterling, Va., who is hoping to arrange the forum with the congresswoman. \u201cThey don\u2019t know every single policy. They do know that she is pro-gun.\u201dLooking to history, fledgling activists are researching Vietnam-era student protests for context and inspiration. They are using words like \u201cintersectional.\u201d They are quoting favored lyrics from \u201cHamilton\u201d: \u201cThis is not a moment, it\u2019s the movement.\u201dThat movement, though, will hinge on reversing years of below-average voter turnout among young Americans \u2014 translating sound and fury into the long, slow work of lasting change.While youth-driven movements in recent years, like Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, have installed themselves as forces in Democratic politics and the national discourse, their effects at the ballot box have been uncertain.Yet even in corners of the country unaccustomed to dissent on gun issues, supporters of restrictions sense an opening. In Maine\u2019s Second Congressional District, a region that includes both small cities and parcels of land so rural they are officially called \u201cunorganized territory,\u201d school walkouts and satellite March for Our Lives protests have specked the map, powered by students and Democratic activists.\u201cWe\u2019ll outlive them,\u201d said Sean Monteith, 17, a junior at Lewiston High School, adding that he hoped his peers would be able to outvote them, too. His cellphone includes a list of action items and reminders: \u201cconnect with city council,\u201d \u201cdraft legislation,\u201d \u201cdo not go on assumptions.\u201dBack in Washington, a handful of Republicans seem attuned to at least two of those directives, hedging their positions in recent weeks to accommodate the post-Parkland moment. Several vulnerable members signed on to a Democratic bill authorizing federal research into gun violence. Two of them, Brian Mast and Carlos Curbelo, both Republicans from Florida, have endorsed an assault weapons ban.Activists appear determined to make others pay a professional price for declining to engage. In Colorado\u2019s Sixth District, where Representative Mike Coffman is widely considered one of the most endangered Republican incumbents, organizers with Never Again Colorado, a new group advocating gun control, are planning a forum to discuss guns \u201cwith or without\u201d Mr. Coffman. The district includes Aurora, where a gunman killed 12 people in a movie theater in 2012.\u201cWe have a lot of momentum right now,\u201d said Ian Gaskins, 17, a high school junior who is helping to plan the event. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to stop caring about this until the next mass shooting.\u201dFor Democrats, the zeal for gun control has at once presented an uncommon opportunity and an occasion to revisit plans for midterm messaging. After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, his opponents did not necessarily expect a gun reckoning to be central to their 2018 strategy.Eight months later, it is gun violence, more than any fiscal issue, that has galvanized a new generation of prospective Democrats, some not yet old enough to vote.In Virginia, the party had already long targeted Ms. Comstock, casting her as a poor fit for a district that includes some rural pockets, like Berryville, but also left-leaning Washington suburbs and vast reserves of more moderate voters repelled by Mr. Trump. \u201cBarbara Bump-Stock,\u201d said Candy Baracat-Donovan, 34, from Leesburg, Va., whose morning routine now includes a round of phone calls to the offices of representatives like Ms. Comstock.A spokesman for Ms. Comstock, Jeff Marschner, said the congresswoman was \u201ccommitted to a multipronged effort to prevent gun violence,\u201d citing her support for additional mental health funding and narrow, N.R.A.-backed legislation improving reporting to the national background check database, among other measures.It is not clear if she will agree to a town hall with students. They seem to understand the calculation.\u201cHigh school students are scary,\u201d said Jay Falk, 18, a senior in Virginia who co-founded Students Demand Action DMV, a gun control group with over 100 members. \u201cWe are not cynical yet.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer reported from Berryville, Va., and Jess Bidgood from Lewiston, Me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "MoviePass Says All Is Well. Even Some of Its Customers Are Skeptical.", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 MoviePass has had a hard few months.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the viability of MoviePass at all,\u201d said Ted Farnsworth, chief executive of Helios and Matheson Analytics, which owns 92 percent of the service, with Verizon holding the balance. \u201cOur customer service has dramatically improved, we\u2019ve worked out the little bugs with the technology and we have plenty of money to get through the next year.\u201dMoviePass, which has been around since 2011, now has more than two million subscribers, up from 20,000 in August, when the company drastically cut prices. Suddenly you could see a movie a day in theaters, 365 days a year, for $10 a month. It\u2019s such an eye-popping deal that 32 percent of MoviePass\u2019s own subscribers believe the service won\u2019t last, according to data released this week by National Research Group, a movie industry consulting firm.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been saying,\u201d he said.Mr. Farnsworth spoke in a joint interview with Mitch Lowe, chief executive of MoviePass. They came across as giddy \u2014 something that Mr. Farnsworth chalked up to the thrill of owning a \u201chot company,\u201d and that Mr. Lowe, eating from a bag of Fritos, credited to \u201calcohol.\u201dUnder the MoviePass business model, theaters are paid full price for every admission. People who sign up receive a membership card that functions like a debit card. When members want to see a movie (no more than one a day), they use a MoviePass smartphone app to check in at the theater. The app instantly transfers the price of a ticket to the membership card. Members in turn use the card to pay for entry. And it all works independently of theaters.To a degree, the service depends on traditional subscription economics: more people pay than go. \u201cWe\u2019re profitable on 88 percent of our customers,\u201d Mr. Farnsworth said.It gets more complicated, however, when you consider heavy users and the price of movie tickets. According to the National Association of Theater Owners, the organization holding its annual gathering in Las Vegas, tickets cost an average of $8.97. But theaters in cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco routinely charge $16.50 for a standard ticket.MoviePass believes it can make money by striking bulk ticket pricing partnerships with theaters; charging studios fees to promote new films to members; and perhaps even growing big enough (20 million subscribers is a goal) to demand a slice of concession revenue, although Mr. Lowe appears, for now at least, to have backed away from that particular aspiration.\u201cIt\u2019s really a mistake for people to think that we\u2019re after their concessions,\u201d he said.Mr. Lowe and Mr. Farnsworth said they already had some deals in place with studios, although they would not say which ones. \u201cWe\u2019re collecting significant revenue from partnerships,\u201d Mr. Lowe said. \u201cBut they say: \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone that we\u2019re paying you. We don\u2019t want to make the theater owners mad.\u2019\u201dToo late. Companies like AMC Entertainment, the largest theater chain in North America, have dismissed MoviePass as a fly-by-night operation. \u201cAMC has absolutely no intention \u2014 I repeat, no intention \u2014 of sharing any \u2014 I repeat, any \u2014 of our admissions revenue or our concessions revenue,\u201d Adam Aron, AMC\u2019s chief executive, told analysts late last year.Mr. Aron remains a nonbeliever. Told by a reporter about the assertions made by Mr. Farnsworth and Mr. Lowe about financial viability and improved customer service (they have vastly expanded that department), Mr. Aron narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cOur view on MoviePass hasn\u2019t changed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Sees Inquiry Into Cohen as Greater Threat Than Mueller", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s advisers have concluded that a wide-ranging corruption investigation into his personal lawyer poses a greater and more imminent threat to the president than even the special counsel\u2019s investigation, according to several people close to Mr. Trump.As his lawyers went to court in New York on Friday to try to block prosecutors from reading files that were seized from the personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, this week, Mr. Trump found himself increasingly isolated in mounting a response. He continued to struggle to hire a new criminal lawyer, and some of his own aides were reluctant to advise him about a response for fear of being dragged into a criminal investigation themselves.The raids on Mr. Cohen came as part of a monthslong federal investigation based in New York, court records show, and were sweeping in their breadth. In addition to searching his home, office and hotel room, F.B.I. agents seized material from Mr. Cohen\u2019s cellphones, tablet, laptop and safe deposit box, according to people briefed on the warrants. Prosecutors revealed in court documents that they had already secretly obtained many of Mr. Cohen\u2019s emails.Mr. Trump called Mr. Cohen on Friday to \u201ccheck in,\u201d according to two people briefed on the call. Depending on what else was discussed, the call could be problematic, as lawyers typically advise their clients against discussing investigations.Mr. Cohen has publicly declared that he would defend the president to the end, but court documents show that prosecutors are building a significant case that could put pressure on him to cooperate and tell investigators what he knows.The documents seized by prosecutors could shed light on the president\u2019s relationship with a lawyer who has helped navigate some of Mr. Trump\u2019s thorniest personal and business dilemmas. Mr. Cohen served for more than a decade as a trusted fixer and, during the campaign, helped tamp down brewing scandals about women who claimed to have carried on affairs with Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and their teams were still scrambling on Friday to assess the damage from the raid early Monday morning. They remained unsure what had been taken, an uncertainty that has heightened the unease around Mr. Trump.Although his lawyers had projected confidence in their dealings with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, they were caught flat-footed by the New York raids. The lawyers fear that Mr. Cohen will not be forthcoming with them about what was in his files, leaving them girding for the unknown.Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, through their lawyers, argued in federal court on Friday that many of the seized records were protected by attorney-client privilege. They asked for an order temporarily prohibiting prosecutors from reading the documents until the matter could be litigated. Mr. Cohen argued that he or an independent lawyer should be allowed to review the documents first.\u201cThose searches have been executed, and the evidence is locked down,\u201d Joanna C. Hendon, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said in court. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to delay. I\u2019m just trying to ensure that it\u2019s done scrupulously.\u201dMr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, wrote in a court filing that the search \u201ccreates constitutional concerns regarding officers of the executive branch rummaging through the private and privileged papers of the president.\u201dProsecutors argued that the previously seized emails revealed that Mr. Cohen was \u201cperforming little to no legal work, and that zero emails were exchanged with President Trump.\u201d They said their investigation was focused on Mr. Cohen\u2019s business dealings, not his work as a lawyer.But it is difficult to extract Mr. Cohen from his work for Mr. Trump. For more than a decade, Mr. Trump has unleashed Mr. Cohen on his foes \u2014 investigative journalists, business rivals and potential litigants. And the New York search warrant makes clear that the authorities are interested in his unofficial role in the campaign.Prosecutors demanded all communication with the campaign \u2014 and in particular two advisers, Corey Lewandowski and Hope Hicks, according to two people briefed on the warrants.Prosecutors also seized recordings of conversations that Mr. Cohen had secretly made, but he told people in recent days that he did not tape his conversations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen frequently taped conversations with adversaries and opposing lawyers, according to the two people briefed.The raids on Mr. Cohen surprised and angered the president, who has been frustrated with the special counsel investigation into Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference, the Kremlin\u2019s possible coordination with Trump associates and whether the president has tried to obstruct those inquiries.In response to the raids, Mr. Trump has considered firing Mr. Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. On Friday, Mr. Trump\u2019s spirits were frayed in the morning as his lawyer battled in the Manhattan courtroom. But he grew cheerier as the day went on, an adviser said, buoyed by a report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general that was damning about a former F.B.I. official, Andrew G. McCabe, who he believed had tried to undermine him.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers have called the raids of his offices and hotel room an overreach of the law. Prosecutors said on Friday that they had used a search warrant, rather than a subpoena, because they had evidence that Mr. Cohen\u2019s files might be permanently deleted \u2014 by whom, the documents did not say. Many details in the documents were redacted, but prosecutors said they had found evidence of fraud and a \u201clack of truthfulness\u201d on his part.Mr. Cohen wants his lawyers to be able to review the files and withhold privileged material before prosecutors can see them. As an alternative, he asked that an independent lawyer be allowed to review the files first. A judge scheduled a follow-up hearing for Monday and ordered Mr. Cohen to attend. The judge, Kimba M. Wood, was upset that he was not in court Friday.Federal agents seized documents that dated back years, some of which are related to payments to two women who have said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Other documents seized included information about the role of The National Enquirer in silencing one of the women, people briefed on the investigation have said.Communications between lawyers and their clients are normally off limits to prosecutors, but there are exceptions, including when the materials are considered part of a continuing crime.Mr. Trump has viewed any investigation of his business and private life to be off limits to prosecutors, but the search warrants make clear that investigators consider those topics part of their case.Agents sought information about Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims she had a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump shortly after the birth of his youngest son in 2006. American Media Inc., which owns The Enquirer, paid Ms. McDougal $150,000. The company\u2019s chief executive is a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s.Agents also demanded information related to Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress. Ms. Clifford has said she had sex with Mr. Trump while he was married. Mr. Cohen has acknowledged paying Ms. Clifford $130,000 as part of a nondisclosure agreement to secure her silence days before Election Day.Mr. Trump recently told reporters he knew nothing about the agreement.Benjamin Weiser and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mueller Investigating Ukrainian\u2019s $150,000 Payment for a Trump Appearance", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The special counsel is investigating a payment made to President Trump\u2019s foundation by a Ukrainian steel magnate for a talk during the campaign, according to three people briefed on the matter, as part of a broader examination of streams of foreign money to Mr. Trump and his associates in the years leading up to the election.The subpoena is among signs in recent months that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is interested in interactions that Mr. Trump or his associates had with countries beyond Russia, though it is not clear what other payments he is scrutinizing.Mr. Mueller also ordered the Trump Organization to turn over documents, emails and other communications about several Russians, including some whose names have not been publicly tied to Mr. Trump, according to the three people, who would not be named discussing the ongoing investigation. The identities of the Russians were unclear.The payment from Mr. Pinchuk \u201cis curious because it comes during a campaign and is from a foreigner and looks like an effort to buy influence,\u201d said Marcus S. Owens, a former head of the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt organizations. He called the donation \u201can unusual amount of money for such a short speech.\u201dMr. Trump assailed the special counsel investigation on Monday as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d reaching for a favored insult in response to the seizure of Mr. Cohen\u2019s records. He complained that he had cooperated with the inquiry and viewed the warrant for the raid, obtained by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after a referral from Mr. Mueller, as an extreme step.\u201cIt\u2019s a disgraceful situation,\u201d he told reporters at the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s a total witch hunt. I\u2019ve been saying it for a long time. I\u2019ve wanted to keep it down. I\u2019ve given over a million pages in documents to the special counsel.\u201dThe inquiry into the Trump Organization\u2019s payments from foreign nationals underscores how diffuse Mr. Trump\u2019s sources of income have been over many years. And the destination of Mr. Pinchuk\u2019s donation \u2014 the Trump Foundation instead of the president\u2019s personal coffers \u2014 raised fresh questions about how the president handled the entity he set up to deal with charitable giving.Two weeks after he was elected president, the foundation acknowledged in a tax form that it might have broken federal rules designed to prohibit self-dealing, when charities use their money to benefit principals in their organization.Mr. Pinchuk is the son-in-law of a former president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, who from 1994 to 2005 led a government criticized for corruption, nepotism and the murder of dissident journalists. Mr. Pinchuk, who has been accused by steel makers in the United States of illegally dumping steel on the American market at artificially low prices, drew more scrutiny during the campaign for his ties to Hillary Clinton and her family foundation. He has donated more than $13 million to that organization since 2006.In a statement, the Victor Pinchuk Foundation said it reached out to Mr. Trump and other world leaders to help \u201cpromote strengthened and enduring ties between Ukraine and the West.\u201dThe foundation said the donation was \u201ca specific request of Mr. Trump Foundation in September of 2015 when there were multiple candidates for the Republican nomination for president and it was by no means assured that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee in 2016.\u201dAt the time, Mr. Trump occupied an unusual position in the presidential race. Though he was the Republican front-runner, the primary field was crowded and he was being vetted or seriously considered by few, if any, in the news media or the Republican establishment.The event, his first foray into global politics during the campaign, was set up by Doug Schoen, a veteran political consultant and pollster who works with Mr. Pinchuk, according to a person familiar with how the speech was arranged. Mr. Schoen, a frequent Fox News guest, has known Mr. Trump for years and contacted him personally to set it up at the end of August 2015, according to the person.Mr. Trump did not raise the prospect of any payment. But the next day, Mr. Cohen called Mr. Schoen to solicit the $150,000 as an honorarium, the person briefed on the matter said.

Putin of Russia.Ukraine, once a part of the Soviet Union, has been at the center of another part of Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry.

{"Headline": "Vincent Bollor\u00e9, French Billionaire, Faces a Rare Corruption Inquiry", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In France\u2019s cutthroat corporate world, the billionaire Vincent Bollor\u00e9 has a reputation for being untouchable.That aura of invincibility appeared to be in jeopardy on Wednesday, as judges in Paris placed Mr. Bollor\u00e9 under formal investigation after the police questioned him for two days over accusations that he helped the presidents of two African nations gain power in exchange for lucrative business contracts.The inquiry could result in criminal charges against Mr. Bollor\u00e9, who is known as the King of Africa for the vast business dealings that have won him untold riches in former French colonies.A Havas executive, Jean-Philippe Dorent, and a top Bollor\u00e9 Group official, Gilles Alix, were also placed under formal investigation after questioning by the police, who searched the Bollor\u00e9 Group headquarters outside Paris this month.The case has renewed attention on the cronyism that persists between members of the French elite and African leaders and on both parties\u2019 mercantile ambitions in Francophone Africa.One of the matters involving Mr. Bollor\u00e9 now under scrutiny is connected to Alpha Cond\u00e9, a Guinean politician who is believed to have befriended Mr. Bollor\u00e9 while he lived in political exile in Paris in the mid-2000s.After Mr. Cond\u00e9 returned to Guinea to seek the presidency in 2010, an international Havas unit helped guide his campaign, and then allegedly underbilled him for its services. After Mr. Cond\u00e9 won, the Guinea government transferred an agreement to run the container-port terminal at Conakry, Guinea\u2019s capital, to the Bollor\u00e9 Group from a French rival.A similar pattern emerged in Togo, another former French colony. There, the same Havas unit was said to support, with below-market-rate services, the re-election of President Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 in 2010.A few months before Mr. Gnassingb\u00e9, who has close ties to Mr. Bollor\u00e9, won a second term, his government awarded a contract for the container port at Lom\u00e9, the country\u2019s capital, to the Bollor\u00e9 Group.The suits have challenged the media outlets France Inter, France 2, Rue89 and Mediapart, among others. Those reports included investigative pieces alleging that workers at the company\u2019s Socapalm and Safacam units, which operate palm oil plantations in Cameroon, were being exploited.The Bollor\u00e9 Group has said the suits were meant to combat what it described as biased reporting.The formal investigation of corruption charges against Mr. Bollor\u00e9 and the others means French judges believe there is evidence that points to serious wrongdoing. But the magistrates can later drop the charges if they do not believe the evidence is sufficient to proceed to trial.Advertisement"}

The suspect, Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was arrested by the police this week.Investigators, it turned out, had used DNA from crime scenes that had been stored over the decades and plugged the genetic profile of the suspected assailant into an online genealogy database. Eventually, they traced the DNA to the suspect\u2019s front door.Those who had investigated the case for years were ecstatic.And then there were all the victims to consider.My colleagues Jennifer Medina and Jose A. Del Real spoke to several victims and members of their families.As one relative noted: \u201cThis not a club anyone really wants to be a member of.\u201dMore from The New York Times:Additional coverage:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)For baseball fans in Los Angeles, there are few things better than soaking in a perfect California sunset at Dodger Stadium.The problem is getting there.Traffic on Sunset Boulevard at 5:30 p.m. on a game night is the stuff of legend. Buses fill a dedicated lane, drivers flee to side streets, and still, making first pitch can feel nearly impossible.Under this kind of duress, it\u2019s likely that at least a few Angelenos have fantasied at the wheel about one day being able to soar over the congestion and float to the front of Chavez Ravine.Perhaps, by 2022, they will be able to do just that.On Thursday, Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies announced plans for what is effectively a gondola lift that would send passengers from downtown\u2019s Union Station to Dodger Stadium in about five minutes.Officials said the system would whisk more than 5,000 riders per hour in each direction, eliminating hundreds of thousands of annual car trips.Its price tag? $125 million, funded in part by Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies and in part by other private financing.In a telephone interview, the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric M. Garcetti, said there would be no cost to taxpayers. He said he expected that rides would cost a \u201cfew bucks\u201d \u2014 a \u201csingle digit\u201d dollar amount.\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about this for years,\u201d said Mr. Garcetti, who has lived just blocks from Dodger Stadium. \u201cTraffic is so terrible at Dodgers games. It\u2019s the only bad thing you experience \u2014 short of a loss, of course.\u201dOfficials say public review could begin by the end of this year. In a prepared statement, the Los Angeles Dodgers expressed support for the project, calling it \u201cimportant and innovative.\u201dAnd already on Thursday, Mr. Garcetti was imagining Vin Scully\u2019s voice welcoming fans to the aerial tram.\u201cPeople don\u2019t think of L.A. as a romantic city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s as romantic as Paris or any other city in the world.

{"Headline": "Eyeing 2020, Trump Fund-Raisers Return to Familiar Well: Small Donors", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has ramped up its fund-raising this year, bringing in $20.2 million, while investing heavily in cultivating a wide base of small donors, according to reports filed Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign apparatus spent nearly $8.2 million through the end of last month, with more than 60 percent of that going toward low-dollar fund-raising tools such as solicitations delivered via social media, email, direct mail and telemarketing, the reports show.The reports were filed by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and two joint committees it formed with the Republican National Committee: Trump Victory Committee and Trump Make America Great Again Committee.The committees also spent $863,000 on legal fees as Mr. Trump, his campaign and associates continue to deal with a handful of legal fights, as well as the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign.But that legal spending paled in comparison with the more than $5.2 million spent on fund-raising revealed in the reports. Taken together, they reveal that, even as some major Republican donors have warmed to Mr. Trump, his political operation is not abandoning the approach that carried it through much of the 2016 campaign, when it relied primarily on a stream of donations from small donors giving online.During the first three months of this year, Mr. Parscale\u2019s firm was paid $1.7 million for digital consulting and online advertising, according to Sunday\u2019s reports. Much of that was probably passed through to website and social media platforms, though the campaign also paid Facebook $4,700 for ads directly.An additional $2.3 million was spent on direct mail, which is typically used to solicit small and medium-size donations, while $210,000 went to a collection of eight fund-raising consultants, and $158,000 was spent on telemarketing.The investment in low-dollar fund-raising is already paying dividends. More than half of the total raised by the three committees this year came from donors who gave $200 or less, the reports show.To be sure, the Trump Victory committee, which was created to raise big checks from major donors, did raise $4.9 million from more than 60 donors who gave $20,000 or more each, including $250,000 checks from the Wisconsin industrialist Elizabeth Uihlein, the Alaska investor Robert B. Gillam and the Las Vegas restaurateur Craig Estey and his wife, Patricia.A third of the committees\u2019 $863,000 in legal fees went to two firms involved in the legal fight with the adult film star known as Stormy Daniels. Those firms \u2014 Harder LLP and Larocca, Hornik, Rosen, Greenberg & Blaha \u2014 were paid a combined $280,000. A campaign official said the payments were not related to Ms. Daniels.Another $376,000 was paid to Jones Day, the firm representing the campaign on election law and campaign finance compliance, as well as matters related to the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Trump\u2019s committees also continued to pay his businesses for a variety of functions, including nearly $58,000 in rent and $59,000 in facility rental and catering services to the Trump International Hotel in Washington.The three Trump committees ended March with $44.3 million in the bank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Week Inside a Soccer Club When the Money Runs Out", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerKONGENS LYNGBY, Denmark \u2014 Mads Byder sent the text message to everyone he could think of, anyone who had the money \u2014 and maybe the madness \u2014 to help. In the end, he copied and pasted the message 15 times, changing the name of the recipient, but nothing else.All the texts started the same way: \u201cHey, long time no see.\u201d And they all cut quickly to the chase. \u201cYou have seen what is happening,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is not an investment \u2014 it is fun. And sometimes, you have to invest with the heart.\u201dByder did not have time to be creative. He had, by that stage, roughly a day, maybe a little more, to prevent the century-old Danish soccer club he had supported all his life, Lyngby B.K., from slipping into oblivion.Its current owner had run out of money. Its staff members had been told their jobs were gone. The team\u2019s insurance had run out. The players had not been paid. Several had already left. Many more would follow if new owners could not be found. Byder was sending messages because he was the last resort.He had been told as much the previous night when Birger Jorgensen, Lyngby\u2019s longtime sporting director, had called him at home close to midnight.Over the next 36 hours, the two led a last-gasp attempt to help Lyngby avert the thing that fans across the world fear more than anything: not that their club will lose a final, or miss out on a tournament, or even suffer the indignity of relegation, but that it will cease to exist entirely.Every year, through careless management or reckless ambition, a handful of teams come uncomfortably close to collapse. Those who do fall \u2014 Rangers or Leeds United or Parma \u2014 serve as cautionary tales about the dangers of living beyond your means. But they are not heeded. Still, every year, more clubs flirt with disaster.In the first week of February, Lyngby came closer than most to the edge. Mathias Tauber, the club captain, said that, at one point, the club was \u201c15 minutes\u201d from going under. The story of those few days offers an insight not just into what it takes to rescue a club, but also into how players cope when they stand on the brink.The hotel, Mathias Hebo said, was perfect. At the end of January, Hebo and the rest of Lyngby\u2019s players had flown to Faro, a resort town on the Algarve coast in Portugal, for a warm-weather training camp. \u201cVery good pitches, 20 degrees Celsius, all the stuff,\u201d he said.Hebo had joined the club the previous summer. He was 21, playing for Fredericia in Denmark\u2019s second tier, and Lyngby seemed the ideal step up: a club close to his family in Copenhagen, with a proud reputation for developing players \u2014 Lyngby has produced a scree of Danish internationals, including four members of Denmark\u2019s 1992 European championship team \u2014 and the promise, after a third-place finish in the league in 2017, of Europa League games this season.There had been interest in Hebo from Brondby, historically Denmark\u2019s biggest club, and from teams in Sweden, too, but \u201cLyngby\u2019s plan for me was the most impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as I got the call, I knew this is what I would do.\u201dThe luxurious trip to Faro seemed like another of the benefits Hebo would have to get used to; earlier in the season, Lyngby had flown by private jet to a Europa League match against Krasnodar in Russia. This was the life of a Superliga player. And then, five days into the winter training camp in Faro, Hebo and his teammates found out that life was about to end.\u201cOne day, Ekstra Bladet, a Danish newspaper, did a big story that Lyngby might close,\u201d Hebo said. The team\u2019s owner, Torben Jensen, could no longer fund the club, the newspaper reported, as his finance firm, Hellerup Finans, was on the verge of bankruptcy.\u201cThe staff had warned us,\u201d Hebo said. \u201cAnd then my phone just started ringing all the time.\u201dThe players approached their coach, Thomas Norgaard, seeking more information, and he passed on what Jensen had told him. \u201cWe were told everything was under control,\u201d Tauber said. \u201cHe said we were not floating in money, but everything would be fine.\u201dBy the time the squad returned to Denmark, though, it was clear that was overly optimistic.Though Jensen had assured the coaching staff he was doing his best to find a solution, to cover his obligations, it had all been to no avail. As sporting director, Jorgensen had been trying his best to drum up an angel investor, but had drawn a blank, too. The edge was approaching. On Jan. 31, the players were told that their monthly salaries \u2014 due that day \u2014 would not been paid.\u201cWe were nervous then,\u201d said Thomas Sorensen, one of the team\u2019s veterans. \u201cThat is when you realize it is really serious.\u201dFor them, and for the club. The players learned from their union that, under Danish law, they could file a claim against Lyngby for their unpaid wages. If the club did not produce the money within three working days, they could consider their contracts broken, and negotiate to join other teams.On Friday, the players submitted the claim. By the following Tuesday, Feb. 6, the money had not arrived. Lyngby\u2019s entire squad, about to return from winter break in the middle of a season that had begun in the Europa League, was free to leave.For a week, Jorgensen had been trying to stave off disaster. He had contacted everyone he could think of who might be able to step unto the breach. He had even been in touch with a handful of English clubs, including Aston Villa, in the hope that one might view Lyngby as a suitable farm team. None of it had borne fruit. Five players had already decided not to wait around to be rescued. Jorgensen was worried about a mass exodus.When he called Byder, on Wednesday, Feb. 7, Jorgensen said he \u201cwas throwing in the towel,\u201d Byder remembered.The two knew each other only cursorily: Byder\u2019s public relations company had once sponsored Lyngby, putting its name on the team\u2019s blue jerseys, and he was still a regular at games. When he called, Jorgensen told Byder that a mutual friend had passed him his phone number. Not a problem, Byder said, but why?\u201cI heard you have a big blue heart,\u201d Jorgensen responded.He did, but his wallet was not big enough to save the club alone. All Byder could offer was an idea. Lyngby sits 20 minutes north of Copenhagen, in one of the richest areas of Denmark, known as the country\u2019s equivalent to Silicon Valley.He suggested to Jorgensen that perhaps \u201cmany minor investors, local investors, could find a few million kroner each\u201d and come together to keep Lyngby B.K. from folding. Jorgensen, despite several days without sleep, agreed it was worth a shot.The next day, Byder sent out his flurry of texts. Not all of those he contacted shared his enthusiasm. \u201cPeople sent messages or called saying it was not for them, but they understood why I was doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a few said: \u2018Don\u2019t do it yourself.\u2019\u201dByder, though, had a feeling that he wanted to give something back to the club that had given him good, and bad, memories. \u201cI was ready to pay for that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was ready to lose money for it, too.\u201dFour or five of his entreaties worked, however. On Thursday night, together with a couple more names mustered by Jorgensen, 10 people met at a private house near Lyngby. \u201cThere was no time for presentations,\u201d Byder said. He, Jorgensen and Tommy Petersen, a financier, gave short speeches. They were not uniformly positive.\u201cTommy said that we did not have time to look through the budget,\u201d Byder said. \u201cHe did not know how big the black hole would be.\u201dAs captain, Tauber was busy that night, too. He had spent much of the previous year injured, nursing a torn knee ligament that \u2014 at 33 \u2014 threatened to end his career. He already had been considering what he would do if he was forced to retire. He could restart his law degree, on hiatus since he turned professional. He had even had an interview arranged with a digital marketing company.He did not feel ready to quit, he said, but he knew the club\u2019s liquidation would make the choice for him. \u201cI find it very hard to imagine that any club would want an injured 33-year-old,\u201d he said.As Lyngby\u2019s situation deteriorated during those frantic days, though, Tauber had found himself front and center, being a captain once more. The players had decided only he would speak to the news media. \u201cWe wanted to protect some of the younger players,\u201d he said. \u201cTo make sure that what was coming out from us made sense in some way.\u201dEvery morning before training, the players would hold a short meeting. Tauber would relay what he, Sorensen and another senior player, Jeppe Brandrup, had learned, and then field a few questions. The union\u2019s advice was consistent: Keep quiet, say nothing, file the claim, see what happens.That changed when the money did not arrive on Tuesday. Suddenly, Lyngby\u2019s players were free to go. \u201cFrom my perspective, I could not force players to stay,\u201d Tauber said. \u201cThe club had a problem, but the players needed to be able to choose whether to wait, or to go elsewhere and not be worried.\u201dTogether with Sorensen and Brandrup, he told the team that there would be no hard feelings for anyone who decided to go immediately. The rest, he said, would wait until Friday at 3 p.m. If no money arrived then, if no new owner had been found, they would have no choice but to leave.The mood was anxious. In private, the players would ask each other their intentions, but it was hard, Hebo said, to be sure everyone was being honest. \u201cMaybe one person told you one thing and said something different to others,\u201d he said. Surreptitious phone calls prompted suspicion: Was he talking to his agent, arranging a move?Tauber did what he could to canvass opinion. \u201cI talked to almost everybody,\u201d he said, about contracts, but also about wives, and children, and mortgages. Looking back, now, he knows that not everyone told him the truth.In the end, five players decided they could not take the risk, and left. One, Casper Nielsen, a fullback who had already agreed to sign for Aarhus at the end of the season, simply brought his move forward. Even then, Tauber said, \u201che refused to be the first: He would not be the one who took everyone with him.\u201dBy Thursday night, though, Tauber feared it was over. He had heard there might be a chance of salvation, but time was running out. The artificial deadline \u2014 3 p.m. the next day \u2014 was fast approaching. \u201cI knew it was close, but I also knew they were missing a few million kroner,\u201d he said of the new investors. And so he spent that night on the phone to his teammates one more time, to \u201chear their situations, hear their thoughts.\u201dAt 6 a.m. on Friday, Byder\u2019s phone beeped. \u201cThanks for last night,\u201d read the first email on the thread. Seven of the potential investors that had gathered the previous night had agreed to try to save the club. A local lawyer, Lars Borring, registered a company: The Friends of Lyngby had been born. That morning, the members started transferring money \u2014 some $50,000, some closer to $1 million \u2014 to replenish the club\u2019s accounts.After training, the squad gathered in the canteen at Lyngby\u2019s stadium. The last of the money had landed in the new company\u2019s accounts with 15 minutes to spare. Petersen and Jorgensen told the players the money was in place. They would be paid.\u201cBoom, like that, everyone stays,\u201d Hebo said. In his car on the way home, Tauber cried with relief. Byder, though, had another problem. The bank account was empty again.There were, at the start, seven Friends of Lyngby. There are now more than 20: lawyers and chief executives and restaurateurs, as well as several players who started their careers at the club\u2019s academy. Andreas Bjelland, a Danish international now with Brentford in England, was the first; three others have followed.They are, as Byder said, a \u201cteam behind the team,\u201d their experience in a whole swath of industries, all of which he believes can help develop the club in some way. \u201cWe reflect different resources,\u201d he said. Sponsors are returning, too, eager to be involved.The club\u2019s accounts, quickly emptied to pay the players\u2019 overdue wages and the team\u2019s outstanding bills, have been filled again. The new owners remain open to further investment; the only requirement is that any further Friends should not have \u201cterms and conditions\u201d to their input. This is with the heart, as Byder told the first few to sign up; it is investing in fun.They are aware, though, that there is a limit to how far they can take the club. Byder has held more meetings with Aston Villa about a potential partnership, but other clubs are hovering, too: one or two from England, and Club Brugge from Belgium.Networks of clubs, economies of scale, are all the rage in global soccer these days. Manchester City, which already owns teams in New York, Melbourne and Montevideo, has been alerted to Lyngby\u2019s willingness to talk. Byder does not rule anything out: He noted, with a smile, that David Beckham\u2019s Miami franchise might be an interesting prospect.More immediately, though, there is another battle looming. Lyngby finds itself in a protracted relegation battle, thanks to Denmark\u2019s complex system of playoffs. It has struggled on the field since that nightmarish week in February, not simply because of the players who left \u2014 though that hardly helped \u2014 but because of the psychological damage it did.When players talk about Lyngby, they almost always mention family. \u201cWe care about each other, we understand each other,\u201d Tauber said. That had always been the club\u2019s strength: its familiarity, its warmth. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a Danish guy to explain the word hygge,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cIt is hard to put it into words, but it is where you feel you belong.\u201dDuring that perilous week, though, that bond was sorely tested. Players were forced to think not about the collective, but about themselves: their futures, their fears, their needs. Training sessions lacked intensity because players feared injury more than usual: A bad tackle at the wrong time might have meant months without pay, without a new club.\u201cI was worried that spirit might break,\u201d Tauber said. \u201cIt did not, but we are challenged right now.\u201dIt has taken time to restore that spirit. It may take more yet. Relegation would be the unhappiest of codas to what should be a heartwarming story, but perhaps even that has had its sting drawn by what Lyngby went through. Clubs go up and down, but they always remain, as long as there are people ready to rescue them, people with big blue hearts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Bureau\u2019s Chief Gives Big Raises, Even as He Criticizes Spending", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMick Mulvaney, the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has complained that the regulator engages in \u201cwasteful spending\u201d and needs to be slimmed down. To underscore the point, he submitted a quarterly budget request recently that was a nice round number: $0.That attitude, though, apparently didn\u2019t apply to two of his recent hires.Mr. Mulvaney appointed two senior staff members who are paid salaries of more than $230,000, amounts that are far above what they had been earning in their previous government jobs in Washington, according to agency documents obtained by The New York Times through a public records request.The consumer bureau, as well as fellow financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is allowed under federal law to pay employees significantly more than other government agencies can pay. The rationale is that the higher salaries are necessary to recruit skilled employees who otherwise might land jobs on Wall Street.As a result, the C.F.P.B. is stocked with employees who earn more than the average Washington bureaucrat. Of the agency\u2019s 1,600 employees, 219 make more than $200,000, according to the records reviewed by The Times.The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have been trying to defang the agency, which they view as overly tough on the finance industry. One weapon they have tried to employ \u2014 so far, unsuccessfully \u2014 is to reduce the amount of money the agency can pay employees.But Mr. Mulvaney was willing to shell out top dollar for his highest-ranking appointees.Ms. Sutton is making 22 percent more than her predecessor, Leandra English, who earned $212,324 as chief of staff, according to the office of Senator Ron Johnson. Mr. Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, had requested Ms. English\u2019s pay records as part of an inquiry into the C.F.P.B.\u2019s hiring practices.Like Ms. Sutton, Brian Johnson, another new deputy, previously worked on the House Financial Services Committee. In his most recent job there, as policy director, he earned about $170,000 a year, according to LegiStorm.Of the 20 people at the bureau with the title of senior adviser, Mr. Johnson is the second-highest paid. (Another adviser, whose name wasn\u2019t disclosed in the public records reviewed by The Times, is paid $240,000.)\u201cNon-career staff are being paid on par with the career staff who directly report to them,\u201d Jen Howard, a spokeswoman for the consumer bureau, said in a written response to questions from The Times.

{"Headline": "A Spy\u2019s Tale: The TV Prankster Who Says He Became a Double Agent", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "Robert Moore posed as a documentary filmmaker to monitor activists for a K2 Intelligence client. He contends he switched sides. Now he\u2019s being sued. His unusual case offers a peek into a growing industry.Supported byLONDON \u2014 A former television producer here, Robert Moore, once loved working on comedies akin to \u201cCandid Camera\u201d or \u201cDa Ali G Show\u201d that conned the unsuspecting.On one show, politicians were tricked into campaigning against a street drug called \u201ccake,\u201d which didn\u2019t exist. On another program, men were fooled into auditioning for a \u201cSurvivor\u201d-style show called \u201cLapdance Island,\u201d supposedly set on an island inhabited by lap dancers.It was a fun ride. But in 2006, Mr. Moore\u2019s career fell apart and, in his early 40s, he found himself divorced, living with his parents, studying Buddhism and working as a gardener. Then he discovered another industry that valued a talent for subterfuge: He became an operative for corporate intelligence firms.For several years, K2 Intelligence, an investigative firm based in New York, paid him to represent himself as a crusading documentary filmmaker and to spy on activists campaigning to ban the use of asbestos, the dangerous construction material. He secretly tape-recorded activists, monitored their strategy sessions and, presenting himself as a journalist, did work for the World Health Organization \u2014 all while on the payroll of the firm\u2019s asbestos industry client.\u201cHe said I had given him a purpose in his life,\u201d said one of the activists, Laurie Kazan-Allen. \u201cI bought it all. I bought the store.\u201dThe corporate intelligence business has boomed into a billion-dollar industry that provides companies, lawyers and Wall Street firms with due diligence inquiries, \u201cstrategic\u201d information and investigations into potential business partners as well as adversaries. K2 Intelligence, started in 2009 by Jules Kroll, a man regarded as the father of corporate intelligence, and one of his sons, Jeremy, is one of the industry\u2019s best-known companies.Mr. Moore, who has denied any wrongdoing, insisted in recent interviews and in court papers that he had become a double agent not long after getting his assignment from K2 Intelligence and had secretly worked to help anti-asbestos advocates. His self-appointed mission: to expose the person he believed was behind the firm\u2019s operation, a Kazakh oligarch with interests in asbestos mines in Kazakhstan and Russia.\u201cI took huge personal risks and put my security and my family\u2019s security on the line,\u201d said Mr. Moore, who has cropped hair and a long, narrow face. \u201cI was utterly motivated by what I saw.\u201dIn its filings in the London lawsuit, K2 Intelligence has also denied any wrongdoing and maintains that its asbestos-related investigation was legitimate and used reasonable measures.\u201cThe matters and methods of investigative work undertaken by K2 Intelligence employees are assessed and evaluated regionally as appropriate,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt is our practice to maintain the highest ethical standards at all times and to comply with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\u201dCiting the active litigation, K2 Intelligence declined to make executives available for interviews, and the company did not respond to written questions from The New York Times. A lawyer for the firm urged Mr. Moore not to speak with a Times reporter, an email shows.\u201cIt would be in all our interests for you not to engage,\u201d the lawyer, Dan Morrison, wrote in an email. \u201cThat is the approach that K2 will take and I hope you will agree that this is the correct approach.\u201dMr. Moore\u2019s curious life as a corporate operative started unexpectedly on a British beach in 2007 when he bumped into an old television acquaintance. The friend had since gone to work for Kroll Inc., a major corporate intelligence firm, and offered to make an introduction for him.Two years earlier, Mr. Moore had lost his job as head of television comedy at a production company. After a career of orchestrating pranks, he had hit a creative wall. \u201cI thought I had lost my way,\u201d he said.Mr. Moore eventually decided that being a private investigator would pay more than gardening. And over the next few years, he got sporadic assignments on due diligence and fraud investigations from Kroll, started in 1972 by the senior Mr. Kroll, who later sold it.On some cases, Mr. Moore, who had dabbled in journalism before his comedy career, posed as a reporter. He also once disguised himself as a deliveryman with a large floral bouquet to get into a mansion owned by a Russian oligarch. Mr. Moore, who was eager to get back into television, saw cases as possible fodder for documentaries.\u201cI found the work fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoyed the mischief.\u201dAccording to Mr. Moore, Mr. Bigazzi told him that a new client, described to him as a \u201cU.S. investor,\u201d wanted to know if American plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers handling asbestos cases were financing efforts by activists to ban the material. One of those lawyers was Ms. Kazan-Allen\u2019s brother, Steven Kazan.The firm\u2019s client, Mr. Bigazzi said, suspected that American lawyers like Mr. Kazan were trying to drum up lawsuits by foreign workers. And he added that producers of the material believed that the type of asbestos still widely used in some developing countries \u2014 chrysotile, or so-called white asbestos \u2014 did not cause mesothelioma, a fatal lung cancer tied to the material, if properly handled.\u201cHe told me chrysotile was safe,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cSo if the law firms were doing this, I felt that it was a legitimate investigation.\u201dIn one memo, he told Mr. Bigazzi that the best way to infiltrate the group without arousing suspicions would be to present himself as a documentary filmmaker eager to develop a series of films about dangerous industries, not just asbestos.\u201cThe advantage of going into this world with a bigger agenda than simply asbestos is that it might make my entry seem less deliberate,\u201d he wrote. He added that he planned to win Ms. Kazan-Allen\u2019s confidence by engaging her in \u201cthe most genuine and heartfelt way possible.\u201dWhen Ms. Kazan-Allen met Mr. Moore, she found him, as most people do, bright, charming and energetic. She also glimpsed in him a future leader of efforts to expand national bans on asbestos use, particularly in developing areas such as Southeast Asia.\u201cHe was very polite, incredibly engaging and completely believable,\u201d Ms. Kazan-Allen, 70, said.Mr. Moore had planned their encounter to mask his motives, according to court papers. He first befriended one of her associates, who introduced him to Ms. Kazan-Allen. Soon, he was sending her fawning notes thanking her for recommending books about the asbestos industry, the court papers show. He also mentioned that his sister was a top executive at the British Broadcasting Corporation.\u201cOnce I\u2019m completely up to speed I would very much like to start meeting other experts and campaigners,\u201d he wrote Ms. Kazan-Allen in mid-2012.Mr. Moore also asked her to arrange for him to attend an asbestos conference in Brussels. She agreed to do it, unaware that his real reason for going was to see if American lawyers like her brother were funding it, filings indicate.When Mr. Moore reported back to Mr. Bigazzi, his supervisor at K2 Intelligence, that he had not seen financial involvement by American lawyers, he said, he was told that the client next wanted him to go to Thailand, where activists were pushing for an asbestos ban. It was around then, Mr. Moore said, that he began to question what he was doing.Mr. Moore said he learned that independent groups viewed chrysotile as being as deadly as other varieties of asbestos. He also believed that activists were right to want it banned and started to wonder whether K2 Intelligence\u2019s client was someone other than the \u201cU.S. investor\u201d that had been mentioned to him.\u201cI don\u2019t see the work of an arch mastermind who is unreasonably using disingenuous statistics,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Bigazzi in late 2012, court papers show. \u201cI see the work of campaigners who have a good argument on their side.\u201dMr. Moore acknowledges that he could have simply walked away. Instead, he decided to discuss his situation with fellow Buddhists. He said he had told them that if he quit, K2 Intelligence would simply replace him. But if he stayed he might be able to do something positive by exposing the asbestos industry.\u201cI was told that I could absolutely do this from a Buddhist perspective providing I didn\u2019t cause harm to anyone,\u201d he said.Activists suing Mr. Moore say they believe he had a more prosaic motive \u2014 money. Court papers indicate that K2 Intelligence paid him about $100,000 annually, far more than he had made since losing his television job. Whatever the case, Mr. Moore said he soon began to deceive K2 Intelligence and its client.Anti-asbestos advocates believe Mr. Moore made the film to enhance his cover story as a journalist. But its director, Greg Atkins, said that was not the case. \u201cHe used to laugh about the concept of the industry paying him to screw the industry,\u201d Mr. Atkins said.In court filings, K2 Intelligence said its executive, Mr. Bigazzi, had become aware of the film only after Mr. Moore billed the firm for time he had spent working on it. And Mr. Bigazzi apparently was not amused by how asbestos was depicted.Mr. Moore said that when he showed the K2 Intelligence official the film, he was told halfway through to turn it off. \u201cHe said he had seen enough,\u201d Mr. Moore recalled.Investigative firms usually keep client names secret. But Mr. Moore said he was told during a chance conversation in late 2013 that the client in the asbestos case was a little-known investment firm in Singapore, the Kusto Group.Unsure whether it was true, Mr. Moore tried to ferret out more information. He said he had found nothing at first on Kusto\u2019s website to connect the firm or its founder and chairman, a Kazakh businessman named Yerkin Tatishev, to asbestos. Rather, Mr. Moore said, he stumbled over a link in 2014 when K2 Intelligence assigned him to go back to Thailand.He kept striking out initially when he asked officials of roofing tile companies there if they had heard of Kusto. Then he showed one local official photographs of executives from Kusto\u2019s affiliate in Vietnam.Mr. Moore said the official had recognized two of the executives from their work with a previous company and told him that \u201cthose are the guys who sold us asbestos from the oligarch.\u201d The same official added that Mr. Tatishev had once visited a roofing tile company in Thailand to urge it to keep using asbestos, according to Mr. Moore.Those leads weren\u2019t conclusive. But Mr. Moore says he began to focus his efforts on understanding what part, if any, Kusto or Mr. Tatishev was playing in the asbestos industry. In one 2015 email, for instance, he suggested to an anti-asbestos activist that they start looking into Kusto and the role of Russian asbestos producers in blocking bans in Southeast Asia. And he contacted journalists and filmmakers about making a documentary with him about the asbestos trade.He also met at a London restaurant with a director, Dan Reed, to discuss a film project based on his experience as a corporate operative. Mr. Moore envisioned the film as having a climactic scene in which he would out himself as a whistle-blower at an asbestos conference.\u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be a part of this,\u2019 and thought there was an opportunity to expose it,\u201d Mr. Reed said.Mr. Moore said he started secretly recording his meetings with Mr. Bigazzi of K2 Intelligence. While in Vietnam for the firm, he also gave a speech to reporters titled \u201cThe Duty of Journalists to Protect the Public Health,\u201d in which he urged them to investigate the role of Kazakhstan and Russia in asbestos use. One slide he showed had a photograph of Mr. Tatishev and bags of asbestos.Mr. Moore said he had received an irate phone call afterward from Mr. Bigazzi, who had somehow learned about the talk. But Mr. Moore said he had defused the situation by telling Mr. Bigazzi that he had repeated the contentions of anti-asbestos advocates only to maintain his cover as a journalist.The strain of his life appeared to be taking a toll on Mr. Moore, friends of his said. Bill Lawrence, an occupational safety expert who was helping him analyze asbestos export data, said that he called Mr. Moore at home. During the conversation, Mr. Lawrence overheard Mr. Moore\u2019s companion express fear about their safety.\u201cThis is getting too dangerous, Rob,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said he had heard the woman say.Mr. Moore\u2019s life as an operative soon unraveled. In late 2015, Mr. Moore said, K2 Intelligence offered him another assignment, this time to get close to leaders of a major anticorruption group, Global Witness.Mr. Taylor recalled Mr. Moore saying words to the effect of: \u201cIf you know this story, this is what I want to do for you.\u201d Mr. Moore proposed playing the part of a double agent, sharing that K2 Intelligence had also paid him to spy on anti-asbestos advocates, Mr. Taylor said.Global Witness considered Mr. Moore\u2019s proposal but decided it could not trust him, Mr. Taylor said. The group also urged him to alert activists such Ms. Kazan-Allen about his work. When Mr. Moore balked, Global Witness contacted a law firm. That firm then sued K2 Intelligence, Mr. Moore and Mr. Bigazzi in 2016 on behalf of several activists.Mr. Moore said he felt that Global Witness had betrayed him and insists that he was close to telling activists the truth. But Mr. Taylor said it was not Mr. Moore\u2019s role to set the timetable, adding that his reports to the intelligence firm\u2019s client might have jeopardized the safety of activists.\u201cHe is not in a position to play God,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.Mr. Moore has struggled since the lawsuit. He said he had spent his life savings, over $375,000, on legal fees and was now represented by pro bono attorneys.Mr. Moore said he understood why advocates like Ms. Kazan-Allen felt betrayed. He believes that they will come to see him differently if he has a chance to tell his story in court.In its filings in London, K2 Intelligence said it had undertaken the asbestos inquiry on behalf of a trade group called the Chrysotile Cement Industry of Kazakhstan.A spokesman for the Kusto Group, Michael Farrant, said the firm had never had any asbestos-related holdings. However, Kusto\u2019s website notes that Mr. Tatishev, before starting Kusto, was a major player in the asbestos industry who revived the fortunes of two large asbestos mines, one in Kazakhstan and the other in Russia.Mr. Tatishev declined through Mr. Farrant to be interviewed for this article and did not respond to written questions about his current interests in any entities involved with asbestos.Efforts to settle the lawsuit are underway, though Mr. Moore said he had resisted doing so. Some activists have rejected his tale of intrigue as a product of his imagination. \u201cHow can you believe that anything he says is true?\u201d Ms. Kazan-Allen said.Others, while finding Mr. Moore\u2019s tactics unacceptable, believe his intentions were genuine. \u201cEvery part of my bones tells me there is truth in what he is saying,\u201d said Mr. Lawrence, the occupational safety expert.Meanwhile, Mr. Moore said, he has gone back to developing prank comedy shows, though he is not sure what the future holds.\u201cDo I strike you as someone who knows how to plan?\u201d he asked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin, or the World? Sanctions May Force Oligarchs to Choose", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Compared to the sunny, palm-lined offshore tax havens where Russians typically stash their fortunes \u2014 think the British Virgin Islands or Cyprus \u2014 two chilly, windswept Russian islands would seem to offer little.Yet October Island, a glorified swamp in Russia\u2019s European exclave of Kaliningrad, and Russian Island, a former cow pasture facing the far eastern port of Vladivostok, were highlighted by Moscow this week as potential alternatives.\u201cRussia has no strategy on how to react to this situation, to these new economic circumstances,\u201d Evgeny Gontmakher, a prominent opposition economist, said.The most immediate effect is being felt by Oleg V. Deripaska and his aluminum giant, Rusal, which has lost about one-third of its value on the Moscow stock exchange. \u201cThis is a new stage,\u201d Mr. Gontmakher said. \u201cThis is targeting for isolation a very big, export-oriented company. That is very painful.\u201dParadoxically, the sanctions could help President Vladimir V. Putin to accomplish a long-held goal of putting more of the economy under state control and pressuring billionaires to bring their money home.Yet the sanctions might also work against Mr. Putin\u2019s interests, forcing some of the wealthiest Russians to decide just how closely they want to be identified with the Kremlin by financing militias, political organizations or other adventures abroad. \u201cAnyone who wants to help the Kremlin outside will think twice,\u201d said Konstantin Gaaze, an analyst and frequent contributor to the Moscow Carnegie Center website.In a larger sense, the sanctions are expected to have a limited overall effect after the initial shock wears off, because they ultimately targeted just a handful of companies. But the virtual sequestering of a critical Russian commodity producer has introduced a strong element of uncertainty into dealings with all Russian raw materials, the taproot of the country\u2019s income, which is likely to further isolate Russia from the world.The initial government response was muted, with Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for Mr. Putin, telling reporters that \u201cit would be wrong to make hasty decisions\u201d and predicting that the value of the ruble and the Russian stock market would bounce back once emotions settled down.Given the tiny size of the Russian economy \u2014 around 2 percent of global G.D.P. \u2014 and its limited trade with the United States, there was little expectation of economic retaliation. Any Russian response was likely to come in places like Syria or Ukraine, analysts said, where the Kremlin might ratchet up tensions in order to leverage any solution on ending the sanctions.With an American strike in Syria possible at any moment, in response to what was suspected to be a chemical weapons attack by the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, an occasion for that scenario might materialize quickly.\u201cPeople thought this was a joke, but now it is clear that the situation is serious,\u201d said Vladislav S. Zhukovsky, an economist and investment consultant. \u201cThis is more serious than the previous sanctions.\u201dThe two most prominent industrialists targeted were Mr. Deripaska, whose Rusal company employs an estimated 60,000 in Russia, and Viktor F. Vekselberg, one of the richest men in Russia, whose projects include trying to develop the country\u2019s tech sector.\u201cIt is not clear what are the key sins that got people transferred from the big list to the small list,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, an independent political and economic analyst. \u201cThe logic is not clear, which increases the risk for all others.\u201dIn the end, the most important ramifications of this round of sanctions is the uncertainty they introduce to all of Russia\u2019s dealings with the West. \u201cThere is a big possibility that this is only the beginning of the campaign,\u201d Mr. Gontmakher said.The government said it would address that uncertainty by providing whatever support was needed to keep the targeted companies functioning and their employees in jobs. \u201cThe main thing now is to minimize uncertainty while securing the stable functioning of the companies, where hundreds of thousands of people work,\u201d Arkady V. Dvorkovich, a Russian deputy prime minister, told an economic conference on Tuesday.Most analysts suggested that the Kremlin was likely to buy Rusal, for example, and try to rebrand it to avoid it being stigmatized on the world market and to sell the aluminum at rock-bottom prices just to keep Russians employed. This might well provide a multibillion-dollar payday for Mr. Deripaska.To the dismay of liberal economists, Mr. Putin has pushed state ownership of the economy from about 35 percent to between 50 and 70 percent, and taking over Rusal would further expand government control.Russia weathered a round of sanctions over the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which limited its access to Western capital markets, cut off arms sales and limited technology transfer. The latest are narrower, but more intense, analysts said, since they effectively shut out a giant commodity producer from Western markets.The Kremlin has been trying to force rich Russians to bring their money home and the sanctions might help. \u201cAs one of our clients said, when sanctions were introduced it was the wrong way to destroy Russia,\u201d said Oleg Kouzmin, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank. To really wreak economic havoc in Russia, he joked, the West should roll out the red carpet for assets from the oligarchs, effectively stalling the Russian economy.Habitually, tycoons have feared falling afoul of the Kremlin and having their assets in Russia seized, but any oligarch cut off completely from international financial markets might be more amenable to shifting funds home. Still, it would be only a short-term fix, noted several analysts, because Russia is not a big enough or attractive enough market for significant, sustained investment.\u201cWe have to understand that we are entering a new reality \u2014 Russia is being turned into a toxic asset,\u201d said Mr. Zhukovsky, the economist.Ivan Nechepurenko and Andrew Kramer contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Trump Officials Reach Truce in Fight Over Tax Law\u2019s Implementation", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Treasury Department has relinquished some of its authority over implementation of the Trump tax cuts, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ceding the ability to review regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which is headed by Mick Mulvaney.The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul was rushed through Congress late last year and has left many lingering questions that the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, which is part of the department, have been scrambling to answer. Key among those are what kinds of businesses qualify as \u201cpass-through\u201d companies that are eligible for a new 20 percent deduction and how broadly to apply the international tax provisions aimed at preventing large companies from shifting profits overseas.Last year Mr. Trump called for a review of the Treasury\u2019s exemption from the usual practice of the budget office doing cost-benefit analyses of regulations issued by government agencies, sparking a turf war between Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Mnuchin.Under the new agreement, the White House budget office will review Treasury regulations that could create interference or inconsistencies with regulations from other agencies. It would also assess regulations that raise \u201cnovel\u201d legal or policy issues, such as penalizing conduct through the tax code. And regulations that have a revenue effect on the economy of more than $100 million will receive additional scrutiny.In its effort to maintain control over tax guidance, Treasury officials argued that giving the budget office final say would create additional layers of red tape that could slow implementation of a law the administration is hoping will provide an economic boost. They also argued that the budget office did not have sufficient tax policy expertise to properly scrutinize complex regulations.To alleviate the concerns of business groups, the agreement creates an expedited process for the budget office to review regulations related to the 2017 tax law, completing such assessments in 10 days.Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney both claimed victory on Thursday.\u201cThis updated review framework will increase scrutiny of regulations most likely to impose new costs, while preserving Treasury\u2019s ability to ensure taxpayers receive timely, clear rules and guidance on how to comply with our tax code,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cUnder today\u2019s agreement, Treasury will continue to swiftly and successfully implement historic tax reform while still avoiding needless regulatory costs and delays.\u201dMr. Mulvaney called the deal \u201ca reflection of tremendous coordination\u201d between the Treasury and the budget office and said it would \u201cpromote economic growth and prosperity.\u201dA spokeswoman for the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, praised the deal on Thursday. \u201cWith this agreement, O.M.B. and Treasury have struck the right balance to ensure a transparent, careful and expeditious regulatory process,\u201d the spokeswoman, Julia Lawless, said in an email. \u201cMoving forward, Chairman Hatch will continue to work with the administration as they develop I.R.S. rules on the new tax law.\u201dBut Democrats and some outside experts continued to raise concerns that the additional layer of review would bog down the law\u2019s implementation and potentially open new avenues of confusion for businesses attempting to comply with the law.\u201cSmall businesses are increasingly stuck in a bureaucratic twilight zone,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a committee hearing on Thursday morning. \u201cThere is rampant confusion about how the new tax law works \u2014 untested policies, sloppy legislative drafting and outright mistakes in the law. On top of that, a Trump cabinet turf battle has been adding to the uncertainty and lengthening the time that small businesses are going to be in the dark about how the tax rules apply to them.\u201dJennifer Abelaj, a senior counsel and tax expert at the New York law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, said Thursday that \u201cI am concerned that an additional level of review could result in unnecessary delays that make compliance more difficult, not to mention more expensive for taxpayers.\u201d\u201cAlready, there are many tax questions that need answers,\u201d she said. \u201cThis policy change could throw a wrench \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 in the carefully laid plans of taxpayers and their tax advisers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "They Have Many Differences, but on Syria, Trump Seems Much Like Obama", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 Whether it is the Paris climate accord or the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has moved methodically to dismantle the foreign policy legacy of his predecessor Barack Obama. Except for Syria, on which Mr. Trump has faithfully echoed Mr. Obama\u2019s hands-off policy.Mr. Trump\u2019s statement on Tuesday \u2014 that \u201cI want to bring our troops back home; I want to start rebuilding our nation\u201d \u2014 underscored again how similarly he and Mr. Obama view the United States\u2019 role in the overlapping conflicts in Syria.Both men have doubted the wisdom of a long-term American military commitment in the country. Both have complained that Saudi Arabia expects the United States to bear the burden of a costly war against President Bashar al-Assad. Both have viewed Syria primarily through the prism of combating the Islamic State.Mr. Trump, a former senior adviser said, does not believe that Syria\u2019s civil war is a vital national security interest of the United States. Neither did Mr. Obama, which is why he initially rebuffed proposals to funnel weapons to the rebels in Syria or to impose a no-fly zone over parts of the country.\u201cBoth men retreat from the idea of getting deeply involved in other countries\u2019 civil wars,\u201d said Robert S. Ford, the last American ambassador to Syria. \u201cBoth of them are instinctively more concerned about the American economy and things at home, even if they have very different visions of America.\u201dMr. Ford, who now teaches at Yale and is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, said Mr. Trump, like Mr. Obama, was right to worry about \u201cmission creep\u201d in the military\u2019s operations in Syria.The American-led coalition, Mr. Ford noted, has recently bombed Syrian forces, backed by Iranian militias and Russian mercenaries, who were advancing on oil fields held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a mostly Arab faction that is fighting with the United States against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t about ISIS,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cThis was about keeping the Syrians out of the oil fields held by our buddies.\u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s debates over Syria carry a distinct echo of those during the Obama administration. Both presidents confronted aides pushing more aggressive options. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, the Pentagon is pleading for more time to mop up in Syria, warning that a hasty exit will jeopardize the gains made in the campaign against the Islamic State. In Mr. Obama\u2019s case, the C.I.A. and the State Department both advocated arming the rebels.At a National Security Council meeting on Tuesday, a frustrated Mr. Trump pressed his top military advisers for how long it would take to root out the remaining Islamic State fighters and to train local forces to stabilize Syrian territory freed from the militant group.In 2012, Mr. Ford recalled, a skeptical Mr. Obama quizzed his aides about how arming a ragtag band of Syrian rebels could lead to a negotiated end to the war.Both leaders also share the same skepticism of the motives of allies. Mr. Obama railed against Saudi Arabia, which had lobbied Washington to arm the rebels, as a free rider. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that if Saudis were so eager for the United States to stay engaged in Syria, they should help finance the campaign.\u201cI said, \u2018Well, you want us to stay, maybe you\u2019ll have to pay,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said during a news conference, apparently referring to a call he had with King Salman of Saudi Arabia. \u201cIt is very costly for our country. And it helps other countries a hell of a lot more than it helps us.\u201dMr. Trump is more transactional in his approach than was Mr. Obama. The former president, his aides said, tended to focus on whether a strategy was financially sustainable over time, while the current president views foreign affairs as a strict balance sheet.Trump administration officials insist there are other differences. Mr. Trump, they said, agreed to arm the Syrian Kurds \u2014 a crucial step that enabled these battle-hardened soldiers to fight alongside American troops in retaking the Syrian city of Raqqa.Mr. Obama did not arm the Kurds, mainly because his aides were caught up in a debate over whether it would antagonize Turkey. The Turks view the Kurdish militia as closely linked to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a separatist group known as the P.K.K., which threatens Turkey. Mr. Obama did come around to supporting the idea of arming the Kurds, but only at the end of his presidency.Mr. Trump, officials said, has given his military commanders more flexibility to deploy troops, which they said had accelerated the defeat of the Islamic State. But analysts said Mr. Obama planted the seeds for the victory by orchestrating the multinational military campaign to begin with.\u201cWhile Obama and Trump may share an aversion to escalating the conflict, their instincts led in different directions,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cObama was more focused on diplomacy with the key players, while Trump has shown little inclination to focus on the diplomatic track.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s diplomatic ambitions, some argue, are the key to understanding why he shunned deeper involvement in Syria.\u201cFor Obama, it was fear of alienating Iran from a nuclear deal, the jewel in the crown of his foreign policy,\u201d said Frederic C. Hof, a former special envoy to Syria in the Obama administration. \u201cFor Trump, it is an instinctive belief that anything the U.S. is doing in the Middle East is a waste of time and money.\u201dYet Mr. Obama, too, lamented that American military adventures in the region usually ended in ashes. He often drew an analogy to Libya, where he had authorized a military intervention in 2011 that left the country in shambles.With their reluctance to get involved, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump may find themselves united in another way. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump regularly castigated Mr. Obama for withdrawing American troops from Iraq too abruptly in 2011 \u2014 a decision that he said allowed the Islamic State to take root and flourish.Now, as Mr. Trump pushes his commanders for a speedy exit from Syria, he faces the same danger.\u201cWhat the Department of Defense is worried about is a three-plus-year military campaign against ISIS going down the drain,\u201d Mr. Hof said. \u201cIf you wanted to write a script for the resurgence of an Islamist regime, this is it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could the U.K. Vote Again on Brexit? The Prospects Are Rising", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySALFORD, England \u2014 Like the majority of voters in this gritty part of northern England, Alan Wood voted for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union largely, he says, because of immigration.But lately, as he watches his government\u2019s stumbling efforts to negotiate departure, Mr. Wood has begun to suspect that Britain\u2019s economy will suffer, questioned how he will be affected and wondered whether he made a mistake.\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know whether it is right or not,\u201d he said, munching a meat pie and fries at Yum Yum\u2019s cafe.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how big it was going to be,\u201d added Mr. Wood, 54, a dog trainer, conceding that \u201cif there were another vote, a lot of people would change their minds and vote to stay this time.\u201dAt this no-frills diner on a drab suburban highway, Mr. Wood was sharing a table with a member of Britain\u2019s House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, who was here to reach out to voters in areas that had voted for the country\u2019s withdrawal, or Brexit, and to persuade them to think again.Not every conversation was going so smoothly for Mr. Adonis. At the counter, next to the freshly battered fish, was Darren Fildes, 46, a cafe worker and a Brexit supporter who sees the European Union as \u201ccommunism with a new pair of knickers,\u201d a British word for underwear.Yet, with Britain mired in tortuous exit negotiations and its economy slowing, pro-Europeans like Mr. Adonis have begun to sense a change in the prevailing winds and are actively trying to drum up support for another say over the country\u2019s future. Several groups have come together recently and events are being organized across the country to make the case for a new vote.They argue that, rather than a rerun of the 2016 plebiscite, this new \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d would decide whether whatever Brexit deal the government finally produces matches up to the extravagant promises made in the raucous referendum campaign.Mr. Adonis, who sees a looming political crisis over the terms of withdrawal, estimates the prospects of stopping Brexit at 30 to 40 percent.That may not be as fanciful as it sounds. Any withdrawal deal struck by Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, will need approval from Parliament, where she has no reliable majority.Were lawmakers to reject her agreement, Mrs. May would then face three choices, says Dominic Grieve, a pro-European rebel lawmaker in her own Conservative Party. She could try to renegotiate it \u2014 unlikely, in view of domestic political pressures and resistance from the European Union \u2014 call a general election or put her Brexit plan directly to the people.A reversal of Brexit, nevertheless, remains a long shot. Neither the government nor Labour, the main opposition party, wants a new referendum, and pro-Europeans face many obstacles, not least drumming up interest among a weary or indifferent populace.While Britain\u2019s economy is one of the laggards of the Western world, the out-and-out recession predicted by Brexit\u2019s opponents never did materialize. Negotiations on the withdrawal are generally acknowledged to be going poorly for London, steeped in confusion and retreat. But they are so technical that many voters have tuned out and the largely pro-Brexit newspapers pay little heed to British setbacks.But none of that is discouraging a growing cohort convinced they can right what they regard as a terrible mistake. On the first floor of Milbank Tower, near Parliament in London, no fewer than nine pro-European groups have tried to overcome differences, and competing egos, by joining a Grassroots Coordinating Group.This was nicknamed GCHQ, a lighthearted reference to Britain\u2019s secret intelligence monitoring center, though with posters on the walls, leaflets stacked in boxes and an open carton of breakfast cereal on a table top recently, the room hardly resembles a high-tech spy center.Partly financed by George Soros, the financier and philanthropist, Best for Britain was featured in a controversial article in The Daily Telegraph, co-written by Nick Timothy, a \u201cleave\u201d enthusiast and former aide to Mrs. May. The headline accused organizers of a \u201csecret plot to thwart Brexit.\u201dIn truth, its activities are more humdrum, like the staging of \u201cbarnstormer\u201d events, sometimes in leave-voting areas, where pro-European campaigners learn messages and debating techniques.Though opponents of Brexit are routinely portrayed by critics as members of a discredited, remote elite, Mr. Adonis, a former minister who studied at Oxford University, is unperturbed.\u201cI am too metropolitan, I am too cosmopolitan,\u201d he said disarmingly, \u201cbut I do get out and about.\u201dHis reception seems generally friendly on a tour of 100 areas of the country that voted for Brexit. Face to face, \u201cvery, very few people aren\u2019t nice\u201d he said, before adding that \u201cthe people who want me hanged or shot say so under a pseudonym on Twitter.\u201dCerebral and intense, Mr. Adonis spoke quickly as he analyzed how Britons came to vote against European Union membership, a decision as damaging to their country, he says, as the Suez crisis of the 1950s.Far from helping those left behind by globalization, he argued, the true agenda of leading Brexit supporters is to shrink the state and extend the laissez-faire policies of Margaret Thatcher. He sees the Brexit vote as a protest from areas with legitimate grievances, and says he thinks that concerns about immigration must be addressed.There are compelling practical arguments for another referendum, because the 2016 vote was silent on what should replace European Union membership, and those options vary enormously. Since none have a specific democratic mandate, any outcome is likely to be contested for years.But it is hard to detect a burning public desire for another vote. Outside a shopping mall here in Salford, the main complaint is not about Europe, but about municipal cost-cutting and reduced garbage collection. (\u201cIf we can get weekly bin collections, we can stay in the European Union,\u201d jokes Mr. Adonis.)If it happens, a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d will result less from popular demand than from a political impasse. Mrs. May has been embarrassed by defeats on amendments to legislation to quit the bloc in the House of Lords, the unelected second chamber of Parliament, and faces crunch votes to overturn them in the House of Commons soon.Then, when lawmakers vote on any Brexit deal in the fall, the Labour Party will be crucial. Though its left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a lifelong Euroskeptic, most of his lawmakers and party members are not, and analysts say they believe he will oppose any deal that Mrs. May strikes, on the pretext that Labour could do better.So one strand of the pro-European campaign aims to galvanize Labour Party members \u2014 including young people \u2014 to pressure Mr. Corbyn to resist Brexit. But another is to start engaging with supporters of Brexit in case there is another campaign.At an open meeting in Oldham, one of Britain\u2019s most deprived towns, about two dozen people answered a recent invitation from Mr. Adonis to debate Brexit.Ros Birch, 46, an apprenticeship officer who voted to remain, said it had become clear that the nearly $500 million a week bonanza that Brexit supporters had promised to divert to health spending would never materialize, and pointed to Mrs. May\u2019s problems putting together a deal and getting it through Parliament.\u201cWhether I am living in cloud cuckoo land or not, I don\u2019t know, but I still don\u2019t feel it will happen,\u201d she said.But many in Oldham hope it does, including Richard Lowe-Jackson, 58, a self-employed businessman and leave voter, who said he would resent having a second referendum, which he called \u201ca second bite at the cherry.\u201dDuring most of the 90-minute discussion, Mr. Adonis stayed quiet and encouraged audience members to speak.\u201cPeople like me,\u201d he said, \u201chaven\u2019t been listening enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Virtual Currency Plans", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe offering was part of a broader, but still very private push that the firm was making into the nascent world of cryptocurrencies over the last year.The goal of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s own coin offering? Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, said in an interview. The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.\u201cWho knows more about the usage of personal data than Cambridge Analytica?\u201d Ms. Kaiser said. \u201cSo why not build a platform that reconstructs the way that works?\u201dThe effort was overseen by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s British chief executive, Alexander Nix, who was forced out of the company in March after he was caught on tape bragging about his company\u2019s approach to political work in other countries, including the use of shell companies and strategies designed to entrap opponents. The Facebook data revelations and Mr. Nix\u2019s comments appear to have put the virtual currency work, which was still in the early stages, on hold.\u201cThere are only a handful of more controversial areas it could have expanded its business into,\u201d said Tim Swanson, a consultant to companies in the industry, who was briefed on the Cambridge Analytica coin offering.A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Cambridge Analytica boasts that its \u201cpsychographic profiles\u201d of voters and consumers allow for more persuasive and precisely targeted advertising. In marketing material sent to investors, the firm said Ms. Kaiser was \u201chelping blockchain companies in using predictive modeling to target investors for token sales.\u201dJill Carlson, a consultant who has worked with several blockchain companies, attended meetings where Cambridge Analytica pitched its services to virtual currency companies, including one that Mr. Nix attended.Ms. Carlson said the Cambridge Analytica employees had bragged about their success in helping get President Trump elected and their ability to carefully target advertising campaigns using data from social networks like Facebook.She also remembers they spoke about an array of potential campaigns. The most unusual idea involved sending virtual currencies to people in far-flung regions of Mexico. The payments would give people incentive to fill out surveys and get data that could then be used to help design campaigns for Mexican political candidates.Ms. Carlson said the pitch was contrary to the ideas of openness and transparency that drew her to virtual currency projects like Bitcoin.\u201cThe way that Cambridge Analytica was talking about it, they were viewing it as a means of being able to basically inflict government control and private corporate control over individuals, which just takes the whole initial premise of this technology and turns it on its head in this very dystopian way,\u201d she said.Cambridge Analytica did win over some clients. Last summer, Ms. Kaiser\u2019s team began working with Dragon Coin, a new virtual currency that was designed to be used by gamblers. The coin was supposed to make it easier for people to get their money to casinos in Macau, an island that is technically a part of China with some independent political structures.But documents sent in September to potential investors by Dragon Coin\u2019s co-founder Paul Moynan listed Mr. Wan as the sponsor of the initial coin offering and included his picture. Ms. Kaiser was included in the email. A separate Dragon Coin document that Mr. Moynan sent out at the same time listed Mr. Wan as one of a few high-profile supporters of the project.When reached recently, Mr. Moynan initially said that his email address had been hacked and that he did not recognize the documents. He later said the documents were a \u201chypothetical wish list\u201d of a \u201cjunior staff\u201d member.\u201cWe will be conducting an internal investigation, as unfinished draft documents would never have been indicative of actual agreed partnerships,\u201d he said.Ms. Kaiser said that her work on the Dragon Coin event in Macau had been done in a personal capacity, and that the Dragon Coin team had told her that Mr. Wan was not involved with the project.Dragon Coin claimed it raised more than $300 million from investors last fall. That total has been hard to verify. Like many coin offerings, Dragon Coin has failed to live up to its promises.The document sent to investors in September said Dragon Coin had secured a partnership with Visa to release a debit card that would work on the Visa network. A spokeswoman for Visa said that there was no partnership and that no Dragon card had been approved, as is necessary for a card to be issued.The setbacks did not stop Cambridge Analytica from plunging further into the virtual currency realm. The company\u2019s New York office continued reaching out to potential investors and partners, emails show. And in January, Ms. Kaiser hosted a side conference dedicated to blockchain projects, known as CryptoHQ, at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Nix spoke on a panel at the event.He said that the technology would be helpful in solving the very problems that Cambridge Analytica has since become the emblem of \u2014 the abuse of online personal data.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a new type of economy emerging where people can start to take ownership of their data and monetize on their data,\u201d Mr. Nix said, according to a tweet from the CryptoHQ account. \u201cAnd that is only possible through the blockchain.\u201dThe virtual currency that Cambridge Analytica was designing was aimed at exactly this problem, and would have also helped the company raise money from investors.Nathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco, and Nicholas Confessore from New York.Advertisement"}

By then, debt held by the public will almost match the size of the nation\u2019s economy, reaching 96 percent of gross domestic product, a higher level than any point since just after World War II and well past the level that economists say could court a crisis.The new C.B.O. projection is the first since President Trump signed a tax cut that is expected to cost the government nearly $1.9 trillion over 11 years, then signed legislation to significantly boost military and domestic spending over the next two years. The figures are sobering, even in a political climate where deficit concerns appear to be receding.This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the budget deficit is expected to total $804 billion, up from $665 billion last fiscal year, according to the C.B.O. projections.

The company, he says, will block app developers from gaining access to the data of users who have been inactive for three months; restrict the ability of users to inadvertently share information about others in their networks; and adopt stricter permissions guidelines and search features.Democrats are expected to grill Mr. Zuckerberg about the privacy scandals, and how the social network is guarding against possible interference in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans are expected to be more reticent about privacy regulations, and may use the hearings to raise suspicions of political bias on the social network.More from The Information:\u201cOverall, there has never been a time where we have seen so much focus on diversity.

{"Headline": "Investigators Focus on Another Trump Ally: The National Enquirer", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has long had ties to the nation\u2019s major media players. But his connections with the country\u2019s largest tabloid publisher, American Media Inc., run deeper than most.And in the Trump era, A.M.I.\u2019s flagship tabloid, The National Enquirer, has taken a decidedly political turn, regularly devoting covers to the president\u2019s triumphs and travails with articles headlined \u201cTrump\u2019s Plan For World Peace!\u201d and \u201cProof! FBI Plot to Impeach Trump!\u201dThe federal inquiry could pose serious legal implications for the president and his campaign committee. It also presents thorny questions about A.M.I.\u2019s First Amendment protections, and whether its record in supporting Mr. Trump somehow opens the door to scrutiny usually reserved for political organizations.A.M.I. has denied any wrongdoing while also saying its cooperation with investigators will not extend beyond its constitutionally protected status as a news organization.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look down at the work product of celebrity magazines and assume they are not entitled to the same protections as the mainstream media,\u201d said Cameron Stracher, a lawyer for A.M.I. \u201cBut the First Amendment was designed to protect all speech against government intrusion.\u201dIn A.M.I., Mr. Trump has had an unusually powerful media backer, one that complements the supportive prime-time slate at Fox News.The Enquirer had an average paid circulation of about 260,000 copies weekly in the second half of last year. That was a 13 percent drop from the previous six-month average, according to publisher data provided to the Alliance for Audited Media that was obtained by The Times.But most of its sales come over the counter at $4.99 a copy. The Enquirer provides a useful platform for a politician seeking votes from average Americans, in a place candidates have gone to show their familiarity with everyday life: the supermarket checkout lane.The family that controlled A.M.I. before Mr. Pecker took it over in 1999, the Popes, moved early on to secure prime placement for The Enquirer in magazine racks at grocery store cash registers. The company now also owns The Globe, Us Weekly, OK! and other titles that benefit from that arrangement.In a statement, the company said, \u201cIf A.M.I. was \u2018helpful\u2019 to the president during the campaign, it was because the audience of The National Enquirer was one of the most supportive of his candidacy during the campaign.\u201d It added that Enquirer covers featuring Mr. Trump increased sales.\u201cWe covered him for a business reason,\u201d the statement said.He said that after A.M.I. bought Ms. McDougal\u2019s story and agreed to feature her in health and fitness columns in non-gossip magazines like Hers and Flex, it expected her loyalty to the company and Mr. Trump. \u201cOnce she\u2019s part of the company, then on the outside she can\u2019t be bashing Trump and American Media,\u201d he said.Mr. Pecker has been supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential aspirations since his run as a Reform Party candidate in 2000, when George magazine \u2014 part of the company Mr. Pecker ran then, Hachette \u2014 featured a friendly profile. The Enquirer was early to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s potential bid in 2011.As Mr. Trump ramped up his campaign in 2015, he, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Howard and Mr. Pecker engaged in more serious discussions about how A.M.I. could be helpful, according to several people familiar with the efforts.In one early interaction, Mr. Cohen helped arrange an ultimately abandoned attempt to buy and bury a potentially damaging photograph of Mr. Trump at an event with a topless woman \u2014 what is known in the tabloid world as a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d operation.One person close to the campaign at the time recalled a meeting at Trump Tower in February 2015 between Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump about how A.M.I. could help surface embarrassing information about Bill and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival, during a general election. The person, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters, said Mr. Cohen was also present. Mr. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.Late Wednesday, A.M.I. said in a statement, \u201cIf the suggestion is that David, Trump and Cohen met to discuss Clinton strategy, A.M.I. categorically denies it.\u201dAt the center of the campaign finance inquiries will be whether the ties between Mr. Cohen, Mr. Howard, Mr. Pecker, Mr. Trump and others led A.M.I. to act more like a political supporter than a news organization.The group that brought the federal election complaint, Common Cause, claims the payment for Ms. McDougal\u2019s story was not a \u201clegitimate press function\u201d and therefore was not protected by rules exempting news organizations from campaign finance regulations.The question represents tricky terrain for federal officials, given the protection journalists have under the First Amendment. \u201cWe always worry when investigators are making those judgment calls about whether your editorial process is legitimate or not, or is this legitimate journalism or not,\u201d said Alexandra Ellerbeck, the North America program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.Yet even the staunchest defenders of the press say fraudulent activity is not protected by journalistic freedoms.\u201cWe are not, as media organizations, immune from the civil and criminal laws of the country,\u201d said Sandra S. Baron, a senior fellow at Yale Law School and the former executive director of the Media Law Resource Center.Matt Apuzzo, Maggie Haberman and Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. and China Play Chicken on Trade, and Neither Swerves", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 At the heart of the intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China is a fundamental question: Which country is more willing to endure short-term pain for the long-term gain of playing a leading role in high-tech industries.China has embarked on an aggressive and expensive plan to retool its economy for the future as it moves to dominate in robotics, aerospace, artificial intelligence and more. President Trump has said China\u2019s approach relies on unfair and predatory practices, and on stolen American technology. And even as Chinese leaders say they want to avoid a trade war, they are staunchly defending their plans and showing little sign of backing down.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to sharply escalate the administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports \u2014 a threat he reiterated on Friday \u2014 shows that neither side has yet gone far enough to persuade the other to compromise. Bigger and broader tariffs may be necessary to get China\u2019s attention.\u201cThe administration, if it\u2019s serious, better be prepared for much more,\u201d said Derek Scissors, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.It is an agenda that China would probably go to great lengths to protect. \u201cWe will not start a war \u2014 however, if someone starts a war, we will definitely fight back,\u201d Gao Feng, the commerce ministry spokesman, said at a news conference in Beijing on Friday. \u201cNo options will be ruled out.\u201dFor the United States, victory in such a war would be difficult to verify, much less achieve.China could say it plans to ease back on government support. But that could be difficult to quantify because of the country\u2019s opaque political system and the state\u2019s control of information.China could back off from rules that favor local competitors and require American companies to share technology if they want access to the Chinese market. For example, foreign automakers face pressure to transfer electric-car technology to their local partners, and foreign technology companies are increasingly required to submit to security reviews. Foreign businesses have long complained that many of the rules they must follow are unwritten.Proving that the Chinese government unfairly supports the effort could be difficult, however.The United States could press its argument with the World Trade Organization, which oversees global trading rules and prohibits big loans from government-controlled banks at artificially low interest rates. But the W.T.O. requires many contracts and government documents to prove cases, evidence that can be hard to get in a tightly controlled country like China.Even when the W.T.O. rules against China, persuading the country to comply can be challenging. One such ruling, involving China\u2019s restrictions on foreign electronic payment systems, was issued nearly six years ago. China is still mulling how it will comply \u2014 despite numerous complaints from the Obama administration and more recent nudges from the Trump administration.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.So the United States has turned to tariffs. That means it is using a 1980s tool to address an industrial policy issue that is already shaping the 21st century.Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, was a deputy United States trade representative under President Ronald Reagan. The tariffs that Mr. Lighthizer threatened against Japan in those days are among the same ones he is wielding now. But the two periods differ in two big ways.One is that Japan depended on the United States in the \u201980s for military protection from the Soviet Union. China, by contrast, is an increasingly assertive global rival, sending naval vessels to the Baltic Sea and building a naval base in East Africa.The second major difference between then and now is that the European Union deeply resented the tariffs of the 1980s, and Mr. Trump\u2019s use of them could make it difficult to persuade European officials to present a united front. In response to American tariffs, Beijing could simply shift business from American companies like Boeing and Ford to European rivals like Airbus and Daimler.Chinese officials dispute the American accusations about their unfair trade practices. They say Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs violate W.T.O. rules, and they dispute claims that China forces American companies to hand over technology. As for Made in China 2025, Chinese officials say the plan is only guidance, not a government directive \u2014 and that foreign companies are free to participate, too.In China\u2019s current industrial policy, the Trump administration sees an extension of how the country has already come to dominate one major industry of the future: solar power.Mr. Trump himself is no fan of solar panels. He has spoken enthusiastically about coal, not renewable energy, throughout his campaign and his presidency. But the solar power industry is one of the biggest success stories so far in China\u2019s efforts involving advanced industries.The United States played a central role in developing solar panels and manufacturing them until a decade ago. Around then, the Chinese government decided to finance a lavish expansion of the sector. State-controlled banks lent tens of billions of dollars at low interest rates despite the high-profile bankruptcies of solar manufacturers.Chinese firms now produce three-quarters of the world\u2019s solar panels. Most American and European companies have closed factories, and many have become insolvent. China\u2019s success in producing solar panels has given Beijing a blueprint for seizing the lead in a long list of other high-tech industries.Many foreign companies are caught between China\u2019s industrial ambitions and Washington\u2019s efforts to stop them, including major aerospace companies and carmakers. The conflict may spread: Made in China 2025 could create major competitors to General Electric and Intel, and to companies outside the United States like Siemens and Samsung.Tariffs could hurt such companies if the United States and China follow through on their plans. They also risk losing their competitiveness if Beijing succeeds in subsidizing the creation of large Chinese rivals in their industries.Boeing, for example, could be hit by American tariffs on civilian aircraft parts it buys from Avic, a state-controlled Chinese military and aviation company \u2014 required purchases if the company, which is based in Chicago, wants to sell planes in China. China, in turn, is pushing a consortium that includes Avic to become a Boeing rival. Boeing, like other multinational companies, has refrained from endorsing or criticizing the tariffs.\u201cAlthough our members are unhappy with retaliatory tariffs being used,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, \u201cthere is a belief that greater pressure has to be brought to bear on China.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

Ms. Wong suggests starting by tracking your spending right down to your 3 p.m. vending machine run. \u201cThis is such an eye-opening exercise because it forces you to think about your spending a little bit more, which then makes you more aware of how you\u2019re spending,\u201d Ms. Wong explained. \u201cWriting down your spending gives the transaction a sense of tangibility.\u201dMs. Schlesinger organizes some basic goals into what she calls the \u201choly grail\u201d of financial security. \u201cPeople have three big priorities in life,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey want to be consumer debt-free. They want to have an emergency reserve fund, like 6-12 months of your expenses sitting in some boring account. [And] they want to maximize their retirement account.\u201d Once you have those figured out \u2014 or a plan for how to get there \u2014 the real fun begins.\u201cUsing life events as a prompt is a great idea,\u201d Ms. Schlesinger said. \u201cMaybe you and your spouse look at finances differently. A financial adviser can act as a mediator. Because money can be so emotional, bringing in someone else can help bridge the gap.\u201dLife events like graduating from college, getting married and buying property, are all great times to start thinking about your financial future, but there is no wrong time. \u201cMy mantra is that it\u2019s never too early to find the services you need and to take advantage of that knowledge,\u201d Mr. Brown said.While the average person can probably pay down credit cards, set up a Roth IRA and do some basic investing online, professionals can help streamline the nuances of financial planning.\u201cI liken it to WebMD. You can look up symptoms, but there\u2019s a limit to what you can do with that information,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cFinance is the same way \u2014 you can find a lot of things on your own, but you need that deep knowledge.\u201dLess concretely, you also want to feel comfortable with your financial adviser. Mr. Brown likened a financial adviser to a family doctor \u2014 someone who will be with you over the long haul. Find someone with whom you can let all of your finances hang out. After all, brutal honesty is in your best interest.\u201cWith each event, things change. Finances change,\u201d Mrs. Collado said. It\u2019s important that your adviser remain flexible to revisiting your plan when and if your life circumstances change. Once you tweak that plan, it could require a reroute. \u201cMaybe you had built up emergency savings and then there was an emergency, so you needed to deplete those funds,\u201d Mrs. Collado said. \u201cWe would then reroute what was going to 401(k) savings or investment accounts back to the emergency funds to replenish.\u201dFinancial health \u2014 just like the physical or mental kind \u2014 takes time and effort. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen overnight. You don\u2019t have to understand everything about personal finance at once,\u201d Ms. Wong said. \u201cStart with one thing and focus on feeling good and confident with that one thing, even if it\u2019s paying an extra $10 a month toward your debt, or learning to say no to an impulsive purchase.

{"Headline": "How a Liberal Dissident Became a Far-Right Hero, in Hungary and Beyond", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUDAPEST \u2014 During the final days of communism in Hungary, a young, liberal dissident wrote to a foundation run by the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, asking for a grant to finance his research into grass-roots democracy.Hungary would soon \u201ctransition from dictatorship to democracy,\u201d the student wrote in 1988. \u201cOne of the main elements of this transition can be the rebirth of civil society.\u201dEach country has its own story. But societies across Central and Eastern Europe are dominated by similar figures \u2014 some by politicians who, like Mr. Orban, have lost interest in the liberal democratic project that followed the crumbling of communism in 1989, and others by those with different motivations who have exploited voters\u2019 growing disaffection with liberalism.Personal freedoms and wealth did increase, but the chaotic nature of the process, compounded by the global financial crisis in 2008, meant that expectations often outpaced progress. In some countries, the privatization of state assets was perceived as benefiting foreign investors and corrupt politicians more often than it did ordinary citizens.\u201cKaczynski is a master of playing on bad emotions,\u201d said Radoslaw Sikorski, who was foreign minister and speaker of the Polish Parliament during the government that preceded Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s.But no one exemplifies the angry direction of post-communist Eastern Europe more than Viktor Orban, whose journey from liberal academic to illiberal populist is starker than any of his regional contemporaries. He used the Soros grant to study the history of civil society at Oxford University, fought communism as a dissident from behind the Iron Curtain and then, as a center-right politician, helped to steer Hungary into the European Union and NATO.\u201cThe worst nightmare, in terms of Orban-ism spreading, has come true,\u201d said Gerald Knaus, the director of the European Stability Initiative, a Berlin-based research group.The young Mr. Orban was a passionate dissident, famous for a 1988 speech in which he demanded that Soviet troops leave Hungarian soil. At another rally, Mr. Orban risked his life to protect another opposition leader, Gaspar Miklos Tamas, taking several blows to his head as he thrust himself between the police and Mr. Tamas.He gave little hint of his future trajectory \u2014 save a cameo role in a student production of the German Absurdist drama \u201cHow Mr. Mockinpott Was Cured of His Sufferings\u201d, in which he played a demagogue.\u201cIt was not his aim to be a politician,\u201d said Gabor Fodor, Mr. Orban\u2019s former roommate and best friend. \u201cHe wanted to be an intellectual and to be a member of Hungarian intellectual circles.\u201dThat all began to shift in 1990, with the approach of Hungary\u2019s first democratic elections in half a century. Mr. Orban had co-founded a liberal youth group, Fidesz, that was reconstituted as a political party and won 22 seats in the new Parliament.Appointed as the party\u2019s leader, Mr. Orban spoke out against nationalism, defended civil society and opposed clerical influence in politics. But behind the scenes, his political ideology was beginning to morph \u2014 and he was beginning to exert greater control on the management of Fidesz.By 1993, Mr. Orban had assumed overall leadership of Fidesz, redefined it as a more nationalist and centrist party and ruthlessly sidelined its liberal faction, headed by his now former friend, Gabor Fodor.Quite why Mr. Orban changed is a matter of debate. Some contemporaries believe it was the genuine ideological shift of a young man whose politics were a work in progress. Others argue he grew resentful of cosmopolitan liberals.But most feel that Mr. Orban\u2019s transition was a pragmatic response to the landscape of Hungarian politics. Overshadowed by other left-of-center parties, Fidesz lacked a clear brand. By tacking toward the political center, Mr. Orban reckoned that his party could stand out.Unlike most other Hungarian politicians of the time, Mr. Orban \u201cthought about politics in a more professional way,\u201d said Zsuzsanna Szelenyi, one of the Fidesz lawmakers sidelined by Mr. Orban in 1993. \u201cHe realized it was about power.\u201dDespite Mr. Orban\u2019s machinations, Fidesz did poorly in the 1994 elections. He responded by shifting further to the right, turning Fidesz into a center-right Christian democratic party \u2014 one still open to Western and American ideals.\u201cThe 1990s were wonderful for American diplomats,\u201d said Donald Blinken, who, as the American ambassador to Hungary from 1994 to 1997, lunched annually with Mr. Orban. \u201cEveryone loved us, the Cold War was won, and we thought it was this great period of peace and prosperity.\u201dBut Mr. Orban kept growing more nationalistic \u2014 and, apparently, more religious.Married in a civil wedding a decade earlier, Mr. Orban and his wife, Aniko Levai, renewed their vows in a religious ceremony in 1996. Gabor Ivanyi, the pastor who performed that second ceremony, has since become skeptical of Mr. Orban\u2019s motivations. \u201cHe had to convince people, to win over the conservative right,\u201d Mr. Ivanyi said. \u201cHe is an unscrupulous person.\u201dMr. Orban finally assumed power in 1998, becoming prime minister for the first time at the head of a conservative coalition. (Voters were angered by the Socialist-led government\u2019s handling of the struggling economy.)For the next four years, Mr. Orban operated as a relatively orthodox center-right politician. His administration was tainted by minor corruption scandals, but his performance was mostly praised.He brought Hungary to the brink of European Union membership and shepherded the country into NATO, an event he celebrated with a private dinner in Brussels attended by several of his mentors, including Zbigniew Pelczynski, his politics professor at Oxford.It was his defeat in the 2002 elections that accelerated his pivot to the far right.\u201cThey say that power spoils good politicians,\u201d said Jozsef Debreczeni, an adviser to Mr. Orban after his first rightward turn \u2014 and later his biographer. \u201cWith Orban that wasn\u2019t the case. It was the loss of power that did that.\u201dDuring an intense one-and-a-half days after the election, Mr. Debreczeni listened as Mr. Orban blamed his political demise on a partisan news media that needed to be reined in.Mr. Debreczeni said that Mr. Orban had drawn one conclusion: \u201cThis democracy thing, where power can slip so quickly from you, was no good.\u201d\u201cAnd from that point on,\u201d Mr. Debreczeni added, \u201che spent his time preparing so that if he ever won power again, he wouldn\u2019t lose it.\u201dThe global financial crisis of 2008, coupled with increasing resentment of the Socialist-led government, eventually gave Mr. Orban that chance. The Socialists, who were also in power during the economic turmoil of the 1990s, were accused of squandering the political and economic potential of the transition from communism.Mr. Orban reinvented himself as an outsider who promised to restore Hungarian control to an economy buffeted by external forces \u2014 a popular policy among Hungarians rankled by how privatization efforts after 1989 had allowed foreigners to take over parts of Hungarian industry.\u201cTo understand the Orban phenomenon, you have to go back to 1989,\u201d said Laszlo Andor, who was once Hungary\u2019s most senior representative at the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm. \u201cPeople\u2019s ambitions were not fulfilled.\u201dMr. Orban sees all this as nothing less than the march of history.Benjamin Novak contributed reporting from Budapest, and Palko Karasz from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macron Had a Big Plan for Europe. It\u2019s Now Falling Apart.", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd for fans of Europe, that\u2019s too bad.The window for meaningful changes is rapidly closing before next year\u2019s elections for a new European Parliament, and the choices of a new European Commission, European Commission president and head of the European Central Bank. Projects and legislation not approved by June or by latest October will fall by the wayside until 2020.It would be a shame to miss this chance, said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cIt is urgent, a window of opportunity between now and European elections is real but narrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe constellation of the most centrist German chancellor in a long time in her last term looking for her legacy and a French president, newly elected on a European platform and highly ambitious, is very rare.\u201d\u201cIf you think European reform can happen outside a crisis, you\u2019ll never get a better constellation than now,\u201d he added.If populism and nationalism surged with the impact of the financial crisis, Mr. Macron argues, the best answer is a more integrated European Union that protects and benefits its citizens and a more sustainable eurozone, with its own budget, banking protections and financial management.\u201cIt\u2019s getting hard politically, it\u2019s getting hard timewise, and it\u2019s getting hard in terms of momentum,\u201d said Jean Pisani-Ferry, a French economist and former adviser to Mr. Macron. \u201cNot only for the countries with no appetite for it, but for Germany, too.\u201dIn Germany, new ministers are still figuring out their jobs, Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing Christian Democrats are running to the right and the Social Democrats, the center-left party in the coalition, have silenced their most prominent pro-European voices.Christian Democratic lawmakers have been pushing to anchor any financial overhaul to a treaty change, which in turn would require approval from individual parliaments, creating considerably more uncertainty and delay.In a joint news conference on Thursday in Berlin, Ms. Merkel promised Mr. Macron some form of compromise over how to reinforce the euro and the eurozone\u2019s banks.\u201cThere are of course always different starting points when it comes to the opinions of Germany and France,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need open debates and in the end we need the ability to compromise.\u201dBut compromise will mean minor changes, and almost surely on German terms.Nouriel Roubini, a globe-trotting economist who predicted the crash of a decade ago, said that the fundamental problems of the euro \u201cwon\u2019t be solved until you have real fiscal and then political union. But for now, it\u2019s stalled, and the Germans will see the Italian risks as another reason not to move forward.\u201dThe Germans are \u201cworried as ever that risk sharing becomes risk shifting, that a fiscal union becomes a transfer union,\u201d he said.Until eurozone countries like France, Greece, Italy and Portugal \u201chave done enough fiscal austerity so that public debt is sustainable, and do enough reform so that their potential growth approaches that of Germany,\u201d Berlin will hesitate, he added.At the same time, Mr. Roubini said, Mr. Macron has made some important fixes in France, increasing market flexibility, taxing some pensions and cutting the budget deficit.\u201cSo he can tell the Germans that \u2018it\u2019s not only cheap talk I\u2019m delivering, and while you may not be able to accept full range of reforms, we can meet somewhere in the middle,\u2019\u201d Mr. Roubini said.Macron proposals like a eurozone finance minister and a budget, to help countries deal with high unemployment or economic shocks, have been put aside while the bloc tries to make a few less spectacular and more technocratic fixes.Given timing, the European Commission has narrowed its focus, said Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner in charge of the euro and financial stability. \u201cWe need to strengthen the resilience of the eurozone economy and its shock-absorption tools,\u201d he said in an interview.That means, he said, concentrating on promoting structural reforms in member states, completing a banking union and turning the European Stability Mechanism, created during the Greek debt crisis, into a more competent European Monetary Fund.The idea is to protect eurozone countries and their banks from another crisis. But there are concerns about the governance of the new fund, about how much money would be involved and about how non-eurozone members would contribute.There are also worries about the amount of nonperforming loans still held by banks in countries like Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Portugal, as well as the amount of sovereign debt they hold, given the lesson of the euro crisis that sovereign bonds are hardly risk-free.So Germany and northern countries in particular are pressing for more \u201crisk reduction\u201d before \u201crisk sharing,\u201d Mr. Dombrovskis said.That means that another key change intended to reassure citizens \u2014 a European banking deposit insurance scheme, like one in the United States \u2014 is unlikely to happen soon.Instead, Mr. Dombrovskis said he hoped for gradual progress, increasing bank liquidity first before moving toward mutualization of debts, which remains a red line for Berlin.\u201cBut we need to move during this mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must agree not to lose another year.\u201d Given the populist surge, \u201cWe need Europeans to feel these positive economic figures in their pocketbooks, to show people that they are better off with Europe than without.\u201dBut risks increase over time, with growth due to slow in the medium term, Brexit unresolved, Italy confusing and a possible trade war in the offing, noted Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the Eurasia Group. \u201cMarkets remain complacent for now, but it will not last forever,\u201d he said.Jyrki Katainen, the European commissioner for jobs and growth, said in an interview that \u201cthe main issue is trust among member states, which is not as good as it should be.\u201dRather than a Macronian revolution, he urged evolution, and a road map for the next five or 10 years. \u201cA longer perspective would help trust, with steps made conditional, so it\u2019s not unbalanced,\u201d he said.Heidi Crebo-Rediker, who was the State Department\u2019s first chief economist, said she foresaw a slow process. \u201cUntil you have confidence in all the banking systems, including Italy, and an agreement that risks can now be managed centrally, only then you take that final step forward,\u201d she said.\u201cBut just when you have the potential to move forward in France and Germany, there\u2019s the potential for a real scare from the south, from Italy,\u201d she added. \u201cSo even slow progress is now under threat.\u201dMr. Katainen, a Finnish former prime minister, still sees progress coming from Paris and Berlin.\u201cMacron and Merkel get along well, respect one another, are both pro-European and ambitious,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth want to leave a mark on Europe. I see Macron as pragmatic, setting his priorities for the future, but it doesn\u2019t mean every detail must be done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkish Secret Agents Seized 80 People in 18 Countries, Official Says", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurkish secret agents in 18 countries have seized 80 Turks suspected of having links to a group accused of plotting a coup in 2016 and returned them to Turkey, a senior government official said Thursday.Bekir Bozdag, the deputy prime minister, hinted at audacious actions by Turkish intelligence operatives abroad under the increasingly authoritarian government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The scope of the arrests conjured up analogies to the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s covert seizures and imprisonments of suspects after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Speaking in a Turkish television interview, Mr. Bozdag did not specify how precisely such arrests had been carried out. Nor did he disclose where the suspects had been detained, except for the arrests that had been made public in Bulgaria, Malaysia and Kosovo. There have been unconfirmed reports in the Turkish press of arrests in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan.A spokesman for Mr. Erdogan, Ibrahim Kalin, said later that the arrests and extraditions had been handled legally and that Turkey intended to carry out more.The Turkish officials said all of those arrested had been linked to Fethullah Gulen, the reclusive Turkish Islamic cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. A former ally of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s and now one of the president\u2019s biggest critics, Mr. Gulen has been accused by the Turkish government of orchestrating the coup attempt on July 15, 2016. Mr. Gulen and his organization have denied any role.Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly pressed the United States to extradite Mr. Gulen, who has been called a terrorist by Turkey\u2019s government. Turkish officials refer to his organization by the acronym FETO, which stands for \u201cFethullah Terror Group.\u201dMr. Bozdag told the Haberturk television news channel that as of Thursday, Turkish intelligence agents had \u201cbundled up and brought back 80 FETO members in 18 countries.\u201dMr. Gulen\u2019s organization in the United States, the Alliance for Shared Values, said Mr. Bozdag\u2019s remarks were a \u201cblatant admission\u201d of what it called international lawbreaking and contempt for national sovereignty.\u201cRather than being ashamed of such operations, they are boasting about them,\u201d Alp Aslandogan, the organization\u2019s executive director, said in response to queries by The New York Times.\u201cWhile we are not surprised by such announcements by the Erdogan regime,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat really matters is whether sovereign states will allow these operations on their soil and bend to the demands of an authoritarian Turkish ruler.\u201dMr. Bozdag spoke less than a week after the arrests and deportations of six Turkish citizens from Kosovo, an action that Turkey said had been carried out by the authorities in Kosovo at its request. The six included teachers at schools financed by Mr. Gulen\u2019s organization.President Erdogan\u2019s spokesman cited those arrests on Thursday as an example of foreign cooperation with Turkey\u2019s campaign against Mr. Gulen\u2019s associates. But the arrests have caused a political tempest in Kosovo and have been criticized by human rights groups.Kosovo\u2019s prime minister, Ramush Haradinaj, called the arrests a mistake and has ordered an investigation. Last Friday he dismissed his interior minister and the head of the secret service for failing to inform him of the arrests ahead of time.Mr. Erdogan has insisted that Mr. Gulen and his supporters were behind the coup attempt, which had support from some in the military and was the most traumatic crisis in the country in many years. More than 250 civilians were killed and hundreds were wounded. Jets bombed the Parliament building in the capital Ankara and tanks crushed civilians who protested.His subordinates have purged tens of thousands of people suspected of disloyalty from the government and the military, and thousands more have been arrested and charged with supporting terrorism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Criticizes OPEC, Calling Oil Prices \u2018Artificially\u2019 High", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries makes an easy scapegoat for American politicians. It has been a target of derision by American leaders since the Arab oil embargo of 1973 caused long lines at the pump and badly damaged the economy.But OPEC doesn\u2019t have the same influence it once did, given soaring production in the United States, Canada and a few other countries. Now it is just one factor in lifting prices, which are being affected by everything from geopolitics to the growing demand for gasoline and diesel fuel.Mr. Trump could have been referring to OPEC\u2019s cutback in exports to increase prices. Saudi Arabia and other oil producers in the region have also made an alliance of convenience with Russia, a non-OPEC member heavily dependent on oil revenues to finance its government. Together they have restrained production since 2016, reducing global stockpiles.\u201cPrices are high,\u201d said Rob West, an analyst at Redburn, a London research firm. Noting that Mr. Trump may have a point, he added, \u201cI do see some artificiality in the prices we see today.\u201dOPEC and non-OPEC producers gathered Friday in the Saudi city of Jidda in an effort to continue the policy even as the price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, has climbed above $70.Not long ago, as prices plummeted from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in early 2016, inventories were so high that tankers were needed to hold excess supplies. Now, even as United States oil production continues to grow, worldwide inventories are declining, increasing the pressure on prices. The International Energy Agency reported that global oil supply eased by 120,000 barrels a day in March.The price of crude is the major reason American drivers are paying more at the pump as the summer driving season approaches. The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $2.75 a gallon, according to AAA, up 19 cents over the last month and 33 cents from a year ago. It is the highest level since the summer of 2015.The increase has been particularly noticeable over the last week, with prices in some states rising more than a penny a gallon every day.Americans consume roughly 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so the 33-cent increase over the last year means roughly $132 million less every day in consumer pockets. Working-class Americans, who usually drive older, less fuel-efficient cars and spend a higher percentage of their income on fuel, are disproportionately affected.\u201cThis hurts the pocketbooks of typical Trump voters in swing states who live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. He predicted gas prices would continue to increase modestly, probably rising above $2.80 a gallon in the coming weeks.Deutsche Bank analysts warned this week that the rise in gas prices was beginning to cut into the disposable-income gains from the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law late last year.Much of the recent price increase is a result of world tensions \u2014 some related to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 that have bolstered investor expectations that oil prices could rise even higher.Oil production is plummeting in Venezuela, the country with the largest reserves, and the expectation of stepped-up American sanctions in the coming months could reduce its exports further. The threat that the United States could pull out of the nuclear deal with Iran has put the size of future Iranian exports in doubt.A doubling of American oil production in recent years, producing growing exports and a decline in imports, has helped stabilize the oil market and kept big price rises in check. But United States output represents only a bit more than 10 percent of the 98 million barrels a day produced worldwide, and there are limits to its growth.A shortage of oil and natural-gas pipelines in Texas could slow output over the next two years. In addition, American refineries, generally designed for heavier crudes, are reaching a saturation point for lighter shale oil produced around Texas and North Dakota.Still, there is no doubt that the orchestrated output curbs led by major producers have had an effect. It is not clear whether the agreement will be extended beyond the end of the year, but the Saudis appear to favor doing so.An earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, a recent increase in gasoline prices. They have risen 33 cents in the last year, not the last month.Stanley Reed and Prashant S. Rao contributed reporting from London, and Jim Tankersley from Washington.Advertisement"}

President Trump\u2019s narrow victory appears to have been fashioned, at least in part, by a covert appeal to the insecurity, religious fervor or racism of voters willing to rely on social media for information about the world.Those who financed and carried out this ugly propaganda campaign were careful to avoid having their names associated with such lies and distortions.

The challenge now is to get the word out to those influenced by Cambridge Analytica.STEPHEN DYCUS, NEW YORKTo the Editor:The left and the liberal media are up to their old tricks, this time using the Cambridge Analytica imbroglio to once again advance the narrative that Donald Trump cheated and didn\u2019t win fair and square, and in essence \u201cstole\u201d the election from Hillary Clinton by using Cambridge\u2019s capabilities to surgically target individual voters and \u201cbrainwash\u201d them into voting against her. It\u2019s getting silly now.This is just the latest denigration of Trump voters, who have been repeatedly maligned as ignorant and unsophisticated. Why is it so hard for those on the left to accept the simple fact that people voted for Donald Trump of their own free will, because they wanted someone and something different in Washington? They weren\u2019t bullied into doing so by their husbands, sons or bosses, and they weren\u2019t brainwashed into doing so by Cambridge, Facebook and the Russians.Hillary Clinton lost because she was a flawed candidate with flawed ethics and flawed judgment who ran a flawed campaign.

{"Headline": "Independent New York Prosecutors Pose Potential Risk for Trump", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFaced with a sprawling investigation by the special counsel in Washington, President Trump must also contend with an independent-minded office of federal prosecutors in his hometown, New York, who are investigating his longtime personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen.Mr. Trump\u2019s administration had fired the Obama-era leader of the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York last year, after initially asking him to stay on. Earlier this year, the administration installed a Republican former prosecutor and party donor, Geoffrey S. Berman, after Mr. Trump made an unusual request to interview him personally.Soon after assuming the Southern District post in January, Mr. Berman notified Justice Department officials in Washington of a possible appearance of conflict of interest in the then-undisclosed Cohen investigation, and officials concluded that he should be recused, according to people briefed on the matter.With potential campaign finance law violations under scrutiny, one person said, the Cohen investigation was assigned to career prosecutors in the office\u2019s elite public corruption unit, which has a track record of convicting politicians on both sides of the aisle.On Monday, the prosecutors in the case will be back in court as a federal judge weighs a request by Mr. Cohen to keep investigators from reviewing the materials they gathered during searches of his office, home and hotel room as part of the inquiry.It is one of the most consequential corruption inquiries in a generation, notable even by the standards of the Southern District office, which has never been shy about reaching far beyond Manhattan to find headline-grabbing cases. And the office\u2019s longstanding reputation for nonpartisanship and autonomy \u2014 it is jokingly referred to as the \u201cSovereign District\u201d \u2014 could make it less vulnerable to attacks from either the president\u2019s allies or his critics.\u201cThe office has been historically known for its independence of the Justice Department,\u201d said John S. Martin Jr., a former United States attorney in Manhattan and former federal judge. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so powerful in this investigation, and such a danger to Donald Trump.\u201dPresident Trump has called the F.B.I. raid \u201ca disgraceful situation\u201d and a \u201ctotal witch hunt.\u201dThe materials seized from Mr. Cohen could open a window into the president\u2019s relationship with a loyal aide who guided Mr. Trump through not only business dilemmas but personal and political ones as well. That includes Mr. Cohen\u2019s role in helping to arrange payments during the campaign to women who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump.In federal court hearings in Manhattan on Friday, lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump argued that many of the records seized by the F.B.I. were protected by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Cohen has asked for an order temporarily prohibiting prosecutors from reading the documents until the matter could be litigated.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, has said the search was \u201ccompletely inappropriate and unnecessary.\u201d A spokesman for the United States attorney for the Southern District declined to comment.Mr. Berman is not known to have any connection to Mr. Cohen. A former Southern District prosecutor, Mr. Berman is a registered Republican, donated $2,700 to the Trump campaign and did some part-time volunteer work for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team.Although Mr. Berman had been law partners with Rudolph W. Giuliani, another former Southern District United States attorney and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters, that connection was not a factor in the recusal, according to the people briefed on the matter.Also not a factor in the recusal, one person said, was the personal interview that Mr. Trump conducted with Mr. Berman last year as part of the selection process. Mr. Berman has not disclosed publicly details of any such meeting.With Mr. Berman sidelined, Mr. Khuzami assumed responsibility for the Cohen investigation. Mr. Khuzami is in his second stint in the office, having made a name for himself as a terrorism and financial crimes prosecutor from 1990 to 2002.He helped secure the conviction of Omar Abdel Rahman, who conspired to blow up New York City landmarks. As an outgrowth of that case, he worked on the investigation of Mr. Abdel Rahman\u2019s lawyer, Lynne Stewart, who had her office and files searched by federal authorities.After leaving the Southern District, Mr. Khuzami joined Deutsche Bank, where he ultimately became general counsel for the firm\u2019s American arm. But his role as a terrorism prosecutor arose again when he was asked to give the 2004 speech at the Republican National Convention, in which he staunchly defended the Patriot Act and credited President Bush with having \u201cthe courage and the wisdom\u201d to seek its passage.Mr. Khuzami, who grew up in Rochester, is registered as \u201cnonpartisan.\u201d His friends have teased him about his speech, expressing disbelief that he would participate in the convention even though he is not a Republican. Mr. Khuzami responded that he had actually edited out other comments in his speech praising President Bush.Mr. Khuzami made a donation to John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign in 2007. He also donated to the campaign of John Anderson, who ran for president in 1980 as an independent against Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.\u201cHe\u2019s apolitical, a consummate public servant who plays by the rules,\u201d said Richard Walker, a partner at King & Spalding who was Mr. Khuzami\u2019s boss at Deutsche Bank and is a former S.E.C. enforcement chief himself.Mr. Khuzami\u2019s experience at Deutsche Bank, President Trump\u2019s largest lender on Wall Street, has generated some blowback from liberal commentators, but that could bolster his credibility with conservatives. Steven M. Cohen, a former Southern District prosecutor who later became the top aide to New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, recalled watching Rachel Maddow, the MSNBC host, lament Mr. Berman\u2019s and Mr. Khuzami\u2019s ties to Deutsche Bank. Recalling the show, Mr. Cohen said it made him think: \u201cGood lord, he has just been inoculated.\u201d\u201cPresident Trump now has real legal peril\u201d because of the Southern District inquiry, Mr. McCarthy declared. \u201cAnyone potentially connected to it should be worried,\u201d he added.The investigation is not Mr. Khuzami\u2019s first politically sensitive matter. While at the S.E.C. in 2010, he approved an action against Steven Rattner, a well-connected financier who led the Obama administration\u2019s auto industry overhaul.And in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when the S.E.C. was under fire for not detecting the Madoff scheme, Mr. Khuzami shook up the enforcement division and filed a record number of actions, many of them against companies at the center of the crisis, including Goldman Sachs.\u201cWe handled lots of politically sensitive cases together at the S.E.C., and my experience is he\u2019ll make the right decision based on the right standard for the right reason,\u201d said Lorin Reisner, who was Mr. Khuzami\u2019s deputy at the S.E.C. and later became the head of the criminal division in the Southern District. \u201cHe\u2019s an on-the-merits leader,\u201d said Mr. Reisner, now a partner at Paul Weiss in New York.But Mr. Khuzami also handed out awards to officials who spent years building potentially big cases that they then chose not to file for lack of evidence \u2014 sending a message that the agency should not bend to public and political pressure to punish unpopular figures on Wall Street, according to current and former officials. As a result, the agency faced criticism from the left for not charging top Wall Street executives after the crisis. Much to the dismay of critics of Wall Street and even the agency\u2019s chairwoman at the time, Mr. Khuzami sided with investigators in New York who were opposed to charging top Lehman Brothers executives. Judge Jed S. Rakoff once called one of the agency\u2019s settlements under Mr. Khuzami \u201cpocket change.\u201dAfter leaving the S.E.C. in early 2013, Mr. Khuzami became a partner at Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, which proved to be a lucrative role. He earned about $11 million over the last two years, a significant sum even by the standards of big law partnership shares.As Mr. Khuzami leads the Cohen investigation, he is being counseled by two senior prosecutors: Audrey Strauss, a prominent New York lawyer whom Mr. Berman brought back to the office as senior counsel; and Lisa Zornberg, the chief of the criminal division.The corruption unit prosecutor who spoke in court on Friday was Thomas McKay, who previously helped prosecute Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican majority leader of the New York State Senate. Also in the courtroom were Tatiana Martins, who heads the corruption unit, and her deputy, Russell Capone.Mr. Bharara, appearing on CNN on Sunday, called the members of the government team professionals \u201cwho do things by the book.\u201dThe court hearings on Friday also underscored the Southern District\u2019s reputation for catapulting its alumni into powerful jobs in government and the defense bar.President Trump\u2019s own lawyer at the hearings, Joanna C. Hendon, once worked as a Southern District prosecutor.Elisa Cho contributed research.Advertisement"}

They persuaded renowned street artists and galleries to donate pieces; they drafted the communication strategy; they designed and built the exhibition space.More than 250 people gathered in the cultural center on March 19 to watch as 65 lots from 55 artists, including Shepard Fairey, Banksy and CLET, were auctioned, with bids starting at 500 euros (about $620).Julien Garcia-Toudic, 22, was among the students charged with collecting the donated street art. \u201cIt can be complicated to ask artists to donate work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as soon as I explained that it was for charity and it would be financing children\u2019s access to art, they were immediately supportive of the cause.\u201dFounded more than 40 years ago, the 6,400-square-foot space provides exhibit-related activities for those \u201cbetween the ages of 3 and 103.\u201d\u201cChildhood is when a lot of core values are formed,\u201d said Ms. Girardet, 67. \u201cWe thought that if we initiated children into the world of art, then as future adults they wouldn\u2019t have this mental block.\u201dChildren are encouraged to study the paintings to see if they can uncover which artist \u201cstole\u201d the palette. At the end of the exhibition, once they have found the culprit, they are given a tube of paint.\u201cYoung parents who came to visit the museum when they were little now come back with their children,\u201d Ms. Girardet said as she watched schoolchildren crowd around the tables in the museum\u2019s atelier. \u201cIt\u2019s touching; it means they remember and they keep fond memories of their time here.\u201dEvery year, she said, the nonprofit museum \u201cstruggles to find a budget for the year ahead.\u201d The annual budget is around \u20ac1 million. About half comes from admissions; grants from City Hall make up a fifth of the budget, and the rest is acquired through sponsors.Nicolas Laugero-Lasserre, 42, the director of the Icart School of Arts and a fan of the philosophy behind the Mus\u00e9e en Herbe, suggested having his students organize an auction for the museum.\u201cThree years ago, I decided I wanted the students to really experience how the art market works,\u201d Mr. Laugero-Lasserre said at the exhibition before the auction. \u201cThen I thought, why not raise money for a good cause? The Mus\u00e9e en Herbe is like a paradise for children, open to everyone and breaking social barriers.\u201dThis year, Ms. Girardet announced that the students raised \u20ac90,750; she was greeted with loud cheering and clapping. The museum will use part of the funds for its next exhibition on the monsters of Japanese manga comic books and their influence on contemporary artists in Japan.Charley Uzzell Edwards, a street artist known as Pure Evil who is based in London, donated two original pieces. One sold for \u20ac4,000, and the other, painted live at the auction, sold for \u20ac3,000.\u201cIt\u2019s awesome that they have [the Mus\u00e9e en Herbe] set up to cater to children and get them inspired,\u201d he said. \u201cI think for a lot of kids, street art is their art.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Smelling Blood, Democrats Swarm New York House Race", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCALLICOON, N.Y. \u2014 Across New York\u2019s Hudson Valley and points west, a sprawling demographic and cultural hodgepodge has emerged as a key battleground for the Democratic Party in its hope to flip the House of Representatives in November\u2019s midterm elections.More than $6 million has already poured into the race for the 19th Congressional District from Democratic donors. The only problem is that the Democrats have yet to settle on a candidate, and there are seven contenders, including two lawyers, a businessman and a former C.I.A. official.\u201cI\u2019m staying neutral,\u201d said Keith Kanaga, chairman of the Columbia County Democratic Committee. \u201cPart of the thing we are all grappling with is that we like them all. But who will the general voter like the best? That\u2019s turning out to be a hard question to answer. They are all attractive in different ways.\u201dVoters here favored President Barack Obama in 2012, but then sided with Donald J. Trump in 2016. A Democrat held a House seat here as recently in 2010, but the last four elections have gone to Republicans, most recently John J. Faso, in 2016.Only one of Mr. Faso\u2019s Democratic challengers can claim government experience in New York; that candidate, Gareth Rhodes, who worked for the Cuomo administration, has sought to differentiate himself in a shoe-leather sort of way \u2014 or, more accurately, a tire-tread way.Mr. Rhodes, 29, has set out to visit all 163 towns in a congressional district larger than Connecticut and Delaware combined, buying a Winnebago for the tour of an area that contains pristine horse farms and rod-and-gun clubs, art galleries and monster-truck shows.Along with the pledge to visit every town is another campaign gimmick that Mr. Rhodes hopes will resonate in a district where the median household income is about $55,000. Wherever he goes, he asks for a donation of $19 (for the 19th District), an amount that he believes demonstrates support without straining wallets.Mr. Rhodes is toward the back of the fund-raising pack, however. Occupying the lead in that race, according to campaign filings through the end of March, are Antonio Delgado, a former Rhodes scholar who lives in Rhinebeck and practices law in New York City, with $1.9 million, and Brian Flynn, an entrepreneur who became an activist after his brother was killed aboard Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, with $1.4 million.Patrick Ryan, a Kingston native, Iraq War veteran and small-business owner, had raised $1.3 million; David Clegg, a trial lawyer from Woodstock and member of several social-justice organizations, $650,000; and Jeff Beals, also of Woodstock, a high school teacher who was a C.I.A. intelligence officer and later a diplomat, $261,000. Mr. Rhodes\u2019s year-end total was $450,000; his current total of $685,000, he said, includes the highest portion of small donations.The lone woman in the race, Erin Collier of Cooperstown, who worked as an agricultural economist under President Obama, was a late entrant, so her fund-raising totals were not reflected in the last filing with the Federal Election Commission.Steven Greenberg, a pollster with the Siena College Research Institute, said that once the Democratic candidate emerged in the June 26 primary, additional money would pour in.For his part, Mr. Faso defends his record as a freshman congressman, saying he has helped struggling dairy farmers in his district and secured projects and funding that are critical, if not sexy. He cited a hospital generator in Sullivan County and grants for sewer systems, as well as help he provided to individual constituents. \u201cWe fixed a disability claim for a veteran that was pending for 30 years,\u201d he said.As for the issue over which he and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have butted heads, the plan that would have forced the state to pick up counties\u2019 share of Medicaid, Mr. Faso said he stood by the now-defunct legislation.\u201cThe 57 counties outside of New York City spend more on Medicaid costs than the 49 other states combined,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a gigantic problem, which Governor Cuomo prefers not to address.\u201dMr. Faso has tried to strike a balance in his stance on President Trump. And he has sought bipartisan solutions to problems through the House\u2019s Problem Solvers Caucus, which is made up of two dozen Democrats and an equal number of Republicans. \u201cI\u2019ve said clearly when I agree and when I disagree with the president,\u201d he allowed. \u201cThese are contentious and polarized times and I\u2019ve tried to be a voice of reason.\u201dMost recently, in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Faso embraced such gun-control measures as tightening background checks, raising the age to buy a semiautomatic rifle and banning bump stocks.Mr. Rhodes\u2019s position on gun control is significantly tougher than that of Mr. Faso. At a recent meet-and-greet event at a home in this town in northwestern Sullivan County, he laid out a set of measures, including a ban on assault-style weapons like the AR-15, universal background checks and laws on gun storage and safety.As a press aide to Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Rhodes crisscrossed the Hudson Valley in his first job after college. He left government in 2015 to enroll in Harvard Law School, and with only one semester left before graduating, Mr. Rhodes stepped away from Cambridge to run for Congress.It remains to be seen whether his association with the Cuomo administration will help or hurt his candidacy. Four years ago, Mr. Cuomo took a beating in the district, drawing fewer votes than Zephyr Teachout in the Democratic primary and than Rob Astorino in the general election. (In 2016, Ms. Teachout unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Faso.)Still, Mr. Rhodes trumpets his work for Mr. Cuomo, highlighting the agenda he helped promote.\u201cI was part of the administration that said no to fracking, and I\u2019m proud to be from a state that did that,\u201d he said to scattered applause at a recent campaign event here.One resident asked Mr. Rhodes how his policies differed from those of his fellow Democratic challengers. Before he could finish his response, however, another attendee, Bruce Ferguson, who was a leader in the fight against fracking, piped up: \u201cElectability, electability, electability.\u201d\u201cYour work ethic is second to none,\u201d Mr. Ferguson, a leader of a group called Sullivan Alliance for Sustainable Development, said to Mr. Rhodes. \u201cYou are up every morning and hitting the road. It\u2019s the kind of energy we need to win a very tough race.\u201dRegardless of voter turnout in November, Mr. Faso will have the advantage of incumbency, not to mention a campaign war chest \u2014 currently at $1.7 million \u2014 that he can largely conserve until the general election draws closer, unlike his Democratic counterparts still seeking their party\u2019s nod.Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz, counts Mr. Faso as a longtime friend. A lifelong Republican, Professor Benjamin said he was so disturbed by President Trump\u2019s record that he recently dropped his enrollment in the party. Yet he still plans to vote for Mr. Faso. \u201cHe\u2019s deeply experienced, smart and wonky and totally informed on a range of issues,\u201d he said.Mr. Rhodes is nonetheless optimistic that voters will turn against Mr. Faso on issues ranging from health care to gun control, and expects that his own exhaustive tour of the district will win him votes. \u201cThis district is enormous: 7,900 square miles,\u201d he told the small audience here. \u201cI\u2019m doing town-hall meetings. I\u2019m going to diners, just listening. To me, this is important both to win the race, but also to take the voice of this community to Washington.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $76,000 Monthly Pension: Why States and Cities Are Short on Cash", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "Governments are struggling as mounting pension obligations crowd out the rest of their budgets. Oregon faces a severe, self-inflicted crisis.Supported byA public university president in Oregon gives new meaning to the idea of a pensioner.Joseph Robertson, an eye surgeon who retired as head of the Oregon Health & Science University last fall, receives the state\u2019s largest government pension.It is $76,111.Per month.That is considerably more than the average Oregon family earns in a year.Oregon \u2014 like many other states and cities, including New Jersey, Kentucky and Connecticut \u2014 is caught in a fiscal squeeze of its own making. Its economy is growing, but the cost of its state-run pension system is growing faster. More government workers are retiring, including more than 2,000, like Dr. Robertson, who get pensions exceeding $100,000 a year.The state is not the most profligate pension payer in America, but its spiraling costs are notable in part because Oregon enjoys a reputation for fiscal discipline. Its experience shows how faulty financial decisions by states can eventually swamp local communities.Oregon\u2019s costs are inflated by the way in which it calculates pension benefits for public employees. Some of the pensions include income that employees earned on the side. Other retirees benefit from long-ago stock market rallies that inflated the current value of their payouts.For example, the pension for Mike Bellotti, the University of Oregon\u2019s head football coach from 1995 to 2008, includes not just his salary but also money from licensing deals and endorsements that the Ducks\u2019 athletic program generated. Mr. Bellotti\u2019s pension is more than $46,000 a month.The bill is borne by taxpayers. Oregon\u2019s Public Employees Retirement System has told cities, counties, school districts and other local entities to contribute more to keep the system afloat. They can neither negotiate nor raise local taxes fast enough to keep up. As a result, pensions are crowding out other spending. Essential services are slashed.\u201cYou get to the point where you can no longer do more with less \u2014 you just have to do less with less,\u201d said Nathan Cherpeski, the manager of Klamath Falls, a city of about 21,000 in south-central Oregon.Klamath Falls\u2019s most recent biennial bill from the pension system, known as PERS, was $600,000 more than the one before. PERS has warned that the bills will keep rising. Mr. Cherpeski has had to cut back on repairing streets and bridges.Even as the American economy is humming, many states and cities are still hurting from the 2008 financial meltdown. The crash hammered their pension funds and tax revenues, but didn\u2019t reduce the amounts they owe retirees.It wasn\u2019t until 2016 that average state tax collections returned to pre-2008 levels. In the meantime, states and cities have had to rebuild pension funds to cover the rising numbers of retirees drawing benefits. That has left less money for the police, school sports programs and everything else. Local residents might not know why, but they are paying more taxes and getting scantier services in return.Costs are rising even in places that previously acted to defuse the problem. Colorado trimmed pensions in 2010, but a new $32 billion shortfall means more pension cuts and tax increases are likely. Detroit sliced its pension obligations in bankruptcy and persuaded philanthropists to chip in, but it is not clear that the city has an affordable plan.In San Francisco, the school board wants voters to approve a $298 \u201cparcel tax\u201d on real estate, ostensibly to raise $50 million to pay teachers a living wage.\u201cThat\u2019s a worthy objective, but it\u2019s not the real reason,\u201d said David Crane, a former trustee of the California teachers\u2019 pension system. He said the school district\u2019s retirement costs had grown by $50 million over the last five years, devouring resources that would have gone to teachers.Oregon is a blue state, but in its restive red hinterlands, tax increases are politically off limits and financial distress has been severe since 1994, when logging was curtailed to save an endangered owl. Lately, things have been getting even worse.When a man was reported yelling and firing his gun on the property of a school in rural Josephine County, it took two hours for a sheriff\u2019s deputy to arrive, said Kate Dwyer, chairwoman of the board for the Three Rivers School District.The county has cut sheriff patrols, closed its mental health department and kept its jail at less than half capacity because of a lack of guards.Dave Valenzuela, the Three Rivers school superintendent, traces the latest woes directly to PERS. The system is run at the state level, but it is bankrolled in large part by obligatory contributions from local governments.This year, Three Rivers was poised to receive its first increase in state education funding in years, a reflection of growing enrollment. But Oregon raised by more than 50 percent the amount that Three Rivers had to contribute to PERS. So Mr. Valenzuela had to lop five days off the school year, ask each school to cut its budget by 10 percent and lay off the district librarian and English specialist.That includes the state, by far the system\u2019s biggest contributor.Even prosperous communities are being pinched. The Beaverton School District, outside Portland, had to get rid of 75 teachers last year when its mandatory pension contribution rose by $14 million. That was after shedding 340 teachers in 2012.\u201cI have town hall meetings, and the parents are just confounded by this,\u201d said Mark Hass, a Democratic state senator from Beaverton.Oregon\u2019s unusual method for calculating pensions tends to generate lavish payouts.For decades, PERS calculated pensions two different ways, and retirees could choose whichever produced the bigger numbers.The first way was similar to what most states do, basing pensions on each worker\u2019s final salary and years of service. But Oregon\u2019s lawmakers included a golden touch, redefining \u201csalary\u201d to include remuneration from any source.That was how Mr. Bellotti, the former football coach, came to be the state\u2019s third-highest-paid pensioner, at roughly $559,000 a year.Mr. Bellotti said he never asked for a supersize pension. In 1995, he said, the university started to include a percentage of all endorsement and licensing fees in coaches\u2019 salaries.\u201cIt was basically to augment the university\u2019s ability to pay a competitive salary to its coaching staff,\u201d he said.When Mr. Bellotti retired, he was partway through a five-year, $1.9 million-a-year contract, which he said was still below the league average of about $3 million.PERS made up for it with a big pension. \u201cIt was pay later as opposed to paying now,\u201d he said.Dr. Robertson, the former Oregon Health & Science University president, said he had retired and started drawing his pension last fall, after learning he had multiple sclerosis. He said he agreed to stay on through the end of the academic year, without pay, \u201cfor the sake of continuity.\u201dA spokeswoman for the medical center said Dr. Robertson\u2019s pension was based on his salary, incentive payments, clinical pay and unused sick or vacation time.Oregon\u2019s second way of calculating pensions dates back to 1946: For decades, every public worker got a simulated tracking account. It was credited with 6 percent of each paycheck, then left to compound at a predetermined rate.In the early years, a low rate was used because the pension system invested in bonds that didn\u2019t yield much.But in the 1970s, lawmakers started nudging the rate up, eventually to 8 percent. Then, the system\u2019s trustees decided 8 percent should be a guaranteed minimum. In years when markets produced higher returns, the accounts compounded at those rates, after money-management fees. During the 1990s bull market, accounts compounded by up to 21 percent a year.When workers retired, their employers were required to \u201cmatch\u201d the account balances, doubling them. Then PERS would base the pensions on the total.Randall Pozdena, an economist who supervised the pension system\u2019s investments in the 1990s, gave speeches warning that the situation was unsustainable.\u201cThe only way you\u2019re going to get out of this is if the state is hit by a golden asteroid from Planet Tiffany,\u201d he recalled saying.But efforts to change the system, including a 1994 ballot initiative, were blocked by the State Supreme Court, which ruled that accruals could not be reduced during any public worker\u2019s career.So, when lawmakers required government retirees to pay Oregon\u2019s 9 percent income tax, as everybody else did, they also increased pensions by 9.89 percent, giving retirees extra money to pay the tax with.\u201cIt\u2019s an affront to everybody who pays taxes,\u201d said Bruce Dennis, a retired carpenter from outside Portland who earned a $54,000-a-year pension by swinging a hammer for 45 years. No one gives him extra money to cover his taxes.\u201cAt every step of the way, they\u2019ve made decisions that went against the interests of the public,\u201d he said.Starting in 2003, the tracking accounts were phased out. But workers who already had the accounts were allowed to keep them. New hires got a more modest retirement plan.\u201cThe cost of this pension system is not caused by the people we are hiring today,\u201d said Steven Rodeman, executive director of the Public Employees Retirement System. \u201cThis is a legacy problem from the 1980s and 1990s.\u201dFor workers with the tracking accounts, PERS dialed back the annual returns to 8 percent, then to 7.5 percent in 2016. That is still more than what PERS\u2019s investments have generated over the last decade. And so the pension fund\u2019s financial hole continues to deepen.Across Oregon, local officials have been told to brace for 15 to 20 more years of rising pension bills. That\u2019s when the current generation of retirees will start dying out.\u201cAll we can do is wait,\u201d said Jay Meredith, finance director of Grants Pass, the seat of Josephine County.In the meantime, mounting pension costs mean that a generation of schoolchildren is growing up in the area with no theater program, no orchestra, no wood shop and minimal sports, chorus and art.That\u2019s if they can get to school.A county road recently washed out, stranding 300 people. Ms. Dwyer, of the Three Rivers School District, reported the problem to a public-works official.She recalled his response: \u201cI have trucks, but I can\u2019t put gas in them to come to you and dig it out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Colleges Dance Around Travel Bans, With the Help of Their Lawyers", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN ANTONIO \u2014 This year\u2019s men\u2019s Final Four seemed to go off without a hitch. All of its participants \u2014 Villanova, Kansas, Michigan and Loyola-Chicago \u2014 made it to Texas without trouble. Trading the cold and rain of their campuses for the warm Texas sun probably did not bother any of them.The reason is that several states have enacted laws banning state-funded travel to certain other states because of legal climates seen as discriminatory, including those related to so-called religious freedom or bathroom bills. The states most commonly the focus of the roughly half-dozen bans are North Carolina and Mississippi. California has a law prohibiting taxpayer-funded travel to eight states, including several that frequently host college championship events: not only North Carolina, but also Kansas, Kentucky, Tennessee \u2014 and Texas.In essence, and with several exceptions, the California law bans the use of state money to pay for travel to those states, a prohibition that generally applies to California\u2019s numerous public universities, including, arguably, their sports teams.Still, San Diego State\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team did, in fact, travel to Kansas last month to play on the tournament\u2019s first weekend (the Aztecs lost to Houston in the first round in Wichita). And last year, U.C.L.A. played in the second weekend of the tournament in Memphis.California\u2019s public university teams have felt compelled to devise legal workarounds. The men\u2019s basketball committee, which selected the 36 teams that received at-large bids to the N.C.A.A. tournament and seeded all 68 in the field, disregarded state travel bans, said its chairman, Bruce Rasmussen, the Creighton athletic director.\u201cWe, unfortunately, do not control where we play in the tournament, and we will not deny our student-athletes the opportunity for postseason play,\u201d Shana Wilson, a senior associate athletic director for U.C.L.A., wrote in an email. She confirmed that last year, U.C.L.A. used revenue generated by the athletic department \u2014 sources like ticket sales, donations and sponsorships, but not direct state funding \u2014 to pay for the Bruins\u2019 trip to Memphis.San Diego State, which is in the California State University system, used revenue from donations to finance the basketball team\u2019s trip to Kansas in March, as well as its football team\u2019s trip to Fort Worth to play Army in the Armed Forces Bowl last December, said Chuck Lang, a senior associate athletic director.\u201cWe avoid going to them as much as possible,\u201d said Lang, referring to the eight banned states.San Diego State does not schedule nonconference road competitions against teams in those states, though Lang said other Aztecs squads had traveled to them \u201cbecause we had to\u201d for other N.C.A.A. championship events.Some opponents of the laws that the travel bans were meant to challenge remain uneasy about such accommodations, saying they circumvent the bans\u2019 spirit, if not their letter.\u201cWe would prefer that in states that have active travel bans, that organizations and agencies in those states honor those bans,\u201d said Thomas Witt, the executive director of Equality Kansas, an L.G.B.T. advocacy group.Kansas showed up on California\u2019s list after its state government passed a law in 2016 that permitted groups on Kansas campuses to turn away prospective members who did not share their religious beliefs. Supporters of that law say it protects religious freedom; detractors like Witt say it inappropriately allows state-financed groups to discriminate.It is debatable whether California\u2019s travel ban applies to sports teams\u2019 travel to N.C.A.A. championship events like the men\u2019s basketball tournament. The law lists several exceptions under which state funds can be used to travel to those states, including for litigation or to comply with a federal request to appear before a committee. One of the exceptions is \u201cto meet contractual obligations incurred before January 1, 2017.\u201dSan Diego State had been a member of both the N.C.A.A. and the Mountain West Conference (which has a contract with the Armed Forces Bowl) before that date, Lang said, so the university concluded that its teams\u2019 participation fell under that exception. Yet it used non-taxpayer funds to pay for the trip anyway, Lang said, \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201dThe California attorney general\u2019s office has been considering whether the ban applies to \u201cUniversity of California and California State University athletic team staffs\u201d for nearly a year. But the question remains unanswered. The attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment for this article.In the past, the N.C.A.A. has taken a stand in reaction to some state laws. It opposed the 2014 \u201creligious freedom\u201d law in Indiana, where the association is headquartered. And before last year\u2019s tournament, it responded to North Carolina\u2019s passage of a notorious bill that put restrictions on bathroom access for transgender citizens by pulling some events from the state and threatening not to schedule more there. In both cases, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s public opposition played a significant role in the laws\u2019 subsequent modification or repeal, with the N.C.A.A. going on to keep events in those states and schedule others.\u201cWe can\u2019t control what states\u2019 laws are, nor should we,\u201d Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president, said last year.\u201cIf any state says they\u2019re not going to travel to any other place for some other reason,\u201d he added, \u201cWe can\u2019t then say, \u2018Well, we\u2019ve decided we\u2019re not going to go there because another state has decided it.\u2019\u201dSeveral future N.C.A.A. championship sites could test this question. The Division I men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments alone have scheduled several regionals and subregionals in states on California\u2019s list. Several Division II baseball tournaments, including this year\u2019s, are planned for North Carolina.As with many boycotts, the travel bans stir complex feelings even among their supporters. Witt, who supports travel bans, acknowledged that he is based in a state that takes college basketball extremely seriously, and watched its flagship university make the Final Four this year.\u201cThere are a lot of fans in the L.G.B.T. Kansas community who are big-time basketball, and K.U. basketball, fans,\u201d Witt said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Park Geun-hye, South Korea\u2019s Ousted President, Gets 24 Years in Prison", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conviction and sentencing represented a climactic moment in an influence-peddling scandal that drew hundreds of thousands of South Koreans into the streets demanding Ms. Park\u2019s resignation and shook the country\u2019s political and business worlds.Ms. Park \u2014 the conservative daughter of a past dictator \u2014 is the country\u2019s first former leader to be convicted of crimes since two former military-backed presidents were found guilty of sedition and corruption in the 1990s. Ms. Park\u2019s conviction on bribery, coercion, abuse of power and other charges was the first lower-court ruling on a criminal case to be broadcast live in South Korea.Many viewed her conviction as a giant step forward for South Korea\u2019s democracy, raising hopes that the country would tackle the corruption that accompanied its impressive economic rise. But there are fears that no true reform is possible until the country\u2019s powerful conglomerates are held to better account for serious white-collar crimes like bribery.A Samsung executive implicated in the scandal has already been freed from prison.Ms. Park, 66, did not appear in court for her case on Friday. She has refused to attend any court hearings since October, staying in her prison cell, complaining of poor health and insisting that she is the victim of a political conspiracy.Although Ms. Park is expected to appeal the verdict, the sentencing is likely to bring a sense of closure to the corruption scandal that engulfed her. Her supporters, mostly older South Koreans, have insisted on her innocence, and hundreds of them protested outside the courthouse on Friday, demanding her release and calling her a victim of \u201cpolitical revenge.\u201dMs. Park has tearfully apologized to the public, cutting ties with Ms. Choi and insisting that she was not aware of many of her friend\u2019s illegal activities. Her lawyers also appealed for leniency, arguing that the money collected from big businesses was not used for her personal gain. Some of the money Ms. Choi secured from South Korean businesses went to finance her daughter\u2019s equestrian career.In Friday\u2019s verdict, Ms. Park was convicted of collecting or demanding nearly $22 million in bribes from three of South Korea\u2019s top business conglomerates: Samsung, Lotte and SK.The former president was also found guilty of abusing her power to help Ms. Choi and her associates win lucrative business contracts from big businesses, and of blacklisting artists, writers and movie directors deemed unfriendly to her government, excluding them from state support programs.Ms. Park was also ordered to pay $17 million in fines.\u201cThe accused caused chaos in state affairs by abusing the power given to her by the people, and it is necessary to hold her responsible with a stern punishment so that similar things will not happen again,\u201d the presiding judge, Kim Se-yoon, said in the nationally televised sentencing.Ms. Park\u2019s removal from office \u2014 she was replaced as president by the liberal politician Moon Jae-in \u2014 represented a huge setback for her once-dominant conservative party. Locked away in jail, she has slowly receded from public discourse. Older conservatives who represent her most ardent supporters are deeply mistrustful of Mr. Moon, whom they regard as pro-North Korean, but he now enjoys public approval ratings hovering around 70 percent.Ms. Park\u2019s scandal rekindled longstanding public anger over the extensive ties between the government and family-run conglomerates known as chaebol.Friday\u2019s sentencing was an ignominious end to Ms. Park\u2019s career. A daughter of the former military dictator Park Chung-hee, she grew up in South Korea\u2019s presidential residence, the Blue House, and essentially served as her father\u2019s first lady after her mother was assassinated by a pro-North Korean gunman in 1974. Her father\u2019s 18-year dictatorship ended with his own assassination by his spy chief in 1979. Never married and childless, Ms. Park lived a reclusive life afterward.Her fortunes changed amid the Asian financial crisis of 1998, when South Koreans, hankering for her father\u2019s charismatic leadership, elected her to the National Assembly. She became a political boss and a conservative icon.Almost all of South Korea\u2019s presidents have seen their reputations tarnished toward the end of their tenure or during their retirement because of corruption scandals involving them, their relatives or aides. The two former military-backed presidents who were imprisoned in the 1990s \u2014 Chun Doo-hwan and his friend and successor, Roh Tae-woo \u2014 were eventually pardoned and released. (Mr. Chun had faced a death sentence.)A spokesman for the current president, Mr. Moon, called Friday\u2019s developments \u201cheartbreaking.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Missouri Governor Faces New Charge: Misusing Charity List for Campaign", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Eric Greitens of Missouri was accused on Friday of illegally obtaining a donor list from a charity he founded and using it to raise money for his 2016 campaign, a new blow to Mr. Greitens in a deepening political and sex scandal that has threatened his grip on the governor\u2019s office.Kimberly Gardner, the St. Louis circuit attorney, charged Mr. Greitens with one felony count of tampering with computer data in connection with the donor list.Mr. Greitens, a Republican who was first elected governor in the 2016 race, already was facing a different felony charge, invasion of privacy. In January, he admitted that he had a sexual relationship with his former hairdresser while he was married. The woman has told a legislative committee that Mr. Greitens took a nude or seminude picture of her without her consent, then threatened to make the image public if she told anyone about their affair.The new felony charge dates back to actions prosecutors say took place in April 2015, when Mr. Greitens, a former Navy SEAL, was running for governor and serving on the board of directors for The Mission Continues, a veterans charity that he founded. According to the charging document, Mr. Greitens directed an employee of the charity, identified only as \u201cK.T.,\u201d to take a list of donors from the charity.\u201cThe defendant and K.T. knew that the donor list disclosed on April 22, 2015, was taken without the permission of The Mission Continues,\u201d the document said. Personal use of the donor list was prohibited by the charity, the document said.Late Friday, Mr. Greitens bluntly rejected the new count against him, suggesting that the prosecutor was scrambling to shore up her case.\u201cHer case is falling apart\u2014so today, she\u2019s brought a new one,\u201d Mr. Greitens said, in a written statement in which he pledged that he will clear his name.His attorney, Ed Dowd, said in a separate statement: \u201cThis charge makes no sense at all.\u201dMr. Dowd said that Mr. Greitens\u2019s charity group had helped thousands of veterans and that Mr. Greitens had created it in \u201can extraordinary act of public service.\u201d\u201cThe court will find Eric innocent of yet another absurd charge, and the people of Missouri will learn the true motives behind this action soon enough,\u201d Mr. Dowd said. \u201cThis allegation is absurd, and Eric will be found innocent of this accusation in court.\u201dEarlier this week, Josh Hawley, the attorney general of Missouri and a Republican, said that he believed there was evidence that Mr. Greitens had committed a felony in obtaining the list. Mr. Hawley said that his office did not have jurisdiction to charge, so he turned over the evidence to Ms. Gardner\u2019s office for consideration.\u201cThese are serious charges \u2014 and an important reminder that no one is above the law in Missouri,\u201d Mr. Hawley said on Friday after the new charge was announced.Earlier this month, a House committee released an investigative report detailing damaging claims against Mr. Greitens, including sworn testimony from his former hairdresser that he had slapped her and once coerced her into performing oral sex.Mr. Greitens faces trial on the invasion of privacy count in St. Louis on May 14, and has said that he looks forward to clearing his name. He has rejected calls from leaders in the Missouri Republican Party to resign from the governor\u2019s office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert E. Rubin: Philosophy Prepared Me for a Career in Finance and Government", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rubin was secretary of the Treasury from 1995 to 1999.When I arrived at Harvard in 1956 as a freshman, I felt overwhelmed academically. Unlike many of my classmates who had gone to rigorous private schools, I graduated from a Florida public school that in those days rarely sent kids to elite colleges in the North. Even after four years of high school French, I couldn\u2019t pass the exam to get out of the entry-level class at Harvard. In math, I was relegated to the remedial course.The dean tried to reassure us at orientation by noting that only 2 percent of the class would fail out. I thought my classmates were lucky: I\u2019d somehow manage to fill the quota all by myself.My tenuous feeling about being at Harvard would never fully dissipate. But to my surprise, and that of my advisers, my grades were quite good at the end of the year. The upside of entering Harvard with less academic preparation than many of my classmates was that it forced me to rethink much of what I thought I knew.So, too, did Raphael Demos. Professor Demos, an authority on Greek philosophy, was Harvard\u2019s Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy and Civil Policy. But to me, when I took a class with him my sophomore year, he was a genial little man with white hair and an exceptional talent for engaging students from the lecture hall stage, using an overturned wastebasket as his lectern.Professor Demos would use Plato and other great philosophers to demonstrate that proving any proposition to be true in the final and ultimate sense was impossible. His approach to critical thinking planted a seed in me that grew during my years at Harvard and throughout my life. The approach appealed to what was probably my natural but latent tendency toward questioning and skepticism.I concluded that you can\u2019t prove anything in absolute terms, from which I extrapolated that all significant decisions are about probabilities. Internalizing the core tenet of Professor Demos\u2019s teaching \u2014 weighing risk and analyzing odds and trade-offs \u2014 was central to everything I did professionally in the decades ahead in finance and government.At the same time that I was processing Professor Demos\u2019s class, one of the big ideas floating around coffeehouses in Cambridge, Mass., was existential philosophy. In time, I arrived at my own interpretation of that way of thinking. To me, existentialism is an internalized sense of perspective. I came to believe that on one hand, the present matters a great deal, but on the other hand, in the totality of space and time, the here and now becomes insignificant.I\u2019m asked from time to time which undergraduate courses best prepared me for working at Goldman Sachs and in the government. People assume I\u2019ll list courses in economics or finance, but I always answer that the key was Professor Demos\u2019s philosophy course and the conversations about existentialism in coffee shops around campus. For me, embracing these two perspectives brought me a sense of calm in what were incredibly stressful situations.There was a point in the early 1980s when the Goldman Sachs arbitrage department, which I led, lost more money in one month than it had made in almost any one year, driven by severe declines in the equity markets. Given the vicissitudes of markets, there was no way to tell whether we\u2019d reached the nadir and recovery was around the corner \u2014 or whether we were about to go over a cliff. Despite the immense pressure, and the emotional state of the markets, I drew on an existential perspective, and my colleagues and I made careful, probabilistic decisions to adjust our portfolio, and we weathered the storm.During my time in the Clinton White House, my colleagues and I tackled similarly complex situations. One extraordinarily complicated issue was the 1995 budget battle, which transformed into a debt-limit crisis and two government shutdowns. Compounding the severity of this policy debate for me was the experience of being personally vilified. Despite the complexity of the issues and the emotions involved, we managed to keep our balance and stand our ground. The Republican-controlled Congress eventually raised the debt limit, as we had advocated.In both of those situations \u2014 one on Wall Street, the other in Washington \u2014 I drew from Professor Demos\u2019s philosophy class and the existentialist lessons from the coffeehouses, which shaped my thinking on how to make decisions and helped me build a durable sense of remove and perspective.Despite having such a profound impact on my way of thinking, I never actually met Professor Demos. I was just one of a hundred or so young faces sitting in a lecture hall, taking in his every word. If I had the chance, I would thank him for challenging me all those many years ago. He crystallized for me the power of critical thinking: asking questions, recognizing that there are no provable certainties and analyzing the probabilities. And that, coupled with my coffeehouse lessons, was the best preparation one could have \u2014 not just for a career but also for life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lucrecia Martel: A Director Who Confounds and Thrills", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel expresses admiration for those directors who challenge reality, she could be talking about herself.In her previous movies, Ms. Martel \u2014 who, with her casual attire, long hair and oversized cat\u2019s-eye glasses, could almost pass for a graduate student \u2014 focused largely on family relations. She does not, however, see herself as a maker of women\u2019s films. \u201cRomantic comedies are my enemy,\u201d she said, speaking through an interpreter a few days after \u201cZama\u201d was shown at the New York Film Festival last fall.Given the originality of her oblique style, near-documentary fascination with large families and taste for depicting provincial inertia, Ms. Martel both excites and confounds viewers. Her vivid, elusive movies are observational and fragmented, agitated and entropic in equal measure, populated by accident-prone characters notable for their absence of self-awareness.It is tempting to attribute Ms. Martel\u2019s intimacy and ease in directing ensemble casts to her own experience. Raised in Salta, a city tucked in Argentina\u2019s northwest corner at the foot of the Andes and the edge of the rain forest, she was one of seven siblings, and, she said, the child charged with making her prosperous family\u2019s home movies.Set mainly at a medical convention held in a dilapidated family-owned hotel, \u201cThe Holy Girl\u201d (2004) details a teenager\u2019s self-appointed mission to redeem the middle-aged doctor who rubbed up against her in a crowd. \u201cThe Headless Woman\u201d (2009) concerns a well-off matron\u2019s addled response to an automobile accident in which she may or may not have hit something or someone.Ms. Martel avoids establishing shots and, at times cutting away from the action, favors abrupt transitions. Her skewed framing and use of focus can be unsettling, something she has slyly attributed to her myopia. Her most formally radical film, \u201cThe Headless Woman,\u201d is deliberately disorienting, putting the viewer in the position of its discombobulated protagonist.Following the Salta films, Ms. Martel decided to switch gears. Her next project was an adaptation of H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld\u2019s graphic novel \u201cEl Eternauta\u201d (The Eternal), a science-fiction fantasy critical of Argentine authoritarianism by a writer who was apparently murdered by the regime during the \u201cdirty war\u201d of the mid-1970s and early 1980s. As someone who grew up in those years, Ms. Martell described the period as a more sinister version of her films: \u201cThings happened with no explanation, especially for a kid,\u201d she said, citing mysterious cars, bloodstains and even corpses in the street.After two years developing a script, without securing financing and the necessary rights, Ms. Martel abandoned \u201cEl Eternauta.\u201d It was then that she discovered Antonio Di Benedetto\u2019s 1956 novel, \u201cZama,\u201d which sat unread on her shelf for five years before she brought it with her on a trip along the Paraguay River, where much of the book is set. Asked if she saw a film in it, she replied in English: \u201cImmediately!\u201dMs. Martel\u2019s first digitally shot film, her first set outside Salta, her first period film and her first adaptation, \u201cZama\u201d is also her first centered on a man, although, as she points out, the frustrated Don Diego de Zama, a South American-born functionary of imperial Spain posted in a remote Paraguayan backwater, resembles many of her female characters. Played by the Mexican actor Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho in a state of wounded dignity, Zama is a confused provincial, frustrated, self-deluded and clinging to a precarious sense of cultural superiority.As the Kafkaesque drama of a man unable to get a transfer, \u201cZama\u201d shares the dislocation and torpor characteristic of the Salta Trilogy. But disconcertingly beautiful and at times otherworldly, the movie\u2019s spacey final movement recalls Werner Herzog adventures like \u201cAguirre, the Wrath of God\u201d and \u201cFitzcarraldo.\u201d Ms. Martel does not take this as a compliment. \u201cHis films bother me,\u201d she said, citing what she sees as their \u201cirresponsible treatment of animals and indigenous people.\u201dThe veteran Argentine film critic and festival director Eduardo Antin, who writes under the name Quintin, noted that however faithful to the Di Benedetto novel the film is, Ms. Martel made the material \u201cconsistent with her political interests\u201d by bringing \u201cthe background to the foreground.\u201d Di Benedetto focused on Zama and his would-be European milieu and largely ignored the colony\u2019s enslaved people and indigenous inhabitants. Martel includes Africans and Indians, most often women, in nearly every frame. Zama\u2019s story is also theirs. \u201cSuch a change requires great will and precise thinking,\u201d Mr. Antin wrote in an email. It also serves to set up the movie\u2019s horrifying \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d ending.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Venture Capitalists Prepare for an I.P.O. Wave", "Date": "2018-04-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Jason Pressman spent Thursday morning cheering from the balcony of the New York Stock Exchange as shares of the software firm Zuora, which he backed in 2008, began trading.\u201cNot bad at all,\u201d Mr. Pressman said by phone on Thursday night, before heading to a celebratory dinner with about 60 people at a pricey Italian restaurant in Chelsea. Mr. Pressman, a venture capitalist at Shasta Ventures, said he had been up much of the night before but still expected to raise a few glasses. \u201cI\u2019m running a little bit on adrenaline.\u201dMr. Pressman and many other Silicon Valley venture capitalists expect the windfalls to continue. Many of these investors, who back tiny start-ups with the hope that they will someday go public or be sold for nine- or 10-figure sums, have enjoyed enormous paper gains in recent years. But few have cashed in, because their fast-rising companies, like Uber and Airbnb, have remained private.That finally may change. Investors, bankers and analysts said they expected a wave of initial public offerings to bring some of the most highly valued and recognizable start-ups to the public market over the next 18 to 24 months \u2014 and billions of dollars in returns to their executives and investors. The potential bonanza would follow years of waiting as a few dozen companies amassed valuations without precedent in the private market.The tide has turned, venture capitalists said. \u201cI talk to bankers all the time and they\u2019re like: \u2018Dude, we have stuff coming down the pike. There\u2019s a bunch of offerings teed up,\u2019\u201d said Rob Hayes, a general partner at First Round Capital, who led a $1.5 million funding round in Uber in 2010 that valued the company at $4 million. Uber is now worth $68 billion.A wave of tech I.P.O.s would have implications for Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem. Once start-ups go public and their employees pocket some of the wealth, executives and engineers may leave with more resources to begin their own start-ups. That gives venture capitalists a fresh set of companies to invest in, renewing the cycles of innovation and experimentation that sit at the heart of Silicon Valley.The I.P.O.s will also earn the venture capitalists big returns \u2014 and bragging rights. According to an annual ranking of venture capitalists by CB Insights, a research firm that follows start-ups and venture capital, many of the top-ranked investors backed companies with 2017 I.P.O.s, including the software maker MuleSoft; Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service; and Snap. (While Snap has struggled on the stock market, investors bought in at far lower valuations.)Steve Anderson of Baseline Ventures, No. 2 on the list, also backed Stitch Fix. And Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Ventures, who was No. 10, funded Snap, while his colleague Ravi Mhatre, No. 8, backed MuleSoft and Stitch Fix. (The list of top 20 venture capitalists is below.)\u201cEven though most firms have had fairly record numbers over the past four or five years, they\u2019ve been paper numbers,\u201d Mr. Gurley said. \u201cAt the end of day, cash-on-cash returns is what matters.\u201dWhile private capital has been so accessible that start-ups have been able to get ample funding without the headaches of an I.P.O., several factors are encouraging companies to go public now, investors and bankers said. Public investors are hungry to buy shares of fast-growing companies. Early employees are getting antsy to cash in their stakes. And some start-up executives are eager to prove themselves as public company chief executives after founders like Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey have said going public improved their discipline and focus on profits.\u201cAt all levels, there are more and more companies who are thinking about should we go public this year or next?\u201d said Noah Wintroub, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s vice chairman of investment banking. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an environment now that\u2019s conducive to asking that question, and also a lot of companies that have scaled up to the point where they can go now.\u201dMatthew Kennedy, an I.P.O. analyst at Renaissance Capital, said nearly all private companies valued at more than $1 billion were strong candidates to go public in the next two years. He said he expected more immediate activity among midsize start-ups, such as Slack, the maker of corporate messaging software, which is valued at $5.1 billion, and DocuSign, an e-signature company valued at $3 billion that filed I.P.O. paperwork last month.Once this generation of start-ups goes public, investors said, it will ease the anxiety of the wealthy families, pension funds and university endowments that finance the venture capitalists\u2019 investment funds. Those so-called limited partners have been itching for their returns, venture capitalists said.\u201cThey\u2019re certainly eager for cash back,\u201d said Mr. Pressman, the Zuora investor. An I.P.O. boon would be good for the venture capitalists, too.\u201cFor sure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the business to make money for our investors, but we make money when our investors do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charitable Giving by Corporations Is Also About Getting, a New Study Finds", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe same goes for the Walmart Foundation\u2019s contributions to reduce carbon emissions in China and to protect wilderness areas in the United States, or the Dow Chemical Foundation\u2019s contribution to Habitat for Humanity. These companies might be ruthless in their lines of work \u2014 fighting against environmental regulations or more stringent labor standards \u2014 but their foundations are in it to do good to the world.Sifting through the donations to charity from 1998 to 2015 by foundations set up by the largest companies in the United States \u2014 those in the Fortune 500 or the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 Marianne Bertrand of the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business; Matilde Bombardini and Francesco Trebbi of the University of British Columbia; and Raymond Fisman of Boston University detected a pattern of contributions to 1,087 charities linked to 451 members of Congress.Turns out that the spending is a little more self-serving than companies would have us believe. Some of the charitable giving looks a lot like corporate lobbying. Because companies get a break for such giving, it amounts to political spending at taxpayers\u2019 expense. \u201cFirms deploy their charitable foundations as a form of tax-exempt influence seeking,\u201d the researchers write.Think of it like this: One way a company could please Senator Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee and is a member of the committees on finance, agriculture, the budget and taxation, would be to have a corporate political action committee donate directly to his campaign.But there is another way, one that often slips below the radar of campaign-finance watchdogs. Why not donate to the Partnership for a Drug-Free Iowa, where the senator has been an honorary advisory board member?A corporation could also give to the University of Northern Iowa Foundation, on whose board Mr. Grassley sat as a trustee. Over the period covered by the study, the foundations of AT&T, ConAgra Foods, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Medtronic, Merck, Monsanto, Nationwide Insurance, Principal Financial Group and Rockwell Collins all contributed to one or the other.Mr. Grassley\u2019s office, when asked about the corporate contributions to causes linked to the senator, said: \u201cSenator Grassley receives many requests to support various nonprofit organizations. He lends his name to some, but declines most.\u201dThe researchers who conducted the new study don\u2019t claim that any specific charitable contribution was meant to manipulate the political process. But their work lays bare the extent to which corporate donations may respond to political, rather than charitable, motivations.The new research uncovers patterns in the aggregate data that suggest corporate donations are often dictated by recipients\u2019 political clout. For instance, a company foundation will donate more to charities in districts where the representatives have gained seats on a committee that is important to the company. And when the member of Congress leaves office, corporate donations to charities in his or her district will dip.Corporations\u2019 philanthropy often flows to the same areas as their political action committee contributions: Charities in districts where companies favor a particular candidate tend to get more corporate donations.A charity need not have been founded by a member of Congress to get corporate money. But it helps. A nonprofit is more than four times more likely to receive grants from a corporate foundation if a politician sits on its board. And corporate foundation grants are even more likely if the politician happens to sit on a committee being lobbied by the firm.The authors of the study examined only a subset of corporate philanthropy, money flowing through corporate foundations that must disclose the recipients of their largess. But the research suggests that the impact of corporate contributions could be much bigger than even critics of campaign-finance practices realize.The researchers estimate that over 7 percent of charitable donations by corporate foundations are intended to buy political leverage. Applied to $18 billion worth of corporate philanthropy in 2014, that would amount to $1.3 billion, almost four times as much as total political action committee contributions that year and 40 percent more than the corporations\u2019 lobbying expenditures.There are a couple of lessons here. For those who favor campaign-finance reform, perhaps the most urgent message is that there are many doors that corporate America can use to buy influence. But the research also highlights the way that companies interact with society.Corporations are likely to tally their foundations\u2019 charity as a decided plus on the dashboard of corporate social responsibility. But politically motivated charitable giving meant to undercut regulations, promote a tax cut or otherwise gain a break could actually reduce total welfare.As the researchers write, \u201cIf corporations\u2019 good deeds (in the form of charitable contributions) cater to politicians\u2019 interests, who as a result put the interests of business ahead of those of voters, the overall welfare effects are ambiguous \u2014 society benefits via increased charity, at the potentially high cost of distorting laws and regulation.\u201dNone of this would happen, of course, if politicians weren\u2019t so hungry for corporate money. \u201cCompanies wouldn\u2019t do this if it didn\u2019t pay off,\u201d Professor Bombardini told me. \u201cPoliticians get good publicity by channeling funds that are valuable to the community. Whatever makes you look good, you want to take credit for it.\u201dBut with a new wave of scandals engulfing some of the nation\u2019s corporate titans, it would behoove them to honestly assess the ultimate purpose of their charity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "FIFA\u2019s Infantino Calls for Rare Emergency Meeting Amid $25 Billion Offer", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFIFA\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, has called for an emergency meeting of the leading officials in international soccer to address a $25 billion rights offer from an investment group that could radically change some of the biggest competitions in the sport.In lengthy letter sent to members of the governing FIFA Council last week, Infantino called for a special meeting with leaders of soccer\u2019s six regional bodies as soon as this week to discuss new details of the offer for control of a new quadrennial 24-team club tournament along the lines of the World Cup, FIFAs\u2019s $5 billion cash cow, and a proposed league for national teams.Officials have so far blocked Infantino from moving ahead with a deal that he said had to be signed within 60 days, in part because he declined to identify the members of the international consortium, citing a nondisclosure agreement, and also because they are concerned the event could compete with existing tournaments.\u201cA meeting with the confederations will take place in due course but no date has been set yet,\u201d said a FIFA spokesman, confirming the planned talks were to discuss details of the offer from investors. \u201cFurther consultation is also ongoing with different stakeholders on potential changes to the FIFA Club World Cup.\u201dEmergency meetings are rare and reserved for the most vital matters. The last time FIFA called its top board for an unscheduled meeting was in 2015, after several of the board\u2019s members were arrested in a dawn raid on a luxury Zurich hotel.Infantino\u2019s rationale for the urgent meeting is twofold. He wants to persuade skeptical officials to allow him to forge ahead with negotiations on the proposed $25 billion deal. But he also wants to calm some members who have grown angry over what they see as Infantino\u2019s aggressive pursuit of a deal that would lead to the biggest restructuring in soccer in several decades.During his campaign for the presidency of FIFA, Infantino promised fourfold increases in financing for soccer development to member nations. The $25 billion would provide Infantino with enough money to follow through on that commitment ahead of his bid for re-election next year.Opposition from powerful European soccer officials and some of the continent\u2019s biggest clubs remains strong. Creating the event without the agreement of the world\u2019s best clubs, employers of the top players required to make the events a success, is likely to lead to a protracted conflict in a sport that has been a battleground for primacy between national teams, which are governed by FIFA, and club soccer, which is overseen by the six regional confederations and their members.To win support, Infantino recently met with a handful of executives from the biggest clubs, including Germany\u2019s Bayern Munich and Chinese-owned Inter Milan, according to people familiar with the situation. The discussion took place without the knowledge of the European Club Association, an umbrella group for about 200 teams from across a continent, which includes the vast majority of the world\u2019s richest clubs. A spokesman for the E.C.A. said it had not been informed about the extraordinary FIFA Council meeting.In a briefing document sent to FIFA Council members before the Bogot\u00e1 meeting, and seen by The New York Times, FIFA said it favored a 24-team global club championship, with half the participants drawn from Europe. That group would include the finalists from the four prior editions of the Champions League, soccer\u2019s richest club event.European soccer\u2019s governing body UEFA is largely opposed to the proposal. Both competitions proposed by FIFA would cause upheaval to its events, including the creation of a significant competitor to the Champions League, which generates billions of dollars in advertising and broadcast revenue. The global nations league also would usurp UEFA\u2019s own version of a similar competition, which begins its first edition later this year.In its most recent letter to members, FIFA explained that the money from the proposed deal would directly benefit its 211 member federations, the group that will vote in next year\u2019s presidential election.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Beat Trump, Build a Better Biden", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the election were held today, Joe Biden would crush President Trump. Almost any other Democrat \u2014 including one named Generic Democrat \u2014 would also beat the man who runs an administration of kooks, quacks, criminals, drunks, wife beaters and grifters.Sadly, there remains a sizable constituency for incompetency on this scale \u2014 the look-the-other-way evangelicals, the get-yours-while-you-can corporate class, the ditch-your-principles Republican officeholders. They\u2019re with Stupid, no matter how much Trump debases the office.Surprisingly, the Democrats are thinking big for once. The ideas being tossed around are risky enough to be called bold: a guaranteed-jobs program, universal health care, a public option for banking, free community college.But the best-known carriers of that message have problems. Nancy Pelosi is toxic in many a targeted red-to-blue district. Chuck Schumer sounds too much like a party hack. The presidential contenders all have weaknesses.If you were to go into a lab and create a perfect candidate for 2020, along with a popular policy prescription for this anxious decade, what would that look like? It would be a big-hearted, progressive person whose appeal crosses class lines. It would be someone very much like Biden \u2014 a younger Biden. Let\u2019s ignore the age issue for now.Your candidate would need to be ethically clean \u2014 no Wall Street speeches, no foundations that serve as backdoor ways to do well while doing good, no sexual misconduct. This is vital, because Trump has filled the swamp with odious creatures, taking their cues from him.It might help if your candidate was not from the political class. Oprah? She\u2019s not interested, so she says. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook showed some promise until we all realized that social media had been weaponized to destroy democracy. The entrepreneur Mark Cuban? Haven\u2019t we had enough of a reality show star playing at being president?This gets you to the bench of elected officials. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior senator from New York, is a whirlwind of Big Ideas of late. She just unveiled a financial first step for paycheck-to-paycheck Americans: a plan to require every post office to offer basic banking services \u2014 an alternative to predatory payday loans.She is coldbloodedly #MeToo, having shoved her former colleague Al Franken and the Clintons under the bus. And she has gotten ahead of the one-note socialist Senator Bernie Sanders on the idea of a job guarantee for everyone who wants to work. The problem there is cost (up to a half-trillion dollars, by some estimates) and the bureaucratic nightmare it could create. Gillibrand is swinging for the fences, even if she did the least well of major Democrats against Trump in recent polling.Much of the party\u2019s energy is coming from the Sanders wing; Sanders himself will be 79 on Election Day 2020 and he is not getting any less cranky. But don\u2019t overlook the enthusiasm generated by the Texas Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke or Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana. They\u2019ve stood up for the basic right of health care, and against the wrong of more tax cuts for the rich \u2014 foundational positions favored by a majority of the country.Another prospect is the Senate\u2019s resident vegan, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. He\u2019s got some Wall Street problems and is less populist than the mood of the country. But he has terrific political skills; he wouldn\u2019t need a slogan like Stronger Together.In the same class is the rookie Senator Kamala Harris of California. She\u2019s sharp, dynamic, with the right balance of ego and intellect. But how would a California liberal play in Scranton, Pa.?Trump will be 74. He\u2019s old and he\u2019s angry, and will get only older and angrier. Build a better Biden, from our political lab, and you win. But maybe the current Biden is built to last, with just enough septuagenarian strut to end the dark age of Trump. \u2610Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rent Control Campaign in California Is Taken to the Streets", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 How do you get a landlord to endorse a proposal to limit rent increases?Yong Her, a 39-year-old bookkeeper, was one of 40 or so organizers who considered the question on a recent afternoon. The group had gathered in a conference room here to discuss strategies for getting people of various backgrounds, incomes and occupations to sign a petition to put a rent-control measure before Sacramento\u2019s voters.It was one small scene in what is shaping up as an epic battle on the state and city levels to combat California\u2019s affordable-housing crisis. Pitting a rising tenants rights\u2019 movement against apartment owners, the fight will consume tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of organizing effort and political advertising before the November election.If the Sacramento initiative were to make the ballot and ultimately pass, rent increases would be capped at 5 percent a year. That kind of law is a fairly easy sell in higher-density apartment complexes where everyone is a renter. But organizers need 50,000 signatures for the measure to be certified. That means they have to comb the city in search of registered voters willing to sign \u2014 and they aren\u2019t going to reach their goal, let alone pass the law, unless they persuade homeowners and small landlords to join together with tenants.So before organizers like Ms. Her left that evening to go door to door with bags full of pens and petitions, they watched while their colleagues play-acted some scenarios. The hardest one was getting a landlord to sign. The man playing the landlord was skeptical (\u201cStop right there \u2014 I\u2019m a landlord\u201d). The man playing the organizer was gentle and persistent (\u201cIt\u2019s just to put it up for a vote\u201d).The room took a few minutes to review the performance and suggest improvements. (One person recommended telling landlords that the proposed law could save them money by creating a board to rule on rent disputes, keeping them out of small-claims court.) Then Ms. Her and another organizer, Marie Camacho, left to do the real thing.A short drive later, they were in a sprawling neighborhood of single-family homes with long and winding streets. It seemed an unproductive place to go knocking, but Ms. Her was not intimidated.\u201cIt\u2019s very doable,\u201d she said.In California, where one in five people lives in poverty once rent is figured in, lawmakers have offered a flurry of bills to streamline building regulations, expand tenant protections and put more money toward subsidized housing. For many tenants, those efforts are not nearly enough. Up and down the state, activists and renters\u2019 groups are using California\u2019s tradition of citizen government to put voter initiatives on the ballot.As a result, this year\u2019s rent-control drives are more ambitious, in county seats like Sacramento, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and Santa Ana; big Los Angeles suburbs like Pasadena, Glendale, Inglewood and Long Beach; and the San Diego suburb of National City.Some organizers are so confident that they are willing to try do-overs. The Santa Rosa City Council passed a rent-control measure in 2016, prompting a landlord-backed proposal that repealed the measure in a special election last year. Now, after the fires that destroyed thousands of homes across Santa Rosa and surrounding Sonoma County last year, organizers are getting ready to collect signatures for an initiative to put rent control back in place.\u201cPeople are already supportive of rent control, and even more so after the fire,\u201d said Davin Cardenas, a director at the North Bay Organizing Project. \u201cThe need has not gone away, so we feel like we have a very good chance of winning.\u201d\u201cIt will be a full-scale campaign and probably one of the most dominant ones on the airwaves,\u201d said Steve Maviglio, a longtime political consultant who is now working with the California Apartment Association, a landlords\u2019 group.State-level initiatives usually come down to money. With California\u2019s 40 million people spread across two megaregions along with dozens of small cities and a wide expanse of rural areas, election campaigns are TV-centric and almost presidential in scope.\u201cThis is the defining issue for California right now,\u201d said Jim Ross, a political consultant for the Coalition for Affordable Housing, which is pushing for the Costa-Hawkins repeal and at this point is almost entirely financed by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. \u201cEveryone in California has a story about rental housing \u2014 it\u2019s the thing that pulls us together.\u201dCertainly everyone has an opinion. On the recent evening in Sacramento, as Ms. Her and Ms. Camacho went door to door, pretty much everyone who answered seemed to agree that California had a dire housing problem and that something needed to be done.Jessica Repa was the first person to sign Ms. Her\u2019s petition. Ms. Repa, 43, who is at home raising two children, used to live in San Francisco and grew accustomed to the security of rent control.While she didn\u2019t commit to supporting the initiative if it qualifies for the ballot, she said, \u201cI agree that it needs to be something people consider as a solution.\u201dLater in the evening, Ms. Camacho stopped by the home of Tony Rittell, a 75-year-old retired computer programmer. He listened politely but didn\u2019t sign.\u201cThere is definitely an issue in California,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure rent control is the way to go. I mean, they\u2019ve had rent control in San Francisco for how many years?\u201dHe added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem. They need to build more units.\u201dToward the end of the evening, after a few miles of walking, Ms. Her came across a landlord \u2014 the scenario that her colleagues had practiced. He was Gustavo Casillas, 62, a retired landscaper who also owned rental property. But Ms. Her did not have to do much persuading to get him to sign. Mr. Casillas picked up the pen without hesitation.Why would a landlord sign a proposal for rent control? \u201cWe haven\u2019t raised the rents in years because we want to keep them there,\u201d he said of his tenants. \u201cI don\u2019t care for homelessness, especially with veterans. I think more should be done about that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That Ms. Danius lost her position while Mr. Arnault remains under investigation led her defenders to say that she had been made a scapegoat.The academy\u2019s deliberations are highly secretive, and it is unclear who exactly was responsible for Ms. Danius\u2019s ouster. But two of her predecessors as permanent secretary had said that the scandal surrounding Mr. Arnault was overblown and called Ms. Danius weak. Mr. Arnault\u2019s wife, the poet Katarina Frostenson, left her work with the academy on Thursday.In a statement sent to Swedish news agency TT on Friday, Ms. Danius said that the academy should work against \u201coutmoded power structures or manifestations of misogyny,\u201d but did not address what had happened directly.The abrupt removal of Ms. Danius led to a fierce show of solidarity on the street and online, as a country that prides itself on gender equality reaffirmed its commitment to feminism through the image of the knytblus. \u201cI find it frustrating that such a conflict ends with two women having to step out of the way,\u201d she said in an interview on Swedish radio. \u201cI can\u2019t accept that.\u201d Men also expressed sartorial support for Ms. Danius. Mikael Damberg, Sweden\u2019s innovation minister, posted a picture of himself wearing a scarf knotted at the neck, along with members of his team in the Ministry of Finance. In an interview, he said that the outfit represented his commitment to gender equality and women\u2019s leadership. He added that the ouster of Ms. Danius had left him \u201cdisturbed and worried.\u201d\u201cAfter #MeToo it is important to take a stand,\u201d he said.The #MeToo movement has hit Sweden with force, despite the country\u2019s reputation for progressive gender politics. Mr. Arnault, a major cultural figure, was the subject of a November report in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, which found that at least 18 women had accused him of sexual assault and harassment. The paper said he had been accused of mistreating women for more than two decades.The academy has been rived by the accusations. Last week, three members quit in anger over Mr. Arnault\u2019s alleged misconduct, including Ms. Danius\u2019s predecessor as permanent secretary, Peter Englund. Two other former heads, Sture Allen and Horace Engdahl, have made cutting statements about Ms. Danius while playing down the accusations. Officially members are elected to life terms, and the recent departures have left the body with fewer members than it needs to elect replacements. King Carl XVI Gustaf has said that he will consider amending the academy\u2019s rules to allow members to resign and to be replaced.On Friday, rumor continued to spread about what had happened within the academy the previous day. Sara Stridsberg, an ally of Ms. Danius and one of the younger members, told Dagens Nyheter that a deal had been struck in which Katarina Frostenson would leave her work with the academy if Ms. Danius stepped down from the permanent secretary role.Another member, Per Wastberg, corroborated that account in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, writing that Ms. Danius had been sacrificed for Ms. Frostenson in what he called \u201chorse trading.\u201d \u201cThis is a stain on the Academy that cannot be washed away,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd all this misery because of a sex addict!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Is Set to Take a Hard Line on Trump\u2019s Trade Demands", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Staking an assertive negotiating stance, China says it will refuse to discuss President Trump\u2019s two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks.The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America\u2019s $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing\u2019s $300 billion plan to bankroll the country\u2019s industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft.The reason: Beijing feels its economy has become big enough and resilient enough to stand up to the United States.A half-dozen senior Chinese officials and two dozen influential advisers laid out the Chinese government\u2019s position in detail during a three-day seminar that ended here late Monday morning. The officials and most of the advisers at the seminar gave an overview of China\u2019s economic policies, including an in-depth review of the country\u2019s trade policy, to make sure China\u2019s stance would be known overseas. All of the officials and most of the advisers at the seminar insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.It is not clear what will happen when the two sides sit down this week or whether either will find a reason to waver. Still, the Chinese and American positions are so far apart that China\u2019s leaders are skeptical the two sides can find common ground by the end of this week. They are already raising the possibility that Chinese officials may fly to Washington a month from now for further talks.\u201cI don\u2019t expect a comprehensive deal whatsoever,\u201d said Ruan Zongze, the executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, which is the policy research arm of China\u2019s Foreign Ministry. \u201cI think there is a lot of game playing here.\u201dBeijing is frustrated with Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to impose tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese goods and dismayed by suggestions in the West that China has a weak bargaining position. Chinese officials think the country\u2019s one-party political system and President Xi Jinping\u2019s enduring grip on power \u2014 particularly after the repeal of presidential term limits in March \u2014 mean that China can outlast the United States and Mr. Trump in any trade quarrel.The Chinese government believes Mr. Trump\u2019s background as a businessman means that at some point he will agree to a deal. Seminar participants also reaffirmed previous Chinese trade policy offers to further open the country\u2019s financial and automotive sectors, though not in ways that would impact China\u2019s industrial modernization program, called Made in China 2025. They also suggested that China would be willing to tighten its intellectual property rules so as to foster innovation within China as well as protect foreign technologies from counterfeiting and other illegal copying.China is insisting that the parameters of any negotiations be limited, and that the tariff threat be removed before a final deal can be struck.Chinese officials have reached out to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has reacted positively to China\u2019s overtures in the auto and financial sectors. Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who will be on the Trump administration\u2019s team in Beijing later this week, has sought to calm investors worried that the rhetoric between Washington and Beijing could break out into a full-blown trade war.The U.S. and China have both demonstrated a willingness to offer concessions \u2014 and escalate tensions \u2014 to get what they want.China\u2019s position is that the bilateral trade imbalance arises from differences in savings rates. Households in China save roughly two-fifths of their income. Americans, on average, save almost nothing. So money from China tends to flow to the United States, buying factories, technology companies, real estate and more, and Americans in turn spend much of that money to buy goods from China. Many economists in the United States, including some at the Treasury, share that view.By contrast, many trade lawyers, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and Mr. Trump contend that the trade deficit stems to a large extent from unfair practices, including cheap loans by state-controlled banks to exporters.China is ready to discuss shrinking the $375 billion annual trade deficit. But it wants to do so by buying more high-tech American goods. Washington has long blocked such deals because of concerns that they may have military value. China is also willing to buy more oil, natural gas, coal and other goods from the United States, and to help finance the extra pipelines and other infrastructure that would be needed to move them to China.A senior Chinese government official said that Beijing is unwilling to negotiate with the United States on any curbs on Made in China 2025, which includes large-scale government assistance to favored industries in advanced-technology manufacturing. China perceives the American demands as an attempt to stop China\u2019s economic development and technological progress, the senior Chinese official said.Germany and other countries also have industrial policies, and the United States has not objected to them, he added. American and European officials have argued that those policies elsewhere are much narrower and less ambitious.Other advisers and officials said that the United States had misunderstood the Made in China 2025 industrial policy. They expressed hope that it might be possible to resolve differences by explaining the program better and making very small tweaks to it \u2014 a stance that still may not appease the Trump administration.The Chinese government is not simply throwing money, land and other resources to favored industries like robotics, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and aircraft manufacturing, they said. China is engaged instead, they contended, in a carefully thought-out program that measures potential profits for each dollar of investment. So China\u2019s program bears some resemblance, they said, to private sector investment programs in the West.One subject was repeatedly and conspicuously avoided by all officials throughout the seminar, even when advisers occasionally speculated about it: whether China might someday try to link trade disputes to national security issues.China has been deeply involved in international pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, an issue of high importance to the Trump administration. Beijing also wants to someday assert control of Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing regards as a renegade territory.Tsinghua University\u2019s new Academic Center for Chinese Economic Practice and Thinking organized the seminar, which was held at Tsinghua and two other venues in western Beijing. President Xi graduated from Tsinghua, which is in Beijing and is China\u2019s top university, and he has filled much of the senior ranks of his government with Tsinghua professors and graduates.In some respects, the hard stance struck by Chinese officials reflects a hardening of public attitudes in China.Washington officials cited ZTE\u2019s repeated violations of sanctions against Iran and North Korea, but many in China saw it as a reminder by the United States that sizable sectors of the Chinese economy still rely on American-made goods. Much of the Made in China 2025 policy is aimed at reducing that dependence.The ZTE case \u201chas changed a lot of Chinese people\u2019s opinion,\u201d said Mr. Ruan, of the China Institute of International Studies. \u201cIn the past, people saw us as interdependent.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Austria, Police Raids Stemming From Russian Sports Corruption Inquiries", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe authorities in Austria raided the headquarters of biathlon\u2019s global governing body following a tip from the World Anti-Doping Agency that its leaders may have been involved with the vast Russian doping scandal that continues to roil international sports.The Salzburg-based International Biathlon Union, which has long had close links to Russian sports, confirmed the investigation in a news release on Wednesday, in which it also announced that its longtime secretary general, Nicole Resch, had requested a leave of absence. The I.B.U. said the investigation focused on Resch \u2014 who had publicly questioned sports regulators\u2019 conclusions about Russia\u2019s systematic cheating \u2014 and the group\u2019s president, Anders Besseberg, a former biathlete and cross-country skier who is also a board member of the antidoping agency.The raid escalates the Russian doping scandal at a time when sports officials have tried to put it in the rearview mirror. Investigators have established that huge amounts of corruption within Russia\u2019s system tainted track and field. The raid in Austria signals that the investigation has extended to other sports\u2019 governing bodies and could raise additional questions about possible bribery in other federations.Biathlon had been at the center of a number of allegations related to Russian doping years before the 2016 revelations of a state-sponsored scheme that corrupted dozens of sporting events, including to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.The raid on the biathlon organization came after the antidoping agency gave details gleaned by its own investigation team to law enforcement officials in Norway \u2014 where a raid also took place \u2014 and Austria, as well as the global police organization Interpol. The government investigation began in 2017 and resulted in surveillance of potential targets late last year, according to three people familiar with the case.\u201cWADA confirms that the issue is linked to doping but as the police investigation is ongoing, the agency can make no further comment at this stage,\u201d the organization said in a statement.The Norwegian broadcaster NRK, citing a news release from the country\u2019s financial crimes investigator, reported that the police there were providing assistance to Austrian authorities who suspected Norwegians \u201cof economic crime.\u201dBesseberg, 72, is from Norway, and is one of the longest-serving sports federation presidents. He did not respond to requests for comment.Late last year, after the International Olympic Committee had banned the Russian Federation from the 2018 Winter Olympics, Besseberg announced that Russia\u2019s biathlon organization had been relegated to \u201cprovisional membership\u201d \u2014 a largely symbolic suspension that did not limit Russia\u2019s ability to host events. That prompted an outcry from some sports officials and boycotts of competitions in Russia by American and Canadian biathletes.This week\u2019s raid came as another prominent Norwegian sports figure \u2014 Linda Helleland, the nation\u2019s minister of children and equality, who also serves as the vice president of the antidoping agency \u2014 proposed an overhaul of global sport\u2019s antidoping system in the wake of the Russian doping scandal.\u201cWhy has it been so difficult to secure universal acceptance of the facts?\u201d Helleland wrote in a proposal circulated privately among WADA executives and obtained by The New York Times. Her analysis of the scandal is expected to be discussed at the organization\u2019s foundation board meeting next month. \u201cHow can we avoid the confusion that arose when Russian athletes were treated differently from sport to sport and sometimes within one sport?\u201dIn an interview in Austria in December, Besseberg called the rash of Russian doping violations damaging and said that in reviewing suspicious cases, he had considered each athlete\u2019s circumstances individually.\u201cWe are handling cases and taking our decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cWADA can appeal if they don\u2019t agree with our decisions.\u201dThe full scope of the Russian doping program was revealed by Grigory Rodchenkov, a former director of the country\u2019s antidoping laboratory. Rodchenkov, who is in hiding in the United States, provided details of abuses in biathlon, according to his lawyer, Jim Walden.\u201cDr. Rodchenkov has been cooperating with the investigation of the International Biathlon Union, and with other investigations,\u201d Walden said in a statement. \u201cWe are hopeful that all doping fraud and corruption in international sports is fully exposed, and we will continue to work diligently to make that a reality.\u201dIn an interview published earlier Wednesday, Rodchenkov told NRK, the Norwegian broadcaster, that biathlon officials had ignored suspicious blood passport results registered by Russian biathletes. Instead of investigating the anomalies, officials simply sent the information to Russia\u2019s antidoping agency, which was itself at the center of the cheating scheme.\u201cRussia received sensitive information from I.B.U., with a message to take care of it,\u201d Rodchenkov said, according to NRK. Rodchenkov\u2019s claims of a sophisticated scheme to replace drug-tainted samples with clean ones was validated by three separate independent investigations.Doping by Russian athletes infected biathlon for years, and even after the wider doping program was unmasked, the I.B.U. faced repeated criticism from many of its own members for what they perceived to be weak antidoping policies, and a soft stance toward Russia. That prompted teams from the United States, Ukraine and the Czech Republic to withdraw from last month\u2019s season-ending event in the Russian resort Tyumen.In 2011 Jacques Rogge, then the I.O.C. president, was so concerned about Russia\u2019s biathlon federation that he urged the country\u2019s president at the time, Dmitri A.

{"Headline": "Can Dirt Save the Earth?", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "FeatureAgriculture could pull carbon out of the air and into the soil \u2014 but it would mean a whole new way of thinking about how to tend the land.Supported byThe couple quickly settled into their bucolic new surroundings. Wick began fixing leaks in the barn. Rathmann loved watching the many animals, including ravens, deer and the occasional gopher, from the large porch. She even trained the resident towhees, small brown birds, to eat seed from her hand. So smitten were they with the wildlife, in fact, that they decided to return their ranch to a wilder state. For nearly a century, this had been dairy country, and the rounded, coastal hills were terraced from decades of grazing. Wick and Rathmann would often come home and find, to their annoyance, cows standing on their porch. The first step they took toward what they imagined would be a more pristine state was to revoke the access enjoyed by the rancher whose cows wandered their property.Within months of the herd\u2019s departure, the landscape began to change. Brush encroached on meadow. Dried-out, uneaten grass hindered new growth. A mysterious disease struck their oak trees. The land seemed to be losing its vitality. \u201cOur vision of wilderness was failing,\u201d Wick told me recently. \u201cOur na\u00efve idea was not working out so well.\u201dWick was especially bothered by the advance of a prickly, yellow-flowered invasive weed called the woolly distaff thistle. He pulled it, mowed it, doused it with herbicides. But the distaff kept moving into what had been pasture. He thought about renting goats to eat the weeds and brush, but they were too expensive. He even considered introducing wild elk, but the bureaucratic hurdles seemed too onerous.Then Wick and Rathmann met a rangeland ecologist named Jeff Creque. Instead of fighting against what you dislike, Creque suggested, focus on cultivating what you want. Squeeze out weeds by fostering conditions that favor grasses. Creque, who spent 25 years as an organic-pear-and-apple farmer in Northern California before earning a Ph.D. in rangeland ecology, also recommended that they bring back the cows. Grasslands and grazing animals, he pointed out, had evolved together. Unlike trees, grasses don\u2019t shed their leaves at the end of the growing season; they depend on animals for defoliation and the recycling of nutrients. The manure and urine from grazing animals fuels healthy growth. If done right, Creque said, grazing could be restorative.This view ran counter to a lot of conservationist thought, as well as a great deal of evidence. Grazing has been blamed for turning vast swaths of the world into deserts. But from Creque\u2019s perspective, how you graze makes all the difference. If the ruminants move like wild buffalo, in dense herds, never staying in one place for too long, the land benefits from the momentary disturbance. If you simply let them loose and then round them up a few months later \u2014 often called the \u201cColumbus method\u201d \u2014 your land is more likely to end up hard-packed and barren.Wick was persuaded. He began preparing for the cows\u2019 return. He dug wells for water, pounded in steel posts and strung nonbarbed wire. He even bought a molasses lick to supplement the animals\u2019 diet of dry thatch. He didn\u2019t want medicated livestock excreting drugs that might harm the worms and insects living in his soil \u2014 most cows are routinely dewormed \u2014 so he tracked down a herd of untreated cows and borrowed them for the summer of 2005.The cows beat back the encroaching brush. Within weeks of their arrival, new and different kinds of grass began sprouting. Shallow-rooted annuals, which die once they\u2019re chewed on, gave way to deep-rooted perennials, which can recover after moderate grazing. By summer\u2019s end, the cows, which had arrived shaggy and wild-eyed after a winter spent near the sea, were fat with shiny coats. When Wick returned the herd to its owner that fall, collectively it had gained about 50,000 pounds. Wick needed to take an extra trip with his trailer to cart the cows away. That struck him as remarkable. The land seemed richer than before, the grass lusher. Meadowlarks and other animals were more abundant. Where had that additional truckload of animal flesh come from?Creque had an answer for him. The carbohydrates that fattened the cows had come from the atmosphere, by way of the grass they ate. Grasses, he liked to say, were like straws sipping carbon from the air, bringing it back to earth. Creque\u2019s quiet observation stuck with Wick and Rathmann. It clearly illustrated a concept that Creque had repeatedly tried to explain to them: Carbon, the building block of life, was constantly flowing from atmosphere to plants into animals and then back into the atmosphere. And it hinted at something that Wick and Rathmann had yet to consider: Plants could be deliberately used to pull carbon out of the sky.Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, agricultural practices and animal husbandry have released an estimated 135 gigatons \u2014 135 billion metric tons \u2014 of carbon into the atmosphere, according to Rattan Lal, a soil scientist at Ohio State University. Even at current rates, that\u2019s more than a decade\u2019s worth of carbon dioxide emissions from all human sources. The world is warming not only because fossil fuels are being burned, but also because soils, forests and wetlands are being ravaged.In recent years, some scientists have begun to ask whether we can put some of that carbon back into the soil and into living ecosystems, like grasslands and forests. This notion, known as carbon farming, has gained traction as it becomes clear that simply reducing emissions will not sufficiently limit global warming. According to the 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an authority on climate science that operates under the auspices of the United Nations, humankind also needs to remove some of the carbon already in the atmosphere to avoid, say, the collapse of polar glaciers and the inundation of coastal cities worldwide. \u201cWe can\u2019t just reduce emissions,\u201d Keith Paustian, a soil scientist at Colorado State University and an author of an earlier I.P.C.C. report, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s all hands on deck. Things like soil and land use \u2014 everything is important.\u201dSome of the proposed methods to begin this drawdown include scrubbing the air with great air-conditioner-like machines; fertilizing the oceans with iron dust to prompt algal blooms that, when they die, carry captured carbon to the bottom of the sea; capturing and storing the carbon dioxide that results when energy is produced by burning trees and other plants that removed carbon from the atmosphere during their growth; and crushing and spreading certain types of rock, like basalt, that naturally absorb atmospheric carbon. None of these approaches are yet proved or affordable at the scale needed to make a difference. The most obvious hurdle is the additional energy some of them require, which, unless it comes from a free, renewable source, adds more costs.Plants, however, remove carbon from the atmosphere already, require no additional power and grow essentially free. During photosynthesis they harness the sun\u2019s energy to make sugars by combining hydrogen atoms (acquired from water molecules) with carbon atoms (from carbon dioxide), while emitting oxygen as a byproduct. (Lest we forget, the fossil fuels that now power civilization contain carbon removed from the air during photosynthesis millions of years ago.) Every spring, as the Northern Hemisphere greens, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dips, before rising again the following fall and winter as foliage dies. Some scientists describe this fluctuation as the earth breathing.Nearly all the carbon that enters the biosphere is captured during photosynthesis, and as it moves through life\u2019s web, every organism takes a cut for its own energy needs, releasing carbon dioxide as exhaust. This circular voyage is the short-term carbon cycle. Carbon farming seeks to interfere with this cycle, slowing the release of carbon back into the atmosphere. The practice is often conceptualized and discussed in terms of storing carbon, but really the idea is to change the flow of carbon so that, for a time at least, the carbon leaving a given ecosystem is less than the carbon entering it.Dozens of land-management practices are thought to achieve this feat. Planting or restoring forests, for one: Trees lock up carbon in woody material. Another is adding biochar, a charcoal made from heated organic material, directly to soil. Or restoring certain wetlands that have an immense capacity to hold carbon. (Coal beds are the fossilized remains of ancient marshes and peatlands.)More than one-third of earth\u2019s ice-free surface is devoted to agriculture, meaning that much of it is already managed intensively. Carbon farming\u2019s fundamental conceit is that if we change how we treat this land, we could turn huge areas of the earth\u2019s surface into a carbon sponge. Instead of relying solely on technology to remove greenhouse gases from the air, we could harness an ancient and natural process, photosynthesis, to pump carbon into what\u2019s called the pedosphere, the thin skin of living soil at the earth\u2019s surface. If adopted widely enough, such practices could, in theory, begin to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, nudging us toward a less perilous climate trajectory than our current one.In a 2016 paper, Pete Smith, a soil scientist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, and the influential climate scientist James Hansen argued that land-management practices are one of the few affordable options available today for drawing down carbon. \u201cWhat\u2019s surprising to me is that we\u2019ve not done it sooner,\u201d says Smith, who is also a lead author on a recent U.N. report that explores carbon-dioxide-removal technologies. \u201cThis has the potential to make a huge difference.\u201d Otherwise, Hansen told me, we\u2019re leaving the problem to our grandchildren. \u201cThat assumption that somehow young people, and people later this century, are going to figure out how to suck it out of the air \u2014 that\u2019s a pretty big burden to place on them,\u201d he said.The I.P.C.C. is preparing a special report on climate change and land use, to be finalized in 2019, that will consider in greater detail the potential of sequestering carbon in soil. But for now the biggest international effort to promote carbon farming is a French-led initiative called \u201cfour per 1,000.\u201d The proposal aims to increase the amount of carbon in the soil of crop- and rangelands by 0.4 percent per year through a variety of agricultural and forestry practices. These include agroforestry (growing trees and crops together increases carbon retention), no-till agriculture (plowing causes erosion and carbon loss) and keeping farmland covered (bare dirt bleeds carbon). Doing so, the French argue, could completely halt the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide.Few experts I spoke to think the impact would be quite that grand; Pete Smith, for example, estimates that soil could, at the most, store just 13 percent of annual carbon-dioxide emissions at current levels. \u201cI appreciate that everyone wants to save the planet,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut we shouldn\u2019t fool ourselves that this is all we need to do.\u201d Even so, the four-per-1,000 goal highlights how a relatively small annual increase in soil carbon could, on a large-enough scale, have a substantial impact. Increasing soil carbon could yield other benefits, too: Improvements in soil fertility, water retention and greater crop resilience would help agriculture adapt to a warming world. More soil carbon would also reduce the amount of fertilizer needed, decreasing emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide, a byproduct of excess nitrogen fertilization. It would be profoundly appropriate if agriculture, whose modern practices have themselves contributed to climate change, could become part of its solution. Farming, responsible for the birth of civilization, could now help save it.Silver was skeptical that she could measure what was likely to amount to very small changes in his land\u2019s soil carbon. The endeavor seemed akin to looking for cups of water added to a swimming pool. But she did sketch out a way to arrive at a definitive answer. When Wick offered to underwrite such a study, she warned him that he might not like the results. She wasn\u2019t just going to tell him what he wanted to hear. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I had to work with her,\u201d Wick recalls.Silver agreed to the project, which she began that year. Seeking baseline values for the carbon concentrations in the soil, she and her students collected samples from different rangelands in Marin and Sonoma Counties. The samples with the most carbon, it turned out, came from current and former dairy farms. What distinguished these operations, she learned, was that they often sprayed manure onto their pastures; this was done both to fertilize the land and dispose of waste. Apparently, how soil was treated could very much affect its carbon content \u2014 a surprise. The larger implication was that people could potentially \u201cgrow\u201d soil carbon deliberately.But how quickly could they do so? Silver found an answer, in part, by looking for nuclear fallout. In the mid-20th century, radioactive carbon isotopes were spewed into the atmosphere as a result of aboveground nuclear tests. Plants around the world absorbed those isotopes during photosynthesis, effectively turning them into a time stamp. Wherever that carbon shows up, it must have arrived there relatively recently. On dairy farms, Silver found the isotopes a full three feet below the surface. This was another surprise. Conventional wisdom holds that it takes perhaps hundreds of years for carbon-rich topsoil to accumulate. On these dairy farms, however, atmospheric carbon had pushed deep into the earth in a matter of decades.Wick wanted to know if he could deliberately replicate this process on his ranch \u2014 but without manure, which, as it decomposes, can release potent greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. The former traps about 30 times as much heat as carbon dioxide, the latter 300 times as much. As a carbon-farming tool, manure might be self-defeating.Jeff Creque, a onetime organic farmer, had a suggestion: Why not use compost? Compost can contain manure, but whereas manure alone can release nitrogen as nitrous oxide, the nitrogen in compost becomes locked up in complex molecules. At least in theory, that limits the escape of a powerful greenhouse gas. In 2008, Wick, Silver and Creque spread several semi trucks full of the stuff, purchased from a composting plant near Sacramento, onto Wick\u2019s ranch and on another ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. In total, it amounted to about half an inch spread over three acres.After three years, Wick was disappointed to discover that grazing on its own wasn\u2019t leading to carbon sequestration. In fact, the soil lost carbon in untreated control plots. No one knows precisely why, but grasslands throughout California are bleeding carbon. European settlers introduced shallow-rooted annual grasses to the state, which partly displaced deeper-rooted perennial grasses. So carbon put into the ground long ago by deep-rooted grasses may now be seeping out. That\u2019s what made the treated plots so remarkable. They had the same history and were exposed to the same conditions, but instead of losing carbon, they absorbed it \u2014 at a rate equivalent to nearly 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide per acre per year. That\u2019s roughly equal to your car\u2019s emissions if you drove from Miami to Seattle.Silver had thought that the compost would simply break down, releasing its carbon back into the atmosphere or, worse, produce nitrous oxide. But those emissions never occurred; moreover, judging by its chemical signature, most of the carbon moving into the soil came from the air, not the compost. The compost appeared to help the plants draw more carbon from the atmosphere than they otherwise would have.When it comes to mitigating climate change, soil scientists are most interested in what Silver calls occluded carbon \u2014 organic material, often in the form of dead microbes, trapped in clods of dirt. This type of carbon can potentially stay locked away for centuries. (Another carbon type, called labile carbon, continuously cycles among the atmosphere, plants and organisms in the soil.) It was precisely this more durable carbon, Silver discovered, that increased in the treated plots.Her findings corresponded with a shift in recent decades in scientists\u2019 understanding of how soil carbon forms. Previously they emphasized how dead organic material had to physically work its way into the soil. But the newer model stressed the importance of living plants. Their rootlets are constantly dying, depositing carbon underground, where it\u2019s less likely to go airborne. And perhaps more important, as plants pull carbon from the air, their roots inject some of it into the soil, feeding microorganisms and fungi called mycorrhiza. An estimated 12,000 miles of hyphae, or fungal filaments, are found beneath every square meter of healthy soil. Some researchers refer to this tangled, living matrix as the \u201cworld wood web.\u201d Living plants increase soil carbon by directly nourishing soil ecosystems.In the years that followed, Silver\u2019s analyses of soil cores indicated that the treated land kept taking in carbon. Computer simulations suggest that it will continue to do so for decades. It also retained more moisture and grew about 50 percent more grass. One dose of compost ignited what Silver calls a state change: The plants and the soil \u2014 and everything that inhabited it \u2014 moved toward a new equilibrium in which the soil ecosystem pulled in and retained greater amounts of carbon.Silver began publishing her findings in scientific journals in 2010. Her second paper, written with her postdoc Marcia DeLonge and the graduate student Rebecca Ryals, offered a remarkable bit of extrapolation. California has about 56 million acres of rangeland, the single largest type of land use in the state. If compost made with manure was applied to just 5 percent of that area, they calculated, it would offset emissions from about 80 percent of the state\u2019s agricultural sector \u2014 all the cows raised, crops grown, fertilizer applied and tractors driven in California. Much of that offset came from diverting manure from festering lagoons \u2014 where it releases methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere \u2014 into compost, a one-time benefit. But the ongoing drawdown of carbon dioxide from enhanced grass growth could be important, too. If you treated 41 percent of the state\u2019s rangeland, Silver told me, carbon pumped into the earth by photosynthesis might render the entire agricultural sector of the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy carbon-neutral for years to come.Farmers\u2019 obsession with soil health isn\u2019t new, of course. It has been a preoccupation for ages. But modern, conventional agriculture has largely relied on synthetic fertilizer to compensate for losses in natural fertility. And while fertilizers help plants grow, some evidence suggests that they can, in excess, accelerate the loss of carbon from the soil. An influx of nutrients may feed precisely those microbes that release carbon back into the atmosphere. Plants may also excrete less carbon into the earth when bathed in synthetic fertilizers, causing the ancient relationship among plant roots, soil fungi and microbes \u2014 the symbiosis that increases soil carbon \u2014 to fray.In recent years, the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service, which was founded in response to the Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s, has promoted the fostering of soil carbon as an important farming practice. But one of the more remarkable aspects of the regenerative-agriculture movement is that it has been driven largely by farmers themselves. Its proponents fret over soil carbon not necessarily because the N.R.C.S. tells them to, or because they worry about the planet\u2019s fate. They have discovered that doing so can help their bottom line.Darin Williams is one such farmer. He lives near Waverly, Kan., with his wife, Nancy, in a tidy, gray-painted house with a stone chimney. A life-size plastic deer sits on his front lawn, run through with arrows; he uses it for target practice to sharpen his hunting skills. He\u2019s a big man with a baby face and a mischievous squint. When he drove me around his farm last October in his red \u201cone-tonner\u201d pickup truck, he talked incessantly about soil.For nearly 20 years, Williams worked as a contractor, building houses in Kansas City. But work dried up after the financial crisis hit in 2007. Williams decided to return to the family farm near Waverly, an area of gently rolling plains, and give farming a try. His family had farmed some when he was a teenager before leasing the land to tenants for years, and he knew it was difficult to make ends meet. But he was inspired by an article about a North Dakota rancher and farmer named Gabe Brown, who claimed to have developed, through trial and error, a more efficient and cost-effective way to farm.The gist of Brown\u2019s argument was that if you focus on the health of the soil and not on yield, eventually you come out ahead, not necessarily because you grow more corn or wheat per acre but because the reduction in spending on fertilizer and other inputs lets you produce each bushel of grain more cheaply. Williams decided to follow Brown\u2019s prescription. \u201cIf after three years, I\u2019m bankrupt, I\u2019ll admit it was a bad joke,\u201d Williams remembers thinking.Seven years later, his gamble seems to have paid off. He started with 60 acres, now farms about 2,000 and, when I visited last fall, had just purchased an additional 200. In one of his fields, we walked down a lane he had mowed through his warm-weather cover crops \u2014 plants grown not to be harvested, but to enrich the soil \u2014 which towered over us, reaching perhaps eight feet. They included sorghum, a canelike grass with red-tinted tassels spilling from the tops, mung beans and green-topped daikon radishes low to the ground. Each plant was meant to benefit the earth in a different way. The long radishes broke it up and drew nutrients toward the surface; tall grasses like sorghum produced numerous fine rootlets, adding organic material to the land; legumes harbored bacteria that put nitrogen into the soil. His 120-strong herd of British white cattle \u2014 he introduced livestock in 2013 \u2014 would eventually eat through the field, turning the plants into cow patties and enriching the soil further. Then he would plant his cash crops. \u201cHad I not found this way to farm,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe would not be farming.\u201dA mat of dead vegetation \u2014 from cover crops, cash-crop residue and dung \u2014 covered Williams\u2019s fields. The mulch, along with his cover crops, inhibited weeds from becoming established, a major concern for conventional farmers, because so many weeds have evolved resistance to herbicides. \u201cI don\u2019t lie awake at night wondering how I\u2019m going to kill weeds,\u201d Williams said.Williams doesn\u2019t till his fields. By minimizing soil disturbance, no-till farming prevents erosion, helps retain moisture and leaves the soil ecosystem \u2014 worms, fungi, roots and more \u2014 mostly intact. At one of his soybean fields, Williams showed me how this translated to soil with \u201cstructure.\u201d \u201cSee how that crumbles into a cottage-cheese look?\u201d he said, massaging a fistful of earth. Small clods fell through his fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want.\u201d Worm holes riddled the dirt, giving it a spongelike quality that was critical, he said, for absorbing rain and preventing runoff. Weather patterns seemed to be changing, he noted. Rain used to arrive in numerous light storms. Now fewer storms came, but they were more intense. \u201cWe have to be able to capture rain and store it,\u201d he said.By focusing on soil health, Williams says he has reduced his use of herbicides by 75 percent and fertilizers by 45 percent. He doesn\u2019t use pesticides \u2014 he relies instead on beneficial insects for pest control \u2014 and he saves money by not buying expensive genetically modified, herbicide-resistant seed. He estimates that he produces a bushel of soybeans for about 20 percent less than his conventionally farming neighbors. Last fall, he claims, his yields ranked among the highest in the county. While doing all this, he has so far raised the amount of soil organic matter, a rough predictor of soil carbon concentrations, from around 2 percent to 3.5 percent in some fields. Gabe Brown, for his part, says he has more than tripled his soil carbon since the 1990s. And an official with the U.S.D.A.\u2019s Agricultural Research Service confirmed to me that the amount of carbon in Brown\u2019s soil \u2014 what his farming has pulled from the atmosphere \u2014 was between two and three times as high as it was in his neighbors\u2019 land.The successes of Brown and Williams suggest that farmers can increase carbon in the soil while actually reducing their overall expenses. This could be vital, because in order for carbon farming to have an impact on the climate, as much land as possible, including both crop- and rangeland, will have to be included in the effort.Critics of regenerative agriculture say that it can\u2019t be adopted broadly and intensively enough to matter \u2014 or that if it can, the prices of commodities might be affected unfavorably. Mark Bradford, a professor of soils and ecosystem ecology at Yale, questions what he sees as a quasi-religious belief in the benefits of soil carbon. The recommendation makes sense intuitively, he told me. But the extent to which carbon increases crop yield hasn\u2019t been quantified, making it somewhat \u201cfaith-based.\u201dWilliam Schlesinger, an emeritus soil scientist at Duke, points out that \u201cregenerative\u201d practices might inadvertently cause emissions to rise elsewhere. If you stop tilling to increase soil carbon, for example, but use more herbicides because you have more weeds, then you probably haven\u2019t changed your overall emissions profile, he says. He thinks the climate-mitigation potential of carbon farming has been greatly oversold.Williams has reduced his herbicide use, not increased it, but Schlesinger\u2019s broader point \u2014 about the need for a careful overall accounting of greenhouse gases \u2014 is important. Williams, Brown and others like them aren\u2019t focused on climate change; no one really knows if the carbon they put in the ground more than offsets the methane produced by their cows, for example. What they do demonstrate is that augmenting soil carbon while farming is not only possible, but also beneficial, even in a business sense. And that makes the prospect of rolling out these practices on a larger scale much easier to imagine.In the absence of federal leadership on climate \u2014 and as emissions continue to rise globally, shrinking the time available to forestall worst-case outcomes \u2014 state and local governments (as well as nonprofits) have begun to look into carbon farming. Last year, Hawaii passed legislation meant to keep it aligned with the Paris agreement, which President Trump has said he will abandon; the state has also created a task force to research carbon farming. The New York state assemblywoman Didi Barrett introduced legislation that would make tax credits available to farmers who increase soil carbon, presumably through methods like those employed by Darin Williams and Gabe Brown. A bill to educate farmers about soil has been proposed in Massachusetts. And in Maryland, legislation focused on soil health passed in 2017. Other carbon-farming projects are in the works in Colorado, Arizona and Montana.But it is California, already in the vanguard on climate-mitigation efforts, that has led the way on carbon farming. By 2050, the state aims to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 20 percent of what they were in 1990. Nearly half its 58 counties have farmers and ranchers at various stages of developing and implementing carbon-farming plans. San Francisco, which already has the largest urban composting program in the country, hopes to become a model carbon-farming metropolis. Cities don\u2019t have much room to plant trees or undertake other practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere, says Deborah Raphael, the director of San Francisco\u2019s Department of the Environment. But they can certainly produce plenty of compost. \u201cIf we can show other cities how doable it is to get green waste out of landfills, we can prove the concept,\u201d Raphael told me. \u201cWe like to say that San Francisco rehearses the future.\u201dMany of California\u2019s carbon-farming efforts owe a debt to Wick, Creque and Silver. In 2008, they founded the Marin Carbon Project, a consortium of ranchers, scientists and land managers. The goal is to develop science-based carbon-farming practices and to help establish the incentives needed to encourage California farmers to adopt them. Silver continues to publish her findings in respected journals. Creque also started a nonprofit, the Carbon Cycle Institute, that assists farmers and ranchers in making carbon-farming plans.Wick has thrown himself into the policy realm, hiring a lobbyist in Sacramento to push a carbon-farming agenda. (In 2014, he even testified before Congress, outlining the project\u2019s discoveries and explaining how compost could increase soil carbon on public lands. He deliberately mentioned \u201cclimate\u201d only once.) Educating policymakers matters because, as Torri Estrada, executive director of the Carbon Cycle Institute, points out, carbon-mitigation efforts that focus on agriculture can be much cheaper per ton of carbon avoided than the flashier energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects that usually get most of the attention. The major obstacle to their implementation, he says, is that government officials don\u2019t understand or know about them.California\u2019s Healthy Soils Initiative, which Wick helped shape, explicitly enlists agriculture in the fight against climate change. In principle, that means this carbon farmers can receive money from the state\u2019s climate-mitigation funds not just for compost but also for 34 other soil-improving practices already approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. That\u2019s important because the compost needed to cover just a few acres can cost thousands of dollars. Wick has also tried to tap federal funding. Once N.R.C.S. scientists vet Silver\u2019s work, a compost amendment could become the service\u2019s 35th recommendation. As a result, farm bill money, which farmers receive to subsidize food production, could help finance carbon farming done according to Wick\u2019s protocol \u2014 not to fight climate change explicitly (which is now seen as politicized), but to bolster the health of soil (which isn\u2019t).As a carbon-farming tool, compost bears some notable advantages \u2014 namely, it works both preventively and correctively. Composting prevents emissions from the starter material \u2014 manure, food scraps \u2014 that, if allowed to decompose, might emit potent greenhouse gases. (About one-fifth of United States methane emissions comes from food and other organic material decomposing in dumps.) By enhancing plant growth, it also aids in removing carbon from the atmosphere, a corrective process. And because the carbon in nearly all organic material was originally pulled from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, compost that enters the soil represents the storage of carbon removed from the air earlier \u2014 the grass eaten by cows that became manure, or the trees that became wood chips \u2014 and at a different location. That, too, is corrective.Calla Rose Ostrander, Wick\u2019s right-hand person at the Marin Carbon Project, told me that the project\u2019s greater goal is to completely reframe how we think about waste, to see it as more than a nuisance \u2014 to recognize it as a resource, a tool that can help us garden our way out of the climate problem. Before the modern era, farmers had no choice but to return human and animal waste to the fields. (Wick is looking into the possibility of composting human waste as well; the end product is called humanure.) In a sense, Wick and Ostrander seek to resurrect these ancient practices and, with the aid of modern science, to close the loop among livestock, plants, air and soil \u2014 and between cities and the agricultural land that feeds them.But the group also has critics. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical of their results and their claims,\u201d William Horwath, a soil scientist at the University of California, Davis, told me. He wants to see Silver\u2019s experiments replicated. This is the project\u2019s major weakness: Its big idea is based almost entirely on extrapolation from a few acres in California. At this point, it\u2019s impossible to say whether compost can cause land to become a carbon sponge in all climates and conditions, and for how long treated grassland will continue to take in and retain its carbon.Cows, a flash point in any discussion about climate change, may also present problems. Ruminants burp methane, and while carbon farming does not require their presence, some argue that merely accepting them on the land undermines the goal of reaching a carbon-neutral or -negative future. Livestock emissions account for almost half the heat-trapping gases associated with agriculture, so an obvious way to reduce emissions is to decrease the number of cows on the planet. Instead of dumping compost on rangeland, says Ian Monroe, a lecturer on energy and climate at Stanford University, why not allow forests cleared for pasture to regrow, and change people\u2019s eating habits so they include less meat?Criticism is directed at compost too. The stuff requires energy to produce; huge machines are required to shred the material and keep it aerated. And it\u2019s unclear if compost, like synthetic fertilizer, can cause nitrogen pollution when put on the land, or how much greenhouse gas composting itself generates. (As long as compost mounds are regularly aerated to prevent low-oxygen conditions, composting is thought to produce few emissions.)Organic material from municipal sources can contain bits of plastic and glass, which no one wants on their fields. Manure might carry seeds of invasive plants. (Silver has seen no evidence of this.) Spreading compost on public rangeland could disrupt plant communities, squeezing out species adapted to conditions of scarcity. And in any carbon-farming scheme, who will monitor and verify that far-flung stretches of land are really absorbing and storing the carbon as they\u2019re supposed to?Horwath considers the amount of compost used in Silver\u2019s research \u2014 about 10 times the usual application, he estimates \u2014 to be unrealistically high for practical use. \u201cIt seems an inordinately large amount to apply to any system,\u201d he told me. And given what he sees as the many unknowns in Silver\u2019s research, that compost would be put to better use on cropland where, he says, scientists know with greater certainty that it could improve water retention and the efficiency of fertilizer.Then there\u2019s the problem of supply. Demand for San Francisco\u2019s compost, which mostly goes to vineyards in California\u2019s wine country, already outstrips what\u2019s available. But Wick thinks more starter material shouldn\u2019t be hard to find: Americans throw out between 30 and 40 percent of all the food they buy, sending it to landfills where it rots and generates greenhouse gases. Silver has calculated that there\u2019s enough organic waste material in California to treat one-quarter of its rangeland every few decades.Still, given the energy requirements, the logistical headaches and the cost, skeptics question whether spreading compost across extensive portions of the world\u2019s surface \u2014 including conflict zones in the Sahel or Central Asia \u2014 is really feasible. Even if it is, soils probably can\u2019t soak up carbon indefinitely. If they have a saturation point, increases in carbon will eventually stop when that moment is reached. And because soil degradation can cause the release of whatever carbon it holds, treated lands would have to be well cared for in perpetuity.Down the road, he showed me a composting facility that Creque dreamed up initially. He and Wick hoped it would serve as a self-sustaining prototype. \u201cAnything that has ever been alive can be composted,\u201d he told me, surveying the 10-foot-tall piles of chicken droppings and feathers, horse bedding (manure and straw) and shredded trees. A tractor mixed woody refuse with animal waste \u2014 to get the composting process started requires the right mix of carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. (That\u2019s why some backyard composters recommend urinating on the pile to kick things off: Urine is rich in nitrogen.)Across the lot, a hulking machine straddled rows of steaming black compost, turning them with a metal spinner. Compost has to be regularly \u201cfluffed,\u201d or aerated, Wick explained, to prevent anaerobic microbes from producing methane and nitrous oxide. The manure piles were acrid, but the compost itself had a rich and pleasant odor, like cigars.Wick hopes that facilities like this will someday dot the American agricultural landscape. The idea is to manufacture compost close to both its source material and the place where it will be used, obviating the emissions from carting heavy materials over long distances. The plant also embodied Wick\u2019s contention that composting can help farm carbon and manage waste at the same time. The challenge of affordably creating millions of tons of compost and applying it to great expanses of land is formidable. But there is a pleasing symmetry to the idea that we could use waste to bring the excess carbon in the atmosphere back to Earth, all while making the world lusher and more bountiful.When I first got in touch with Wick, in late 2016, he greeted me with a question: \u201cDo you know how the earth\u2019s atmosphere was oxygenated?\u201d He was referring to a period 2.3 billion years ago when oxygen, produced by photosynthetic organisms, began building up in the atmosphere, prompting a mass extinction and clearing the way for multicellular life (and, eventually, humans).\u201cCyanobacteria?\u201d I guessed.\u201cVery good,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might work.\u201d Evidently I had passed some sort of scientific literacy test. But his bigger point was that living things \u2014 and particularly photosynthetic life \u2014 had always been the great engineers of the planet\u2019s climate. Now, he believed, we could use that fact to our advantage.That sort of cosmic thinking about the planet and its history is ultimately what makes Wick\u2019s vision so compelling and potentially powerful. The essential insight is one often overlooked when we talk about climate change: The element that threatens to smother civilization is also, in different forms, the fundamental building block of life. To prevent carbon from causing misery and destruction, perhaps we just need to change its location. Perhaps we can find a way to pull it from the air and restore it to the earth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tracking Graft, From the Bootlegger to the Mayor", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe scandal began with a routine traffic stop and soon ensnared police officers, a union official, a hedge fund mogul, machers of Orthodox Brooklyn \u2014 even City Hall.When they searched the van, they found nearly 2,000 bottles of top-shelf cognac and a pack of razor blades, which they surmised had been used to remove the bottles\u2019 tax stamps. The driver claimed ignorance. He said that a friend from New York, a man named Hamlet Peralta, had asked him as a favor to drive the brandy from New Hampshire to a church party an hour south of Lowell. But the law was the law, and the driver was arrested for transporting untaxed liquor. His case was soon disposed of with six months of probation and a $1,000 fine.What no one knew at the time was that this two-bit bootlegging run was the tip of a criminal scheme that within three years would be used as evidence in an unimaginably larger case, a federal corruption investigation that would ultimately reach deep into New York City\u2019s highest offices of power. While the inquiry began with Mr. Peralta, it eventually engulfed a Dickensian cast of characters: two Orthodox Jewish businessmen, an influential union leader, a hedge fund mogul, a coterie of top police officials \u2014 even the city\u2019s mayor.Because the case has involved so many people and has moved through the courts in separate pieces, its story, at least so far, has been told in serial increments. Some of the nearly 20 figures it has touched have pleaded guilty. Some have gone to trial. Others have escaped public censure \u2014 except, perhaps, in the headlines. But the sprawling paper trail the case has left behind \u2014 legal filings, trial transcripts and wiretap records \u2014 reveals a larger saga of favor-trading and back-room deals that connects its various players in an intersecting web of venality and vice.In May, the last two targets of the probe \u2014 Jeremy Reichberg, an Orthodox Jewish community leader from Brooklyn, and James Grant, a former Police Department deputy inspector \u2014 will appear in Federal District Court in Manhattan at a bribery trial that will also feature a dozen other uncharged co-conspirators. As it nudges the case toward its conclusion, the trial will reprise the investigation\u2019s central theme: that a culture of graft \u2014 sometimes petty, sometimes serious \u2014 has existed in New York since the days of Tammany Hall.The authorities have never said what tipped them off to Mr. Peralta, but in an affidavit that the Federal Bureau of Investigation used to tap his cellphone, investigators said that in February 2013 an anonymous letter was sent to the Police Department\u2019s anti-corruption nerve center, the Internal Affairs Bureau. The letter, which appears to be the first public mention of the inquiry, contained an explosive allegation: The man in charge of Harlem\u2019s 30th Precinct, Deputy Inspector Ruel Stephenson, was crooked. Specifically, it claimed that the deputy inspector was close with someone named Hamlet and often warned him when the police were planning to inspect his businesses.At that point, Hamlet Peralta owned two businesses in Harlem, a liquor store on West 125th Street and the Hudson River Cafe, a restaurant several blocks to the north. Perched near the water, Hudson River Cafe was known both for its views and its lively \u201cclub nights\u201d that featured bands and D.J.\u2019s. It was also known as a police hangout.A gregarious man born in the Dominican Republic, Mr. Peralta, 39, was friends with several officers from nearby precincts, men who called him \u201cbro\u201d and regularly texted him with gossip. In April 2013, two months after getting the tipster\u2019s letter, Internal Affairs sent undercover detectives to speak with him at his restaurant. According to court papers, the detectives pretended that they wanted Mr. Peralta\u2019s help with \u201can outstanding ticket.\u201d Mr. Peralta told them that he had \u201ca very good relationship with Inspector Stephenson\u201d and trying to be helpful, passed along his number.Within a matter of months, investigators were digging deeper into Mr. Peralta\u2019s business deals. They found two confidential sources who told them that for years Mr. Peralta had purchased spirits out of state \u2014 or sometimes stolen off trucks \u2014 and sold them wholesale to restaurants and nightclubs in violation of his liquor license. They also learned about the role he played in the brandy shipment discovered in the traffic stop in Massachusetts.Mr. Peralta\u2019s bank accounts were particularly suspect. Court filings say that money flowed into them from one person and then out to another in a manner suggesting a Ponzi scheme. The filings also said that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been transferred in recent years to two convicted drug dealers. The records further indicated that Mr. Peralta owed large sums to the state tax authority and was substantially in debt to a capo in the Genovese crime family.But what pushed the case forward \u2014 and finally undid Mr. Peralta \u2014 was a series of seemingly innocuous transactions. In his accounts, court papers said, the authorities found numerous deposits from a company called JSR Capital \u2014 among them, a $250,000 check with \u201cliquor loan\u201d written on its memo line.Following the money, investigators learned that JSR was a real-estate firm with offices on Fifth Avenue, a few blocks south of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. It took its name from the initials of its owner: Jona S. Rechnitz.After attending Yeshiva University in Upper Manhattan, Mr. Rechnitz followed in his father\u2019s footsteps and tried to make a go of it in New York City real estate. For his first few years, those who knew him said, he worked in minor jobs at middling firms like Marcus & Millichap. But in 2007, he edged closer to success, taking a post at Africa Israel USA, the American subsidiary of the international development firm Africa Israel, which was owned by the billionaire diamond dealer Lev Leviev.By his own account, Mr. Rechnitz started slowly at Africa Israel, fetching coffee and picking up dry cleaning for its New York chief executive. But as he later testified, he enjoyed the company\u2019s ambience of \u201ctrophy properties\u201d and \u201cluxury developers.\u201d Within a few years, as he progressed at the firm and eventually became its director of acquisitions, Mr. Rechnitz began to make connections to the machers and scoundrels who populated the world of New York real estate \u2014 something else he seemed to enjoy.\u201cI have never seen a young man so schooled in networking,\u201d said someone who had dealings with him at the time and requested anonymity to avoid the investigation. \u201cHe made his life all about connective tissues. He doesn\u2019t know how to do financial analysis. He doesn\u2019t know how to put together a proposal. He doesn\u2019t have normal business skills. But he knew everyone.\u201dForever on the hunt for people who could help him advance his prestige or career, Mr. Rechnitz noticed one day that one of his Africa Israel clients had custom license plates marked \u201cSheriff\u201d that gave him special parking privileges. \u201cWhen he came to meet me, he would park wherever he wanted,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz later said in court, \u201cand that is something I thought was pretty cool.\u201dMr. Rechnitz wanted his own set of the plates, and the client offered to introduce him to the man who had provided them. His name was Jeremy Reichberg, and he would soon be hosting a charity dinner for the N.Y.P.D.\u2019s football team, the client said. When Mr. Rechnitz learned that \u201ca lot of the higher-ups in the Police Department\u201d would be at the event, he was even more convinced he had to go.So, hustling as always, he bought a $5,000 ticket. Mr. Reichberg, he recalled, was \u201cvery happy with the donation\u201d and arranged for the football team to give him a memorial plaque. \u201cIt made him look good, made me look good,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said, \u201cand we started to become friends.\u201dAside from dabbling in real estate and diamonds, Mr. Reichberg, now 44, also worked as an official liaison between the Police Department and Borough Park\u2019s Orthodox Jewish community. The department uses liaisons throughout the city to keep abreast of the concerns of local residents, but prosecutors say that Mr. Reichberg considered the post as both a public-service job and a personal profit center. In their early meetings, Mr. Rechnitz said, Mr. Reichberg described himself as \u201ca fix-it guy\u201d who used his police connections to help his friends in Borough Park take care of things like parking tickets and moving violations. For rendering these courtesies, he charged a small fee.As the men grew closer, Mr. Reichberg supposedly acknowledged performing other favors. Once, Mr. Rechnitz said, he confessed that he had sent the police to a colleague\u2019s diamond business to chase away a rival who was handing out fliers in front of his store. The police were later \u201crewarded with jewelry,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said.To fulfill these requests, the government says, Mr. Reichberg relied on a stable of pliant police officials. Among them, prosecutors claim, was Mr. Grant, who at that point ran the 72nd Precinct nearby in Sunset Park, and Michael Harrington, an inspector assigned to a larger unit, Patrol Borough Brooklyn South. Mr. Reichberg also had connections, the government says, to a former commander of Borough Park\u2019s 66th Precinct who had left the department to become the police commissioner in Floral Park, N.Y. Court papers say that he had similar relationships in the Westchester County Police Department and the New York courts.\u201cHe had all these connections to police,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz testified. \u201cI didn\u2019t know many people that had connections with police, growing up in Los Angeles, and I thought this would be an awesome tool for me personally and for my business.\u201dNot long after the football dinner, Lev Leviev, the head of Africa Israel, came to New York on a business trip. Wanting to impress him, Mr. Rechnitz called Mr. Reichberg, who, he said, offered to have the police escort Mr. Leviev from his private plane at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel into the city. Prosecutors say that at Mr. Reichberg\u2019s behest, the police shut down one of the tunnel\u2019s lanes so that Mr. Leviev could sail through on his own. \u201cThis is good,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz remembered thinking at the time. \u201cThis will earn me a lot of points.\u201dIn the months that followed, Mr. Rechnitz said, he started joining Mr. Reichberg for expensive dinners at which they entertained police officials and were rewarded with little perks like getting invited behind security lines at the New York City Marathon and the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration in Times Square. The two men developed a dynamic based on their money and connections. \u201cJeremy would deal with more of the details, if something needed to be done,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz later said, \u201cand I would be the guy to basically pay for it.\u201dIn 2011, at age 29, Mr. Rechnitz left Africa Israel and opened JSR Capital. In his later testimony, he claimed to have owned as much as $100 million in holdings at one point. He bought the old Mount Hope Medical Center in the Bronx and, not long after, a building at 238 Madison Avenue in Manhattan. He also owned two townhouses in the East Village and a sprawling complex called Solomon\u2019s Plaza in Borough Park, Brooklyn.But even if his properties were something less than glamorous, JSR gave Mr. Rechnitz a pool of capital to spend on his new friends, and his expenditures were eventually legion. On the witness stand, he testified that during this period he regularly racked up credit card bills of $1 million a year. As one lawyer involved in the case later claimed in court, Mr. Rechnitz often spent more on New York Knicks tickets \u2014 one of his favorite gifts \u2014 than he did on his taxes.As they expanded their network, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg also became more brazen. In February 2013, the government said, they chartered a private jet \u2014 for nearly $60,000 \u2014 and flew Mr. Grant and David Milici, a detective from the 72nd Precinct, to Las Vegas for an all-expense-paid weekend at the Super Bowl. There were tickets to the game, prosecutors said, and luxury suites at the MGM Grand.There was something else, too: a high-priced escort \u2014 \u201ca professional in her industry,\u201d as Mr. Grant\u2019s lawyer later called her \u2014 joined the men on the flight in a special costume that Mr. Reichberg bought: a sexy stewardess\u2019s outfit.In one of his early moves, Chief Banks plucked his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Michael Harrington, from Brooklyn South to work as his executive officer. While this was a coup for Mr. Harrington, it was also one for Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg. After moving into 1 Police Plaza, Mr. Harrington introduced the men to Chief Banks. As Mr. Rechnitz later claimed in court, the fortuitous staffing change gave him \u201caccess to the highest levels at the N.Y.P.D.\u201d \u2014 or what he called a \u201cone-stop shop for assistance.\u201dWithin weeks of Mr. Harrington taking his new job, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg lavished him with gifts, the government said. Mr. Rechnitz sent him Knicks and New York Rangers tickets, court papers say, while Mr. Reichberg helped arrange a contract for a security company his brother owned.Mr. Grant was also still receiving the men\u2019s largess. When he and his family went to Rome in August 2013, Mr. Rechnitz paid a portion of their hotel bill, prosecutors say. A few months later, according to court papers, they bought Mr. Grant a $3,000 watch and spent another $6,000 to install new railings on his house in Staten Island.Then on Christmas Day, prosecutors say, the two religious Jews, who typically wore sober black and white, showed up at the Grant family home dressed as Santa\u2019s elves. They were bearing gifts: a Nintendo set for Mr. Grant\u2019s children and jewelry for his wife. After leaving the presents, the government claimed, they went on to do the same at Mr. Harrington\u2019s house.But the two men clearly saw Chief Banks as their most important contact. Court papers say that in late 2013, they started spending time with him at least twice a month, dining at what Mr. Rechnitz called \u201cthe finest kosher establishments in New York.\u201d They bought Chief Banks a ring, Mr. Rechnitz testified, that had once belonged to Muhammad Ali. (Chief Banks was a fan.) The chief, in turn, met with the men in his office, prosecutors said, letting them park in his reserved spot in the department\u2019s private garage. They went to cigar bars and started taking trips together \u2014 a fact that \u201ccarried weight,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said, when they sought help from other officers.While these arrangements were cozy, they were not necessarily illegal. But one thing troubled the federal agents on the case. As they continued scrutinizing Hamlet Peralta\u2019s bank accounts, they found curious transactions involving Chief Banks.At some point in 2013 \u2014 the record is unclear \u2014 prosecutors say that David Colon, the Police Department\u2019s housing bureau chief, introduced Mr. Peralta to Mr. Rechnitz. Mr. Peralta was, as always, strapped for cash \u2014 \u201cin way over his head,\u201d his own lawyer said \u2014 and at a meeting, he pitched Mr. Rechnitz on investing in his liquor deals. Charging a \u201ccash fee\u201d of 18 percent, Mr. Rechnitz started gathering money from a group of friends and relatives and ultimately invested more than $3 million with Mr. Peralta. Some of that money, the authorities said, came from Chief Banks.The chief was not the only official doing business with Mr. Rechnitz. As he and Mr. Reichberg grew closer to Chief Banks, they were introduced to one of the chief\u2019s old friends, Norman Seabrook, the longtime leader of the Correction Officers\u2019 Benevolent Association, the union for New York City\u2019s jail guards. Though he was a dandy with a taste for cigars and tailored suits, Mr. Seabrook was also a power broker who wielded control over Rikers Island and had numerous connections to local politicians. Immediately, Mr. Rechnitz saw him as a usable commodity.\u201cThis was yet another chapter in my life,\u201d he later said of meeting Mr. Seabrook, \u201cand another thing that I felt no one else had access to.\u201dIn December 2013, a few weeks before their elfin Christmas visits, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg chartered another private jet and took Chief Banks and Mr. Seabrook on a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Mr. Peralta also went along. As Mr. Rechnitz later said: \u201cWe played golf. We relaxed. We smoked cigars. We ate nice.\u201dOne night, after a long bout of drinking, Mr. Rechnitz found himself in Mr. Seabrook\u2019s room at their luxury villa. Amid the palm trees \u2014 and under the influence of local booze \u2014 Mr. Seabrook became emotional. According to Mr. Rechnitz, he launched into a story about his troubles: how he had grown up with a single mother and reached the pinnacle of power in New York, but had little to show for it financially. Mr. Seabrook said his mortgage was crippling him and his beloved dog had just died. Drunk, he opened his shirt, Mr. Rechnitz said, and showed off a tattoo of the dog he had gotten on his chest.Then he broke down.\u201cHe makes, everybody makes, but Norman Seabrook doesn\u2019t make,\u201d Mr. Seabrook told him.\u201cYeah,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz answered, \u201cyou should be making money.\u201dMr. Seabrook agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said, \u201cNorman Seabrook got paid.\u201dMr. Rechnitz knew someone who might pay Mr. Seabrook.Murray Huberfeld, a founder of the hedge fund Platinum Partners, was an old family friend. Mr. Huberfeld\u2019s father and Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s grandfather were from the same part of Poland and had both survived the Holocaust. The two men had vacationed together when Mr. Rechnitz was a child, and when he came to New York City, Mr. Rechnitz reconnected with Mr. Huberfeld and occasionally did business with him. While working in real estate, Mr. Rechnitz had sold Mr. Huberfeld a few apartments in the pricey Apthorp building on the Upper West Side.Beyond his experience as a financier, Mr. Huberfeld was also a major donor to Chabad-Lubavitch synagogues and to various yeshivas in Borough Park. But despite his philanthropic tendencies, he had a checkered past. In 1993, Mr. Huberfeld had been convicted in a fraud case, accused of having someone else take his broker\u2019s license test in his name.Shortly after returning from Punta Cana, Mr. Rechnitz met with Mr. Huberfeld in his office near Carnegie Hall. He wanted to see if Platinum Partners might be interested in investing money from Mr. Seabrook\u2019s union. Platinum Partners was, in fact, looking for institutional investors. It was potentially lucrative for the firm, a small fund that stood out for its double-digit returns, but Mr. Rechnitz told Mr. Huberfeld that there would be a catch if the deal went through: Mr. Seabrook would have to get a kickback.Mr. Huberfeld, prosecutors said, was amenable. Like many hedge funds, Platinum Partners worked on what was known as the \u201c2 and 20\u201d structure: The fund charged 2 percent of the total investment as a management fee and then kept 20 percent of the profits. From that 20 percent, court papers say, Mr. Huberfeld agreed to give a cut to Mr. Seabrook.In March 2014, before the deal was sealed, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg took Mr. Seabrook and Chief Banks on another trip, this time to Israel. They prayed together at the Western Wall, ate at fancy restaurants in Jerusalem and went to the Arab marketplace, where Mr. Rechnitz bought Chief Banks a backgammon set, a game they liked to play together.Within a month of their return, Mr. Seabrook had persuaded his union to invest $10 million from its pension fund into Platinum Partners, the government said. Over the summer, he invested another $10 million from the operating fund. According to court papers, the $20 million play was the largest single-client deal that Platinum Partners had gotten that year. But the last two tranches of $5 million, investigators say, were never approved by the union\u2019s board of directors. Even its treasurer didn\u2019t know.By the end of 2014, prosecutors say, Mr. Seabrook was getting antsy. Although he had invested heavily in Platinum, he had not yet been paid, and he started pressing Mr. Rechnitz for his money. Mr. Rechnitz said he went to Mr. Huberfeld, who complained his fund was having a bad year. In their initial conversations, Mr. Rechnitz had promised Mr. Seabrook that he would make at least $100,000 in the deal. But feeling pinched, the government said, Mr. Huberfeld was now offering only $60,000 \u2014 and even that was a stretch.The payoff was scheduled for Dec. 11, 2014, the government said. Aware that he was chintzing Mr. Seabrook, Mr. Rechnitz said he tried to sweeten deal by tossing in a gift: an $800 Salvatore Ferragamo handbag. He knew that Mr. Seabrook loved the brand. The union leader had once proudly showed Mr. Rechnitz the burgundy suede Ferragamo loafers he was wearing. After Mr. Rechnitz bought the bag, he stuffed it full of cash from his office safe. Then, he said, he met Mr. Seabrook on West 57th Street in Manhattan, climbing into his Chevrolet Suburban, which had pulled up to the curb.Mr. Seabrook was hardly thrilled, Mr. Rechnitz said, to be getting less than he was promised, but their friendship managed to survive. Later that night, the two men met Chief Banks and Mr. Reichberg for dinner on Lexington Avenue and then strolled over to a Torah dedication ceremony at a Chabad-Lubavitch office on Fifth Avenue, where all they danced with the scroll.After that, Mr. Rechnitz said, they retired to the Grand Havana Club for cigars.As entertaining as the night had been, there was something the men didn\u2019t know at the time: All of them were under investigation.The authorities had been on to them for weeks, secretly collecting their conversations through a court-ordered wiretap. The inquiry, which had started with Mr. Peralta, was by now an expansive operation jointly run by Internal Affairs and the New York office of the F.B.I. The initial working theory that tied these threads together was almost inconceivable: that Mr. Peralta was funneling money from Mr. Rechnitz, Mr. Reichberg and Chief Banks through his liquor business into the coffers of a drug dealer.The news set off a flurry of anxious calls and texts. Mr. Peralta immediately sent a message to one of his police friends, exclaiming, \u201cBanks quit!\u201d Not long after, court papers say, Mr. Banks reached out to Mr. Reichberg, saying he had recently seen Mr. Rechnitz, whom he described as \u201cfreaking nervous.\u201d Mr. Banks tried to downplay the tension, telling Mr. Reichberg, \u201cEverything is fine.\u201d But the papers say he also told Mr. Reichberg to get his partner under control. \u201cJust calm him down,\u201d Mr. Banks said.Then, just as it seemed as if the inquiry was finally was taking shape, a bombshell exploded on the wire.Despite their alarm at Mr. Banks retiring, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg never stopped hustling. Within three months, in fact, Mr. Reichberg was caught on the wiretap telling a deputy chief that with Mr. Banks out of the way, he was angling to get Michael Harrington, now a deputy chief himself, promoted to chief of the department.To accomplish the task, Mr. Reichberg told his friend that he would reach out \u201cto the mayor.\u201d\u201cNobody will turn down the mayor,\u201d he said.The men had known Bill de Blasio since before he entered office. Though Mr. Rechnitz had at first supported one of his rivals, William C. Thompson Jr., in an early stage of the 2013 mayor\u2019s race, after Mr. de Blasio won the Democratic primary, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg switched their allegiance and became major donors to the de Blasio campaign.In deciding to back Mr. de Blasio, the men had followed the advice of Fernando Mateo, a local politico who was also an owner of La Marina restaurant in Inwood and worked for a city taxi union. Mr. Rechnitz said that he was introduced to Mr. Mateo by Deputy Chief Colon, Mr. Peralta\u2019s friend. Once Mr. de Blasio secured the nomination, Mr. Mateo boasted that he had \u201can in with Bill de Blasio,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz said. And when Mr. Mateo promised to arrange a meeting with the campaign, Mr. Rechnitz sensed an opportunity.\u201cWe had the police going for us,\u201d he later said in court. \u201cNow it was time to get into politics.\u201dIndeed, within days, prosecutors say, Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg had an audience with Ross Offinger, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign fund-raiser. As Mr. Rechnitz later testified, they told Mr. Offinger: \u201cWe\u2019re going to become significant contributors, but we want access. And when we call, we want answers. When we reach out for things, we want them to get done.\u201dTrue to his word, in early 2014, Mr. Rechnitz donated $50,000 to the Campaign for One New York, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s nonprofit fund-raising and advocacy group. Months later, Mr. Reichberg held a party for Mr. de Blasio at his home in Borough Park at which another $35,000 was raised. That same year, one of Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s companies, JSTD Madison LLC, gave more than $100,000 to the mayor\u2019s pet effort to flip the State Senate back to the control of the Democratic Party.Mr. Rechnitz says that Mr. de Blasio gave him his personal cellphone number and email address and \u201ctold me to call if there\u2019s anything I need \u2014 always be in touch.\u201d Shortly after the election, both men were placed on the mayor\u2019s inaugural committee with celebrities like Russell Simmons, Sarah Jessica Parker and Steve Buscemi.But that was just the beginning, Mr. Rechnitz said, of their attempts to wrangle favors out of City Hall. As Mr. de Blasio got settled into office, Mr. Offinger was met with a barrage of calls from the two men. In one of those calls, Mr. Rechnitz said, he asked for help on behalf of a friend who owned a building on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn and was worried that the local police precinct might buy it out from under him for use as a stationhouse. In another, Mr. Rechnitz requested assistance for a cousin of his wife who ran a school on Manhattan\u2019s east side and was having trouble meeting the city\u2019s building code.One of Mr. Reichberg\u2019s friends had problems with his water bill, and Mr. Rechnitz himself had legal issues with Airbnb at his Madison Avenue property. In a particularly brazen move, Mr. Rechnitz tried at one point to get himself appointed to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s new committee on fighting police corruption.While city officials called and emailed to follow up on some of these pleas, many were rebuffed. Mr. de Blasio has adamantly denied that he did anything wrong. \u201cJona Rechnitz is a liar and a felon,\u201d he said this fall, after Mr. Rechnitz pleaded guilty to honest services fraud and turned state\u2019s evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201dBut at the time, Mr. Rechnitz dreamed of the good turns he hoped to get in exchange for his donations.\u201cMy mind was limitless,\u201d he testified in November. \u201cJeremy had told me in the days of Giuliani, people made a fortune. I was focused on making money, getting my name out there, becoming a big player in town.\u201dIt all came crashing down within a few months in the spring of 2016.On April 8 that year, Mr. Peralta was arrested in Georgia and charged with running what the government described as a $12 million Ponzi scheme. A few weeks later, in a stunning move, Mr. Rechnitz decided to cooperate with the authorities, betraying everyone he worked with. He was facing 20 years in prison and said he signed the cooperation papers \u201cin the hopes of leniency\u201d at sentencing.Once he started talking, the dominoes kept falling.Federal prosecutors have promised to retry the men in July, a few months after Mr. Grant and Mr. Reichberg go on trial. Mr. Rechnitz is scheduled to testify at both trials.In the meantime, though, he has left New York. He now lives in Beverlywood, a neighborhood on the west side of Los Angeles, where he rents a house, he said, for $17,000 a month.Advertisement"}

Does it mean dressing up a familiar tale in different clothes? Reading it against its grain? Replacing parts of a story like boards in a ship, until an old story\u2019s shape is built of entirely new wood? This month, I\u2019m looking at recent books that are all retellings of one sort or another.Throughout \u201cThe Merry Spinster,\u201d gender is as slippery a proposition as happiness. No one called \u201cmerry\u201d actually is so, any more than a daughter is necessarily referred to as \u201cshe.\u201d Girls are named Paul, boys are named Sylvia; love is oppressive, abusive, exploitative and equal-opportunity in its dreadfulness, whether between friends and lovers, parents and children, or children and stuffed animals. The incongruities invite attention, prompt us to question our assumptions about gender with every startling juxtaposition of name and pronoun, and our assumptions about relationships with every pairing where love is vampiric and destructive. Each story makes space for reflection more than it makes claims \u2014 and every page flutters with anxiety so thorough I sometimes had to stand up and walk around before resuming my reading.Perpendicular to its gender play are questions of consent, labor, the warp and weft of gift and debt, all the things we give to and take from one another, especially property and pain. In the title story \u2014 a retelling of \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d \u2014 Beauty encounters the following inscription in the library that\u2019s ostensibly hers:These stories are full of suffocating generosity, aggression so passive it\u2019s like breathing splinters.There\u2019s not a single weak link in the cat\u2019s-breath chain of this collection \u2014 only an initial shock at what sort of experience the book is. If you\u2019re familiar with Ortberg\u2019s work as a humorist, either from The Toast or \u201cTexts From Jane Eyre,\u201d this is something else; even the stories adapted from the \u201cChildren\u2019s Stories Made Horrific\u201d series on The Toast have sharper claws, are more primly vicious. It may ruin tea for you, or teach you something of how not to be a terrible person. Either way, it\u2019s incredible.\u2666Minh is a senior consultant at ESSA, a firm that specializes in restoring and maintaining surface habitats. Minh herself specializes in restoring rivers and has spent decades wrangling underground banks into funding aboveground projects \u2014 until the invention of limited-use time travel turns bankers away from long-term ecological restoration and toward short-term profits from temporal tourism. But when Minh\u2019s intern Kiki draws her attention to a call for proposals to restore the Mesopotamian drainage basin by traveling into the past to study it, she jumps at the chance.Robson\u2019s world-building is fantastic; I\u2019m always grateful for books that fold business and finance systems into their narratives in lively ways. She writes about strategizing on RFPs and securing funding like planning a heist, with absolutely delightful team-assembling dynamics and fake-it-till-you-make-it bravado. I also loved the dynamic between Minh and Kiki, loosely echoing some of the boomer-millennial rhetoric of our present moment in complex and empathetic ways.My only problem with this book is its length; it reads like the first three acts of a perfectly paced and plotted five-act novel, to the point where I wondered if the rest had been cleanly sheared off at the printer\u2019s. It\u2019s a short story\u2019s conclusion to a novel\u2019s worth of development, and while I certainly hope that Robson will write a sequel, I can\u2019t help feeling dismayed by an amazing story that stops instead of ending.\u2666Reading \u201cQueens\u201d is at first a study in finding analogues. While Lear is Lear, his daughters Goneril, Regan and Cordelia become Gaela, Regan and Elia; Edgar and Edmund are Rory and Ban. But the Shakespearean counterparts are at most touchstones for the fully developed characters Gratton writes. Most notably, Gaela and Regan aren\u2019t petty, scheming villains; they\u2019re grieving daughters who\u2019ve had to wonder for years whether their father murdered their mother.Gratton\u2019s decision to make Dalat black, from the empress-ruled Third Kingdom \u201can ocean and half a continent away,\u201d thoroughly enriches the story. A young Gaela is infuriated by the lack of songs praising dark skin; Elia, when she goes abroad, is assumed to be from the Third Kingdom, even though she doesn\u2019t speak its language or know its customs.While the storytelling is certainly decompressed \u2014 the novel has a somewhat ponderous prologue, seven different points of view, and a flashback every other chapter \u2014 \u201cQueens\u201d is always thoroughly engaging; right up until the end, I found myself wondering with increasing urgency whether this story, like \u201cLear,\u201d would end in tragedy.I\u2019ll leave you to wonder, too.An earlier version of this article stated that \u201cThe Queens of Innis Lear\u201d was $36.99.Amal El-Mohtar won the Nebula, Locus and Hugo awards for her short story \u201cSeasons of Glass and Iron.\u201d Her novella \u201cThis Is How You Lose the Time War,\u201d written with Max Gladstone, will be published in 2019.Advertisement"}

Thain is now ready to make another big move.He and his wife, Carmen M. Thain, are selling their duplex penthouse at the venerable 740 Park Avenue co-op building, at East 71st Street, which they had been using as a pied-\u00e0-terre for the last several years.The asking price is $39.5 million, according to the listing broker, John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens, with monthly maintenance of $19,215.\u201cWe love the apartment \u2014 it is wonderful and also irreplaceable \u2014 but we find that we\u2019re just not spending any time there lately,\u201d said Mr. Thain, who described himself as retired after stepping down in 2016 as chief executive and chairman of the CIT Group, the finance company he ran after leaving Merrill Lynch.He and Ms. Thain say they are looking to spend more time in California, where most of their children and grandchildren are living. They already have a beachfront townhouse in Santa Monica, in addition to their main residence in Rye, N.Y.Long regarded as one of New York City\u2019s most prestigious addresses, 740 Park has housed many other wealthy and powerful residents, from John D. Rockefeller Jr., to more recently, the Blackstone Group founder Stephen A. Schwarzman and the billionaire businessman David H. Koch. (Not surprisingly, financing is not permitted for purchases there.) The building was designed in the late 1920s by the architect Rosario Candela and developed by James T. Lee, a grandfather of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who also lived there.\u201cIt appeared to have been abandoned for a number of years,\u201d Mr. Thain said, describing the apartment\u2019s previous condition. \u201cFireplaces were closed up and even the roof-level terrace space was completely shut off.\u201d\u201cI think the previous owner had been wary of intruders,\u201d Ms. Thain added.The unit\u2019s early-20th century charm has since been restored. Throughout the home \u2014 filled with an eclectic mix of antiques, traditional furnishings and striking artwork \u2014 are ornate plaster and wood moldings, Parquet de Versailles hardwood floors, functioning wood-burning fireplaces, French doors and oversize windows. Ceilings on the main level reach 12 feet.\u201cIt\u2019s a very elegant apartment,\u201d Mr. Burger said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t see these kinds of opulent details anymore.\u201dThe apartment has three bedrooms and three and a half baths, plus an office that could be converted into a fourth bedroom. There is ample outdoor space \u2014 with two terraces on the lower level, a wraparound terrace on the top floor and the recreated roof deck \u2014 that provide stunning cityscape and Central Park vistas.\u201cThat\u2019s the best part of this side of 740 Park: You have park views,\u201d Mr. Burger said of the building\u2019s west wing, where the penthouse is situated. \u201cThe light here is just fantastic.\u201dOn the home\u2019s main level, a private elevator landing opens to a stately windowed gallery 27 feet long, with a grand elliptical staircase and entry to a 15-by-14-foot west-facing terrace. The gallery leads to an enormous living room that also connects to the terrace. It is anchored by a richly carved marble fireplace, one of three in the apartment, and flows into the formal dining room.Off the dining room is a butler\u2019s pantry with two dishwashers, and beyond that, a large eat-in kitchen with custom marble flooring and a spacious pantry and laundry area. The kitchen is equipped with stainless-steel appliances like a Wolf stove and Sub-Zero refrigerator and wine cooler and also features a stainless-steel center island.The most eye-catching features in the kitchen are the geometric plaster medallions along the ceiling perimeter \u2014 a design idea of Ms. Thain, who wanted to replicate the ornamental details found at the top of the building\u2019s facade.On the second floor is another spacious gallery, along with a sizable master bedroom with walk-in closets and a fireplace, and a guest bedroom currently being used as a study. Each bedroom has an en-suite marble bath. The master bath features heated floors and a separate soaking tub. Both bedrooms open to the wraparound terrace, with eating and lounging areas.This floor is reachable via the main staircase and service stairs off the kitchen, as well as a private elevator bank off the gallery. A third set of stairs from this floor connects to the teak roof deck, with trellis walls and various plantings like climbing hydrangea.Mr. Thain said the roof deck was one of his favorite spots in the penthouse, and one that he will miss the most. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful space, and it has amazing views.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Fears Being Sidelined by Trump on Trade and North Korea", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 As every Japanese knows, when you travel abroad, you must bring home some \u201comiyage\u201d \u2014 souvenirs.When Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe appeared before reporters in Palm Beach on Tuesday, the American president declared that \u201cJapan and ourselves are locked, and we are very unified on the subject of North Korea\u201d and that Japan and the United States \u201chave never been closer than they are right now.\u201dOn Wednesday in Tokyo, critics were skeptical that Mr. Trump would give Japan much consideration once he got into a room with Mr. Kim.\u201cThe possibility of the U.S. thinking about Japan is zero,\u201d said Terry Ito, a commentator on Nippon Television, from Tokyo.There was a sense in Tokyo on Tuesday that Japan has been sidelined as Mr. Trump cultivates relationships elsewhere in Asia. Though sitting next to Mr. Abe at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump spent nearly as much time effusively praising China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, as \u201cincredibly generous\u201d and \u201ca very special person to me\u201d as he did discussing Japan.Mr. Trump is \u201ccertainly not approaching this summit from the perspective of \u2018Japan is one of our most important allies and how do I keep this relationship strong,\u2019\u201d said Mintaro Oba, a former State Department diplomat and now a speechwriter in Washington.Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cWhile Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I don\u2019t like the deal for the United States.\u201d But South Korea is not currently a party to the agreement.Mr. Trump\u2019s reversal on the trade deal, less than a week after he suggested the United States could enter the pact, reinforced the view that he sees Japan\u2019s interests as expendable.The leaders\u2019 meeting in Florida comes at a time when Mr. Abe needs a political bounce, as domestic scandals have driven approval ratings for his cabinet down as low as 27 percent, according to one poll. Mr. Abe is now even less popular than Mr. Trump.\u201cThe consequence of Prime Minister Abe looking so effective with President Trump in previous summits,\u201d said Mr. Oba, the speechwriter, \u201cis that he has a higher level from which to fall.\u201dAnalysts said that Mr. Abe would most likely proclaim Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment as a victory when he returned home, but the strategy could backfire.\u201cMr. Abe will probably exaggerate his success on the abduction issue when he comes back to Japan,\u201d said Takashi Kawakami, a national security expert at Takushoku University in Tokyo. \u201cBut it\u2019s not enough.\u201dOn Wednesday in Tokyo, Shigeo Iizuka, a brother of Yaeko Taguchi, one of the abducted Japanese citizens, said he wanted concrete results.\u201cI want him to get a definite promise to return the Japanese citizens as well as bringing it up at the table,\u201d Mr. Iizuka told reporters about his hopes for Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with Mr. Kim. \u201cThis is the first and last chance of a lifetime, and I don\u2019t want him to miss this chance.\u201dIn addition to the abductees, Japan is also counting on Mr. Trump for security guarantees. One of Tokyo\u2019s fears is that Mr. Trump might agree to a freeze in North Korea\u2019s weapons program that would leave the country with shorter range missiles that could still reach Japan and South Korea.For now, Japan has been left out of North Korea\u2019s recent charm offensive.\u201cNorth Korea is now talking to the South Koreans, talking to the Chinese, and talking to the Americans, but seems to be trying to isolate Japan,\u201d said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. \u201cSo that\u2019s another negative element or factor\u201d for Mr. Abe.Analysts said Mr. Trump would very likely view a commitment to bring up the abductees with Mr. Kim as a gift to Japan that warranted something in return.\u201cI fear that Japan may be pushed toward getting into talks about a bilateral agreement,\u201d said Jun Saito, a senior research fellow at the Japan Center for Economic Research. \u201cMr. Abe might think that it\u2019s better to get into some kind of negotiation rather than losing Japan\u2019s status in regional politics.\u201dMr. Abe already expended considerable domestic capital to persuade farmers \u2014 traditional supporters of his Liberal Democratic Party \u2014 to accept more foreign agricultural products as part of the TPP.Pushing for more concessions from Japan in a bilateral deal with the United States could put Mr. Abe in an even more politically sensitive position.\u201cCapitulation to Trump here, I would think, would sign his political death warrant,\u201d said Jeffrey Wilson, the head of research at the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia.Mr. Abe\u2019s biggest headaches still remain back in Tokyo, where he is fighting off allegations that he helped friends at two educational institutions gain preferential treatment from the government. Several leaks of tampered files and previously missing documents have deepened the scandals. Additional allegations of sexual harassment by a top official in the Ministry of Finance are also tarring the prime minister\u2019s leadership.In rounds of golf and meetings on Wednesday in Palm Beach, Mr. Abe is likely to try to showcase his friendship with Mr. Trump in the hopes that it will remind voters back home that he is still the best man for the job.\u201cAs for his strong leadership in diplomacy, I think people appreciate that,\u201d said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington. \u201cBut people also think that no one is above the law.\u201dMakiko Inoue and Shiho Takezawa contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump Serious About Trade War? China\u2019s Leaders Hunt for Answers", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In an elegantly furnished back room at a conference in eastern China in December, a member of the Chinese leadership asked American tech executives for help.He has not been alone.In these meetings, the Americans have warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints should be taken seriously because of widespread frustration in Washington with Chinese policies, especially a $300 billion program to dominate critical high-tech industries, known as Made in China 2025, that has alarmed the United States national security establishment.It is unclear whether that message is making it through to Mr. Xi \u2014 or whether he has chosen to ignore it after concluding that Mr. Trump is bluffing and that the United States will back off, as it has in the past.\u201cWhen you have this kind of regime, you want to report the good story,\u201d said Tao Jingzhou, a managing partner at the global law firm Dechert who deals with senior Chinese officials. \u201cI have the impression the leadership is not fully briefed about the seriousness of the atmosphere against China in the U.S. establishment.\u201dDespite this deep bench of expertise, the Chinese leadership appears at a loss, grasping for interlocutors in an American political landscape that has been scrambled by Mr. Trump. For more than two decades, Beijing has watched corporate America make the case for trade with China and one American president after another embrace that agenda. But Mr. Trump has defied that pattern.\u201cChinese experts do not understand the current state of the United States,\u201d said Jie Zhao, a professor at the China Executive Leadership Academy Pudong, which trains senior civil servants in Shanghai. \u201cThey do not understand Trump, do not understand his team and do not understand the source of his policies.\u201dPart of the problem is that the leadership\u2019s usual contacts in the United States \u2014 often establishment figures with backgrounds in international finance and diplomacy \u2014 have been largely sidelined by Mr. Trump.\u201cThe people with whom Chinese officials are familiar in Washington are mainly the enemies of Trump,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cTrump hates those people.\u201dLooking for answers, Vice President Wang has met instead in recent weeks with three former Treasury secretaries \u2014 Timothy Geithner, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Lawrence H. Summers \u2014 as well as Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative, and William S. Cohen, the former defense secretary.Business leaders who have met with Chinese leaders in the same period include Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs.\u201cThey ask, \u2018Who can we talk to?\u2019\u201d said David M. Lampton, the scholar who has recently hosted five Chinese officials. \u201cThey don\u2019t see a stable structure.\u201dBut Professor Lampton, of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, added that despite their frustration, the Chinese seemed satisfied that they can \u201coutlast a U.S. administration that alienates its allies, erodes its own political base and has a public with a low threshold for pain.\u201dThere are vague hints of disagreement in Beijing over how to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade threats. Some in the elite have emphasized the potential impact of a trade war on the Chinese economy and urged negotiations, while others have argued that the dispute is part of a broader effort to thwart China\u2019s rise \u2014 and that Beijing must respond accordingly.\u201cOn the trade war issue, the hawkish atmosphere in China is quite strong right now,\u201d said Chen Jieren, a political commentator in Beijing.Although the tariffs that Mr. Trump has enacted thus far hit only a small segment of China\u2019s steel and aluminum sector, the pain of a proposed additional set would be spread across manufacturers of more than 1,300 goods.Given the party\u2019s tight control of the media, there has been no outcry against Mr. Xi\u2019s policies like that by some American business leaders against Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. It helps that no single sector or region in China stands out as especially vulnerable, though the aerospace industry could be stung and Chinese automakers eyeing exports to the United States would be disrupted.But speaking at the conference, Fan Gang, the director of China\u2019s National Economic Research Institute, warned of \u201csystematic risk\u201d to manufacturing supply chains. And Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, suggested that a trade war could destroy 10 million jobs.One sensitive question in Beijing is the fate of the Made in China 2025 plan, which has been the focus of the Trump administration\u2019s complaints. The program would provide subsidies and loans to help Chinese firms acquire foreign competitors, develop advanced technologies and dominate key sectors such as alternative energy, robotics, telecom and artificial intelligence.The military and security apparatus, and the industries close to them, regard the program as essential to China\u2019s strategic ambitions. But discerning the attitude of China\u2019s economic policymakers is more difficult, and not simply because it would be politically taboo to back away from a plan that Mr. Xi has blessed.Premier Li Keqiang, for example, has tended to take more conciliatory positions in trade disputes than colleagues in the leadership who favor asserting China\u2019s clout as a global power. But Mr. Li also leads a cluster of government ministers who are the main architects and advocates of the Made in China 2025 program.They include Miao Wei, the minister of industry and information technology, and Wang Zhigang, the minister of science and technology. Like Mr. Li, both grew up in central China\u2019s impoverished Anhui Province and favor an extensive role for the state in upgrading Chinese industries, acquaintances said.On the other hand, the policymakers closest to Mr. Xi \u2014 men with finance backgrounds including Mr. Liu and Vice President Wang \u2014 are more interested in seeking geopolitical parity with the United States and less enthusiastic about industrial policy in general.They worry that state intervention may distort markets and exacerbate the problems of China\u2019s already debt-laden financial system, people who know them said.Yet such concerns have not translated into a willingness to retreat on the Made in China 2025 program in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats. \u201cI don\u2019t think China is willing to compromise Made in China 2025,\u201d said Da Wei, a professor at the University of International Relations in Beijing. \u201cThis is the core of the competition.\u201dMr. Xi has charted a moderate course so far, retaliating in equal measure when the Trump administration has imposed tariffs, while urging that the dispute be resolved through negotiation.But talks have stalled since Chinese officials rejected American demands that Made in China 2025 be rolled back. A Chinese spokesman said on Thursday that no actual trade negotiations were underway.Reporting was contributed by Jonathan Ansfield, Javier C.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more?\u2022 Sears shares jumped after ESL called on the Sears to sell the Kenmore brand.\u2022 Walmart is said to be close to gaining a majority stake in Flipkart.\u2022 Mike Bloomberg opened his wallet for climate change.\u2022 Learn more about \u201ctransshipping,\u201d one of President Trump\u2019s big trade bugbears.What might happen to Amazon\u2019s bottom line if it paid its workers more? This question may become more pressing if labor shortages start to force companies to up their pay to attract and retain employees.Amazon does not disclose its total compensation expense, so it\u2019s not possible for outsiders to accurately compute what would happen to profits if it raised pay.But the disclosure of median pay provides a little insight. Under S.E.C. rules, public companies must now disclose the median pay figure for all their employees. In annual filings, that number is then compared with the pay of the chief executive. In Amazon\u2019s case, the $1,681,840 that Jeff Bezos earned in 2017 was 59 times that of the median employee, a lower ratio than exists at other large public companies.One way to get a rough proxy for a company\u2019s overall compensation expense is to multiply its median pay number by its total number of employees. For Amazon, that would produce a purely hypothetical compensation expense of $16.1 billion (566,000 employees times $28,466.)Increasing Amazon\u2019s median pay number by 10 percent would bump the $28,466 up to $31,313, and the putative compensation expense would rise to $17.7 billion. Such an increase would have cut Amazon\u2019s $3.8 billion of pretax income in 2017 by 42 percent to $2.2 billion. A 20 percent raise would have slashed those earnings by 85 percent.How does Amazon stack up against Walmart? The C.E.O. of Walmart, Doug McMillion, made $22.8 million in the company\u2019s latest fiscal year. That sum was 1,188 times as large as the median employee\u2019s pay of $19,177 (a number that excludes some foreign employees.)At Walmart, increasing the hypothetical compensation expense would have less of an impact on earnings. A 10 percent increase would reduce Walmart\u2019s latest annual pretax profits by 28 percent, while a 20 percent pay increase would lower profits by 56 percent.There are two ways to view such numbers. One is that retail is a cutthroat business and wages cannot rise by much if a company is going to be healthily profitable. The other is that large retailers have used their heft to lower as many of their costs as possible, including wages.\u2014 Peter Eavis\u2022 Net profit jumped 73% to $9.4 billion in the first quarter, up from $5.4 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $13.33 per share, beating analyst estimates of $9.28 per share.\u2022 The company reported a $3 billion, or about $3.40 a share, gain on equity securities in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales rose to $31.1 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $30.3 billion.Shares of Alphabet bounced around after hours.

Investors wanting concrete measurements are getting squishy ones instead.\u201dShares of Sears Holding are up about 4 percent in recent trading on Mr. Lampert\u2019s latest attempt to save the troubled retailer.In a letter to the Sears board, Mr. Lampert, whose ESL Investments hedge fund owns a controlling stake in the company, said ESL would also be willing to buy the retailer\u2019s home-services and its appliance-parts units.Mr. Lampert offered to pay Sears $500 million for the home-services and appliance-parts units, but did not mention a price for the Kenmore brand or the real estate. He noted that the company had been trying to sell the assets for nearly two years, but had failed to find other buyers.Mr. Lampert is Sears\u2019s chief executive. Any deal involving Sears and Mr. Lampert is complicated by his dual roles running both the retailer and the hedge fund, which is also a major Sears lender.Mr. Lampert said in his letter that he would recuse himself from any board discussions about his proposal. Any deal would need to be approved by a majority of Sears shareholders not affiliated with ESL, the letter said.\u2014 Michael CorkeryMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said in a statement:\u201cThe way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services. Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won\u2019t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.\u201dThe European Commission is concerned that Shazam\u2019s strong position in music recognition would enable Apple to \u201cobtain access to commercially sensitive data about customers of its competitors.\u201d\u201cAccess to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors\u2019 customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music.

Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute told the NYT, \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is a threat to democracy, but so is Amazon.\u201dThe problem: Customers often aren\u2019t notified when money is transferred; customers are subjected to phishing attacks that drain money from their accounts; buyers have no protections if sellers don\u2019t provide paid-for goods.Why it matters: Banks want their share of digital payments, and 18 so far have signed up with Zelle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Meets With Top Lawmakers Before Hearings", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, tried to get ahead of a week of intense scrutiny for him and his company by visiting several top lawmakers in Washington on Monday and reiterating how sorry he was for the social network\u2019s failings.The prospect that Mr. Zuckerberg, a 33-year-old billionaire, will be taken to task on Capitol Hill has created intense interest and a media circus. On Monday, he was trailed by more than a dozen television cameras and numerous reporters when he exited the office of Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a Senate Commerce Committee leader. Mr. Zuckerberg said nothing as he strode out of an Senate office elevator, accompanied by Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy, who is based in Washington, and Brian Rice, a leading Democratic lobbyist for the social network, among others.Mr. Nelson, who met with Mr. Zuckerberg for an hour, said the chief executive was taking the situation \u201cseriously.\u201dBut when asked whether the meeting helped assuage his concerns about Facebook\u2019s privacy violations, Mr. Nelson said, \u201cCount me as skeptical.\u201d He also said it was to be determined whether Facebook would be able to stave off more foreign disruption in the American midterm elections this fall.\u201cI think he\u2019s trying,\u201d Mr. Nelson said of Mr. Zuckerberg, \u201cbut I think if we don\u2019t get our arms around this, none of us is going to have any privacy anymore.\u201dStaff for Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said Mr. Zuckerberg and the senator were scheduled to meet on Monday. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg met with the Judiciary Committee leaders, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, according to a person briefed on the visits, who asked not to be named because the information was not public.Senator Grassley did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Thune\u2019s and Ms. Feinstein\u2019s offices confirmed the meetings with Mr. Zuckerberg but declined to elaborate.\u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in prepared testimony. \u201cIt was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I\u2019m responsible for what happens here.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg added that Facebook must do more to protect its users\u2019 personal information and summarized some of the measures the Silicon Valley company is taking to lock down the data privacy of its more than 2.2 billion members. Those include blocking app developers from gaining access to the data of users who have been inactive for three months, restricting the ability of users to inadvertently share information about others in their networks and adopting stricter permissions guidelines and search features.In recent days, Facebook also suspended two data analytics companies for inappropriately gathering data from their platform. AggregateIQ, a Canadian firm associated with Cambridge Analytica, was suspended on Friday, Facebook said. The company was accused of using data inappropriately harvested from Facebook to support the \u201cVote Leave\u201d campaign for Britain to exit the European Union.Facebook also said it had suspended CubeYou for inappropriately harvesting data, using tactics similar those of Cambridge Analytica. The company collected information on Facebook users through quizzes. CNBC, which earlier reported the firm\u2019s suspension, said people had been misled into believing the quizzes would be used for nonprofit academic research; instead, the data was sold to marketers.\u201cOur apps and activity on Facebook have been subject to regular audits and reviews with the company,\u201d a CubeYou spokeswoman said. She added that the company was in compliance with Facebook\u2019s data policy and rules and that CubeYou\u2019s terms informed users that their data would be used for academic and business research purposes.Yet even as Facebook suspended data firms and took other actions over data privacy, worries about what can be posted on the social network continued. Facebook confirmed on Monday that it had removed a popular Facebook page with nearly 700,000 followers that was associated with the Black Lives Matter movement after it was discovered to be inauthentic.The commission\u2019s goal, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, \u201cis both to get the ideas of leading academics on how to address these issues as well as to hold us accountable for making sure we protect the integrity of these elections on Facebook.\u201dThe researchers chosen to participate will have access to privacy-protected sets of Facebook data, but only after being vetted by a review board, external privacy experts, and Facebook\u2019s privacy and research review teams. The company said it would not review or approve the researchers\u2019 findings before they are published.Financing for the project is being provided by, among others, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Charles Koch Foundation and the Omidyar Network.\u201cBut there is much more to do \u2014 and we don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d they said.Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, Tiffany Hsu from New York and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Finance Official in Japan Resigns Over Harassment Accusations", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The highest-ranking civil servant in Japan\u2019s Finance Ministry offered his resignation on Wednesday amid swirling accusations that he had sexually harassed several female journalists.At a news conference, the official, Junichi Fukuda, 58, the administrative vice minister, said allegations that he had made sexually suggestive remarks to the women were \u201cnot factual.\u201dStill, Mr. Fukuda\u2019s resignation, which was accepted by Taro Aso, the finance minister, was a small sign that Japan might be joining the international reckoning of the #MeToo movement, spurred by widespread accusations of sexual harassment and assault.Both men\u2019s resignations came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Palm Beach, Fla., meeting with President Trump. Mr. Fukuda\u2019s resignation is subject to confirmation by the entire cabinet, including Mr. Abe.\u201cI thought it would be difficult to fulfill my duty,\u201d Mr. Fukuda said. \u201cI apologize to everyone to whom I have caused trouble.\u201dIn the allegations reported by Shincho magazine about Mr. Fukuda, several unidentified journalists said he had repeatedly made sexually suggestive remarks in meetings and at bars.At the news conference on Wednesday, when a reporter asked Mr. Fukuda if he recognized his own voice in the recording, he responded, \u201cI hear my voice through my body, so I can\u2019t recognize my true voice when listening with my ears.\u201dAsked whether he remembered making any of the remarks described in the magazine article, he said, \u201cI do not recall making such remarks,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t have any memory of having such an awful conversation.\u201dAccording to the public broadcaster NHK, Mr. Fukuda would be the first top-ranking official in the Finance Ministry to resign since 1998, when the official who held the same post quit, along with the finance minister and the head of the Bank of Japan, to take responsibility for a corruption scandal.Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Not Mike Pence?", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistA few days ago, which is to say an eternity in our Trump-dilated time, there was a story on NPR about anxious evangelicals\u2019 seeking a meeting with the president.The subject of their agita, not entirely surprisingly, was the Stormy Daniels affair, in which the president\u2019s lawyer-fixer, Michael Cohen, appears to have averted a possible October surprise by buying the silence of a porn star (and perhaps more than one) with whom Trump committed adultery shortly after the birth of his third wife\u2019s only son.But the prominent evangelicals seeking the meeting were apparently less concerned about the adultery (or the payoff\u2019s possible campaign finance violation) than about the political ramifications \u2014 low religious-right turnout in 2018, a defeat for Republicans, and from there defeats on the policy issues that forced religious conservatives to make their peace with Trump in the first place.Now with the F.B.I. raids on Cohen\u2019s various offices, the emanations and penumbras from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation seem to have raised the Stormy Daniels stakes, pushing us closer to a scenario in which our first openly Hefnerian president gets impeached for illegalities related to an adult entertainer and her charms.The sudden investigatory focus on Cohen and Daniels might turn out to be a legal tempest in a D-cup. But still, for evangelicals concerned that their agenda is yoked so closely to the fortunes of that Hefnerian president, this seems like a good time to contemplate a simple question: Why not Mike Pence?In the 2016 election, once Marco Rubio was defeated and Ted Cruz dispatched, religious conservatives faced a binary choice: Vote Trump or get Hillary. One does not have to agree with the ultimate decision that most of them made to understand the logic that motivated a decision for Trump.But the politics of the coming year, once the Mueller investigation ceases to be a black box and delivers whatever it\u2019s going to deliver (you\u2019ll get no predictions from me!), might offer a very different choice. If Trump were impeached and removed from the White House, the presidency would devolve to precisely the kind of man whom much of pre-Trump religious conservatism insisted that it wanted in the Oval Office: an evangelical Christian family man with a bluenose\u2019s temperament and a boring Reaganite checklist of beliefs.Which means that if, in what is no longer an absurd hypothetical, the president were to face real legal-political jeopardy over the Stormy Daniels business, the evangelical leaders currently fretting about Trump\u2019s political position would face a case where doing the consistent thing \u2014 namely, returning to their Bill Clinton-era position that character counts in presidents and using illegal means to conceal gross infidelities are impeachable offenses \u2014 would actually deliver something closer to what they claimed to want, not so very long ago: not a liberal in the White House, but President Mike Pence.Now I understand very well all the reasons that in the event of a Trump impeachment over Stormy Daniels or anything else, most evangelicals will probably rally to him instead of gently elbowing Pence in to take his place. We do not have a parliamentary system where party leaders fight internal battles and get replaced by their internal rivals on the regular; instead, we elect a quasi-monarch, whose removal seems as traumatic as a regicide. And thus party loyalists tend to identify with their leaders the way royalists identify with their kings, and regard the prospect of impeachment not as an opportunity for a change of leadership but a revolutionary threat.But for all their inevitable appeal, these are bad reasons to pre-emptively reject impeachment, in the Daniels case or any other that Mueller might reveal. And I don\u2019t just mean they\u2019re bad reasons because they\u2019re too partisan and tribal; I mean that the evidence from the last case like this, the Clinton impeachment in all its splendor, is that the partisan and tribal response does not necessarily serve your party or tribe that well.There is no way of knowing exactly what would have happened, of course, had Clinton been pushed out by Senate Democrats and Al Gore installed in his place. But there are good reasons to suspect that as an incumbent steward of late-1990s prosperity untainted by his steadfast support for a lying boss, Gore would have had an easier time dispatching George W. Bush in 2000, and the entire trajectory of the early 2000s would have been more favorable to Democrats. And there are also good reasons to think that professional feminists, who contorted themselves absurdly in defense of Clinton\u2019s predatory conduct, would have been better off accelerating their reckoning with the pigs of liberalism rather than waiting for the age of Trump and the old age of Harvey Weinstein.These lessons could apply to a Trump impeachment as much as to the Lewinsky affair. A Republican Party that ran in 2020 with a boring Midwestern guy (albeit, yes, one sure to be trailed by protesters in Handmaid outfits) as the steward of prosperity would not necessarily be worse off than a party lashed to its current leader; if Gerald Ford could almost win in Nixon\u2019s shadow, why not Pence in Trump\u2019s? And a religious conservatism that sacrificed a lot of cultural credibility in defending Trump might regain a little by abandoning him, vindicating itself against what seem now like reasonable charges of \u201ccharacter for thee but not for me\u201d hypocrisy.Plus, there\u2019s the providential aspect. Sure, making use of Donald Trump to keep Hillary Clinton from being president is a fascinating flourish by history\u2019s Author, but the idea that the Almighty might use a porn star to make Mike Pence president represents, if anything, an even more amazing miracle. So anyone interested in looking for the hand of God in history should probably welcome that miracle\u2019s arrival, rather than resisting in the name of MAGA.And for those same religious conservatives to pass up the chance, preferring a scorched-earth battle in defense of priapism, would be a sad confirmation of the point that a beloved Christian author made many years ago: The doors of hell are locked on the inside.Advertisement"}

In the last two election cycles, he has spent more later in the season.Mr. Uihlein has mostly supported political committees that back hard-line conservatives. He began stepping up his federal contributions during the 2016 elections, and this year, has already spent close to the total he spent in that entire cycle.Comparing how much they have given in previous electionsRichard UihleinThrough Feb. 282012201420162018Tom SteyerThrough Feb. 282012No contributions to PACs201420162018$20$40$60$80 mil.Richard UihleinThrough Feb. 282012201420162018Tom SteyerThrough Feb. 28No contributions to PACs2012201420162018$20$40$60$80 mil.Long a power broker in Illinois and Wisconsin political circles, Mr. Uihlein has taken an even more aggressive political approach this year.Tiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United, a Democratic group that supports campaign finance regulation, said Mr. Uihlein was among the most important donors on the right but has not \u201cgotten the same attention as the Kochs or even the Mercers.\u201d\u201cHe supports the most extreme candidates and inflexible positions,\u201d Ms. Muller said of Mr. Uihlein, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not just candidates he funds, but right-wing groups to try to influence policy.\u201dWhere the bulk of Mr. Uihlein\u2019s money is goingDavid Keating, a campaign finance expert who favors fewer restrictions on political spending, said the rise of donors like Mr. Uihlein and Mr. Steyer mirrored the country\u2019s broader political polarization.\u201cThere are probably more donors who are ideologically driven today than there were in the past,\u201d said Mr. Keating, a former strategist for the Club for Growth.But Mr. Keating cautioned that the prominence of activist donors could also fade over the course of the year, once primary season is over. Many wealthy donors, he said, prefer to save their spending for the more straightforward fall contests that pit one Republican against one Democrat.Indeed, beyond Mr. Uihlein and Mr. Steyer, a longer list of individuals who have donated the most so far shows many major givers who appear more conventional in their practices.Top donors through Feb. 28Fred Eychaner, a billionaire media executive, and George Marcus, a real estate developer, have each given about $4 million, mainly to super PACs linked to Democratic leaders in the House and Senate.Bernard Marcus, a Home Depot co-founder, and Steven A. Cohen, a hedge fund investor, have given a combined $8.3 million, mainly to establishment-aligned Republican groups.Matthew Rothschild, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which supports stricter campaign-finance regulation, said Mr. Uihlein\u2019s political role showed how big donors had come to overshadow traditional political parties.\u201cThe parties are increasingly irrelevant,\u201d Mr. Rothschild said. \u201cBillionaires can just set up their own organizations and just dominate a political campaign.\u201dMr. Rothschild said voters should not mistake the emergence of competing billionaires as a sign that the campaign finance system is basically stable and fair.\u201cOur democracy is not supposed to be a tug of war between a couple of billionaires on the left and a couple of billionaires on the right,\u201d he said.Source: Federal Election Commission data as of April 11, 2018. | Photo of Tom Steyer by Andrew Burton for The New York Times; photo of Richard Uihlein by Stephen Serio/Crain\u2019s Chicago Business. | Note: Some money that has been reported to the F.E.C. cannot be linked to any individual donor.

{"Headline": "A Personal Finance Book Based on Happiness Instead of Money", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfI\u2019ve always believed that the beloved personal finance book \u201cYour Money or Your Life\u201d (Penguin, $17) was slightly mistitled.Written by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez, the book was updated and rereleased this month, but even when it was first published in 1992, I thought the \u201cor\u201d should have been an \u201cand.\u201d So it should have been \u201cYour Money and Your Life.\u201dYes, of course, I understand the appeal of the way the title is actually worded. It instantly evokes a bad guy pointing a gun at a soon-to-be-victim in countless \u201cB\u201d movies. And people of a certain age will remember that it doubles as one of comedy\u2019s funniest straight lines, thanks to Jack Benny.So far be it from me to change the title, but mine would have been more accurate because the book is all about figuring where money fits into your life.Most personal finance books focus on how you can pay for the lifestyle you already have or to which you aspire.Ms. Robin \u2014 who updated the book on her own; Mr. Dominguez died in 1997 \u2014 and her co-author turn that approach on its head, emphasizing that it is far easier to achieve financial independence if you are a minimalist. (As Ms. Robin points out in the new introduction, the book meshes with her long-term work in the sustainability and simplicity movements.)If you have a dependable car, instead of a luxury one, a cellphone that does what you need it to do and no more, and live in a house that suits your needs, instead of something larger, your expenses are less and you don\u2019t need to make as much money from either your work or your investments.Those examples are mine, but they are the sorts of things the book discusses throughout, always ending the discussion with some variation of the question when it comes to material goods: \u201cIs more really better?\u201dTo help readers answer that question, the authors ask them to calculate to the penny how many hours they would have to work to pay for anything they are thinking of buying, whether it is a night on the town or a new couch.They\u2019re betting that doing that kind of sobering arithmetic will reduce the amount of money you spend. \u201cLooking around at your accumulation of stuff, you can ask, \u2018How many hours of my life did I invest to have this chair, car, mismatched set of cookware.\u2019\u201dIf you consistently do the math, you may decide you have \u201cenough,\u201d the financial state that the book says you should be aiming for.What is enough? \u201cWe have everything we need; there\u2019s nothing to weigh us down, distract or distress us, nothing we\u2019ve bought on credit, have never used and are slaving to pay off,\u201d the book says. Enough is \u201can honest and self-observant place. It\u2019s appreciating and fully enjoying what money brings into your life, and yet never purchasing anything that isn\u2019t needed or wanted.\u201dWhen you understand what enough is for you \u2014 and obviously it will vary by person \u2014 you can, in the words of her subtitle, transform your relationship with money and achieve financial independence.I have always had problems with the book. For one thing, there really isn\u2019t much investment advice \u2014 it gets about 10 percent of the space, and what is there tends to be general. Yes, telling people to use index funds and diversify their holdings are good ideas, but details are lacking. Which funds, for example, and how much of your assets should be where?But since it wasn\u2019t intended as a traditional investment book, I don\u2019t much fault it there. What truly bothers me is the focus throughout on how people can afford to stop working as soon as possible so they can fulfill their true potential. The authors never really acknowledge that there are people who can make a pleasant income doing what they love, often using some of their paychecks and free time to make the world a better place.In addition, the authors\u2019 default position seems to be that when most people make what they would describe as an unnecessary purchase \u2014 such as buying a new home when their current one is adequate \u2014 it is done either to satisfy some emptiness in their soul or to impress their friends. It could also be that they want to move into a better school district so their kids can benefit, or some other meaningful reason.And after a while, I found the tone hectoring. Here\u2019s a representative comment describing how the authors feel about the way most of us live: We are \u201ccaught in a consumerist money culture that may feed our greed, but not our real needs for being connected, respected and protected.\u201dAll that said, I understand the book\u2019s allure.Simplifying your financial life sounds great, no matter how much you make, and having someone point out that you may already have enough \u2014 or can get to that point, with a bit of work \u2014 is appealing, especially if you have always considered yourself not to be well off.Those are good things.As is anything that helps you seriously consider every purchase you make. After all, the less you spend, the more you have, or as the book puts it: \u201cThe more you save, the sooner you are financially independent.\u201dThat may be the best relationship with money of all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Two U.S. Orchestras Get a Rare Chance at Carnegie", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoth sizable audiences seemed rich with home-state boosters, especially Michiganders on Friday. But there the similarities mostly ended.It is a big, beautiful piece, written more or less in the style of Mr. Glass\u2019s Gandhi opera \u201cSatyagraha\u201d (1980), Mr. Glass at his best.\u201cGandhi wouldn\u2019t have been Gandhi if it hadn\u2019t been for Ramakrishna,\u201d Mr. Glass said of the 19th-century Hindu mystic in a brief preliminary conversation on stage with Mr. St. Clair. The \u201cPassion\u201d text presents some of Ramakrishna\u2019s thoughts and tells of his death in touching fashion.In the earlier parts, Mr. Glass wields his sustained, seamless arpeggiations to produce a timeless, subdued sort of rocking lullaby. He breaks into uncharacteristically wild expressionism in the death scene, then finds his way to gorgeous tranquillity in an epilogue.The performance was excellent, with the orchestra sounding like a major ensemble; excellent singing from the chorus; and fine work by the baritone Christ\u00f2pheren Nomura and the soprano Elissa Johnston, especially lovely as the Mother of the Universe.The ambitious program opened with Mr. Glass\u2019s \u201cMeetings Along the Edge,\u201d a movement from \u201cPassages\u201d (1990), a major work he wrote in collaboration with the Indian sitarist and composer Ravi Shankar. And it included Shankar\u2019s own Sitar Concerto No. 3 (2009), with his daughter, Anoushka Shankar, as commanding soloist.The idea behind the Grand Rapids Symphony\u2019s return to Carnegie, Ms. Lobbestael said, was to reintroduce the orchestra, with the Brazilian-born Mr. Lehninger, in his second season as music director, to the national stage and celebrate his early achievements. So the program included works by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos along with Falla\u2019s familiar \u201cNights in the Gardens of Spain\u201d and Ravel\u2019s overfamiliar \u201cBol\u00e9ro.\u201dVilla-Lobos\u2019s seemingly untranslatable \u201cMomoprecoce\u201d is a 1929 reworking of his set of piano pieces \u201cCarnival for Brazilian Children.\u201d Like Falla\u2019s \u201cNights,\u201d it is a concerto-like work, and the eminent Brazilian pianist Nelson Freire, on hand for both, presumably made the best possible case for it.

{"Headline": "Australia Pledges Millions of Dollars in Bid to Rescue Great Barrier Reef", "Date": "2018-04-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Australian government unveiled a plan on Sunday to try to rescue the imperiled Great Barrier Reef, pledging hundreds of millions of dollars in what would be the largest single investment for reef conservation and management in the country\u2019s history.Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg said 500 million Australian dollars ($379 million) would be set aside to help the reef, an important ecosystem and a global treasure, after years of devastating damage from warming waters caused by climate change.\u201cWe\u2019ll be improving the monitoring of the reef\u2019s health and the measurement of its impacts,\u201d Mr. Frydenberg said from the city of Cairns, a popular jumping-off point for reef tourism. \u201cThe more we understand about the reef, the better we can protect it.\u201dThe money would be used to improve water quality, control a major predator, invest in coral restoration and enhance underwater monitoring.Critics seized on Australia\u2019s continued subsidized development of gas and coal, especially its openness to the Adani coal mine in northern Australia that would be among the world\u2019s largest, pushing coal on boats running near the reef. The plan still awaits final approval.Mr. Frydenberg said he believed that the reef could overcome its many challenges with help.The plan would set aside roughly 200 million Australian dollars ($151 million) for improving water quality, working with farmers to reduce fertilizer use \u2014 especially sugar farmers, who dominate the rich coastal lands of tropical northern Australia.Money would also be set aside for fighting the crown-of-thorns starfish, which feeds on coral and has become an ever-present pest; for enhancing reef health monitoring; and for community engagement and enforcement.An additional 100 million Australian dollars ($76 million) would finance reef restoration and adaptation, including ambitious plans that amount to growing more resilient corals in laboratories.Mr. Frydenberg was cautious about whether the reef could be revived, arguing that experts had told him that it could be \u201cremarkably resilient.\u201dHe also acknowledged the value of the reef, which supports 64,000 jobs, and argued that the government was working closely with experts to make sure that the plan would succeed.But some scientists who are among the world\u2019s greatest experts on the reef \u2014 including Terry P. Hughes, director of a government-funded center for coral reef studies at James Cook University in Queensland \u2014 said that it was too little, too late, posting maps of the damage to the reef on Twitter.The Australian Academy of Science was only slightly more supportive of the government\u2019s plan.\u201cWe urge the government to address the cause of the problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanctions Are Hurting North Korea. Can They Make Kim Give In?", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "The isolated North is finding ways to cope with tough new penalties. Is the economic pressure enough to get Kim Jong-un to give up his weapons?Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 On a dark February night, the trucks unloaded their contraband near Hyesan, a North Korean town across a narrow river from China. As border guards looked the other way, workers used carts to pull the cargo of metal ore \u2014 tungsten, lead, zinc, copper and gold concentrates, all banned from export under United Nations sanctions \u2014 across the frozen river.By sunrise, all that was left were tire tracks and footprints across the river\u2019s frozen surface.A North Korean witness told an acquaintance living in South Korea that ore, as well as other materials, was being smuggled into China at the crossing almost every night. He said smugglers also headed the other way, moving sugar, flour and 50-kilogram sacks of fertilizers into North Korea.But the elaborate efforts to smuggle goods in and out of North Korea are among the signs that the closed, secretive country is finding ways to cope.The North is also responding with patriotic appeals and belt-tightening, and by prioritizing the allocation of resources to the military and political elite. Despite shortages, exchange rates and key consumer prices are stable, and there is no sign of an approaching famine, according to recent visitors and North Korean defectors who remain in contact with people inside the country.Since then, Mr. Kim has taken steps to appear willing to cut a deal, offering what sound like concessions to the United States, but can also be seen as clever negotiating tactics. On Saturday, Mr. Kim said that \u201cwe no longer need\u201d any nuclear or missile tests, and that the North would close a nuclear test site, according to the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency.One day earlier Mr. Moon said that Mr. Kim removed a key obstacle to negotiations with the United States by ceasing to demand the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea as a condition for denuclearizing his country.It is far from clear, however, whether the pain from sanctions is forcing Mr. Kim to make concessions, and whether it could be enough to drive him to trade away his nuclear arsenal.Many analysts and North Korean defectors have doubts about whether economic pressure alone, no matter how painful, can change the behavior of an impoverished, tightly controlled nation that has endured extreme hardship before.\u201cIf you think the North Koreans would revolt or the regime would collapse because of sanctions, you don\u2019t know anything about the North Koreans,\u201d said Kang Mi-jin, a North Korean defector who collects North Korean consumer prices for the South\u2019s central Bank of Korea. \u201cThese are people who survived the famine by eating weeds and even talk proudly about it.\u201d\u201dWe are starting to see the first major test of the North Korean economy under Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.Since September, the United Nations Security Council has banned all key North Korean exports, including coal, iron ore, seafood and textiles. If enforced fully, they could eliminate a full 90 percent of the country\u2019s total exports in dollar terms.North Korea can still extract 1.2 million barrels of gasoline, diesel and kerosene from the four million barrels of crude oil a year it is allowed to import, mostly from China, said an energy analyst, Lee Jong-heon. But the combined 1.7 million barrels of refined petroleum would be less than half the amount needed to run all of the 280,000 cars in North Korea, much less heat homes and meet other needs, Mr. Lee said.Experts said the sanctions, and China\u2019s apparent willingness to enforce many of them, had dealt a blow to one of the few bright points in the North Korean economy: trade with China, which had been an eager market for ore and other North Korean natural resources.\u201cProduction has sharply decreased, if not come to a compete halt, in coal, iron, zinc and copper mines,\u201d said Jiro Ishimaru, who runs Asia Press, a Japan-based website that monitors North Korea with the help of informants inside the country. \u201cMany miners don\u2019t report for work because management can\u2019t provide rations or pay wages.\u201dNorth Korean exports to China, which account for more than 90 percent of the North\u2019s external trade, plunged by one third to $1.65 billion last year, with volumes dropping by 60 to 95 percent in recent months. Its official trade deficit against China more than doubled last year to $1.68 billion.\u201cPetty traders from the North who used to cross into China in the morning on foot or in small cars and then returned in the evening with auto parts and food to sell on the black market no longer come,\u201d said Wu Qiang, a North Korea expert in China.Without foreign currency, North Korea will struggle to finance imports of consumer goods for its people and raw materials for its factories. It will also be unable to import fertilizer in time for the planting season, raising the specter of a return of food shortages, said Jin Qiangyi, director of the Center for North and South Korea Studies at Yanbian University.Humanitarian aid workers who have recently visited the country warn that food shortages could be exacerbated by the lack of fuel, which could hamper North Korea\u2019s ability to transport grain from areas of surplus to places where there is not enough. Trucks that used to carry goods twice a day now run only once a day on some routes, though some are extending their decks to carry more loads.Despite these privations, analysts say there are few signs that North Korea\u2019s economy has reached a breaking point.In Pyongyang, there is still enough electricity to keep streetlights on at night, said South Korean journalists who visited this month. Everyone seemed to carry a cellphone, and women were more fashionably dressed than before, they said.After soaring last year, gasoline prices have stabilized in recent months, though they remain nearly twice as high as a year ago. North Korea is likely to respond by further reducing its reliance on oil \u2014 petroleum accounts for only 12 percent of its energy production \u2014 using North Korean coal that it once exported to China in its own domestic power plants instead, said Mr. Lee, the energy expert.\u201cI don\u2019t think the North will surrender its nuclear weapons because of oil shortages,\u201d he said.The elites have also been enriched, allowing them to stockpile goods and foreign currency.\u201cWe have seen no big disruption in markets yet that could be attributed to sanctions,\u201d Mr. Ishimaru of Asia Press said. \u201cNorth Korean markets have proved quite resilient against sanctions.\u201dMs. Kang, the defector who collects data using informants in the North, said the country was now far better positioned to ride out the sanctions than in the past. \u201cThey have markets,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is rice there. Many have cash reserves.\u201dShe said the North had also benefited from smuggling that had brought in hard currency and some consumer goods.The actual extent of smuggling could be far larger than estimated. Nighttime smuggling operations have become more common along the border with China, said defectors with sources inside North Korea. North Korean secret police officers collude with border guards to create a window of several hours during which smugglers are free to move goods in and out of the country, they said.Ms. Kang, who also reports for the Seoul-based website Daily NK, said her sample study of North Korean towns near the border showed that the number of smugglers had doubled in recent years, especially since sanctions began to make their effects felt last year.\u201cThe screws have been tightened, so the pain is now bigger, but I don\u2019t think it is lethal,\u201d said R\u00fcdiger Frank, an economist at the University of Vienna who studies the North. \u201cI am not convinced that the sanctions were the main factor that led to the current talks.\u201dIt may be too early to judge the full impact of the sanctions, which began to hurt only in the second half of 2017, after China appeared to step up enforcement. This means conditions in North Korea could deteriorate further.Some analysts have argued that Mr. Kim\u2019s decision to travel to Beijing and meet with President Xi Jinping last month may have been a sign of his desperation to ease sanctions.The recent improvements in living standards in North Korea could mean its political elite and new middle class may be unwilling to tolerate a return to economic hardship, said Kim Dong-yub, a North Korea analyst at the Seoul-based Institute for Far Eastern Studies.In Pyongyang, some families make fewer trips to restaurants and choose cheaper domestic goods over more expensive imports. Outside the capital, rural families now sometimes make do with only two meals a day.\u201cMy worry is that the gains and progress made in recent years in terms of food security and marketization could fade as a result of the sanctions,\u201d said Katharina Zellweger, who has visited North Korea 70 times since 1995, living there from 2006 to 2011 to run a Swiss aid program. \u201cThat would mean we are moving backward.\u201dOne Chinese trader who does business with middle-class North Koreans said that he had noticed a growing discontent with the government because of the shortages.\u201cI can feel they are not satisfied with the government, and if the authorities cannot resolve the sanctions problem, such dissatisfaction will go on and on,\u201d said the trader, who asked to be identified only by his English name, Terry, for fear of repercussions in North Korea. \u201cThey have lost the loyalty toward the regime.\u201dBut the Kim government still has enormous power to suppress or deflect discontent. No organized antigovernment resistance exists in North Korea, where the government maintains a tight grip on society and relies on the police, backed by a system of informers, to imprison critics.Complete control over the news media, and the North\u2019s almost total isolation from the internet, allows the government to shape how many people perceive reality. Bombarded by daily propaganda appeals, North Koreans are more likely to see themselves as citizens of a small nation persecuted by hostile Americans than they are to blame Mr. Kim\u2019s government for their economic hardship, recent visitors and defectors say.\u201cWe do ask people about sanctions,\u201d said Linda Lewis, the North Korea country representative for the American Friends Service Committee, a humanitarian aid group, who last visited in November. \u201cWe ask about the impact of them. The answer that we usually get from people is: \u2018We\u2019ve never experienced a life without sanctions, so how would we know?\u2019\u201dEcho Hui contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Breaking Into the Boom in Escape Rooms: What Entrepreneurs Need to Know", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipHijacked airplanes, derailed subway cars and trapped submarines are usually the stuff of nightmares. A growing number of entrepreneurs, though, are catering to customers willing to pay to escape these types of situations for fun.Escape rooms are adventure games in which teams of friends, family or colleagues work together to find clues and solve puzzles to escape a simulated danger before time runs out.\u201cWe spend so much time in solitary screen-based worlds, so it is magical when people from a wide range of ages come together and solve a challenge,\u201d said Scott Nicholson, a professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario who teaches a course in creating escape rooms.The vast majority of escape rooms in the United States are mom-and-pop operations with one or two sites, Ms. Spira said. From chains to smaller outfits, the format is similar. A group of about four to eight people play an hourlong game that could include escaping a prison, evading a serial killer or finding a cure to a deadly disease. Once one puzzle in the escape room is solved, a clue unlocks the next challenge. Hidden doors often reveal new spaces such as secret passageways as the game proceeds.The outcome is not guaranteed. If players get stuck, escape room staff, often in character, provide hints. The success rate varies, but only about 30 percent to 50 percent of participants escape a given room in the time allotted, Ms. Spira said.Admission usually ranges from $20 to $45 per person, with escape rooms in bigger cities usually charging more. Some business owners earn close to a half-million dollars a year, Mr. Spira said, although getting accurate data is difficult because the companies are private and do not release financial figures.Well-designed games draw on many types of knowledge, so all players have a chance for a \u201chero moment,\u201d said Summer Herrick, a co-founder of Locurio, an escape room in Seattle.\u201cEveryone likes to feel smart, and there is an adrenaline rush of solving a puzzle without the risk of, say, sky diving or spelunking,\u201d Ms. Herrick said.Escape rooms evolved from video games, like the Crimson Room and the Rusty Lake series, that involve puzzles and group adventures. The first real-life escape room was created by a company called Scrap in Kyoto, Japan, in 2007. Scrap opened an escape room in San Francisco in 2012 and now has three in the United States, which the company said about 50,000 people visited in 2017.Pioneering American companies like the Escape Game and Escape the Room can now be found in cities like Houston, Nashville and Orlando, Fla. In the early days, several developed a niche, such as the Basement in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, which became quickly known for its actor-driven horror games.Now, many who played an escape room are creating their own. \u201cBut having $10,000, a dream and some moxie isn\u2019t necessarily enough to make a business,\u201d Mr. Spira said.Successful entrepreneurs have relevant backgrounds like engineering and psychology and the ability to learn a variety of new skills, like accounting, game design and set building.Andrew Preble, who founded Escape My Room in New Orleans, drew on his past working at a technology start-up and operating a restaurant in Berlin. Mr. Preble opened his first escape room in 2015 and now has four games that revolve around mysterious events that happen to a fictional old New Orleans family called the DeLaportes, inspired by Marguerite Delaporte, one of the conspirators accused of poisoning Louis XIV in the 1600s.Mr. Preble said he knew starting a new business would be hard, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t expect it to be as popular as quickly as it was.\u201dDemand was high enough that six months after opening a room called the Jazz Parlor in 2016, Mr. Preble built a nearly identical room for corporate groups and birthday parties. The average number of monthly visitors increased 29 percent from 2016 to 2017, Mr. Preble said, and his team now includes eight full-time and eight part-time employees.Despite the rising popularity, getting a bank loan to finance the business can be a challenge, Mr. Preble said. \u201cLenders still don\u2019t exactly understand what escape rooms are, so it\u2019s difficult to assign value to this as an asset,\u201d he said.Innovation is crucial to hooking repeat customers, especially as more escape room companies enter the market. Some are adding new rooms, switching games more frequently or using more actors and more elaborate props to increase the immersive quality of the experience.And entrepreneurs find they have to be handy. When Derek Tam started Mission Escape Games with a longtime friend, he built the sets himself. Now, he hires employees with experience building immersive attractions at amusement parks to do the work. His company\u2019s five outposts include one in Anaheim, Calif., not far from Disneyland.Escape rooms are also sprucing up related amenities like conference rooms for corporate groups or those celebrating special events.\u201cPart of the fun is having dinner or drinks with your friends or colleagues afterward and reliving your experience after the fact,\u201d Mr. Spira said, who played 250 rooms in 2017 with his wife for their blog.Stuart Bogaty, who started Trap\u2019t in Stamford, Conn., with his wife and three daughters, opened his business in 2016 with two \u201cclean and light\u201d conference rooms, in addition to four escape rooms. \u201cI had seen escape rooms that were a bit dark and kind of dumpy,\u201d he said, adding that his attention to detail has helped draw groups from corporations like Indeed, Mastercard and Vineyard Vines.Mr. Bogaty has not done any direct marketing to corporate groups, focusing instead on Google and Facebook advertisements and on customer service.Word-of-mouth advertising and online reviews have been critical, he said. Strong Google reviews have had the most impact because they affect where a company shows up in searches.\u201cHow you respond to reviews makes a big difference,\u201d Mr. Bogaty said. \u201cEven a bad review \u2014 if you respond to it appropriately \u2014 can help your business.\u201dEntrepreneurs in cities with large numbers of tourists, like Mr. Preble in New Orleans, also draw players by leaving fliers in hotels.The newest wave of entrepreneurs is bringing escape rooms into players\u2019 homes.Juliana Patel and Ariel Rubin of Los Angeles loved escape rooms but found it trickier to get out and play once they had children. They set out in 2016 to raise $19,500 on Kickstarter for their home version, Escape Room in a Box. They surged past $135,000.One of their Kickstarter supporters was a Mattel game designer, who brought the toymaker on board to license their game.\u201cWe know that all consumers are gravitating toward social play,\u201d said Ray Adler, a senior director of global marketing at Mattel. \u201cPeople love to test themselves and do things together.\u201dMs. Patel and Ms. Rubin are busy working on their next boxed game, but they also design escape rooms for various customers, including companies marketing a new product or film or charities looking for an unusual activity at fund-raisers.Few escape room entrepreneurs can rest on their laurels, however.\u201cWhat\u2019s good now won\u2019t be that great in a year,\u201d Mr. Spira said. \u201cCompanies that figure out that it\u2019s not just about making an excellent game but creating an experience that makes customers feel good even if they didn\u2019t escape, that\u2019s the key.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Pastry Layers Tastes of France and Syria", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DessertWhen my chin is down, my eyes are closed and my hands are cupped over my ears, it\u2019s a sure sign that I\u2019m tasting. I know how odd I look, but the momentary calm helps me concentrate on flavors when there\u2019s a new recipe at hand or a complex ingredient. I always taste chocolate this way, and every once in a while I lock myself in my sensory cocoon because I\u2019ve come upon something unusual that I want to get to know better. A couple of months ago in Paris, it was a pastry from a new, strikingly designed patisserie in the Marais, Maison Aleph.When I met Myriam Sabet, Maison Aleph\u2019s founder and owner, I learned how closely the traditions of East and West that shape her desserts mirror her own history. Now 41, she was born in Aleppo, Syria, went to college and graduate school in Canada and moved to France almost two decades ago, when, she says, she decided, \u201cI was mature enough for Paris.\u201d In 2014, Sabet, who worked in finance, turned her life upside down to learn about pastry. She studied with an elderly Syrian baker in Montreal, was certified in French pastry at a Paris school and, last July, opened Maison Aleph, a small shop that attracts dessert lovers from around the world. The day I was there with her, I heard French and English and Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, Spanish and snippets of tongues I couldn\u2019t place at all. Once having hoped for a career in foreign affairs, Sabet looked around the room, laughed and exclaimed, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing now.\u201dSabet makes about a half-dozen variations of the 1001 Feuilles, each with layers of phyllo sandwiching a nut mixture in the style of baklava. One has hazelnuts from the Piedmont, one almonds from Valencia, another pistachios from Iran. The feuilles that called to me was made with sesame and halvah. As it was for Sabet, halvah was a sweet from my childhood. In Brooklyn, where I grew up, we would get it sliced to order from rounds about the size of snare drums. I knew the rich, pressed sesame-seed confection solely as a candy, but the Maison Aleph recipe for the squares\u2019 filling used it as an ingredient to be smoothed, baked and transformed by heat.It was only when I returned home and made the dessert myself that I grasped how complex it truly was, if not in preparation, then in conception: It seamlessly fused two disparate heritages. The filling blends the halvah with tahini, toasted sesame seeds, butter, eggs, sugar and cornstarch, and traces the contours of a classic cr\u00e8me d\u2019amande, the mixture a French p\u00e2tissier would use to fill a traditional fruit tart or a galette des rois.Each of the pastry layers \u2014 of which there are 28, not the poetic 1001 \u2014 is a paper-thin sheet of phyllo brushed with butter then dusted with powdered sugar. Sabet thinks that the work of buttering layer after layer of the ancient Arab dough may have inspired the French mille-feuille. In the moment, it seems right. For me, stacking the layers, spreading the filling over the plump cushion of dough and then covering it with more brushed and dusted layers brings the satisfaction of having, quite literally, constructed something.When the pastry comes from the oven and I compress the layers, helping the butter and sugar, the halvah filling and the dough meld with one another, the dessert leans less toward mille-feuille, more to baklava, its well-known form a blind for the unexpected filling. This is a pastry that\u2019s best hours after it\u2019s made, when the top and bottom layers are at their crispiest. But as soon as it\u2019s cool, I tug a square loose. Now, back in the United States and an ocean away from Paris, I taste it: Its flavor and texture are as good as I remember. What\u2019s missing is the element of surprise \u2014 it has been replaced by the sweetness of knowing every nuance of the dessert, the reward for having made it myself.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Texas, Ted Cruz Is Facing an Unusual Challenge: A Formidably Financed Democrat", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas kicked off his re-election campaign this week with a new Texas-themed slogan and a new video, but something else that was entirely new went largely unspoken \u2014 a formidable and well-funded Democratic opponent.Mr. O\u2019Rourke, a former punk-rock bassist and El Paso city councilman, has raised $13.2 million in the race so far, and outraised Mr. Cruz in three of four Federal Election Commission reporting periods. (Mr. Cruz has not yet reported his latest fund-raising.) In the first three months of 2018, Mr. O\u2019Rourke raised $6.7 million, more than any other Democratic Senate candidate in the country in that period.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of Ann Richards-level enthusiasm, in the crowds he gathers,\u201d said Harold Cook, a Democratic strategist in Austin and former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, referring to the outspoken Democrat who served as Texas\u2019 governor from 1991 to 1995 before losing to George W. Bush. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a response like Beto O\u2019Rourke is getting in a very long time. Beto has got that thing, that star-power deal that you can\u2019t predict in advance.\u201dBut political analysts say Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s chances are a long-shot at best, despite his fund-raising skills. He remains unknown to many voters, even as he has kept up a hectic travel schedule and visited 228 of the state\u2019s 254 counties. In the Democratic primary last month, Mr. O\u2019Rourke lost a number of counties to two lesser-known Democratic rivals, including the Hispanic-dominated border area of the Rio Grande Valley, parts of East Texas and the northern Panhandle region.On Monday, Mr. Cruz formally began his re-election campaign at a venue that has become one of his favorite political backdrops \u2014 the Redneck Country Club in Stafford, 17 miles southwest of downtown Houston. His speech and his surroundings were plastered with references to his new campaign slogan: \u201cTough as Texas.\u201d It is meant to evoke the resilience of the state as it reeled from and united in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.At a campaign event on Tuesday night in San Antonio, Mr. Cruz acknowledged Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s success in fund-raising and the challenge for Republicans this November.\u201cThat\u2019s a whole lotta money \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt about that \u2014 and it has been clear for some time that the hard left is energized and they\u2019re mobilized and they\u2019re angry at the president,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, according to The Texas Tribune. \u201cAnd we are seeing all across the country, the far left giving millions of dollars to liberal Democrats running for office, and it underscores that Republicans cannot take November for granted.\u201dMr. Cruz remains popular with Texas conservatives, particularly the Tea Party activists who helped him, back in 2012, clinch the Senate seat by defeating one of the most powerful Republicans in Texas, David Dewhurst, then the lieutenant governor. And Republicans continue to dominate Texas, culturally and politically, controlling both chambers of the Texas Legislature, the governor\u2019s mansion and all of the more than two dozen statewide-elected offices. Democrats have not won any statewide offices since 1994.\u201cCruz has built-in name identification, conservative credentials and an \u2018R\u2019 behind his name, so his candidacy was effectively born on third base,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor of political science at the University of Houston. \u201cThese advantages give him a serious head start, but he doesn\u2019t want to be the hare who naps while the tortoise passes him by. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s fund-raising should be an eye opener for Senator Cruz.\u201dTexas Democrats have been in this position before. In 2014, Democrats had believed that Wendy Davis would become the first Democratic governor in decades, but Ms. Davis lost and Greg Abbott won. In 2016, Democrats had believed that Hillary Clinton could win Texas in the presidential race, but she lost and Donald Trump won the state.\u201cRight now, history and recent elections are still on Ted Cruz\u2019s side, and the dynamics of this state are still on Ted Cruz\u2019s side, for Republicans to win at a statewide election from the governor\u2019s office to senator and on down,\u201d said Ted Delisi, a Republican strategist in Austin who was the national field director for former Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign.At an event in Waco on Tuesday, Mr. O\u2019Rourke suggested to The Texas Tribune that one of the differences between his race and Ms. Davis\u2019s failed bid for governor in 2014 was the backlash against the Trump White House. \u201cShe did not have the benefit of this year, where, I hope you\u2019ll agree, we\u2019ve never seen this level of urgency, this level of motivation,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said.Asked if he was running against Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump, Mr. O\u2019Rourke replied, \u201cNeither.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not running against anybody. That just doesn\u2019t get me going. It doesn\u2019t energize me.\u201dMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s fund-raising success is an outgrowth of a campaign driven by social media, which has refused to accept money from political action committees.Republicans say they are not worried about an upset but are certainly paying attention. They point to the 2002 race for governor, when the Democrat, Tony Sanchez, a Laredo oil executive, spent $67 million and lost to Mr. Perry. They said that Mr. Cruz\u2019s reputation among Texas conservatives took a knock in 2016 after he refused to endorse Mr. Trump at the Republican National Convention, but that Mr. Cruz had largely repaired the damage.\u201cI think he\u2019s recovered from that,\u201d said State Senator Paul Bettencourt, a Houston Republican who is a former treasurer of the Republican Party of Texas and who is supporting Mr. Cruz. \u201cThis is an unusual year. The electorate is roiled. Statewide, Republicans are going to have to take these races seriously and campaign accordingly.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke jabbed at each other on social media. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign posted a Snapchat filter of a Cruz event in Beaumont and took a swipe at Mr. Cruz\u2019s failed presidential run. \u201cTed Cruz visited 99 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties,\u201d read the filter, which included an image of a frowning Mr. Cruz. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time he listened to Texans in Beaumont?\u201dBut Mr. Cruz wasn\u2019t taking the bait. He responded on Twitter, saying he had been to the city four times in the past year while pointing out Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s failure to win Jefferson County, which includes Beaumont, in the Democratic primary. \u201cAs best I can tell, you\u2019ve been there once for a drive-by campaign event on Feb 9,\u201d Mr. Cruz wrote on Twitter of Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why you lost Jefferson County in the Dem primary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Profiteers Lure Women Into Often-Unneeded Surgery", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJerri Plummer was at home in Arkansas, watching television with her three children, when a stranger called to warn that her life was in danger.The caller identified herself only as Yolanda. She told Ms. Plummer that the vaginal mesh implant supporting her bladder was defective and needed to be removed. If Ms. Plummer didn\u2019t act quickly, the caller urged, she might die.Ms. Plummer, 49, didn\u2019t ask many questions. Her implant was causing her discomfort, and she was impressed by how much Yolanda knew about her medical history. She was scared. \u201cIt was like I had a ticking time bomb inside of me,\u201d she said. Yolanda assured Ms. Plummer that all her expenses would be covered and that she would be set up with a lawyer to help her sue the mesh manufacturer, Boston Scientific.Days later, court records show, Ms. Plummer was lying on an operating table in a medical office in a shopping mall in Orlando, Fla.Just like that, she had stumbled into a growing industry that makes money by coaxing women into having surgery \u2014 sometimes unnecessarily \u2014 so that they are more lucrative plaintiffs in lawsuits against medical device manufacturers.Lawyers building such cases sometimes turn to marketing firms to drum up clients. The marketers turn to finance companies to provide high-interest loans to the clients that have to be repaid only if the clients receive money from the case. Those loans are then used to pay for surgery performed by doctors who are often lined up by the marketers.Interviews with dozens of women, lawyers, finance executives and marketers, as well as a review of court records and confidential documents, indicate that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of women have been sucked into this assembly-line-like system. It is fueled by banks, private equity firms and hedge funds, which provide financial backing.The profits are immense. So are the costs to women. Some suffer physical problems from the surgery. Others say they have become depressed or unable to work. Still others have to get mesh reinserted.Ms. Plummer\u2019s brush with the industry left her wearing diapers.The industry of providing financing to law firms involved in litigation is not new. In recent years, it has expanded into a diverse array of businesses. A spate of companies, such as a Brooklyn outfit named Law Cash, have popped up to provide upfront cash to plaintiffs hoping for big legal settlements.The litigation surrounding mesh implants is a lucrative niche. These so-called mass tort cases, some of which began six years ago when problems with the implants started to arise, encompass claims brought by tens of thousands of women who say they were harmed by the same products.Millions of women worldwide received mesh implants. They are used to correct a condition called pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when a woman\u2019s organs fall and press against her vagina because of weakened pelvic muscles. That causes urinary and other problems. The mesh reinforces the pelvic wall.But many women complained that the implants caused problems such as bleeding and discomfort during sex.Litigation against the implants\u2019 manufacturers, including Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, proliferated. There are more than 100,000 plaintiffs in federal court alone. Many more are involved in litigation at the state level or outside the United States.Representatives of Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson said they stood by the quality of their products. The mesh manufacturers have set aside more than $3 billion to cover potential mesh-related settlements.Not all plaintiffs are equal. Some law firms \u2014 which are paid a percentage of any settlements \u2014 realized that women with the implants still in their bodies tended to receive smaller settlements than those who had them taken out.\u201cDefendants have offered next to nothing to settle cases involving mesh products that have not been removed,\u201d Ms. Plummer\u2019s lawyers at McSweeney Langevin, a small Minneapolis personal injury firm, wrote in a letter advising her to get the implant taken out.Rhett McSweeney, a co-founder of the law firm, said in a statement that the firm never forced clients to undergo unnecessary surgery and \u201cnever directed a client to a particular doctor.\u201dPlaintiffs\u2019 firms turned to marketers to recruit clients. Women with mesh implants said they soon started receiving torrents of unsolicited phone calls, some originating overseas. The women said they didn\u2019t know how these marketers had found them and seemed to know their medical histories.\u201cI think my privacy was breached,\u201d said Jennifer Godsoe, 66, who lives in Cumberland, Me. \u201cThe more I think about it, the more upset I get.\u201dSome women had vague memories of answering an online ad about mesh problems. The only thing linking some other women was that they previously had the same doctors, court records show.Women who took the marketing bait were connected to doctors willing to perform the mesh-removal surgery \u2014 although that process remains murky. One critical player was Surgical Assistance, a Florida company led by Wesley Blake Barber, which acted as a middleman between the women, doctors and funding companies. Mr. Barber\u2019s lawyer declined to comment.In a deposition last summer, Mr. Barber outlined how the company had lined up doctors in Florida and Georgia to perform the surgery. In one online ad, an actor in a white lab coat assures women suffering from their mesh implants that relief is near. By calling a toll-free number, the women will be set up with a \u201cnetwork of qualified surgeons\u201d who remove the mesh without requiring upfront payments.Women who opted for surgery were flown to Florida and Georgia, put up in motels and sent to walk-in clinics, court filings show. The women generally didn\u2019t meet the doctors who would be operating on them until shortly before the procedure. Before going under the knife, few women got a second opinion.Dan Christensen, a lawyer who ran MedStar Funding, which financed mesh removal surgery, said in an interview that it was \u201cludicrous\u201d to argue that women had undergone unnecessary surgery.\u201cYou have to have a doctor willing to put his license on the line,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy jeopardize your license?\u201dThe work was lucrative. Doctors stood to make $14,000 a day.Doctors sometimes churned through four or five removals in a day. Each procedure typically cost about $21,000, according to lawsuits brought by women against the mesh manufacturers. Of that, doctors pocketed roughly $3,500 per surgery; most of the rest went to the medical centers where the surgery took place.Law Cash offered Danette Charnetzky, a hospice worker in Waynesburg, Ohio, financing for a removal surgery in December 2014. Ms. Charnetzky, another McSweeney client, agreed to pay the money back, at a double-digit interest rate, if the litigation was successful. Within a week, she and her husband were on a plane to a surgical center in a Florida strip mall. The process was a terrifying blur.\u201cI wish I could have changed my mind, but we were already there,\u201d said Ms. Charnetzky, 49, who hasn\u2019t received any money from the pending litigation against the mesh manufacturer. \u201cI just prayed for the best.\u201dShe got the worst \u2014 or something close to it. Ms. Charnetzky said she had needed two more procedures to repair scar tissue left by the Florida surgery.Rhonda Espeland, 63, who was living in Arizona, also had a bad experience. Since her mesh implant was removed in January 2015, she has developed incontinence. \u201cI may need another surgery,\u201d she said.The bladder problems have left Ms. Espeland unable to work, and she hasn\u2019t received any money from litigation against her mesh manufacturer. Boxes of diapers are regularly delivered to her door.The doctor who performed her surgery \u2014 and similar procedures on hundreds of others \u2014 was Earle M. Pescatore. In March 2014, around the time that he started doing lots of procedures, Mr. Pescatore and his wife filed for bankruptcy, citing liabilities of $1.5 million, including $38,000 they owed to the Internal Revenue Service, according to court filings. Dr. Pescatore said in a deposition that he had little memory of women he operated on.\u201cAny treatment that Dr. Pescatore provided would have been medically necessary,\u201d his lawyer, Mark DiCowden, said.While studies have shown that up to 15 percent of women with mesh implants will encounter problems, removing the mesh is not always recommended. Taking it out is more complicated than inserting it because the mesh is made of fiber that is designed to bond with tissue.Many of the women who got the surgery had limited or no health insurance. They rarely discussed the surgery with their primary care physicians before arriving at the clinics. Some said they had felt rushed into getting surgery.Dr. Victor Nitti, a surgeon specializing in complex pelvic issues at NYU Langone Health in New York, said serious mesh problems should be addressed with surgery. But, he said, \u201cscaring a patient who has limited to no symptoms into removal is just dangerous and irresponsible.\u201dDr. Nitti said he had grown concerned about such scare tactics after some patients told him that they had been contacted by marketers.A handful of specialized finance firms funded the surgery that Ms. Plummer, Ms. Espeland and other women got. Court filings show that the two main players are Law Cash and Banyan Finance of Boca Raton, Fla., and that the firms charge double-digit interest rates.Ross Elgart, Banyan\u2019s chief executive, did not respond to requests for comment.Lew Fidler, Law Cash\u2019s general counsel, said financing surgical procedures such as Ms. Plummer\u2019s is a small portion of the company\u2019s business. He said the firm, which typically provides cash advances to help plaintiffs pay for everyday expenses, ensures that each surgery is necessary.\u201cI feel for anyone who didn\u2019t get the outcome they were looking for, but we are not doctors,\u201d Mr. Fidler said. \u201cWe don\u2019t substitute our judgment for a licensed physician.\u201dAs a result of those steep interest rates, plaintiffs who do collect settlements see much of the money go to the financing firms. Another large slice goes to their lawyers.The industry has grown thanks in part to a gusher of money from mainstream financial institutions. Law Cash gets funding from DZ Bank, Germany\u2019s second-largest bank, and Melody Capital Partners, a hedge fund with $1.8 billion in assets.McSweeney Langevin, which has represented more than 1,000 women in mesh litigation, got backing from EJF Capital, a Virginia hedge fund with $10 billion in assets, according to corporate records.The industry tries to keep the network of marketers and financiers out of sight \u2014 and some participants have refused to answer questions in depositions, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\u201cPeople are claiming the Fifth and so on and so forth,\u201d said Magistrate Judge Cheryl Eifert in West Virginia, who is hearing one of the mesh cases in federal court. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to talk about necessarily how much money they make, per se, but if someone would just give them an idea of how the arrangement works. But nobody\u2019s willing to do that.\u201dMr. Barber of Surgical Assistance, for example, asserted the privilege nearly two dozen times in a deposition.Jerri Plummer never figured out whom Yolanda worked for. But in December 2014, Dr. Whitney Shoemaker performed the implant-removal surgery. Until the day of the operation, Ms. Plummer had never spoken to Dr. Shoemaker. Her lawyer declined to comment.Hours after Ms. Plummer went under the scalpel, she said, she was hustled back to a Hampton Inn just off the freeway, with a catheter sticking out of her side. The next day, a nurse arrived at the motel, removed the catheter and put her in a taxi to the airport.Soon after she arrived home in Arkansas, she said, complications developed. Her legs swelled like balloons. Her stomach seized up. Ms. Plummer went to her original doctor for help, she said. He informed her that the damage was irreversible. Worse, she said in court records, he told her that there had been no need for the removal surgery.Before the surgery, Ms. Plummer loved to take walks with her two pit bulls and to eat with her husband at Red Lobster. Now chronic incontinence forces her to wear diapers all day and has left her too worried about wetting herself to venture outside.With the help of a local lawyer, James R. Baxter, she is suing Law Cash; Dr. Shoemaker; Mr. Barber and his firm, Surgical Assistance; and lawyers at the McSweeney firm.Mr. McSweeney declined to comment on the lawsuit. His firm is trying to get Ms. Plummer\u2019s lawsuit moved from federal court into private arbitration, where there is no judge or jury. In his statement, he said the firm \u201chad no role\u201d connecting clients with surgical funders like Law Cash or Banyan Finance.Ms. Plummer said she had never received such a warning. She feels that she was victimized twice \u2014 first by the mesh manufacturer and then by her lawyers and doctor. \u201cI was taken advantage of through this whole process,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Memphis had circumvented a state law prohibiting the removal of historical monuments by selling the parks that held statues of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the first head of the Ku Klux Klan; Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy; and Capt.

{"Headline": "The Fight for Wisconsin Is On as Outside Money Pours Into Senate Race", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTAGE, Wis. \u2014 The attack ads began in early 2017, planting doubts well ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Against ominous background music and storm clouds, the Republican-financed spots hit Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic senator, over the Affordable Care Act, Iran and veterans\u2019 health care.By July, a Milwaukee radio station was carrying audacious ads about Ms. Baldwin\u2019s support for abortion rights.Then came the positive ads describing one of her opponents, Kevin Nicholson, as a former Marine; an \u201coutsider\u201d; a businessman; and, like Ronald Reagan, a convert to conservatism.The big spending doesn\u2019t just signal that each party sees the Senate seat as winnable. It\u2019s also a measure of intensity on both sides to prevail in Wisconsin after Donald J. Trump shocked Democrats in 2016 by being the first Republican presidential nominee to carry the state since 1984. National Democrats are bent on winning it back in 2020 \u2014 and getting Ms. Baldwin re-elected is a crucial step toward that goal.The fight may become the most expensive Wisconsin Senate race ever: An analysis by the state Democratic Party found that nearly $10 million in advertising had already aired or been purchased by outside groups against Ms. Baldwin or in favor of Mr. Nicholson. (Mr. Nicholson\u2019s camp put the number at nearly $9 million.) At least another $3.7 million in advertising is underway sponsored by outside groups in favor of Ms. Baldwin.The advertising by political action committees like Restoration PAC and Americas PAC \u2014 both heavily financed by the hard-right industrialist Richard Uihlein \u2014 has propelled the first-time candidacy of Mr. Nicholson, and underscores the influential role that outside conservative PACs play in this politically polarized state. Organizations funded by Mr. Uihlein and the billionaire Koch brothers have devoted millions to assuring continued Republican control of the Senate, and many conservatives view Ms. Baldwin, 56, as a beatable first-term senator who symbolizes the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party.\u201cTammy Baldwin is very vulnerable,\u201d said Brad Courtney, the state\u2019s Republican chairman, calling her one of the Senate\u2019s most liberal members. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be lots of money coming into Wisconsin.\u201dEven in this rural area of small farms, nearly two hours from Milwaukee, it\u2019s hard to avoid the drumbeat of ads, which began well before the traditional start of campaign season.\u201cI hear a lot of stuff on the radio,\u201d said Gary Buchholz, a soil technician who was part of the crowd at J & J Fireball Lanes, a local bowling alley, and plans to vote for Ms. Baldwin. \u201cI don\u2019t like the money that comes in from out of state, huge amounts of money trying to influence Wisconsin elections.\u201dPartly to counter the advertising, an energized Democratic base is organizing early, determined to retain the Senate seat held by their party since 1957, when William Proxmire was elected to the unexpired term of Joseph McCarthy, who had died in office. Yet Wisconsin has become a Republican stronghold: The state not only voted for Mr. Trump, but has also become a laboratory for conservative policy ideas under its two-term governor, Scott Walker, and the Republican-controlled legislature.In November, Ms. Baldwin is expected to face either Mr. Nicholson or Leah Vukmir, a conservative state senator favored by the state\u2019s Republican establishment. Ms. Vukmir, 59, has also benefited from political action committee spending, with a $935,000 ad buy by a group called Wisconsin Next PAC, funded partly by the Beloit businesswoman Diane Hendricks. Ms. Vukmir has also received scores of endorsements from state Republicans, including the support of Reince Priebus, a Wisconsinite who served as White House chief of staff.Democrats privately expressed concern that the negative advertising has whittled away at Ms. Baldwin\u2019s support. A March poll by Marquette Law School revealed that her approval rating was a mere 37 percent.Fearing a reprise of the 2016 Wisconsin Senate race \u2014 when outside groups targeted the Democratic candidate, Russ Feingold, who lost even though he had held a lead two months before the election in a Marquette poll over the incumbent Republican, Senator Ron Johnson \u2014 Ms. Baldwin\u2019s campaign has already dug into her formidable campaign chest. Her campaign said it planned to have 60 field organizers in place statewide by the end of next month.Ms. Baldwin\u2019s campaign also said it had released television advertising earlier than any incumbent Senate Democrat nationally, including one last week emphasizing her support for Wisconsin\u2019s cheese industry. Dairy farms have been a staple of rural areas of Wisconsin like Portage, the county seat of Columbia County, one of 23 Wisconsin counties carried by Mr. Trump that President Barack Obama had won in 2012. The industry has been hard-hit statewide, particularly in Columbia County.\u201cWe\u2019re in a crisis situation, losing a farm a day,\u201d said Sarah Lloyd, whose family milks 350 cows and who supports Ms. Baldwin, partly because of her efforts to bolster a milk price federal insurance program.Ms. Lloyd, who previously ran for Congress, was among about 100 Democrats who braved a harsh April snowstorm to attend the party\u2019s annual county dinner at a motel in this town of about 11,000 residents. Despite the weather, organizers said the meeting was the second-biggest turnout of Democrats ever in Columbia County.\u201cHillary took Wisconsin for granted,\u201d said Ms. Lloyd, referring to the 2016 Democratic nominee. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that happen again.\u201dThe next day, with snow still falling, a hardy group of about 150 Republicans turned out for a Lincoln-Reagan Day luncheon in Mequon, an affluent and reliably Republican suburb of Milwaukee.Addressing the crowd at the River Club of Mequon, in a ballroom with a panoramic golf course view, State Representative Jim Ott shared his concerns about a \u201cblue wave\u201d in November, describing how \u201c40 angry Democrats\u201d had taken over his normally staid town hall meeting.The results of two recent Wisconsin elections in which outside spending was a factor have added to Republican worries.In a January special election upset, a local medical examiner, a Democrat, easily defeated a Republican state legislator for a State Senate seat held by Republicans for 17 years. In that race, the Republican got help from radio and digital advertising by Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-funded group. Then, in April, in a statewide Supreme Court election, a liberal judge from Milwaukee County defeated a county circuit judge backed by conservatives. The winner in that race received a boost from digital ads paid for by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, an organization headed by former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.In many ways, the dynamics in Wisconsin mirror what\u2019s happening nationally within the Republican Party, with deeply conservative newcomers allying with outside donors to challenge more traditional Republicans.The insurgent candidacy of Mr. Nicholson \u2014 a Wisconsin native and Bronze Star recipient who has earned more than $1 million in the past two years as a consultant \u2014 appears to have been shaped in large part by the money of Mr. Uihlein, the founder of a shipping and industrial supply company.Long a power broker in Illinois and Wisconsin political circles, Mr. Uihlein has taken a more aggressive national approach this year, spending $20 million to back conservatives in races across the country. In March of last year, a new Uihlein-backed PAC, Solutions for Wisconsin, announced that Mr. Uihlein had contributed $2 million to support a Senate run by Mr. Nicholson. In all, according to a recent Democratic Party analysis, spending by Uihlein-funded groups in favor of Mr. Nicholson and against Ms. Baldwin exceeds $5.4 million. Mr. Uihlein did not respond to a request for an interview regarding the Wisconsin Senate race.Mr. Nicholson, a telegenic 40-year-old who always seems to have a fresh haircut, said he had begun exploring the idea of a Senate run well before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, seeking support both inside the state and from national donors.\u201cThe coalition is very impressive,\u201d Mr. Nicholson said, reeling off a list of six groups supporting him, including four groups that have received large donations from Mr. Uihlein. \u201cWe have a lot of groups stepping in to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to help you take back that seat.\u2019\u201dMr. Nicholson\u2019s political metamorphosis from Democrat to Republican has attracted thinly veiled criticism from some within the party who question his sincerity. Ms. Vukmir, who worked as a registered nurse for many years, told the crowd in Mequon, \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent pro-life and I have always been 100 percent pro-life.\u201dMr. Nicholson has given various interviews about his transformation from Democrat to Republican, saying that he departed the 2000 convention disillusioned with the party.Perhaps illustrating the political polarization of this state, Mr. Nicholson says he hasn\u2019t spoken with his Democratic parents in more than a year, blaming their estrangement on his political choices. \u201cNo doubt, obviously for them, it created a lot of frustration and disagreement that I feel the way I do and they made a decision that I think is unfortunate,\u201d Mr. Nicholson said.His parents are donors to Ms. Baldwin\u2019s campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why America\u2019s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis", "Date": "2018-04-11", "News": "FeatureThe answer to the disparity in death rates has everything to do with the lived experience of being a black woman in America.Supported byBut Landrum, who was the mother of two young sons, noticed something different about this pregnancy as it progressed. The trouble began with constant headaches and sensitivity to light; Landrum described the pain as \u201cshocking.\u201d It would have been reasonable to guess that the crippling headaches had something to do with stress: Her relationship with her boyfriend, the baby\u2019s father, had become increasingly contentious and eventually physically violent. Three months into her pregnancy, he became angry at her for wanting to hang out with friends and threw her to the ground outside their apartment. She scrambled to her feet, ran inside and called the police. He continued to pursue her, so she grabbed a knife. \u201cBack up \u2014 I have a baby,\u201d she screamed. After the police arrived, he was arrested and charged with multiple offenses, including battery. He was released on bond pending a trial that would not be held until the next year. Though she had broken up with him several times, Landrum took him back, out of love and also out of fear that she couldn\u2019t support herself, her sons and the child she was carrying on the paycheck from her waitress gig at a restaurant in the French Quarter.As her January due date grew closer, Landrum noticed that her hands, her feet and even her face were swollen, and she had to quit her job because she felt so ill. But her doctor, whom several friends had recommended and who accepted Medicaid, brushed aside her complaints. He recommended Tylenol for the headaches. \u201cI am not a person who likes to take medicine, but I was always popping Tylenol,\u201d Landrum says. \u201cWhen I told him my head still hurt, he said to take more.\u201dAt a prenatal appointment a few days before her baby shower in November, Landrum reported that the headache had intensified and that she felt achy and tired. A handwritten note from the appointment, sandwiched into a printed file of Landrum\u2019s electronic medical records that she later obtained, shows an elevated blood-pressure reading of 143/86. A top number of 140 or more or a bottom number higher than 90, especially combined with headaches, swelling and fatigue, points to the possibility of pre-eclampsia: dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy.When Landrum complained about how she was feeling more forcefully at the appointment, she recalls, her doctor told her to lie down \u2014 and calm down. She says that he also warned her that he was planning to go out of town and told her that he could deliver the baby by C-section that day if she wished, six weeks before her early-January due date. Landrum says it seemed like an ultimatum, centered on his schedule and convenience. So she took a deep breath and lay on her back for 40 minutes until her blood pressure dropped within normal range. Aside from the handwritten note, Landrum\u2019s medical records don\u2019t mention the hypertensive episode, the headaches or the swelling, and she says that was the last time the doctor or anyone from his office spoke to her. \u201cIt was like he threw me away,\u201d Landrum says angrily.Four days later, Landrum could no longer deny that something was very wrong. She was suffering from severe back pain and felt bone-tired, unable to get out of bed. That evening, she packed a bag and asked her boyfriend to take her sons to her stepfather\u2019s house and then drive her to the hospital. In the car on the way to drop off the boys, she felt wetness between her legs and assumed her water had broken. But when she looked at the seat, she saw blood. At her stepfather\u2019s house, she called 911. Before she got into the ambulance, Landrum pulled her sons close. \u201cMommy loves you,\u201d she told them, willing them to stay calm. \u201cI have to go away, but when I come back I will have your sister.\u201dBy the time she was lying on a gurney in the emergency room of Touro Infirmary, a hospital in the Uptown section of New Orleans, the splash of blood had turned into a steady stream. \u201cI could feel it draining out of me, like if you get a jug of milk and pour it onto the floor,\u201d she recalls. Elevated blood pressure \u2014 Landrum\u2019s medical records show a reading of 160/100 that day \u2014 had caused an abruption: the separation of the placenta from her uterine wall.With doctors and nurses hovering over her, everything became both hazy and chaotic. When a nurse moved a monitor across her belly, Landrum couldn\u2019t hear a heartbeat. \u201cI kept saying: \u2018Is she O.K.? Is she all right?\u2019\u2009\u201d Landrum recalls. \u201cNobody said a word. I have never heard a room so silent in my life.\u201d She remembers that the emergency-room doctor dropped his head. Then he looked into her eyes. \u201cHe told me my baby was dead inside of me. I was like: What just happened? Is this a dream? And then I turned my head to the side and threw up.\u201dSedated but conscious, Landrum felt her mind growing foggy. \u201cI was just so tired,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like giving up.\u201d Then she pictured the faces of her two young sons. \u201cI thought, Who\u2019s going to take care of them if I\u2019m gone?\u201d That\u2019s the last thing she recalls clearly. When she became more alert sometime later, a nurse told her that she had almost bled to death and had required a half dozen units of transfused blood and platelets to survive. \u201cThe nurse told me: \u2018You know, you been sick. You are very lucky to be alive,\u2019\u2009\u201d Landrum remembers. \u201cShe said it more than once.\u201dA few hours later, a nurse brought Harmony, who had been delivered stillborn via C-section, to her. Wrapped in a hospital blanket, her hair thick and black, the baby looked peaceful, as if she were dozing. \u201cShe was so beautiful \u2014 she reminded me of a doll,\u201d Landrum says. \u201cI know I was still sedated, but as I held her, I kept looking at her, thinking, Why doesn\u2019t she wake up? I tried to feel love, but after a while I got more and more angry. I thought, Why is God doing this to me?\u201dThe hardest part was going to pick up her sons empty-handed and telling them that their sister had died. \u201cI felt like I failed them,\u201d Landrum says, choking up. \u201cI felt like someone had taken something from me, but also from them.\u201dFrom 1915 through the 1990s, amid vast improvements in hygiene, nutrition, living conditions and health care, the number of babies of all races who died in the first year of life dropped by over 90 percent \u2014 a decrease unparalleled by reductions in other causes of death. But that national decline in infant mortality has since slowed. In 1960, the United States was ranked 12th among developed countries in infant mortality. Since then, with its rate largely driven by the deaths of black babies, the United States has fallen behind and now ranks 32nd out of the 35 wealthiest nations. Low birth weight is a key factor in infant death, and a new report released in March by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin suggests that the number of low-birth-weight babies born in the United States \u2014 also driven by the data for black babies \u2014 has inched up for the first time in a decade.This tragedy of black infant mortality is intimately intertwined with another tragedy: a crisis of death and near death in black mothers themselves. The United States is one of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal mortality \u2014 the death of a woman related to pregnancy or childbirth up to a year after the end of pregnancy \u2014 is now worse than it was 25 years ago. Each year, an estimated 700 to 900 maternal deaths occur in the United States. In addition, the C.D.C. reports more than 50,000 potentially preventable near-deaths, like Landrum\u2019s, per year \u2014 a number that rose nearly 200 percent from 1993 to 2014, the last year for which statistics are available. Black women are three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts, according to the C.D.C. \u2014 a disproportionate rate that is higher than that of Mexico, where nearly half the population lives in poverty \u2014 and as with infants, the high numbers for black women drive the national numbers.Monica Simpson is the executive director of SisterSong, the country\u2019s largest organization dedicated to reproductive justice for women of color, and a member of the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, an advocacy group. In 2014, she testified in Geneva before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, saying that the United States, by failing to address the crisis in black maternal mortality, was violating an international human rights treaty. After her testimony, the committee called on the United States to \u201celiminate racial disparities in the field of sexual and reproductive health and standardize the data-collection system on maternal and infant deaths in all states to effectively identify and address the causes of disparities in maternal- and infant-mortality rates.\u201d No such measures have been forthcoming. Only about half the states and a few cities maintain maternal-mortality review boards to analyze individual cases of pregnancy-related deaths. There has not been an official federal count of deaths related to pregnancy in more than 10 years. An effort to standardize the national count has been financed in part by contributions from Merck for Mothers, a program of the pharmaceutical company, to the CDC Foundation.The crisis of maternal death and near-death also persists for black women across class lines. This year, the tennis star Serena Williams shared in Vogue the story of the birth of her first child and in further detail in a Facebook post. The day after delivering her daughter, Alexis Olympia, via C-section in September, Williams experienced a pulmonary embolism, the sudden blockage of an artery in the lung by a blood clot. Though she had a history of this disorder and was gasping for breath, she says medical personnel initially ignored her concerns. Though Williams should have been able to count on the most attentive health care in the world, her medical team seems to have been unprepared to monitor her for complications after her cesarean, including blood clots, one of the most common side effects of C-sections. Even after she received treatment, her problems continued; coughing, triggered by the embolism, caused her C-section wound to rupture. When she returned to surgery, physicians discovered a large hematoma, or collection of blood, in her abdomen, which required more surgery. Williams, 36, spent the first six weeks of her baby\u2019s life bedridden.The reasons for the black-white divide in both infant and maternal mortality have been debated by researchers and doctors for more than two decades. But recently there has been growing acceptance of what has largely been, for the medical establishment, a shocking idea: For black women in America, an inescapable atmosphere of societal and systemic racism can create a kind of toxic physiological stress, resulting in conditions \u2014 including hypertension and pre-eclampsia \u2014 that lead directly to higher rates of infant and maternal death. And that societal racism is further expressed in a pervasive, longstanding racial bias in health care \u2014 including the dismissal of legitimate concerns and symptoms \u2014 that can help explain poor birth outcomes even in the case of black women with the most advantages.\u201cActual institutional and structural racism has a big bearing on our patients\u2019 lives, and it\u2019s our responsibility to talk about that more than just saying that it\u2019s a problem,\u201d says Dr. Sanithia L. Williams, an African-American OB-GYN in the Bay Area and a fellow with the nonprofit organization Physicians for Reproductive Health. \u201cThat has been the missing piece, I think, for a long time in medicine.\u201dThen he tore off her clothes and sexually assaulted her. She called the police, who arrested him and charged him with second-degree rape. Landrum got a restraining order, but the district attorney eventually declined to prosecute. She also sought the assistance of the New Orleans Family Justice Center, an organization that provides advocacy and support for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Counselors secreted her and her sons to a safe house, before moving them to a more permanent home early last year.Landrum had a brief relationship with another man and found out in March 2017 that she was pregnant again and due in December. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie; though I had a lot going on, I wanted to give my boys back the sister they had lost, \u201d Landrum said, looking down at her lap. \u201cThey don\u2019t forget. Every night they always say their prayers, like: \u2018Goodnight, Harmony. Goodnight, God. We love you, sister.\u2019\u2009\u201d She paused and took a breath. \u201cBut I was also afraid, because of what happened to me before.\u201dRight away, the case manager thought of her young, pregnant client. Losing her baby, nearly bleeding to death and fleeing an abusive partner were only the latest in a cascade of harrowing life events that Landrum had lived through since childhood. She was 10 when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005. She and her family first fled to a hotel and then walked more than a mile through the rising water to the Superdome, where thousands of evacuees were already packed in with little food, water or space. She remembers passing Charity Hospital, where she was born. \u201cThe water was getting deeper and deeper, and by the end, I was on my tippy-toes, and the water was starting to go right by my mouth,\u201d Landrum recalls. \u201cWhen I saw the hospital, honestly I thought, I\u2019m going to die where I was born.\u201d Landrum wasn\u2019t sure what doulas were, but once Bartkowicz explained their role as a source of support and information, she requested the service. Latona Giwa would be her doula.Giwa, the daughter of a white mother and a Nigerian immigrant father, took her first doula training while she was still a student at Grinnell College in Iowa. She moved to New Orleans for a fellowship in community organizing before getting a degree in nursing. After working as a labor and delivery nurse and then as a visiting nurse for Medicaid clients in St. Bernard Parish, an area of southeast New Orleans where every structure was damaged by Katrina floodwaters, she devoted herself to doula work and childbirth education. She founded Birthmark in 2011 with Dana Keren, another doula who was motivated to provide services for women in New Orleans who most needed support during pregnancy but couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201cBeing a labor and delivery nurse in the United States means seeing patients come in acute medical need, because we haven\u2019t been practicing preventive and supportive care all along,\u201d Giwa says. Louisiana ranks 44th out of all 50 states in maternal mortality; black mothers in the state die at 3.5 times the rate of white mothers. Among the 1,500 clients the Birthmark doulas have served since the collective\u2019s founding seven years ago, 10 infant deaths have occurred, including late-term miscarriage and stillbirth, which is lower than the overall rate for both Louisiana and the United States, as well as the rates for black infants. No mothers have died.In early November, the air was thick with humidity as Giwa pulled up to Landrum\u2019s house, half of a wood-frame duplex, for their second meeting. Landrum opened the door, happy to see the smiling, fresh-faced Giwa, who at first glance looked younger than her 23-year-old client. Giwa would continue to meet with Landrum weekly until her Dec. 22 due date, would be with her during labor and delivery and would make six postpartum home visits to assure that both mother and baby son remained healthy. Landrum led Giwa through her living room, which was empty except for a tangle of disconnected cable cords. She had left most of her belongings behind \u2014 including her dog and the children\u2019s new Christmas toys \u2014 when she fled from her abusive boyfriend, and she still couldn\u2019t afford to replace all her furniture.They sat at the kitchen table, where Giwa asked about Landrum\u2019s last doctor visit, prodding her for details. Landrum reassured her that her blood pressure and weight, as well as the baby\u2019s size and position, were all on target.\u201cHave you been getting rid of things that are stressful?\u201d Giwa asked, handing her a tin of lavender balm, homemade from herbs in her garden.\u201cI\u2019m trying not to be worried, but sometimes. \u2026\u201d Landrum said haltingly, looking down at the table as her hair, tipped orange at the ends, brushed her shoulders. \u201cI feel like my heart is so anxious.\u201dTaking crayons from her bag, Giwa suggested they write affirmations on sheets of white paper for Landrum to post around her home, to see and remind her of the good in her life. Landrum took a purple crayon, her favorite color, and scribbled in tight, tiny letters. But even as she wrote the affirmations, she began to recite a litany of fears: bleeding again when she goes into labor, coming home empty-handed, dying and leaving her sons motherless. Giwa leaned across the table, speaking evenly. \u201cI know that it was a tragedy and a huge loss with Harmony, but don\u2019t forget that you survived, you made it, you came home to your sons,\u201d she said. Landrum stopped writing and looked at Giwa.\u201cIf it\u2019s O.K., why don\u2019t I write down something you told me when we talked last time?\u201d Giwa asked. Landrum nodded. \u201cI know God has his arms wrapped around me and my son,\u201d Giwa wrote in large purple letters, outlining \u201cGod\u201d and \u201carms\u201d in red, as Landrum watched. She took out another sheet of paper and wrote, \u201cHarmony is here with us, protecting us.\u201d After the period, she drew two purple butterflies.Landrum\u2019s eyes locked on the butterflies. \u201cEvery day, I see a butterfly, and I think that\u2019s her. I really do,\u201d she said, finally smiling, her large, dark eyes crinkling into half moons. \u201cI like that a lot, because I think that\u2019s something that I can look at and be like, Girl, you going to be O.K.\u201dWith this pregnancy, Landrum was focused on making sure everything went right. She had switched to a new doctor, a woman who specialized in high-risk pregnancies and accepted Medicaid, and she would deliver this baby at a different hospital. Now she asked Giwa to review the birth plan one more time.\u201cOn Nov. 30, I go on call, and that means this phone is always on me,\u201d Giwa said, holding up her iPhone.\u201cWhat if. \u2026\u201d Landrum began tentatively.\u201cI\u2019m keeping a backup doula informed of everything,\u201d Giwa said. \u201cJust in case.\u201d\u201cI think everything\u2019s going to be O.K. this time,\u201d Landrum said. But it sounded like a question.At Essence magazine, where I was the health editor from the late \u201980s to the mid-\u201990s, we covered the issue of infant mortality by encouraging our largely middle-class black female readers to avoid unwanted pregnancy and by reminding them to pay attention to their health habits during pregnancy and make sure newborns slept on their backs. Because the future of the race depended on it, we also promoted a kind of each-one-teach-one mentality: Encourage teenagers in your orbit to just say no to sex and educate all the \u201csisters\u201d in your life (read: your less-educated and less-privileged friends and family) about the importance of prenatal care and healthful habits during pregnancy.Though I wouldn\u2019t learn of her work until years later, Dr. Arline Geronimus, a professor in the department of health behavior and health education at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, first linked stress and black infant mortality with her theory of \u201cweathering.\u201d She believed that a kind of toxic stress triggered the premature deterioration of the bodies of African-American women as a consequence of repeated exposure to a climate of discrimination and insults. The weathering of the mother\u2019s body, she theorized, could lead to poor pregnancy outcomes, including the death of her infant.By the late 1990s, other researchers were trying to chip away at the mystery of the black-white gap in infant mortality. Poverty on its own had been disproved to explain infant mortality, and a study of more than 1,000 women in New York and Chicago, published in The American Journal of Public Health in 1997, found that black women were less likely to drink and smoke during pregnancy, and that even when they had access to prenatal care, their babies were often born small.When I became pregnant in 1996, this research became suddenly real for me. When my Park Avenue OB-GYN, a female friend I trusted implicitly, discovered that my baby was far smaller than her gestational age would predict, even though I was in excellent health, she put me on bed rest and sent me to a specialist. I was found to have a condition called intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), generally associated with mothers who have diabetes, high blood pressure, malnutrition or infections including syphilis, none of which applied to me. During an appointment with a perinatologist \u2014 covered by my excellent health insurance \u2014 I was hounded with questions about my \u201clifestyle\u201d and whether I drank, smoked or used a vast assortment of illegal drugs. I wondered, Do these people think I\u2019m sucking on a crack pipe the second I leave the office? I eventually learned that in the absence of a medical condition, IUGR is almost exclusively linked with mothers who smoke or abuse drugs and alcohol. As my pregnancy progressed but my baby didn\u2019t grow, my doctor decided to induce labor one month before my due date, believing that the baby would be healthier outside my body. My daughter was born at 4 pounds 13 ounces, classified as low birth weight. Though she is now a bright, healthy, athletic college student, I have always wondered: Was this somehow related to the experience of being a black woman in America?During Giwa\u2019s last prenatal visit, the day before, she explained to Landrum that she would be given Pitocin, a synthetic version of the natural hormone that makes the uterus contract during labor, to start her contractions. \u201cWill inducing stress out the baby?\u201d Landrum asked. \u201cI can\u2019t lie; I used to wake up and scream, when I\u2019d be dreaming about getting cut open again. I know my body is fine, and I\u2019m healthy, but I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\u201cI respect how honest you are, and your trauma is real,\u201d Giwa told her, slowing down her words. \u201cBut my hope for you is, this birth can be a part of your healing. Your uterus is injured and has been scarred, but you\u2019ve pushed out two babies, so your body knows what it\u2019s doing.\u201dNow, lying on the table, Landrum looked out the window, smiling as the sound of her baby\u2019s heartbeat filled the room. A few minutes later, the technician returned and looked at the monitor. The baby\u2019s heart rate appeared less like little mountains than chicken scratching. He was also either not moving consistently or not breathing properly. A nurse left the room to call Landrum\u2019s doctor to get her opinion. The nurse returned in 20 minutes and gave Landrum the news that the baby would be induced not in two days but now. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait; we\u2019re going to get him out today,\u201d she said to Landrum.\u201cI\u2019m very anxious,\u201d Landrum told Giwa on the phone as she walked to labor and delivery, a few floors up in the same hospital, \u201cbut I\u2019m ready.\u201d An hour later, Giwa arrived, wearing purple scrubs, her cloth bag filled with snacks, lavender lotion and clary sage oil. She made sure the crayon-drawn affirmations were taped on the wall within Landrum\u2019s line of vision, then settled into a chair next to the bed, low-key but watchful. Though some doctors resent or even forbid the presence of a doula during labor and delivery \u2014 and some doulas overstep their roles and create conflict with doctors and nurses \u2014 Giwa says she and the other Birthmark doulas try to be unobtrusive and focused on what\u2019s best for the mother.A medical resident, who was white, like all of the staff who would attend Landrum throughout her labor and delivery, walked into the room with paperwork. Right away, she asked Landrum briskly, \u201cHave you had any children before?\u201dShe hadn\u2019t read the chart.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve had three babies, but one died,\u201d Landrum explained warily, for the third time since she had arrived at the hospital that day. Her voice was flat. \u201cI had a stillbirth.\u201d\u201cThe demise was last year?\u201d the resident asked without looking up to see Landrum stiffen at the word \u201cdemise.\u201d\u201cMay I speak to you outside,\u201d Giwa said to the nurse caring for Landrum. In the hall, she asked her to please make a note in Landrum\u2019s chart about the stillbirth. \u201cEach time she has to go over what happened, it brings her mind back to a place of fear and anxiety and loss,\u201d Giwa said later. \u201cThis is really serious. She\u2019s having a high-risk delivery, and I would hope that her care team would thoroughly review her chart before walking into her room.\u201dOne of the most important roles that doulas play is as an advocate in the medical system for their clients. \u201cAt the point a woman is most vulnerable, she has another set of ears and another voice to help get through some of the potentially traumatic decisions that have to be made,\u201d says D\u00e1na-Ain Davis, the director of the Center for the Study of Women and Society at the City University of New York, the author of a forthcoming book on pregnancy, race and premature birth and a black woman who is a doula herself. Doulas, she adds, \u201c are a critical piece of the puzzle in the crisis of premature birth, infant and maternal mortality in black women.\u201dOver the next 10 hours, Giwa left Landrum\u2019s side only briefly. About five hours in, Landrum requested an epidural. The anesthesiologist required all visitors to leave the room while it was administered. When Giwa returned about a half-hour later, Landrum was angry and agitated, clenching her fists and talking much faster than usual. She had mistakenly been given a spinal dose of anesthesia \u2014 generally reserved for C-sections performed in the operating room \u2014 rather than the epidural dose usually used in vaginal childbirth. Now she had no feeling at all in her legs and a splitting headache. When she questioned the incorrect dose of anesthesia, Landrum told Giwa, one nurse said, \u201cYou ask a lot of questions, don\u2019t you?\u201d and winked at another nurse in the room and then rolled her eyes.As Landrum loudly complained about what occurred, her blood pressure shot up, while the baby\u2019s heart rate dropped. Giwa glanced nervously at the monitor, the blinking lights reflecting off her face. \u201cWhat happened was wrong,\u201d she said to Landrum, lowering her voice to a whisper. \u201cBut for the sake of the baby, it\u2019s time to let it go.\u201dShe asked Landrum to close her eyes and imagine the color of her stress.\u201cRed,\u201d Landrum snapped, before finally laying her head onto the pillow.\u201cWhat color is really soothing and relaxing?\u201d Giwa asked, massaging her hand with lotion.\u201cLavender,\u201d Landrum replied, taking a deep breath. Over the next 10 minutes, Landrum\u2019s blood pressure dropped within normal range as the baby\u2019s heart rate stabilized.\u201cHe\u2019s ready,\u201d the doctor said, snapping off his gloves. \u201cIt\u2019s time to push.\u201dOne resident stepped forward and took his place, putting her hand into Landrum\u2019s vagina, feeling for the baby. Landrum gripped the side of the bed and closed her eyes, grimacing. \u201cYou\u2019re a rock star,\u201d Giwa said. The nurse, standing at her side, told Landrum: \u201cPush! Now. You can do it.\u201d After about 20 minutes of pushing, the baby\u2019s head appeared. \u201cThis is it,\u201d the nurse told her. \u201cYou can do this,\u201d Giwa whispered on her other side.Landrum bore down and pushed again. \u201cYou\u2019re doing amazing,\u201d Giwa said, not taking her eyes away from Landrum. The attending physician left the room to put on a clean gown. Landrum breathed in, closed her eyes and pushed. More of the infant\u2019s head appeared, a slick cluster of black curls. The senior resident motioned to the third and most junior of the women, standing at her shoulder, and told her, \u201cHere\u2019s your chance.\u201d The young resident took the baby\u2019s head and eased the slippery infant out. Landrum was oblivious to the procession of young residents taking turns between her legs or the fact that the attending physician wasn\u2019t in the room at all. She was sobbing, shaking, laughing \u2014 all at the same time \u2014 flooded with the kind of hysterical relief a woman feels when a baby leaves her body and emerges into the world.The resident lay the infant, purple, wrinkled and still as a stone, on Landrum\u2019s bare chest. \u201cIs he all right? Is he O.K.?\u201d Landrum asked, panicking as she looked down at the motionless baby. A second later, his tiny arms and legs tensed, and he opened his mouth and let out a definitive cry.\u201cHe\u2019s perfect,\u201d Giwa told her, touching her shoulder.\u201cI did it,\u201d Landrum said, looking up at Giwa and laying her hands on the baby\u2019s back, still coated with blood and amniotic fluid. She had decided to name him Kingston Blessed Landrum.\u201cYes,\u201d Giwa said, finally allowing herself a wide smile. \u201cYou did.\u201dWhat happened to the doctoral student altered the course of the study. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking, Here\u2019s a middle-class, well-educated black woman having a preterm birth when no one else in our group had a preterm birth,\u201d says Dr. Julie Palmer, associate director of the Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University and a principal investigator of the continuing study of 59,000 subjects. \u201cThat\u2019s when I became aware that the race difference in preterm birth has got to be something different, that it really cuts across class. People had already done some studies showing health effects of racism, so we wanted to ask about that as soon as possible.\u201dIn 1997, the study investigators added several yes-or-no questions about everyday race-related insults: I receive poorer service than others; people act as if I am not intelligent; people act as if I am dishonest; people act as if they are better than me; people act as if they are afraid of me. They also included a set of questions about more significant discrimination: I have been treated unfairly because of my race at my job, in housing or by the police. The findings showed higher levels of preterm birth among women who reported the greatest experiences of racism.The bone-deep accumulation of traumatizing life experiences and persistent insults that the study pinpointed is not the sort of \u201clean in\u201d stress relieved by meditation and \u201cme time.\u201d When a person is faced with a threat, the brain responds to the stress by releasing a flood of hormones, which allow the body to adapt and respond to the challenge. When stress is sustained, long-term exposure to stress hormones can lead to wear and tear on the cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems, making the body vulnerable to illness and even early death.Lynn Freedman, director of the Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, decided to take the lessons she and her colleagues learned while studying disrespect and abuse in maternal care in Tanzania \u2014 where problems in pregnancy and childbirth lead to nearly 20 percent of all deaths in women ages 15 to 49 \u2014 and apply them to New York City and Atlanta. Though the study is still in its preliminary phase, early focus groups of some 50 women who recently delivered babies in Washington Heights and Inwood, as well as with doulas who work in both those areas and in central Brooklyn, revealed a range of grievances \u2014 from having to wait one to two months before an initial prenatal appointment to being ignored, scolded and demeaned, even feeling bullied or pushed into having C-sections. \u201cDisrespect and abuse means more than just somebody wasn\u2019t nice to another individual person,\u201d Freedman says. \u201cThere is something structural and much deeper going on in the health system that then expresses itself in poor outcomes and sometimes deaths.\u201dLandrum stopped, and her entire body sagged. She told Giwa that her sons were staying on the other side of town with her godmother, whom she called Nanny. But with children of her own, Nanny was unable to make the 40-minute drive to bring Landrum\u2019s sons to the hospital to see their mama and meet their brother. \u201cAfter they lost their sister, it\u2019s really important that they see Kingston,\u201d Landrum said.\u201cI understand,\u201d Giwa said, stroking her shoulder. \u201cYou need the boys to see their brother, to know that he is alive, that this is all real.\u201d Landrum nodded. She made several phone calls from her hospital bed but could find no one to get the boys, so I left to drive across town and pick them up. It took Giwa\u2019s attentive eyes, and the months of building trust and a relationship with Landrum, to recognize a problem that couldn\u2019t be addressed medically but one that could have emotional and physical consequences.The doula consumer market has been largely driven by and tailored for white women, but the kind of support Giwa was providing to Landrum was actually originated by black women, the granny midwives of the South. Inspired by that historic legacy and by increasingly visible reproductive-justice activism, dozens of doula groups like Birthmark in New Orleans have emerged or expanded in the past several years in Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, Memphis, Miami, Washington and many other cities, providing services to women of color, often free or on a sliding scale.Interventions that have worked to bring down maternal- and infant-mortality rates in other parts of the world have been brought back to the United States. Rachel Zaslow, a midwife and doula based in Charlottesville, Va., runs a program in northern Uganda, where a woman has a one-in-25 lifetime chance of dying in childbirth, through her nonprofit organization, Mother Health International. In Zaslow\u2019s program, community health workers \u2014 individuals selected by the community and given medical training \u2014 link local pregnant women to trained midwives and nurse-midwives. Since 2008, a mother has never died in Zaslow\u2019s program, and the infant-mortality rate is 11 per 1,000, compared with 64 per 1,000 for the country at large.Three years ago, when she became aware of high rates of infant and maternal mortality in pockets of Virginia, Zaslow decided to take her Ugandan model there: a collective of 45 black and Latina doulas in Charlottesville, called Sisters Keeper, that offers birthing services free to women of color. \u201cThe doula model is very similar to the community health worker model that\u2019s being used a lot, and successfully, throughout the global South,\u201d Zaslow says. \u201cFor me, when it comes to maternal health, the answer is almost always some form of community health worker.\u201d Since 2015, the Sisters Keeper doulas have attended about 300 births \u2014 with no maternal deaths and only one infant death among them.\u201cIt is really hard for American health care professionals to get their heads around that when you have an organized community-based team that connects technical clinical issues with a deep, embedded set of relationships, you can make real breakthroughs,\u201d says Dr. Prabhjot Singh, the director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who studies community health worker models and how they can be used in the United States. \u201cIn the U.S., doulas can\u2019t do it by themselves, but based on work that\u2019s taken place globally, they can help reduce infant and maternal deaths using what is essentially a very simple solution.\u201dAn hour and a half after Giwa noticed that Landrum needed to have her sons with her, Caden and Dillon burst through the door of the hospital room. Holding Kingston in her lap, Landrum lit up at the sight of the boys. Caden, who is 4, ran to his new brother, gleefully grabbing at the infant. \u201cCalm down,\u201d Landrum said, smiling and patting the side of the bed. \u201cPut out your arms, strong, like this,\u201d she told him, arranging his small arms with her free hand. Gently, she lay Kingston in his brother\u2019s outstretched arms. \u201cIt\u2019s my baby,\u201d he said excitedly, leaning down to kiss the infant all over his cheeks and forehead. \u201cI luh you, brother.\u201dDillon, 7, was more cautious. He stood near the door, watchful. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to meet your brother, Dillon?\u201d Landrum asked. He inched closer, looking at the floor. \u201cCome on, boy, don\u2019t be shy. This is Kingston.\u201d He sat on the other side of his mother, and she took the baby from Caden and placed him in Dillon\u2019s arms. He looked down at the newborn, nervous and still hesitant. \u201cIt\u2019s a real baby,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and finally smiling. \u201cMommy, you did it.\u201d\u201cAt that moment, I felt complete,\u201d Landrum said later, tearing up, \u201cseeing them all together.\u201dLandrum had lost the baby weight and looked strong and healthy in an oversize T-shirt and leggings, wearing her hair in pink braids that hung down her back. There was a lightness to her that wasn\u2019t apparent during her pregnancy. One word tumbling over the next, she told me that the new baby had motivated her to put her life in order. She had been doing hair and makeup for church members and friends out of her house to earn money to buy a car. She had applied to Delgado Community College to study to be an ultrasound technician. \u201cI love babies,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I look at ultrasound pictures, I imagine I see the babies smiling at me.\u201dLatona Giwa had continued to care for Landrum for two months after Kingston\u2019s birth. The C.D.C. measures American maternal mortality not just by deaths that occur in pregnancy or childbirth, or in the immediate days afterward, but rather all deaths during pregnancy and the year after the end of pregnancy \u2014 suggesting the need for continued care and monitoring, especially for women who are most at risk of complications.It was Giwa who drove Landrum and the baby home from the hospital, moving her own 2-year-old daughter\u2019s car seat from the back of her Honda and replacing it with a backward-facing infant seat, when Landrum had no other ride. It was Giwa who ushered the new mother into her home and then surprised her by taking a bag of groceries and a tray of homemade lasagna, still warm, from the back of the car. And it was Giwa who asked her, six weeks after childbirth, if she had talked to her doctor about getting a contraceptive implant to avoid pregnancy. When Landrum told her that her doctor had never called her about a checkup, Giwa was livid. \u201cHigh-risk patients with complicated maternal histories often have an appointment two weeks after they\u2019ve been discharged,\u201d she said later, after insisting that Landrum call to make an appointment. \u201cHer life is hectic; she\u2019s at home with three children. Luckily she\u2019s fine, but at minimum someone should\u2019ve called to check on her.\u201dFor Giwa\u2019s work with Landrum, from October to February, she earned just $600. Like the other Birthmark doulas, Giwa can\u2019t make ends meet just doing doula work; she is employed as a lactation consultant for new mothers both privately and at a \u201clatch clinic\u201d in a New Orleans office of the federal Women, Infants and Children Food and Nutrition Service that supports low-income pregnant and postpartum women.\u201cWe need to recognize that there is actual medical benefit to having doula support \u2014 and make the argument that insurance should pay for it,\u201d says Williams, the Bay Area OB-GYN. \u201cIt is a job. People do have to be paid for that work.\u201d Insurance would mean some standardization; Williams notes that many programs securing public funding or grants to provide doula support to lower-income women can\u2019t match the kind of money that private doulas can command. These programs often have \u201call black women who are doulas,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, it\u2019s fantastic that these women are training to be doulas and supporting other black women \u2014 but they\u2019re not making as much as these other doulas.\u201d If, she asks, \u201cdoula support is important and can have this beneficial outcome for women, especially black women, how can we actually move forward to make that more accessible to everybody?\u201dIn her home on that March afternoon, Landrum put Kingston into a baby carrier. He fell asleep as we walked five blocks to meet Dillon and Caden, who were due home from school at two different bus stops. The boys jumped off their buses, dressed in identical red polo shirts, their hair freshly cut, each dragging a large backpack, and ran to their mother. Dillon could hardly wait to pull out his report card and show his mother his grades; he had received four out of six \u201cexceptional\u201d marks. \u201cHe\u2019s smart,\u201d Landrum said, and he gave her a huge, gaptoothed smile.Then he raced ahead, his backpack lurching as he leapt over bumps in the sidewalk full of pent-up little-boy energy; Caden was right behind him, doing his best to keep up with his brother\u2019s longer strides. \u201cHey, y\u2019all, you be careful!\u201d Landrum called, keeping her eyes trained on them. \u201cYou hear me?!\u201dKingston stirred when he heard his mother\u2019s voice. He lifted his head briefly and looked into Landrum\u2019s face. Their eyes met, his still slightly crossed with new-baby nearsightedness. Landrum paused long enough to stroke his head and kiss his damp cheek. The baby sighed. Then he burrowed his head back into the warmth and safety of his mother\u2019s chest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sean Hannity Is Named as Client of Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s Lawyer", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom his Fox News pulpit, Sean Hannity has been one of the most ardent supporters of President Trump, cheering his agenda and excoriating his enemies.He has gone from giving advice on messaging and strategy to Mr. Trump and his advisers during the 2016 campaign to dining with him at the White House and Mar-a-Lago.Now, Mr. Hannity finds himself aligned even more closely with the president.That revelation nudged the conservative commentator into the orbit of those who have lately come under legal scrutiny related to the investigations of Mr. Trump and his associates by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. Both inquiries have provided fodder for Mr. Hannity\u2019s prime-time cable show and nationally syndicated radio program.In a legal filing before the hearing on Monday, Mr. Cohen said that, since 2017, he had worked as a lawyer for 10 clients, seven of whom he served by providing \u201cstrategic advice and business consulting.\u201d The other three comprised Mr. Trump, the Republican fund-raiser Elliott Broidy and a third person who went unnamed.The mystery was solved when Kimba M. Wood, a judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ordered that Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, disclose the name of the client in question \u2014 who turned out to be Mr. Hannity.Mr. Hannity denied on Monday that he was a client of Mr. Cohen\u2019s, saying that he had never paid him for his services and that his discussions with him were brief and centered on real estate.The surprise naming of Mr. Hannity took place after several minutes of back and forth among government representatives, members of Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal team and Judge Wood.Before the name was revealed, Mr. Ryan argued that the mystery client was a \u201cprominent person\u201d who wanted to keep his identity a secret because he would be \u201cembarrassed\u201d to be identified as having sought Mr. Cohen\u2019s counsel.Robert D. Balin, a lawyer for various media outlets, including The New York Times, CNN and others, interrupted the hearing to argue that embarrassment was not a sufficient cause to withhold a client\u2019s name, and Judge Wood agreed.After Mr. Hannity was named, there were audible gasps from the spectators.The hearing on Monday resulted from a challenge by Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers, who argued for the appointment of a \u201cspecial master\u201d to examine the records seized during the federal raid on April 9. The exact nature of Mr. Cohen\u2019s work for Mr. Hannity is unclear.On Fox News, the anchor Shepard Smith reported that his colleague had been named as a client of Mr. Cohen\u2019s, saying that it was time for him to address \u201cthe elephant in the room.\u201dAt roughly the same time, Mr. Hannity, on his radio show, said it was strange to see his name appearing on Fox News and wondered aloud if he should release a statement.The reference to a third party seemed to be an allusion to one of Mr. Cohen\u2019s specialties: drawing up confidential settlements. The lawyer has acknowledged paying $130,000 to Stephanie Clifford, an adult-film actress known as Stormy Daniels, as part of a nondisclosure agreement to secure her silence soon before Election Day in 2016.Fox News declined to comment beyond Mr. Hannity\u2019s statements. On his prime-time show on Monday night, Mr. Hannity seemed to suggest that he had not disclosed his link to Mr. Cohen to his network, saying, \u201cMy discussions with Michael Cohen never rose to any level that I needed to tell anyone that I was asking him questions.\u201dOn April 9 \u2014 the night of the F.B.I. raids on Mr. Cohen \u2014 Mr. Hannity, in high dudgeon, opened his show by telling viewers to \u201ckeep in mind that Cohen was never part of the Trump administration or the Trump campaign.\u201d\u201cThis is now officially an all-hands-on-deck effort to totally malign and, if possible, impeach the president of the United States,\u201d the host added.Without mentioning his relationship with Mr. Cohen, he continued, \u201cNow, what that means is, Mueller\u2019s witch-hunt investigation is now a runaway train that is clearly careening off the tracks.\u201dThere is on-air evidence that Mr. Hannity and Mr. Cohen go way back. In January 2017, shortly before the inaugural, Mr. Cohen was a guest on Mr. Hannity\u2019s radio show. The host described him as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer and then added, \u201cAlso, full disclosure: a personal friend of mine, long before this election ever started.\u201dMr. Cohen shot back, \u201cWell, there goes my reputation now, Sean.\u201dThe chummy conversation took place shortly after the so-called Steele dossier suggested that Mr. Cohen had visited Prague, a claim that Mr. Cohen has denied. Amid guffaws, Mr. Hannity discussed Mr. Cohen\u2019s alibi \u2014 that he had taken his 17-year-old-son to Los Angeles to meet with a baseball coach.Mr. Hannity praised Mr. Cohen\u2019s son as an \u201camazing pitcher, a talented pitcher.\u201dBefore the chat was done, Mr. Cohen thanked Mr. Hannity, saying: \u201cSean, I got to be honest, in all fairness, you have been a beacon for Mr. Trump, for the campaign. It\u2019s very rare that people thank you, because everybody is so busy, especially now with the transition. But on behalf of, obviously, Mr. Trump, the campaign, myself \u2014 you actually deserve a thank you.\u201dAmid the banter, the two mentioned talking with each other during late-night phone calls and discussed how Mr. Trump\u2019s enemies would be gunning for him after he took the Oval Office.\u201cYou and I have discussed this \u2014 they are going to try to destroy Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Hannity said.\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to make this statement to your audience: There is no way in the world I\u2019m going to let it happen,\u201d Mr. Cohen replied.Many years before Mr. Trump was a candidate, Mr. Hannity was there for him. In 2011, when Mr. Trump was making the media rounds to promote an unfounded conspiracy theory \u2014 the so-called birther theory \u2014 that President Obama had not been born in the United States, Mr. Hannity gave him a forum on his radio and television shows.On \u201cHannity\u201d on Monday night, the Fox host offered a welcome \u201cto all you liberals in the media and across America\u201d who do not normally tune into his show, and went on to denounce the media speculation over his link to Mr. Cohen as \u201cabsolutely insane.\u201dTo demonstrate this, Mr. Hannity aired a montage, culled from Monday\u2019s television coverage of cable news hosts saying his name over and over again. It lasted for 46 seconds.Mr. Hannity did face an unexpected challenge from one of his guests, the lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who unexpectedly told the host that it would have been \u201cmuch, much better\u201d to disclose that he was a Cohen client.And when Laura Ingraham \u2014 who follows Mr. Hannity at 10 p.m., and recently faced an advertising boycott \u2014 appeared for the usual banter between hosts, she sent a somewhat barbed joke his way.\u201cI\u2019m glad for like a millisecond,\u201d Ms. Ingraham said, \u201cthat the heat\u2019s off me and on you.\u201dSean Piccoli contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Scott Pruitt Before the E.P.A.: Fancy Homes, a Shell Company and Friends With Money", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Early in Scott Pruitt\u2019s political career, as a state senator from Tulsa, he attended a gathering at the Oklahoma City home of an influential telecommunications lobbyist who was nearing retirement and about to move away.The lobbyist said that after the 2003 gathering, Mr. Pruitt \u2014 who had a modest legal practice and a state salary of $38,400 \u2014 reached out to her. He wanted to buy her showplace home as a second residence for when he was in the state capital.\u201cFor those ego-minded politicians, it would be pretty cool to have this house close to the capitol,\u201d said the lobbyist, Marsha Lindsey. \u201cIt was stunning.\u201dSoon Mr. Pruitt was staying there, and so was at least one other lawmaker, according to interviews. Mr. Pruitt even bought Ms. Lindsey\u2019s dining room set, art and antique rugs, she said.The mortgage on the Oklahoma City home, the records show, was issued by a local bank that was led by another business associate of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s, Albert Kelly. Recently barred from working in the finance industry because of a banking violation, Mr. Kelly is now one of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s top aides at the E.P.A. and runs the agency\u2019s Superfund program.According to real estate records, the 2003 purchase of the house for $375,000 came at a steep discount of about $100,000 from what Ms. Lindsey had paid a year earlier \u2014 a shortfall picked up by her employer, the telecom giant SBC Oklahoma.In 2005, the shell company \u2014 Capitol House L.L.C. \u2014 sold the property for $95,000 more than it had paid. While shell companies are legal, they often obscure the people who have an interest in them, and none of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s financial disclosure filings in Oklahoma mentioned the company or the proceeds \u2014 a potential violation of the state\u2019s ethics rules.The Oklahoma City deal, which has not been previously reported, was one of several instances in which Mr. Pruitt appeared to have benefited from his relationships with Mr. Kelly and Mr. Wagner while in state politics.During his eight years as a Republican state senator, Mr. Pruitt also upgraded his family residence in suburban Tulsa from a small ranch-style home to a lakefront property in a gated community. In addition, he bought a sizable stake in a minor league baseball team, and took a second job at Mr. Wagner\u2019s corporate law firm. Mr. Kelly\u2019s bank, SpiritBank, would be there for much of it \u2014 providing financing for Mr. Pruitt\u2019s Tulsa home and his stake in the baseball team, as well as the mortgage for the Oklahoma City house.Lobbyists and others in Oklahoma state politics who encountered Mr. Pruitt recalled him as a tough competitor who always had his eye on a higher office. Some called him a \u201cBoy Scout\u201d who was stingy with his money, while others said privately that he had exuded a sense of entitlement \u2014 that rules did not apply to him.David Walters, a former Oklahoma governor and Democrat, described Mr. Pruitt as someone who looked out for himself over the needs of constituents, especially during his years as attorney general.\u201cI was disappointed to find him operating in a hyperpartisan manner and seemingly representing corporate interests over Oklahoma citizens,\u201d Mr. Walters said.In response to questions submitted by The New York Times about Mr. Pruitt\u2019s finances in Oklahoma, an E.P.A. spokeswoman said Mr. Pruitt\u2019s business dealings with Mr. Kelly and Mr. Wagner \u201cwere ethical\u201d and his stake in the shell company \u201cwas a simple real estate investment.\u201d\u201cMr. Wagner and Mr. Kelly left high-profile positions in law and banking in Oklahoma, to serve in the administration,\u201d the spokeswoman said in an email. \u201cThey are dedicated E.P.A. employees who have earned the respect and admiration of E.P.A. career employees across the country. They serve the country professionally, and transparently \u2014 and are committed to ensuring the programs they work on are successful.\u201dThe house on Northeast 17th Street in the historic Lincoln Terrace neighborhood here was built in 1928 and has a grand staircase and an arched doorway. Ms. Lindsey said one of the home\u2019s attractions was that it looked out on the white dome of the State Capitol.Mr. Pruitt stayed in the house for parts of 2004 and 2005, neighbors said. The residence put him within walking distance of his job \u2014 legislators worked only part of the year, mainly from February through May \u2014 and also near SBC Bricktown Ballpark, which was home to his baseball team, the RedHawks, now known as the Dodgers.Jim Dunlap, then a Republican leader in the State Senate, said he rented a room from Mr. Pruitt above the garage. He was under the impression that Mr. Pruitt had bought the home as an investment with a group of lawyers, he said.\u201cThis was a place where you slept and had dinner,\u201d Mr. Dunlap said. \u201cIt was all above board.\u201dOklahoma campaign disclosures filed by Mr. Pruitt at the time made no mention of the home purchase or the rental agreement with Mr. Dunlap. Real estate records show that the transfer of ownership from Ms. Lindsey, the lobbyist, was rather complicated and involved multiple steps \u2014 none of them with any public reference to Mr. Pruitt, though the E.P.A. spokeswoman confirmed that he was one of five co-owners of the shell company.When asked whether such a disclosure would be necessary, the executive director of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, Ashley Kemp, referred The Times to a 2005 ethics manual. The rules required disclosing \u201cevery business or entity\u201d in which an official held securities valued at $5,000 or more. Securities were defined to include \u201cdocuments that represent a share in a company.\u201dThe E.P.A. spokeswoman did not respond to questions about Mr. Pruitt\u2019s disclosure filings in Oklahoma.In November 2003, Ms. Lindsey signed the deed of the home over to a relocation company SBC had hired to handle her move and severance. She was reimbursed for close to $475,000, the amount she had paid for the house in 2002, as her contract required, she said.The next day, the relocation company signed the property over to Jon Jiles, a health care executive who has a range of business interests and made contributions to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s political campaigns. Records show no mortgage was involved, and Mr. Jiles paid $375,000 in cash.That December, Mr. Wagner officially registered the Capitol House shell company with the Oklahoma authorities, and Mr. Jiles transferred the deed to the newly formed company. Mr. Jiles was listed as a manager of Capitol House, and Mr. Wagner as the registered agent.The following month, SpiritBank, where Mr. Kelly was chief executive, approved a mortgage in the amount of $420,000 in the name of Capital House L.L.C., another spelling of the entity.Ms. Lindsey, the former lobbyist, said she had been focused on her impending move to Dallas, and had deferred the sale and other arrangements to the company\u2019s relocation agent. She said she had known nothing about the involvement of the shell company and did not recall the final sale price. \u201cThe bottom line is \u2014 it is unusual to take a $100,000 loss on the house\u201d after being on the market for just a few weeks, she said.Asked about the drop in price, AT&T said in a statement that two independent firms appraised the house and that its average value came to $390,000. The valuation and sale were handled by the relocation business, the company added.Mr. Jiles, in an email exchange, said he became involved because Mr. Wagner presented the house as \u201ca good deal\u201d and a convenient place to stay. He said he had no other business interactions with Mr. Pruitt.\u201cA cash transaction was most likely used because sellers will often sell for less if it\u2019s a cash deal rather than a finance deal,\u201d Mr. Jiles said. \u201cAnd I was likely the one most able to do a cash deal at the time.\u201dIn a statement, SpiritBank\u2019s chief executive and president, Rick Harper, said the bank was legally prohibited from commenting on specific loans, but added, \u201cSpiritBank is confident these loans were made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\u201dThe deal came at a time when SBC was a major employer in the state and a lobbying force in Oklahoma City.\u201cIt gives us a chance to try to build a relationship with a lawmaker or an official,\u201d a spokesman, Andy Morgan, told the newspaper. \u201cEvents like that offer a much more relaxed atmosphere.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re one of the state\u2019s largest employers. It\u2019s important that lawmakers are informed about issues affecting our company.\u201dThe prospect of another investigation into a longstanding bribery case had especially rattled SBC. In the early 1990s, an SBC lobbyist had been found guilty in federal court of paying a bribe to a public utilities commissioner to sway a vote that allowed the company to keep federal tax savings rather than disburse them to its ratepayers. But the vote itself was never overturned, and in 2003, another commissioner proposed reopening the investigation, claiming SBC still owed billions of dollars in refunds. The commissioner dropped his plans for an investigation after state legislators, and the attorney general at the time, Drew Edmondson, pushed back against the effort.Later, when Mr. Pruitt became attorney general, he helped quash another attempt to revisit the SBC bribery case. In a March 2011 letter, Mr. Pruitt\u2019s office warned that any commissioner who reopened the investigation could face prosecution for the misuse of public funds.Around the same time Mr. Pruitt invested in the house in Oklahoma City, he had finished a big business deal that involved Mr. Kelly, Mr. Wagner and a campaign donor who ran a large staffing company.The relationship continued, with Mr. Funk serving as campaign chairman during Mr. Pruitt\u2019s unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 2006. Mr. Pruitt announced his candidacy outside the ballpark and cited his efforts on workers\u2019 compensation among his achievements.After losing the election, Mr. Pruitt took a break from public office, but continued his business relationship with Mr. Funk, proposing a $200 million town center on a parking lot next to the ballpark. The City Council balked at the project, but Mr. Pruitt\u2019s ambitions and prominence grew.Back at home in Tulsa, Mr. Pruitt worked with Mr. Wagner\u2019s firm, which had offices in SpiritBank\u2019s building. As a corporate lawyer, Mr. Wagner frequently represented the bank, but also represented a used car dealership run by Mr. Pruitt\u2019s family.In 2004, Mr. Pruitt upgraded from a modest one-story home where his family had lived for over a decade to a $605,000 lakeside house a mile away. SpiritBank financed the home. The E.P.A. spokeswoman said Mr. Pruitt was able to afford the house \u201cdue to his sale of personal assets.\u201dMr. Pruitt moved the attorney general\u2019s outpost in Tulsa to a prime suite in the Bank of America tower, an almost $12,000-a-month space that quadrupled the annual rent. He required his staff to regularly drive him between Tulsa and Oklahoma City, according to several people familiar with his time as attorney general.And he channeled state contracts to Mr. Wagner\u2019s law firm, which was already doing business with the state.From 2011 to 2017, state records show, the attorney general\u2019s office awarded more than $600,000 in contracts to Mr. Wagner\u2019s Tulsa-based law firm, Latham, Wagner Steele & Lehman \u2014 greatly increasing work with the firm, which had gotten a total of about $100,000 over the four years before that. These contracts are not competitively bid. The additional expenditures reflected an approach, contentious even among some fellow Republicans, to hire private lawyers for state business, often for cases challenging federal regulations.\u201cHe said that these people had special expertise that his agency didn\u2019t have,\u201d said Paul Wesselhoft, a Republican former state representative. \u201cHe has an army of lawyers with expertise. He didn\u2019t have to spend that extra tax money to hire another law firm. It didn\u2019t seem frugal.\u201dMr. Pruitt used the Bank of America building as a base for his growing political ambitions. Oklahoma Strong Leadership, a political action committee he formed in 2015 to help finance fellow Republicans\u2019 campaigns, operated out of the building. The group shared a suite with another PAC tied to Mr. Pruitt, Liberty 2.0, as well as his campaign office.Oklahoma Strong Leadership, funded by private donors and corporations, also appeared to support lavish travel and entertainment.An analysis of expenditure disclosures by the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that pushes for stricter rules governing money in politics, shows that just 9 percent of the PAC\u2019s spending was devoted to other candidates. The group found that the PAC had disbursed more than $7,000 for trips to Hawaii in summer 2015 and 2016, $2,180 of which was spent at a Ritz-Carlton. The PAC also put $4,000 toward dining, including a $661 meal at the Cafe Pacific, a high-end seafood restaurant in Dallas.The person who oversaw that spending, as the PAC\u2019s treasurer and chairman, was Mr. Wagner.At the event were two of his most loyal Oklahoma business associates \u2014 Mr. Kelly and Mr. Wagner, newly installed as E.P.A. officials themselves, though neither of them had a background in environmental policy or regulation.Last year, Mr. Kelly, known as Kell, was barred for life from the banking industry.

Joseph E. Hall, so that he can face criminal trial, but American officials have refused, according to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry. Pakistani officials said that Colonel Hall faces a civil suit from the family of the rider, Ateeq Baig, and that on Tuesday he was barred from leaving the country.In Islamabad, Colonel Hall was briefly detained by the police after the crash, but was released because of his immunity, Pakistani police officials said.The American ambassador, David Hale, was called to the Foreign Ministry over the matter and later expressed sadness over it.

{"Headline": "Meghan Markle: The Biggest Influencer of All?", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the former actress steps onto the global stage, she has the potential to change the perception of fashion brands, the royal family and much more.On Wednesday night Meghan Markle finally walked down the wedding aisle, resplendent in a lacy, sparkling white dress. It was, of course, the \u201cSuits\u201d season finale, and she was marrying her on-show fianc\u00e9. But it was also a mere three weeks or so before Ms. Markle herself \u2014 biracial American, now former actress, divorc\u00e9e, United Nations women\u2019s advocate \u2014 will walk down the aisle in Windsor Castle to to marry her real fianc\u00e9, Prince Harry (beloved royal soldier and hell raiser turned mental health activist). That made for a digital frenzy about what may be coming, which is only going to grow as the days wind down. After all, the drip-drip-drip of details has already sped up. The betting is closed. On what? The still outstanding question: What will she wear? There are economic and cultural repercussions riding on the answer. And you thought it was just a dress. Pshaw.The answer won\u2019t be certain until the bride appears on May 19, but what is increasingly clear is that whoever the designer is, he or she will be vaulted into the global conversation. In today\u2019s influencer culture, when an individual\u2019s ability to ignite far-reaching trends simply by dint of her own appeal is more effective than any advertising campaign, and a photo can carry a message round the world more powerfully than any words, it is beginning to seem as if Ms. Markle could be the most influential of all.Even though she has deleted all of her social media accounts.The numbers began to roll in almost as soon as Ms. Markle appeared with Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in Toronto last September wearing ripped jeans from the California brand Mother and carrying an Everlane tote. At Everlane, there are more than 20,000 people on a wait list for the tote she carried, according to the company. When Michael Preysman, the Everlane founder and chief executive, was asked to come up with an equivalent celebrity, he said: \u201cAngelina Jolie.\u201d The white wrap coat by the Canadian company Line the Label that Ms. Markle wore for the engagement announcement sold out almost immediately, the brand said, and the website crashed. Traffic to the website of Birks, the Canadian jeweler responsible for the opal and gold stud earrings she was wearing in the same appearance, spiked 500 percent, according to Birks, and does so each time she wears a Birks piece.\u201cWe have had celebrities wear our pieces \u2014 Claire Foy, Serena Williams \u2014 but no has ever matched the magnitude of the global response,\u201d said Eva Hartling, the vice president of Birks. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had coverage in Canada,\u201d Ms. Hartling said, \u201cbut now we are in Vogue Japan, in Russia\u201d and more.When Ms. Markle carried a Strathberry bag for her first official appearance after the engagement, it sold out in 11 minutes, and traffic to the Scottish company\u2019s website rose 5,000 percent. In January, she wore a pair of black jeans from Hiut Denim, a small Welsh brand, and in March the company moved to a bigger factory to fulfill demand.But as soon as the report was issued, said David Haigh, the chief executive, \u201cpeople went bananas. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a press release get more coverage.\u201d Mr. Haigh began to revise his projections upward. Now, he believes, the wedding itself will have economic repercussions \u201ccloser to GBP one billion \u2014 and to be honest, it could be more than that.\u201d And that\u2019s just in Britain. In Canada, where Ms. Markle lived for much of the seven years she spent filming the television show \u201cSuits,\u201d the fashion industry is also banking on her patronage \u2014 not just to raise the profile of local brands including Birks, Line the Label, Sentaler and Mackage, but of the local industry itself. \u201cWhen you have a figure like that, it changes everything for designers and the country when it comes to fashion,\u201d Ms. Milner said, noting that there had been a stereotype of Canadian fashion as significantly less creative or trendsetting than Paris or Milan, but that Ms. Markle\u2019s patronage could change all that. \u201cFor people to be able to see Canadian brands in a new light is huge.\u201d The French-American designer Joseph Altuzarra, who started working with Ms. Markle when she was in \u201cSuits,\u201d said her ability to alter perception of a brand is \u201cless quantifiable, but arguably has a bigger impact\u201d than her effect on sales. She wore his pinstriped day dress to her first major event as a representative of the royal family, at the Commonwealth Youth Forum last week (website visits up 400 percent, Instagrams up 300 percent in the hours following, according to a spokeswoman for the brand). \u201cWe are not a millennial street style brand,\u201d Mr. Altuzarra said. \u201cWe are a niche brand in a niche area. She changes how people think of us.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that Meghan Markle is very considered in her choice of what she wears, and understands the soft power fashion can have in terms of connecting to a community, shining a light on local companies and using what you wear to challenge conventions,\u201d said Caroline Rush, the chief executive of the British Fashion Council.A random assortment of the brands Ms. Markle has worn include some major British labels (Burberry, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney), but as a whole they range in price, profile and place of origin, and the majority come from smaller contemporary brands from across the Commonwealth (and the former colonies). It is a description oddly reminiscent of Mrs. Obama\u2019s fashion history, though in its particulars it reflects both Ms. Markle\u2019s own story and the anticipation that she and Prince Harry will be tasked with acting as \u201cinternational ambassadors,\u201d according to Mr. Haigh; that in the shadow of Brexit, these royals cross borders, literally and symbolically. Also, perhaps, that Ms. Markle stands for something more than simply aspiration \u2014 she stands for change. That may be expressed in clothes but goes far beyond it.\u201cShe\u2019s less conventional than any of her potential royal peers,\u201d Mr. B\u00e9dos said. She has been criticized because of it \u2014 there were complaints about the ripped jeans, the sheer dress, her messy bun, her penchant for wearing thumb rings \u2014 but also cheered. It has the effect of appealing to a different constituency. Think of it this way: Catherine wears the requisite sheer stockings when she appears in public. Ms. Markle doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a detail, but it\u2019s telling. \u201cIt all seems genuine,\u201d Mr. Altuzarra said \u2014 which is, on the surface, an odd thing to say, but also important. As the hype and hope and gossip continues to build, and the collective breath is held for whatever the big dress (or maybe it won\u2019t be so big?) on the big day will be, that\u2019s a lesson worth remembering.Advertisement"}

The review began after a housing advocacy group filed a lawsuit on April 12 in federal court, contending that an Indianapolis investor group was selling rundown homes through a rent-to-own arrangement that\u2019s prohibited by the program.Chris Spina, a spokesman for Freddie, said the company \u201cis reviewing the transactions referenced in the complaint\u201d by the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana against an investor group operating under the name Casas Baratas Aqui \u2014 or \u201cCheap Homes Here\u201d in Spanish.The lawsuit alleges that the group has violated the federal Fair Housing Act by targeting Latino buyers. As part of its lawsuit, the housing advocacy organization said Casas Baratas Aqui had acquired nearly 1,000 formerly foreclosed homes and recently began selling some of those houses in rent-to-own transactions. The lawsuit references two homes that were part of the Freddie deal.The investor group received a roughly $13 million loan that was one of dozens included in the $161 million bond issued by CoreVest Finance. Freddie provided a financial guarantee that protects investors against the risk that the bond defaults.Freddie is providing that guarantee as part of a program it announced last year. The intention is to make it easier and cheaper for investors to get the money they need to buy homes that they can then rent out on affordable terms. The loans in this particular bond involved more than 2,000 homes in multiple states.The 2008 financial crisis created a boom in such products. There was a ready supply of cheap foreclosed homes for investors to buy and a large population of consumers unable to get traditional mortgages.Advertisement"}

He was going to get a \u201ctouch-up treatment\u201d at a rehab facility he had visited earlier this year, said Mr. Mellon\u2019s stepfather, J. Reeve Bright \u2014 and had been sober for about 70 days.He never made it there.Earlier in the week, Mr. Mellon visited with his parents in Delray Beach, Fla., where he was raised. \u201cWe had dinner with him on Saturday night, a joyful dinner and a very memorable dinner, more than we realized at the time,\u201d Mr. Bright said. \u201cHe hugged and kissed his mother and he hugged and kissed me. He said, \u2018I love you, Dad,\u2019 and I said that I loved him. And 48 hours later he was dead.\u201dMr. Mellon was a member of one of the country\u2019s oldest banking families: the great-great-great grandson of Judge Thomas Mellon, the Mellon Bank patriarch. Matthew Mellon\u2019s father, Karl N. Mellon, died in 1983 at the age of 45, by suicide. Mr. Mellon, who had dyslexia, attended Phelps, a boarding school outside of Philadelphia. He was raised by his mother, Anne, and Mr. Bright; they married in 1975. Mr. Mellon received a bachelor\u2019s degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1989. Mr. Mellon remained close to both his former wives. \u201cHis ex-wives are possibly even more devastated than his mother and I are,\u201d Mr. Bright said. \u201cWe were laughing as we were looking at pictures earlier. There was a picture of Matthew standing between Tamara and Nicole and all of them are smiling. I don\u2019t know how he did it!\u201d Toward the end of his marriage to Ms. Hanley, he expanded his professional interests to bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. In 2014, Mr. Marshack and Mr. Mellon formed their own company, MellonDrexel, that allowed them to consult companies in the nascent cryptocurrency sector. Mr. Mellon was particularly taken with one of those companies, Ripple, for which he became a global ambassador, using his connections to market the company to banks and to his rich or famous friends. He took much of his compensation in its currency, called XRP.Throughout his adult life, Mr. Mellon wrestled with drug addiction and was in and out of rehab. \u201cMatthew has struggled,\u201d his stepfather said, speaking of his son in the present tense. \u201cThere is no question that he has struggled.

{"Headline": "Lobbyists Who Donated to de Blasio Nonprofit Settle With Ethics Panel", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA state ethics panel investigating the activities of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s political nonprofit announced Monday that it had reached settlements with two prominent donors to the organization, known as the Campaign for One New York.The settlements are the first to come out of a lengthy investigation by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, which enforces state lobbying laws. The commission was looking into whether the nonprofit, now defunct, that Mr. de Blasio formed to back his prekindergarten initiative and other efforts lobbied the city in 2015 without registering to do so.The investigation, which has stretched past two years, had been stalled, officials said, after it emerged that state and federal prosecutors were talking to many of the same organizations and donors as part of their inquiries into whether Mr. de Blasio solicited campaign contributions in exchange for official city actions. No charges were ever filed in those cases, and Mr. de Blasio has maintained he acted appropriately. He repeated that stance during in an interview Monday on NY1 in which he was asked about the settlements.The panel has yet to rule on the central item in its investigation: whether the mayor\u2019s nonprofit violated the lobbying law. \u201cThe commission\u2019s investigation relating to donations to CONY is continuing,\u201d the panel said in announcing the settlements.Mr. Capalino agreed to pay a fine of $40,000 for making a $10,000 donation to the nonprofit and raising another $90,000 from his other lobbying clients at a time when he was a registered lobbyist. State rules bar lobbyists from giving gifts of more than $75 to elected leaders or to a charitable organization at the behest of the elected official.In April 2015, \u201cthe mayor directly requested respondent Capalino\u2019s support in advancing the city\u2019s legislative and policy objectives,\u201d the settlement says, and told him that Ross Offinger, treasurer of the nonprofit, \u201cwould provide further information on the details of that support.\u201d Mr. Offinger followed up with a request for a donation and help raising more.Mr. Capalino, in a statement, said he agreed to support the nonprofit when asked because of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s work on income inequality, but allowed that he \u201cshould have been more sensitive to how my support might appear.\u201d Mr. Capalino did not admit to any violation of the law and said he looked forward to \u201cputting this behind us.\u201dIn the Nyclass settlement, the group, which has campaigned for the removal of horse-drawn carriages from Central Park, was fined for failing to register as lobbyists. Its founders Steve Nislick and Wendy Neu both donated to the nonprofit as well, but their gifts were not part of the settlement. \u201cWe made a mistake in failing to file disclosure forms in the first half of 2014,\u201d they said in a joint statement.David M. Grandeau, a former head of the lobby commission and a frequent critic of the panel, said that Jcope appeared to be selectively applying regulations that it developed on its own in 2014.Walter J. McClure, a spokesman for the panel, disputed that. \u201cWe deal fairly and justly with entities and individuals who come under our jurisdiction,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Ms. Nelson-Greenberg doubles down on the absurdism: Sofia\u2019s parents nickname her \u201clittle spider\u201d because she was born with eight arms, while Eva (Megan Hill), an agency employee, cannot remember the name of the boyfriend she just broke up with. We are stuck in a collegiate version of Ionesco, and it is stultifying.Eventually, however, the real subject emerges: the way some men feel threatened by women and demand that love and work be on their terms \u2014 or else.Jon (Dennis William Grimes) is dumbfounded when he learns about menstruation; Howie (Amir Wachterman) has a meltdown and stops only when Sofia tells him that yes, he\u2019s funny: \u201cI think I just didn\u2019t understand the joke,\u201d she explains.As for Eva, she\u2019s willing to date just about any man because if her colleagues think she\u2019s single, they will pounce on her. The ending is bloody, although in a smartly unpredictable way, and may well haunt me for a while.If one theme emerged from Humana\u2019s 42nd edition, it is that living in the United States is a rather complicated proposition nowadays \u2014 especially if you happen to be a woman. Even a comedy like the ace Jaclyn Backhaus playlet \u201cThe National Foosball Championship\u201d (part of an omnibus of short works) revolved around a battle of the sexes.While everybody in Mark Schultz\u2019s \u201cEvocation to Visible Appearance\u201d is despondent, the two female characters feel powerless. Chatty Samantha (Suzy Weller) is dumped by her boyfriend (Lincoln Clauss) after informing him she\u2019s pregnant \u2014 which she may or may not be. Her sister, the sharp-tongued but depressive Natalie (Ronete Levenson), is in a mental institution.A sudden act of violence at a fast-food outlet does not feel earned, and comes across as gratuitous provocation, but the play is almost redeemed by a bizarre conclusion that left the audience as mystified as any I\u2019ve ever seen: In a kind of dark-arts s\u00e9ance, a deafeningly loud doom-metal song is performed live while Samantha attempts to conjure her possibly imaginary unborn child and her father (Bruce McKenzie) dances like a pained cartoon bear. The house lights abruptly come back. There is no curtain call.The four-character play, directed by Meredith McDonough, is professional, but to what end? No matter how much they suffered or how many friends and colleagues they lost, the characters don\u2019t seem to live beyond the page. Ultimately \u201cMarginal Loss\u201d lacks a strong point of view on what these finance workers are trying so hard to accomplish: to make a ton of money again.Masako (Ako) is getting chemotherapy in a hospital, attended by her daughters: the good-girl, born-again Sophie (Emma Kikue) and the pot-smoking, rebellious Hiro (Satomi Blair), who has flown in from New York. Masako\u2019s husband, James (Jay Patterson), is not aging well, having turned into a bit of a hoarder. Fights, reconciliations, tears \u2014 events follow a conventional route.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Aides Set Up Meetings to Help Donor With Lease, Emails Show", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. \u2014 When a New York restaurateur who had donated to Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s campaign grew increasingly desperate to get a lease renewed, he sent an email directly to one of the city\u2019s most powerful people: Emma Wolfe, a top aide to the mayor.\u201cHope you had a great holiday season,\u201d the restaurateur, Harendra Singh, wrote in January 2015. \u201cI would love to speak with you at your convenience.\u201dMs. Wolfe took just nine minutes to respond: \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she wrote, \u201clet\u2019s talk on Monday.\u201dA meeting was soon arranged \u2014 part of a longstanding effort that federal prosecutors say Mr. de Blasio and his aides undertook to help Mr. Singh in return for campaign contributions.The emails were among a raft of evidence related to the alleged scheme that was revealed in Federal District Court here on Wednesday, as part of a case that has revived discussions of possible impropriety by Mr. de Blasio, despite his not actually being involved in the trial.Ed Mangano, the former Nassau County executive; his wife, Linda; and John Venditto, the Oyster Bay town supervisor, are the defendants in the case, all charged with corruption concerning matters unrelated to Mr. de Blasio.The mayor has vehemently denied wrongdoing, saying his office treated Mr. Singh like any other constituent. He has not been charged with any crime, in part because he received only campaign contributions, not personal gifts.Nevertheless, Mr. Singh, testifying as a cooperative witness in the corruption trial, was asked about Mr. de Blasio for the fourth time in the last month. This time, the questions came from Mr. Venditto\u2019s lawyer, and Mr. Singh responded by providing new details about how the mayor personally intervened to help with the lease.Mr. Venditto\u2019s lawyer showed emails in which Mr. Singh stressed how he was a \u201cvery loyal and early friend of Bill.\u201d Ms. Wolfe and another member of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s staff, Javon Coney, responded by helping to set up meetings with the city officials involved in negotiations regarding the restaurant, Water\u2019s Edge, which was on city property in Queens.The lease negotiations were never finalized, although Mr. Singh has said that he had gotten the city to agree to pay for at least part of the replacement of a nearby pier before he was arrested in 2015 on charges that he gave Mr. Mangano and Mr. Venditto thousands of dollars in gifts in return for help obtaining guaranteed loans and county contracts.Mr. Singh has pleaded guilty to bribing Mr. de Blasio and the defendants in the Long Island case.On Wednesday, Mr. Singh also testified that he had many conversations with Mr. de Blasio, and that in each, the two discussed both the lease and political donations.\u201cHe was always looking for money for himself,\u201d Mr. Singh said.A mayoral spokesman said in a statement: \u201cThis administration acted appropriately at all times. We make decisions on the merits. Period.\u201dThe mayor has also suggested that Mr. Singh made up the allegations to appease prosecutors and avoid jail time for his own crimes \u2014 the same argument being made by lawyers for Mr. Mangano and Mr. Venditto. The argument got a boost last week, when defense lawyers played audio recordings in which Mr. Singh said prosecutors wanted him to \u201ctell a story about some politicians \u2026 but it would all be lies.\u201d (Mr. Singh testified in court that that statement itself was a lie.)Unexpectedly, Mr. de Blasio has become part of the trial in part because of his vigorous defense. The lawyers for Mr. Mangano and Mr. Venditto have said that Mr. Singh\u2019s testimony about the mayor discredits him, and that the evidence against the mayor is in some ways stronger than the evidence against their clients.Mr. Venditto\u2019s lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, has spoken about the importance of Mr. Singh\u2019s story about Mr. de Blasio, and has mused about asking the mayor to testify.Wednesday was Mr. Singh\u2019s 11th day on the stand.

{"Headline": "Martin Luther King Jr.: 50 Years Later, His Battles Live On", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "We see him standing before hundreds of thousands of followers in the nation\u2019s capital in 1963, proclaiming his dream for racial harmony. We see him marching, arms locked with fellow protesters, through the battleground of Alabama in 1965.But on the 50th anniversary of his death, it is worth noting how his message and his priorities had evolved by the time he was shot on that balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis in 1968. Dr. King was confronting many challenges that remain with us today.He was battling racism in the North then, not just in the South. He was pushing the government to address poverty, income inequality, structural racism and segregation in cities like Boston and Chicago. He was also calling for an end to a war that was draining the national treasury of funds needed to finance a progressive domestic agenda.This may not be the Dr. King that many remember. Yet, his words resonate powerfully \u2013 and, perhaps, uncomfortably \u2013 today in a country that remains deeply divided on issues of race and class.\u201cAll the issues that he raised toward the end of his life are as contemporary now as they were then,\u201d said Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer-Prize winning historian who has written several books about Dr. King.It is no surprise that Americans remember the man who focused on demolishing the legal underpinnings of Jim Crow.Holding on to the memory of the earlier Dr. King allows us to focus on our nation\u2019s progress, not on the deeply entrenched problems that remain.\u201cPolicy makers of the white society have caused the darkness; they created discrimination; they structured slums; and they perpetuate unemployment, ignorance and poverty,\u201d Dr. King said in 1967, referring to bias in zoning, public budgets and employment.His marches into northern white neighborhoods touched off a backlash among white leaders and residents who had supported similar tactics in the south. His popularity plummeted.His call for an interracial coalition to demand \u201cjobs or income now\u201d was greeted skeptically by some of his supporters and by members of the Black Power movement.His call for an end to the Vietnam War outraged President Lyndon Johnson, lawmakers and others. Even some of his aides doubted the wisdom of that decision and his plan to mobilize a poor people\u2019s campaign.\u201cHe was far more visionary than those around him,\u201d said Clayborne Carson, the director of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute at Stanford University.What would Dr. King make of America today?Historians believe he would marvel at the expansion of rights for women and the L.G.B.T.Q. community, the growth of the black middle class and the number of black elected leaders, including America\u2019s first black president.He would also see a country beset by many of the problems he had urged Americans to focus on during the last years of his life.\u201cI think we should have listened to him then,\u201d Mr. Branch said. \u201cWe really ought to listen to him now.\u201d \u2014 Rachel L. Swarns \n        As Martin Luther King Jr. shifted from integration, he tried to stabilize a vast civil rights movement, pushed for the rights of the sanitation workers in Memphis, and organized a campaign for the poor. A look at those issues then and now.\n      \n        On April 4, 1968, Dr. King was assassinated in Memphis by a fugitive named James Earl Ray. That an advocate of peace met a violent end shook the country and spurred a rethinking of gun laws.\n      \n        A look at how the country dealt with the loss of Dr. King and his rebirth as the benevolent figure he is known as today.\n       From our colleagues in opinion  Michael Eric Dyson  Wendi C.

{"Headline": "The ISIS Files: When Terrorists Run City Hall", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "We unearthed thousands of internal documents that help explain how the Islamic State stayed in power so long.On five trips to battle-scarred Iraq, journalists for The New York Times scoured old Islamic State offices, gathering thousands of files abandoned by the militants as their \u2018caliphate\u2019 crumbled.MOSUL, Iraq \u2014 Weeks after the militants seized the city, as fighters roamed the streets and religious extremists rewrote the laws, an order rang out from the loudspeakers of local mosques.Public servants, the speakers blared, were to report to their former offices.To make sure every government worker got the message, the militants followed up with phone calls to supervisors. When one tried to beg off, citing a back injury, he was told: \u201cIf you don\u2019t show up, we\u2019ll come and break your back ourselves.\u201dThe phone call reached Muhammad Nasser Hamoud, a 19-year veteran of the Iraqi Directorate of Agriculture, behind the locked gate of his home, where he was hiding with his family. Terrified but unsure what else to do, he and his colleagues trudged back to their six-story office complex decorated with posters of seed hybrids.They arrived to find chairs lined up in neat rows, as if for a lecture.The commander who strode in sat facing the room, his leg splayed out so that everyone could see the pistol holstered to his thigh. For a moment, the only sounds were the hurried prayers of the civil servants mumbling under their breath.Their fears proved unfounded. Though he spoke in a menacing tone, the commander had a surprisingly tame request: Resume your jobs immediately, he told them. A sign-in sheet would be placed at the entrance to each department. Those who failed to show up would be punished.Meetings like this one occurred throughout the territory controlled by the Islamic State in 2014. Soon municipal employees were back fixing potholes, painting crosswalks, repairing power lines and overseeing payroll.\u201cWe had no choice but to go back to work,\u201d said Mr. Hamoud. \u201cWe did the same job as before. Except we were now serving a terrorist group.\u201dSince declaring a caliphate in 2014, the Islamic State has controlled large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. But after the group retreated from Mosul and Raqqa in 2017, it lost nearly all of its territory.Persistent controlCurrent controlShort-livedPopulated areasISIS Control KeyQamishliKobaniTURKEYDohukManbijHasakaTal AfarSinjarAleppoIdlibMosulRaqqaErbilSyriaIraqSulaimaniyaDeir al-ZourHamaKirkukHawijaMayadeenSukhnaHomsPalmyraLebanonIranTikritAbu KamalQaimAyn al-FarsHadithaHitBaqubaDamascusFallujaRamadiNawaBaghdadRutbaSweidaJordanDara\u2019aPersistent controlShort-livedCurrent controlPopulated areasISIS Control KeyTURKEYTURKEYAleppoMosulRaqqaSyriaSyriaIraqIraqLebanonLebanonIranIranDamascusDamascusBaghdadBaghdadJordanJordanISIS Control KeyPersistent controlShort-livedCurrent ISIS controlPopulated areasTURKEYAleppoMosulRaqqaSyriaIraqIranLebanonDamascusBaghdadJordanISIS Control KeyPersistent controlShort-livedCurrent controlPopulated areasTURKEYMosulIranRaqqaAleppoSyriaIraqDamascusBaghdadRutbaJordanISIS Control KeyPersistent controlShort-livedCurrent controlPopulated areasTURKEYMosulIranRaqqaAleppoSyriaIraqDamascusBaghdadRutbaJordanNearly all of that territory has now been lost, but what the militants left behind helps answer the troubling question of their longevity: How did a group whose spectacles of violence galvanized the world against it hold onto so much land for so long?Part of the answer can be found in more than 15,000 pages of internal Islamic State documents I recovered during five trips to Iraq over more than a year.The documents were pulled from the drawers of the desks behind which the militants once sat, from the shelves of their police stations, from the floors of their courts, from the lockers of their training camps and from the homes of their emirs, including this record detailing the jailing of a 14-year-old boy for goofing around during prayer.BADC\u00a0The ticket book was recovered in early 2017 north of Mosul in the town of Tel Kaif, in a house that ISIS had turned into a police station.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ticket book was recovered in early 2017 north of Mosul in the town of Tel Kaif, in a house that ISIS had turned into a police station.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BADCBADC\u00a0The ticket book was recovered in early 2017 north of Mosul in the town of Tel Kaif, in a house that ISIS had turned into a police station.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BADC\u00a0The ticket book was recovered in early 2017 north of Mosul in the town of Tel Kaif, in a house that ISIS had turned into a police station.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The New York Times worked with outside experts to verify their authenticity, and a team of journalists spent 15 months translating and analyzing them page by page.Individually, each piece of paper documents a single, routine interaction: A land transfer between neighbors. The sale of a ton of wheat. A fine for improper dress.But taken together, the documents in the trove reveal the inner workings of a complex system of government. They show that the group, if only for a finite amount of time, realized its dream: to establish its own state, a theocracy they considered a caliphate, run according to their strict interpretation of Islam.The world knows the Islamic State for its brutality, but the militants did not rule by the sword alone. They wielded power through two complementary tools: brutality and bureaucracy.The documents and interviews with dozens of people who lived under their rule show that the group at times offered better services and proved itself more capable than the government it had replaced.A little more than a decade later, after seizing huge tracts of Iraq and Syria, the militants tried a different tactic. They built their state on the back of the one that existed before, absorbing the administrative know-how of its hundreds of government cadres. An examination of how the group governed reveals a pattern of collaboration between the militants and the civilians under their yoke.One of the keys to their success was their diversified revenue stream. The group drew its income from so many strands of the economy that airstrikes alone were not enough to cripple it.Ledgers, receipt books and monthly budgets describe how the militants monetized every inch of territory they conquered, taxing every bushel of wheat, every liter of sheep\u2019s milk and every watermelon sold at markets they controlled. From agriculture alone, they reaped hundreds of millions of dollars. Contrary to popular perception, the group was self-financed, not dependent on external donors.More surprisingly, the documents provide further evidence that the tax revenue the Islamic State earned far outstripped income from oil sales. It was daily commerce and agriculture \u2014 not petroleum \u2014 that powered the economy of the caliphate.The United States-led coalition, trying to eject the Islamic State from the region, tried in vain to strangle the group by bombing its oil installations. It\u2019s much harder to bomb a barley field. It was not until last summer that the militants abandoned Mosul, after a battle so intense that it was compared to the worst combat of World War II.While the militants\u2019 state eventually crumbled, its blueprint remains for others to use.\u201cThe Islamic State\u2019s capacity to govern is really as dangerous as their combatants,\u201d he said.The day after the meeting, Mr. Hamoud, a Sunni, returned to work and found that his department was now staffed 100 percent by Sunnis, the sect of Islam practiced by the militants. The Shia and Christian colleagues who previously shared his office had all fled.For a while, Mr. Hamoud and the employees he supervised at the agriculture department went on much as they had before. Even the stationery they used was the same, though they were instructed to use a marker to cover up the Iraqi government\u2019s logo.But the long-bearded men who now oversaw Mr. Hamoud\u2019s department had come with a plan, and they slowly began to enact it.What began as a cosmetic change in Mr. Hamoud\u2019s office soon turned into a wholesale transformation.The militants sent female employees home for good and closed the day care center.

He took out the slacks he wore to work and asked his wife to trim off 5 centimeters.But the biggest change came five months into the group\u2019s rule, and it turned the hundreds of employees who had reluctantly returned to work into direct accomplices of the Islamic State. The change involved the very department Mr. Hamoud headed, which was responsible for renting government-owned land to farmers.To increase revenue, the militants ordered the agriculture department to speed up the process for renting land, streamlining a weekslong application into something that could be accomplished in an afternoon.That was just the beginning.\u201cConfiscation,\u201d the manual says, will be applied to the property of every single \u201cShia, apostate, Christian, Nusayri and Yazidi based on a lawful order issued directly by the Ministry of the Judiciary.\u201dIslamic State members are exclusively Sunni and see themselves as the only true believers. Mr. Hamoud\u2019s office was instructed to make a comprehensive list of the properties owned by non-Sunnis \u2014 and to seize them for redistribution.The confiscation didn\u2019t stop at the land and homes of the families they chased out. An entire ministry was set up to collect and reallocate beds, tables, bookshelves \u2014 even the forks the militants took from the houses they seized. They called it the Ministry of War Spoils.It was housed in a stone-faced building in western Mosul that was hit by an airstrike in the battle to retake the city. The ensuing fire consumed the structure and blackened its walls. But the charred shapes left behind still told a story. Each room served as a warehouse for ordinary household objects: kerosene heaters in one; cooking ranges in another; a jumble of air coolers and water tanks in yet another.The few papers that did not burn up showed how objects seized from the religious groups they had chased out were offered as rewards to ISIS fighters.\u201cPlease kindly approve the request of the family of the late Brother Durayd Salih Khalaf,\u201d says one letter written on the letterhead of the Islamic State\u2019s Prisoners and Martyrs Affairs Authority.

It\u2019s the good life!!! I didn\u2019t buy so much as a single fork.\u201dWhen her concerned teacher wrote back that the apartment had probably been stolen from another family, she shot back: \u201cServes them right, dirty Shia!!!\u201dThose documents revealed the inner workings of Al Qaeda, and years later I wanted to investigate the Islamic State in the same way.When the coalition forces moved to take Mosul back from the militants in late 2016, I rushed to Iraq. For three weeks, I tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to find any documents. Day after day, my team negotiated access to buildings painted with the Islamic State logo, only to find desk drawers jutting out and hard drives ripped out.Then, the day before my return flight, we met a man who remembered seeing stacks of paper inside the provincial headquarters of the Islamic State\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture in a small village called Omar Khan, 25 miles southeast of the city. The next day we traveled to the town, no more than a speck on the map of the Nineveh Plains, and entered House No. 47.My heart sank as we pushed open the door and saw the closets flung open \u2014 a clear sign that the place had already been cleared.But on the way out, I stopped at what seemed to be an outhouse. When we opened the door, we saw piles of yellow folders cinched together with twine and stacked on the floor.Folder after folder, 273 in all, identified plots of land owned by farmers who belonged to one of the faiths banned by the group. Each yellow sleeve contained the handwritten request of a Sunni applying to confiscate the property.BAAC\u00a0The leases were found by Times reporters in the village of Omar Khan in northern Iraq in December 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The leases were found by Times reporters in the village of Omar Khan in northern Iraq in December 2016.\u00a0BAACBAAC\u00a0The leases were found by Times reporters in the village of Omar Khan in northern Iraq in December 2016.\u00a0\u00a0BAAC\u00a0The leases were found by Times reporters in the village of Omar Khan in northern Iraq in December 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Doing so involved a step-by-step process, beginning with a report by a surveyor, who mapped the plot, noted important topographical features and researched the property\u2019s ownership. Once it was determined that the land was owned by one of the targeted groups, it was classified as property of the Islamic State. Then a contract was drawn up spelling out that the tenant could neither sublet the land nor modify it without the group\u2019s permission.The outhouse discovery taught me to stay off the beaten track. I learned to read the landscape for clues, starting with \u0628\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u2014 \u201cbaqiya\u201d \u2014 the first word of the Islamic State slogan. It can be translated as \u201cwill remain,\u201d and marked the buildings the group occupied, invoking its claim that the Islamic State will endure.Once we confirmed that a building had been occupied by the group, we lifted up the mattresses and pulled back the headboards of beds. We rifled through the closets, opened kitchen cupboards, followed the stairs to the roof and scanned the grounds.The danger of land mines and booby-traps hung over our team. In one villa, we found a collection of records \u2014 but could search only one set of rooms after security forces discovered an unexploded bomb.Because the buildings were near the front lines, Iraqi security forces nearly always accompanied our team. They led the way and gave permission to take the documents. In time, the troops escorting us became our sources and they, in turn, shared what they found, augmenting our cache by hundreds of records.They deemed the records to be original, based on the markings, logos and stamps, as well as the names of government offices. The terminology and design were consistent with those found on documents issued by the group in other parts of the caliphate, including as far afield as Libya.As lease after lease was translated back in New York, the same signature inked at the bottom of numerous contracts kept reappearing: \u201cChief Technical Supervisor, Mahmoud Ismael Salim, Supervisor of Land.\u201dOn my first trip back to Iraq, I showed the leases to a local police officer. He recognized the angular signature and offered to escort me to the home of the ISIS bureaucrat.The officer shrugged when asked why a man who had taken part in the group\u2019s organized land theft had not been arrested. His men were overwhelmed investigating those who had fought and killed on behalf of the terrorist group, he said. They didn\u2019t have time to also go after the hundreds of civil servants who had worked in the Islamic State\u2019s administration.Hours later, the man whose signature appeared on the lease for farmland seized from a Christian priest, on the contract for the orchards taken from a monastery, and on the deed for land stolen from a Shia family allowed us into his modest home.The only decoration in his living room was a broken clock whose hand trembled between 10:43 and 10:44.A stooped man with thick glasses, the 63-year-old Salim was visibly nervous. He explained that he had spent years overseeing the provincial office of the government of Iraq\u2019s Directorate of Agriculture, where he reported to Mr. Hamoud, whom we contacted for the first time a few days later.Mr. Salim acknowledged that it was his signature on the leases. But speaking haltingly, he claimed to have been forcibly conscripted into the bureaucracy of the terrorist state.\u201cThey took our files and started going through them, searching which of the properties belong to Shia, which of them belong to apostates, which of them are people who had left the caliphate,\u201d he said.He described informants phoning in the addresses of Shias and Christians.Sunnis who were too poor to pay the rent upfront were offered a sharecropping agreement with the Islamic State, allowing them to take possession of the stolen land in return for one-third of the future harvest.On busy days, a line snaked around his office building, made up of Sunni farmers, many of them resentful of their treatment at the hands of a Shia-led Iraqi government. In the same compound where we found the stacks of yellow folders, Mr. Salim received men he knew, whose children had played with his. They came to steal the land of other men they all knew \u2014 whose children had also grown up alongside theirs.With the stroke of his pen, farmers lost their ancestors\u2019 cropland, their sons were robbed of their inheritance and the wealth of entire families, built up over generations, was wiped out.\u201cThese are relationships we built over decades, from the time of my father, and my father\u2019s father,\u201d Mr. Salim said, pleading for understanding. \u201cThese were my brothers, but we were forced to do it.\u201dAs 2014 blurred into 2015 and Mr. Hamoud and his colleagues helped keep the machinery of government running, Islamic State soldiers set out to remake every aspect of life in the city \u2014 starting with the role of women.Mr. Hamoud, who is known as \u201cAbu Sara,\u201d or Father of Sara, gave in and bought a niqab for his daughter.As he walked to and from work, Mr. Hamoud began taking side streets to dodge the frequent executions that were being carried out in traffic circles and public squares. In one, a teenage girl accused of adultery was dragged out of a minivan and forced to her knees. Then a stone slab was dropped onto her head. On a bridge, the bodies of people accused of being spies swung from the railing.But on the same thoroughfares, Mr. Hamoud noticed something that filled him with shame: The streets were visibly cleaner than they had been when the Iraqi government was in charge.Omar Bilal Younes, a 42-year-old truck driver whose occupation allowed him to crisscross the caliphate, noticed the same improvement. \u201cGarbage collection was No. 1 under ISIS,\u201d he said, flashing a thumbs-up sign.The street sweepers hadn\u2019t changed. What had was that the militants imposed a discipline that had been lacking, said a half-dozen sanitation employees who worked under ISIS and who were interviewed in three towns after the group was forced out.\u201cThe only thing I could do during the time of government rule is to give a worker a one-day suspension without pay,\u201d said Salim Ali Sultan, who oversaw garbage collection both for the Iraqi government and later for the Islamic State in the northern Iraqi town of Tel Kaif. \u201cUnder ISIS, they could be imprisoned.\u201dResidents also said that their taps were less likely to run dry, the sewers less likely to overflow and potholes fixed more quickly under the militants, even though there were now near-daily airstrikes.Then one day, residents of Mosul saw earthmovers heading toward a neighborhood called the Industrial Area in the eastern half of the city. Laborers were seen paving a new blacktop road that would eventually run for roughly one mile, connecting two areas of the city and reducing congestion.The new highway was called \u201cCaliphate Way.\u201dThe new government did not concern itself only with administrative matters. For morality, as for everything else, there was a bureaucracy.The zeal with which the Islamic State policed the population is reflected in the 87 prison transfer records they abandoned in one of their police stations. Citizens were thrown into jail for a litany of obscure crimes, including eyebrow plucking, inappropriate haircuts, raising pigeons, playing dominoes, playing cards, playing music and smoking the hookah.In early 2016, Mr. Hamoud\u2019s daughter Sara ran out for a quick errand without covering her eyes.She was spotted by an officer from the morality police. Before she could explain, he smashed his fist into her eye.From then on, her father forbade her to leave the house, except to drive to the hospital for the appointments that followed the assault, which left her with vision loss, the family said.With change sweeping the region, residents were forced to make fraught choices, among them: Stay or leave, rebel or accommodate.Mr. Hamoud decided to try to escape. He and his eldest son, 28-year-old Omar, had set aside over $30,000 to buy a new home. The morning of their planned departure, Omar withdrew all but around $1,000 from the bank account.Not even two hours later, a unit of masked fighters banged down the family\u2019s front door. One of them was holding the bank slip Omar had signed.\u201cTry this again and we\u2019ll kill every last one of you,\u201d the militants warned.On the western banks of the Tigris River, in a pulverized building, I found an abandoned briefcase.The documents that spilled out revealed that the briefcase belonged to Yasir Issa Hassan, a young professional whose photo identification shows a balding man with a large, aquiline nose. He was the administrator of the Trade Division inside the Islamic State Ministry of Agriculture.The group\u2019s outsize ambitions and its robust bureaucracy hinged on its ability to generate funds. Bulging with accounting forms, budget projections and receipts, as well as two CD-ROMs containing spreadsheets, the briefcase shed light on the scope of the organization\u2019s revenue machine and offered a blueprint for how it worked.The financial reports tallied over $19 million in transactions involving agriculture alone.The documents describe how it made money at every step in the supply chain: Before a single seed of grain, for example, was sown, the group collected rent for the fields it had confiscated. Then, when the crops were ready to be threshed, it collected a harvest tax.You\u2019ll receive Top Stories notifications after the series ends.It did not stop there.Then the bags of flour were loaded onto trucks, which traversed the caliphate, paying more tolls. It was sold to supermarkets and shops, which were also taxed. So were the consumers who bought the finished product.In a single 24-hour period in 2015, one of the spreadsheets in the briefcase shows, the Islamic State collected $1.9 million from the sale of barley and wheat.The organization appeared intent on making money off every last grain \u2014 even crops that were damaged.On just one day, according to another statement, it took in over $14,000 from wheat described as having been scorched in a bombing, and $2,300 from the sale of spoiled lentils and chickpeas. It also took in over $23,000 from grain that had been scraped off the bottom of a tank, according to one spreadsheet.The Islamic State\u2019s tax arm reached into every facet of life in Mosul. Households in Iraq were taxed 2,000 dinars per month (less than $2) for garbage collection, 10,000 dinars (about $8) for each 10 amperes of electricity, and another 10,000 for municipal water.Businesses wishing to install a landline paid a 15,000-dinar (about $12) installation fee to the group\u2019s telecommunications office, followed by a 5,000-dinar monthly maintenance fee.Municipal offices charged for marriage licenses and birth certificates.CBBA\u00a0The paper was recovered by Times journalists in Tal Abta, a village in northern Iraq, in July 2017 in a building used by ISIS fighters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The paper was recovered by Times journalists in Tal Abta, a village in northern Iraq, in July 2017 in a building used by ISIS fighters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CBACBA\u00a0The paper was recovered by Times journalists in Tal Abta, a village in northern Iraq, in July 2017 in a building used by ISIS fighters.\u00a0\u00a0CBA\u00a0The paper was recovered by Times journalists in Tal Abta, a village in northern Iraq, in July 2017 in a building used by ISIS fighters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ordinarily in Islamic practice, the zakat is a tithe used to help the poor. In the Islamic State\u2019s interpretation, an act of charity became a mandatory payment, and while some of the funds collected were used to help needy families, the Ministry of Zakat and Charities acted more like a version of the Internal Revenue Service.Despite hundreds of airstrikes that left the caliphate pocked with craters, the group\u2019s economy continued to function, fed by streams of revenue that could not be bombed under international norms: the civilians under their rule, their commercial activity and the dirt under their feet.It all added up to astonishing sums, as much as $800 million in annual tax revenue, according to the study.Still, the group\u2019s ambition of running a state meant it also had large bills.On a single day in the summer of 2016, the owner of the briefcase handed over $150,000 to one of the group\u2019s accountants to pay for the transport of wheat from one town to another, according to one financial report.In a two-week period the same year, he paid over $16,000 to the Islamic State trade division in the Dijlah district and $14,000 to the one in Kirkuk. He gave an $8,400 cash advance to the group\u2019s Hawija office, $16,800 to the land department and $8,400 to the Islamic State province straddling the Euphrates River.Even as tanks were rolling in and taking surrounding neighborhoods, the trade division continued to make money, pocketing $70,000 in a single sale.One day in late 2016, a flier decorated with the Iraqi flag floated down onto the Hamoud family\u2019s home.The agricultural department official and his extended family were hunkered down inside the living room, sitting elbow-to-elbow on an L-shaped couch, he recalls. By then, the militants had banned both cellphones and satellite dishes. They were cut off from the world.The flier was one of millions dropped over Mosul warning the population to take cover. The military assault was about to begin.\u201cCould this really be happening?\u201d Mr. Hamoud wondered. Then he used a lighter to incinerate the flier.Since then, the militants have lost all but 3 percent of the territory in Iraq and Syria they once held. But they clung so tightly to their caliphate that block after city block was leveled during the battle to take back cities and towns. Thousands of people have lost their homes. New mass graves are being discovered every month. One of them contains the remains of four of Mr. Hamoud\u2019s cousins.Few have anything good to say about their old rulers \u2014 unless prodded to talk about the services they provided.\u201cWe have to be honest,\u201d Mr. Hamoud said. \u201cIt was much cleaner under ISIS.\u201dThough the militants are gone, reminders of the Islamic State and their particular style of governance remain.In the northern town of Tel Kaif, for example, residents recall how the militants conscripted a committee of electrical engineers to fix an overloaded power grid. They installed new circuit breakers, and for the first time, residents who had been accustomed to at most six hours of electricity a day could now reliably turn on lights.In early 2017, Iraqi soldiers reclaimed the town, and were welcomed as heroes. But then they disconnected the Islamic State circuit breakers \u2014 and the power failures resumed.\u201cIf the government was to go back to the system that ISIS put in place, we would go so far as to kiss their foreheads,\u201d Mr. Younes, the truck driver, said at the time.Within a few months, the government did just that.The irony that it had taken a terrorist group to fix one of the town\u2019s longstanding grievances was not lost on its citizens.\u201cAlthough they were not recognized as a state or a country,\u201d said one shopkeeper, Ahmed Ramzi Salim, \u201cthey acted like one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Suburban Connecticut, the Palestinian Avant-Garde", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFaisal Saleh is proud of his Palestinian heritage; his bohemian side, however, has until recently been hidden.Born in the West Bank city of El Bireh, Mr. Saleh came to America as a high-school senior in 1969, studied at Oberlin College, earned his M.B.A. from the University of Connecticut, and eventually helped establish a small benefits and human-resources firm based in Washington, D.C.\u201cThis is a big event for Palestinians,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to invite people to come and learn about Palestinian art and expression and are creating a space where it can be visible and conspicuous.\u201dMr. Saleh is financing the museum himself, but he said he hopes to eventually attract enough financial backers to relocate the gallery from its suburban, turnpike setting to a major city. The museum will be open on Sundays from 1 to 5 p.m.On display at the opening will be works of 20 artists, mostly from the West Bank and Gaza, who are either still living there or are working as expatriates.The range of media includes paintings, textiles, installation pieces and photography. The unifying, and qualifying, theme of the artwork is that it is either by Palestinian artists or represents Palestinian life.\u201cThis is a dream,\u201d said the artist Manal Deeb, whose mixed-media works \u2014 incorporating photographs, oil paint and Arabic calligraphy \u2014 hang in the gallery. Her work was also exhibited at the United Nations Visitors Center in New York in 2012\u20142013. Born in Ramallah, Ms. Deeb moved to America as a teenager in 1986. Speaking by telephone from her studio in Fairfax, Va., she said the new Palestinian museum will provide her and other Palestinian artists with an outlet where there was none before.\u201cAs Palestinians, we all have the same core search for identity, and this is a way for us to all come together and save that identity,\u201d she said.Mr. Saleh said that the museum\u2019s agenda is neither political or religious, but few of the artists on display have avoided the historic and ongoing conflicts between Palestinians and the State of Israel. The impacts of war on women and children are a theme of Ms. Deeb\u2019s art, as well as that of 47-year-old Rana Bishara, born in 1971 in the Upper Galilee village of Tarshiha where she still lives part time. Her paintings in the museum feature abstracts that explore memories of childhood growing up amid political demonstrations, contrasted with the beauty of the natural world. To this end, much of her work features actual pieces of cactus, a symbol of razed villages where nothing remains but the prickly vegetation.\u201cFor me, cactus means to be patient,\u201d said Ms. Bishara, speaking by telephone during a recent visit to Savannah, Ga., where she earned an M.F.A. at the Savannah College of Art in 2003. \u201cOne of my famous works has pieces of pickled cactus, packed tightly in a jar, which depicts Palestinians who are living in Israel under the pressure of laws that treat us like second-class citizens or worse,\u201d Ms. Bishara said.Yet for every statement of political resistance, there are images that simply evoke the human experience. In a vaguely Post-Impressionist interior by Ayed Arafah, a painter from the Dheisheh refugee camp, near Bethlehem, a cat looks up mischievously from an unraveled roll of toilet paper. A series of boldly colored portraits by the gallery\u2019s youngest painter, 18-year-old Malak Mattar, recall the stylistic primitivism of high Modernism. Ms. Mattar, a resident of Gaza, started painting therapeutically when she was 13, amid shelling during the 51-day military conflict with Israel in 2014. So despite the playfulness of her art, Ms. Mattar\u2019s life story draws gallery visitors back to the turmoil she and other Palestinian artists can face, which in turn informs their art.\u201cVery often, when artists are under that kind of war pressure, they produce some of their best work,\u201d said James Harithas, director of the Station Museum of Contemporary Art in Houston. In 2003, the Texas gallery hosted \u201cMade in Palestine,\u201d probably the first museum exhibition of Palestinian art in the United States. The exhibit then toured nationally, and \u201cwas the most popular show we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Mr. Harithas said.\u201cIt was a high period for Palestinian artists, and one of the very important things to them was that their own people understood what they were doing,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, there are Palestinian artists who are now concerned with explaining the Palestinian issue to the outside world and a Western audience, which is why this new museum is so important.\u201dBoth Ms. Halaby and Mr. Saleh are aware of how quickly that message can become controversial. When the \u201cMade in Palestine\u201d exhibit traveled to New York in 2005, two state legislators and at least one assemblyman raised objections to the show, suggesting that it endorsed terrorism.So far, the museum has faced no blowback from the local community, Mr. Saleh said. In fact, he enjoys good relations with one of his nonprofit neighbors, the Jewish Federation of Greater New Haven. When the organization\u2019s Jewish Community Center needed a temporary home last year after a fire, Mr. Saleh rented the Center space in his Woodbridge building, across the hall from the new museum.In an email, the organization expressed appreciation for Mr. Saleh\u2019s support of the community center, and the Jewish Federation\u2019s chief executive, Judy Alperin, affirmed that she hoped there would be opportunities for bridge-building and dialogue once the museum opens.For her part, Ms. Halaby said her art is not as much informed by any specific political agenda as it is by her fondness for Cubism, medieval Islamic art and Soviet Constructivism. Yet at the same time, she does not back away from her identity.\u201cI\u2019m never going to let you forget that I\u2019m Palestinian,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you look at my art, I am saying I\u2019m Palestinian, like it or hate it, here\u2019s what I do, and I do it very well,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blacks Still Face a Red Line on Housing", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFor generations of white American families, homeownership has been a fundamental means of accumulating wealth. Their homes have grown in value over time, providing security in retirement and serving as an asset against which they can borrow for education or other purposes.These losses reflect the persistence of financial racism in America and the fact that black people who were eligible for affordable credit were victimized by predatory loans that paid off handsomely for brokers and lenders but led borrowers to foreclosure.A LEGACY OF ECONOMIC RACISMAs enslaved people, she writes, black Americans were initially unable to take advantage of the Homestead Act, under which the government encouraged westward migration by giving away tens of millions of acres \u2014 to settler citizens. Former slaves gained full citizenship with the 14th Amendment and became eligible for land grants, but that right became irrelevant with the collapse of Reconstruction, the rise of Jim Crow and the limitations on the rights of black people that the Southern states placed in their constitutions.A HOME MORTGAGE \u2018BLACK TAX\u2019The authors determined that the loan default rate would have been considerably lower for black customers had they been treated in the same fashion as whites. Most tellingly of all, the study took into account factors like credit scores, income and down payments that would have been known to brokers and lenders when these abusive loans were made.Under this system, a na\u00efve buyer agrees to pour money into an often dilapidated house while also making high interest payments, with the aim of eventually owning the home. But the buyer can be evicted, losing all of his or her equity, if even a single payment is missed. In the past, this system has both accelerated urban decline and looted the financial resources of ambitious but vulnerable families.In a sensible world, the federal government would be suppressing predatory lending while beefing up programs that provide affordable home mortgages and refinancing arrangements. Instead, the Trump administration and Congress are gearing up to gut federal fair lending protections and make it easier to hide emerging patterns of predatory financing.In the absence of federal leadership, mayors and governors will be left holding the bag when default and declining ownership levels hollow out more communities. So it is up to them to find and root out abuses in real estate lending and to close the racial gap in homeownership. They can expect no help from the Trump administration.Advertisement"}

Harrington, a former federal corruption prosecutor in New York who is now in private practice.But things may feel a bit different in this week\u2019s retrial of Sheldon Silver, the former State Assembly speaker, whose conviction on federal corruption charges was thrown out last year.Mr. Silver was known as one of New York\u2019s \u201cthree men in a room\u201d \u2014 along with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Dean G. Skelos, the State Senate majority leader \u2014 who controlled decision making in Albany.In 2015, Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, and Mr. Skelos, a Republican from Long Island, were tried and convicted of federal corruption charges and given long prison sentences.Except that they never served them.The government said it would retry the two men, and on Monday, the first of those retrials \u2014 Mr. Silver\u2019s \u2014 starts in Federal District Court in Manhattan before Judge Valerie E. Caproni, who presided over the first trial.Although the jury instructions will have to be revised in light of the Supreme Court decision, the presentation of evidence and testimony is largely expected to track that of the first trial. In that case, prosecutors showed that Mr. Silver obtained nearly $4 million in illicit payments in return for taking a series of official actions that benefited others.Prosecutors would still seem to hold an advantage: Judge Caproni, in an order granting Mr. Silver\u2019s request to remain free on bail while he appealed his conviction, observed that \u201cSilver\u2019s case is factually almost nothing like McDonnell.\u201d\u201cThere is no question that Silver took a number of official acts \u2014 most obviously passing legislation and approving state grants and tax-exempt financing \u2014 as part of a quid pro quo\u201d in the charged schemes, the judge wrote.More than two years after the first Silver and Skelos trials, Albany\u2019s power structure remains fundamentally unchanged. Most if not all major policy decisions, including the direction of a $168 billion budget, are still decided by a clutch of three men in a room: the governor; the leader of the Senate, John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican; and the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat.Those negotiations continue to take place behind closed doors, with leaders typically offering brief, largely inconsequential updates to members of the media and announcing details only when final deals are settled upon. That arrangement has been roundly criticized by government watchdogs, who decry a lack of transparency and open debate, as has the Legislature\u2019s common practice of passing bills in wee hours of the night when few members of the public are watching or aware of the proceedings.Mr. Silver\u2019s and Mr. Skelos\u2019s retrials will be watched closely by watchdog groups, which have long criticized Albany\u2019s culture of secrecy and influence peddling.\u201cI have no doubt that Silver will put forward the same defense, which is that it\u2019s business as usual in Albany and therefore not illegal,\u201d said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that the first jury rejected this argument, and we expect that the second jury will do the same.\u201dOne phenomenon of retrials is that the personnel often change. The four prosecutors involved in the first Silver trial have left the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan \u2014 Carrie H. Cohen entered private practice; Andrew D. Goldstein joined the office of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election; Howard S. Master became a senior enforcement counsel for the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman; James M. McDonald now heads enforcement for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u2014 and a new team has taken over.Mr. Silver also has a new defense team, led by Michael S. Feldberg. Neither Mr. Feldberg nor the prosecutor\u2019s office would comment on the retrial.In return, Dr. Taub sent cancer patients with legal claims to a law firm, Weitz & Luxenberg, that kicked back a portion of its fees to Mr. Silver.Dr. Taub, the star prosecution witness in the first trial, could begin testifying as early as Monday, a prosecutor told Judge Caproni last week.Prosecutors have said that in another scheme, Mr. Silver arranged to have two real estate developers, Glenwood Management and the Witkoff Group, send tax business to a law firm, Goldberg & Iryami, that also sent Mr. Silver part of its fees. Mr. Silver supported real estate legislation that benefited the developers, the government said.In overturning the McDonnell verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that official action must involve formal and concrete government actions or decisions, like filing a lawsuit or holding a hearing, not mere political courtesies.In Mr. Silver\u2019s case, two former federal prosecutors differed on how much of an advantage each side may have.\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that he committed these crimes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were quid pro quos and official acts within the narrow definition of McDonnell.\u201dBut Randall W. Jackson, now a defense lawyer, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear cut.\u201d\u201cIt will be very interesting to see how a new jury approaches a case like this after receiving materially different jury instructions,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.\u201cThe Silver case is right at the fault line for some of the difficult questions that have been raised by the courts about what exactly constitutes public corruption,\u201d he added.Generally, in retrying cases, the defense may have certain advantages because the government has already shown its hand, other legal experts said.\u201cThe defense has a blueprint of what the government\u2019s case is, and as a result, they are able to adjust their cross-examination,\u201d said Benjamin Brafman, a veteran defense lawyer who has known Mr. Silver for years and is not involved in his defense.\u201cThe prosecution, on the other hand, really can\u2019t change the nature of the testimony from the first trial to the second trial,\u201d Mr. Brafman added. \u201cIf they do, the witnesses will obviously be confronted with their earlier testimony and vigorously cross-examined about the difference.\u201dThe defense may also benefit from the passage of time, said Rebecca Roiphe, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan who teaches at New York Law School.\u201cDefense attorneys always like delay, because faded memories work in their favor,\u201d she said.Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany.Advertisement"}

His son-in-law and other associates are also under investigation.This is your president, ladies and gentlemen.

He said Attorney General Jeff Sessions made \u201ca very terrible mistake\u201d by recusing himself from overseeing the investigation \u2014 the implication being that a more loyal attorney general would have obstructed justice and blocked the investigation.

Mr. Trump instead made it about him, with his narcissistic and self-pitying claim that the investigation represented an attack on the country \u201cin a true sense.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cinnamon Toast, Fresh Cut Grass and Other Smells From Your Childhood", "Date": "2018-04-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMany readers were transported back to their own childhoods \u2014 to muffins baking in the oven, to their own parents\u2019 cigarette smoke, to freshly cut grass, to the aroma of the big city. Here are some of the memories they shared, edited lightly for clarity and length.As goofy as this sounds, the smell of gasoline immediately transports me back to the farm in Wisconsin where I grew up. My dad used to fill the tractor with gasoline and on occasion, he would let me sit on his lap while he drove it, plowing the fields in spring. I loved riding on that tractor, smelling the fresh, moist ground being plowed up while the soft, cool wind blew in my face. The smell of gasoline triggers such happy, secure and warm memories when I was a small child. How I still miss that farm.Many years into adulthood, I visited the school where I attended first grade. The smell of cinnamon toast coming from the cafeteria hit me and I was 6 years old again.For my husband, who is Italian, it\u2019s the smell of a new book. Whenever he walks into a bookstore, before he picks out the book he will eventually buy, he will leaf through several, and fan its pages through his thumb as he inhales the slight breeze this action creates. I watch him sometimes as he closes his eyes and smiles. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, half alarmed, the first time I saw him do this. \u201cRemembering my childhood in Italy.\u201dWhen I was 18 I traveled by myself to London. There was a big-city smell that stuck in my mind; not sure exactly what it was, but probably diesel fumes mixing with the rain. It doesn\u2019t sound romantic, but once in a while I pick up that smell and it immediately reminds me of that fun trip.In the spring of 1967 my brother came to visit me on the Lower East Side. He was home from his time in the First Marine Battalion in Vietnam. I planned to surprise him with a visit to an Italian grocery and deli that smelled exactly like the store we went to as children in the coal mining town we grew up in. There was the smell of herbs and spices, dried fish, aged cheeses, olive oil, and there were cookies and breads, tamarind syrup for we we called Italian soda, all the smells of our first-generation Tuscan and Piemontese family. As we walked down the stairs to the shop I walked ahead of him and opened the door. All the smells of childhood flooded the air around us. As I turned toward him to celebrate, to my great surprise he stopped, then sat down on the stairs and wept. All I could say was, \u201cI am so sorry, so sorry.\u201d We sat there and cried together.Grew up in Southern California\u2019s San Fernando Valley (\u201cthe\u201d Valley) but now live just a mountain range over, in the San Gabriel Valley. The smell of mowed grass, orange blossoms, the smell you smell before it rains (more and more rare, it seems). The smell of coffee brewing (which is rare now, given that no one uses a percolator anymore). All of those take me home.I was in middle school and our English teacher had us close our eyes and she passed down the row holding something under each of our noses. Then we were to write the first thing that popped in our minds. I smelled something I didn\u2019t recognize but the image of a specific chair in my grandmother\u2019s house immediately came to mind, so I wrote about a brown rocking chair. When we finished, she revealed it had been tobacco leaves in a pouch \u2014 the kind for a pipe. I was totally confused. Later that evening I shared this with my parents. \u201cOh yeah, you used to sit in Papa\u2019s lap while he packed his pipe. That was his chair.\u201d Papa died when I was 3 \u2014 but that smell was stuck in my brain with that chair.My favorite smells of childhood were the corner candy store (newsprint and sugar), the ice cream store and bakery. And I still remember the smell of that varnish or wax used for the wood floors in the school gym; for some reason that always comforted me, though it was likely toxic.For me, that would be the yeasty/malty smell from the neighborhood brewery (which only brewed nonalcoholic pilsner and a malt beverage, as alcoholic beer was illegal in Iceland from the 1920s to 1989) and the incredibly strong and fishy smell from the factories making fishmeal (mostly from capelin and herring) when the wind was blowing from the right (or wrong) direction. To this day, I don\u2019t really know what fishmeal is used for, probably not for human consumption. The smell of money, they used to call it.When I smell bleach, I am immediately transported back to the 1950s. If I close my eyes, I am in my childhood home\u2019s basement laundry room. It always makes me smile.I was born in Seattle and our family later moved to the dry, inland part of the state. My grandparents continued to live in Seattle and we would visit them at holiday times, which were some of our happiest. For days after we got back from a visit to them, I would inhale the slightly mildewy Seattle scent that lingered on suitcases and clothes to prolong that happy feeling.The smell of plastic will always remind me of opening a new Mattel toy! I\u2019m immediately transported to my room in the home in which I grew up, happily tearing into a new Liddle Kiddle or Barbie!My grandparents had homemade wine stored in their basement and dried herbs from their garden, including braided garlic they bought in bulk. I would play in that basement in the summertime while my grandfather read his newspaper or worked on some project because it was the coolest part of the house. Occasionally he and I would eat lunch in the basement and I would watch him uncork a wine bottle from his stash. Sometimes, when cooking and I open a bottle of good red wine, I remember the basement smell, as it must be a combination of wine and herbs.During one part of my career as a journalist, I had to pay regular visits to Japan\u2019s Finance Ministry. Passing through the non-air-conditioned entrance in the summer stopped me in my tracks: The smell of the old, hot wood there was identical to the smell of my grandmother\u2019s front room.Walking to coffee with a friend, we strolled by a bowling alley with the door open to the sidewalk. As the mixed smells of cigarettes, spilled beer and, yes, probably some vomit emanated from the thick shag carpeting, she took a deep, luxurious breath and let out a long satisfied \u201cAhhhhhh ....\u201d Amazed, I asked for an explanation. She said that she grew up on a farm and the whole family would go into town on Saturday night for bowling and pizza, and this smelled like those happy childhood memories.My mother, Chanel No. 5. Walking into her bedroom as she readied to go out for the evening. I don\u2019t wear perfume but I gravitate toward women who do, remembering those evenings of preparation. At those moments, she is with me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Lashed Out at OPEC: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Wells Fargo takes another hit.\u2022 What AT&T\u2019s Randall Stephenson said on the stand.\u2022 What Takeda has to weigh in its pursuit of Shire.But why has President Trump made the international oil cartel his latest b\u00eate noire? One potential reason: It makes life more difficult for many Americans, weighing on the benefits of the Republican tax cuts.The context: OPEC and Russia agreed two years ago to cut \u2014 and maintain \u2014 oil production caps to bring prices back up in the wake of U.S. shale boom. So far, that strategy has worked:With oil above $73 now, even after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, fuel prices are at reaching two-year highs as the U.S. gets into the summer driving season. More importantly, Americans are preparing to spend more on fuel, eating into whatever savings they are expected to receive on average from the tax cuts.Americans are expected to spend an average of $400 per household more on fuel this year than in 2016, as the rebound in crude prices is reflected in the cost of petrol at the pump. By contrast, middle-income US households will on average gain $930 each from the tax cut bill passed at the end of last year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.And Michael Lynch of Strategic Energy & Economic Research had this to say to Bloomberg:\u201cNinety-eight percent of what politicians say about oil should just be disregarded immediately and this falls in there.\u201dIn February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential.The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology.The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said.Representatives for the Justice Department, AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A. declined to comment.\u2014 Cecilia KangShares of General Electric jumped nearly 4 percent Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and reaffirmed its guidance for the year.Though G.E. reported a first-quarter loss on Friday, there were also signs that the struggling industrial giant is beginning to stabilize its business.G.E.\u2019s big power-generator division continues to drag down the company\u2019s overall performance, and it is still burdened with financial liabilities that linger from the conglomerate\u2019s pared-back finance arm, GE Capital.But G.E.\u2019s other major industrial divisions, led by aviation and health care, delivered solid results in the quarter. That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines.Especially heartening for investors, G.E. reaffirmed its profit outlook for the year, predicting earnings per share of $1 to $1.07, though likely at the lower end of that range. Analysts had been skeptical that G.E. could do that well. The average analysts\u2019 forecast for the year was 95 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.To recap: Wells Fargo has already paid $185 million over its fake accounts scandal and set aside $4.25 billion for liabilities tied to other infractions. And the Fed has prevented the bank from expanding its balance sheet.Yes, the upcoming $1 billion fine is the most stringent bank penalty imposed by the Trump administration to date. (The C.F.P.B., under pressure from Mick Mulvaney to go easier on financial firms, is involved here.)But Mr. Stewart writes, \u201cAt this point it\u2019s hard to imagine what more Wells Fargo can do (or how much more it can spend) to make amends.\u201dThat\u2019s the contention of the reporter Jonathan Greenberg, who, as a Forbes reporter in 1984, spoke with \u201cJohn Barron\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s net worth. Mr. Barron \u2014 a now well-known alter ego of the real estate executive \u2014 contended that Mr. Trump had bought out most of his father\u2019s stake in their business.Over time I have learned that he should not have been on the first three Forbes 400 lists at all. In our first-ever list, in 1982, we included him at $100 million, but Trump was actually worth roughly $5 million \u2014 a paltry sum by the standards of his super-monied peers \u2014 as a spate of government reports and books showed only much later.Mr. Greenberg writes that the White House and the Trump Organization declined to comment.The Justice Department, which wants to block the deal, argued that AT&T is different because it\u2019s also a broadband internet provider, and that relations with Silicon Valley are chummier than Mr. Stephenson asserts.A big takeover would give Takeda more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint. But it would also be the company\u2019s biggest takeover by far, and perhaps too expensive.The Japanese drug maker said it intended to maintain its credit rating, which could be difficult if it bids too high \u2014 or is pressured to do so by yet another suitor.With its $16 trillion economy and reputation for tough negotiating, the E.U. could have been the immovable object in President Trump\u2019s trade fight. But that is looking less likely, Peter Eavis writes.Among the lessons if the E.U. concedes: The U.S.\u2019s large trade deficits can give it leverage.The sometimes controversial data consultant cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the C.I.A. Now it\u2019s hoping that its latest product will attract more commercial clients.The company needs to figure out how to be rewarded on Wall Street without creeping out Main Street. It might not be possible. For all of Palantir\u2019s professed concern for individuals\u2019 privacy, the single most important safeguard against abuse is the one it\u2019s trying desperately to reduce through automation: human judgment.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, told Michael that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. \u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dThe tech flyaroundThe only potential obstacle: Arturo Di Modica, the artist who made the bull, doesn\u2019t want it moved.An earlier version of this article, relying on information in a Bloomberg report, misstated the amount of Sumner Redstone\u2019s compensation that a court ruled CBS shareholders could challenge. It is less than $4 million, not more than $13 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chance for Dropouts, Young and Old, to Go Back to School", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANDERSON, Ind. \u2014 About two dozen students in Elysse Hamlin\u2019s English 2 class are struggling here on this cold winter morning \u2014 about 40 minutes outside of Indianapolis \u2014 to learn simple and compound sentences. It\u2019s typically what is taught around seventh grade, but Marte\u2019z Alexander is 20, Emily Spencer is 22 and Bernice Larson is 68. In fact, everyone in the class is over 18 years old.These classmates have little in common except one thing: None of them completed high school. And the work sheets they were puzzling over don\u2019t just represent dry grammar, but a second chance \u2014 at a high school diploma, a better-paying job, maybe college. A second chance to prove to their children and parents, and most important, to themselves, that they can shed the label high school dropout.I dropped out of high school and got pregnant at 17. I went to like seven G.E.D. courses, but it was so hard. I have 25 grandkids \u2014 they\u2019re my pride and joy, and my grandson needed help with algebra, and I couldn\u2019t do it. That made me feel real bad.  When I first came here in 2015, I couldn\u2019t do any of it. I was frustrated; I would just get mad at the teachers. I stayed away once about a week or so and said I\u2019m not coming back, stop calling me. But I had to. The teachers and the coach would call me, and the coach would say, \u201cMs. Karen, don\u2019t give up.\u201d I\u2019m a C.N.A. (certified nursing assistant), but I want to be a counselor for abused women. I wanted to be educated. Three of my children graduated from high school, three didn\u2019t. One is going to school here with me.Karen Johnson, 59, who graduated on Feb. 16 from the Excel Center at University Heights in Indianapolis.Five more, four in Missouri and one in Muncie, Ind., are scheduled to open by 2019.Each school provides life coaches, who serve as a combination guidance counselor and social worker, drop-in child care, transportation assistance and other benefits. Students work toward a regular diploma and dual college credit or industry-recognized vocational certification in any number of fields, such as pharmacy technician, information technology or welding. And any Excel Center in any state is required to incorporate all those elements.Rigorous research has shown that that kind of wraparound support \u201chas the potential to have the most impact,\u201d said Elizabeth Zachry Rutschow, a senior research associate with MDRC, a nonprofit research organization. \u201cThis comprehensive support model is very unusual. Adult education programs are often really strapped for funding.\u201dAlthough most of the students dropped out in high school, the average student has a fourth-grade reading and math level.It was a struggle. In 2015, his Goodwill opened an Excel school in Memphis, with Goodwill funding the bulk of the program and private philanthropists helping out. Goodwill lobbied hard for a change in state law, which was approved late last year; now adult learners receive the same financing as traditional students, and the state will pick up most of the funding for the Memphis center.About 400 students have graduated or are expected to graduate from the Memphis school by June, and Mr. Martini hopes to open six to 12 centers in Memphis over the next six yearsOne reason politicians like these schools is that employers like them.Luke Kenley, a recently retired Indiana state senator, a Republican and appropriations chairman, was a strong supporter of the Excel Center.\u201cThis is a looming problem in Indiana like everywhere else in the country. Where do you get people educated for today\u2019s work force?\u201d he said. When Goodwill, which already ran a free traditional charter school in Indianapolis, came forward seeking funding for the Excel Center, \u201cI knew they were an exceptionally capable nonprofit in terms of social issues, and the problem has become so large \u2014 getting people prepared for good jobs \u2014 that government funding appeared to be necessary.\u201d I was bouncing around through foster homes; I was 17 when I dropped out. I made it through to senior year and didn\u2019t have any of my credits because I was going from school to school because of foster care. I called Goodwill for the G.E.D. program, but they had done away with it, and they invited me to Excel. I was one of the first students who walked through the door. It wasn\u2019t easy \u2014 I worked all day, every day. A couple of times I wanted to give up. (Some staff members) took me on college tours. They got me amped up, and I took the ACT. I\u2019ve been working full time at night as a maintenance mechanic for about seven years, and I also went to Marian (University in Indianapolis) and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. I\u2019ll be going back to get an engineering degree. I want to move from fixing machines to more the engineering and design.Jamieson Brewer, 26, was one of the Excel Center\u2019s first graduates, in 2011.The first Excel Center opened in 2010 in Indianapolis, and it was something of a failure. About 300 students attended the school, but the curriculum was online, and it just didn\u2019t work. Only four students graduated.The staff rethought its approach and moved from online to almost entirely in-class instruction. Each school offers five eight-week terms annually, and students can enter at the beginning of any term. They are tested before entering to determine their level of English and math. Students who fail a subject can retake it in the next eight-week term \u2014 and the next.The core classes are also offered morning, evening and sometimes at night, so a student can work and attend classes.The teachers, many of whom taught in public schools before joining the Excel Centers, and the life coaches know all too well the obstacles facing their students\u2019 quest for a diploma. Children or parents get sick or in trouble, the car breaks down or the bus doesn\u2019t come, the family\u2019s breadwinner loses a job or goes to prison. The teachers and life coaches cajole, praise, encourage, and if a student who has been on track suddenly disappears, they call, text, reach out on Facebook and even show up at their door. Teachers have taken homework to hospitals when a student gets sick.But there\u2019s a fine line between helping the students, many of whom are struggling with multiple financial and family problems, and doing too much.\u201cWe\u2019re loving them, but also challenging and pushing them,\u201d said Dionne Leard, the director at the Excel Center University Heights in Indianapolis.While the average student graduates within 18 months, some, like Karen Johnson, a recent graduate, take much longer. Arriving barely able to read, she took English 2 six times.\u201cAs long as they are making progress they can stay,\u201d Ms. Leard said.Tera Price, 21, fusses over her month-old daughter in a car seat next to her \u2014 the infant is too young to go to the child care center. Nicole Gosha, 42, and her son Rickey, 29, sit next to each other joking with some other students.\u201cI\u2019m just glad I came,\u201d Ms. Gosha said, \u201cand I gave a speech, which isn\u2019t something I normally do.\u201dHer son leaned in. \u201cI gave the best speech. I did research on bed bugs.\u201d The graduation rate at Excel Centers in Indiana is about 20 to 25 percent; while that appears low, the model of eight-week terms makes traditional measurements difficult.At the start of a term, most of the students are full of hope and enthusiasm, proud they showed up the first day.But it\u2019s hard to know who will end up with a diploma and who won\u2019t. Who will power straight through, who will disappear forever and who will reappear after months away. Two weeks after the first class, Tera Price stop showing up. A month in, the Goshas, mother and son, had near-perfect attendance.I had to start paying bills for our household. My mom has a lot of health issues, and my dad has a lot of problems with his back, so they weren\u2019t making the money to make ends meet to pay the bills.  I dropped out in eighth grade; my sister dropped out in high school. We were skidding. We drove around and picked up wooden pallets and cashed them in for the money I always felt bad about dropping out. I got pregnant with my daughter when I was 19, and one of the things mainly pushing me toward getting my diploma was my daughter kept asking me why I didn\u2019t graduate. She was having a problem.

{"Headline": "As Trump Leads a \u2018War\u2019 on California, Who Will Lead California?", "Date": "2018-04-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 At a moment of extraordinary tension between California and President Trump, this state is moving to elect a governor in a changing of the guard that will test its outsize power as a national leader for Democrats in its fight against the White House.Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat retiring after nearly half a century in public life, has been at the forefront of the fight, particularly on climate change. No one in the crowded field of candidates seeking to replace him enjoys Mr. Brown\u2019s level of national prominence; it remains to be seen if any has the political skills Mr. Brown has honed over his long career to take on this kind of complicated battle.The contest is taking place against a backdrop of escalating hostilities, signaling what will most likely be years of legal and political fights between the Trump White House and California. On Monday alone, the administration moved to roll back California\u2019s landmark auto emissions reduction program and challenged a state law intended to curb the sale of federal lands.As has become increasingly clear in recent days, Mr. Brown\u2019s successor will face a thicket of high-stakes challenges. The federal government is suing to overturn so-called sanctuary laws in California intended to hamper federal immigration officials. It has moved to permit offshore drilling in states including California.For his part, Mr. Brown said Washington was \u201cbasically going to war against the state of California.\u201dPolls suggest that the two leading contenders to succeed Mr. Brown are Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and a former mayor of San Francisco, and Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the former two-term mayor of Los Angeles and Assembly speaker, both Democrats. The two are known as effective public speakers with extensive political experience that could prove important in navigating the fight against Washington.Of the two, Mr. Newsom has assumed the more aggressive stance in taking on the Trump administration, drawing strong support from liberal Democrats in the process. He has also called for the impeachment of Mr. Trump. A centerpiece of his campaign is a pledge to adopt a government-run, single-payer health care system, a direct challenge to the free-market vision embraced by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans.\u201cThis is more than a political campaign,\u201d Mr. Newsom told cheering delegates at the state Democratic convention here this year. \u201cIt\u2019s about Democrats acting like Democrats in a battle for America\u2019s soul against a president without one.\u201d\u201cSome of the defeatist Democrats are saying we just want to defend against the status quo,\u201d he told another audience that day. \u201cHow can you just defend against the status quo? We need to do more than just push back against their agenda to wreak more havoc.\u201dMr. Villaraigosa has struck a more restrained note, saying it was too early to talk about impeachment and dismissing Mr. Newsom\u2019s promise to have California go it alone with its own health care system as a \u201cpie in the sky\u201d promise he was making to ride anti-Trump sentiment. In tone, Mr. Villaraigosa is closer to Mr. Brown in positioning himself against the president.\u201cGavin likes to talk about the resistance \u2014 I don\u2019t use that word,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said over green tea during a break from campaigning in downtown Los Angeles. \u201cI tell people the best way to resist is not to text and tweet, scream and yell at Donald Trump. The best way to resist is for us to chart a different path here in this state.\u201d\u201cWe are going to push back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most of our attention, most of our efforts need to be focused on improving the human condition here.\u201dRobert Shrum, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, said the divisions on health care and impeachment reflected discussions Democrats were having nationally as they debated the best way to defeat Mr. Trump. Mr. Villaraigosa\u2019s stance reflects the calculation that while California is overwhelmingly Democratic in its voting habits, many voters are independent by registration, and thus might be less receptive to an overly confrontational position against Mr. Trump.\u201cNewsom is endorsing all of those things on the Democratic wish list,\u201d Mr. Shrum said. \u201cVillaraigosa is saying, \u2018I like those things, but we actually can\u2019t do them.\u2019\u201cOne position speaks to the anger in the base,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other speaks to what I think Democratic leadership in Congress prefers.\u201dUnder California\u2019s election system, 27 candidates will appear on a primary ballot on June 5, regardless of party. A runoff in November will be held between the top two finishers.And Delaine Eastin, a Democrat and the former state superintendent of public education, has drawn vocal support from the left with her own call for single-payer health care and the impeachment of Mr. Trump.If the November election ends up being between Mr. Villaraigosa and Mr. Newsom, it will be a classic north-versus-south contest. Candidates from Northern California tend to win those, because of heavier turnout in the Bay Area; Mr. Newsom enjoys a big advantage in fund-raising and leads in most statewide polls.But Mr. Villaraigosa would be the first Latino governor elected in modern times. He is running when the ever-growing Latino community accounts for nearly 40 percent of the population and when California is battling with the administration over restrictive immigration policies.Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, and his pledge to continue doing so, mean that health care will most likely be another challenge for the next governor, whether or not California carries out single-payer.\u201cIf our health care system is thrown into absolute chaos because of what happens in Washington, the voters in California are going to expect the Democrats who control California to deal with it,\u201d said Garry South, a longtime Democratic consultant who advises the nurses\u2019 union.If Mr. Newsom won and made good on that campaign promise, he would open a up a whole new area of contention with Mr. Trump. Single-payer health care is likely to require waivers from the Trump administration in order to apply Medicare payments to financing a potentially $400 billion program, along with substantial tax increases.Mr. Villaraigosa, 65, said he supported the concept of single-payer health care, but dismissed Mr. Newsom\u2019s promise as unrealistic.\u201cHe\u2019s arguing with bold leadership we\u2019re going to do it \u2014 even though he knows you need Trump\u2019s waivers to do it,\u201d Mr. Villaraigosa said. \u201cThey are not going to give us the waivers for that. Think about this: You ready to double your taxes? Nobody is going to do that. Everyone is for it until they realize \u2014 whoa. The cost. \u201dMr. Chiang said he, too, supported a state health care system. \u201cI just think Gavin Newsom should be forthcoming on how they are going to pay for it,\u201d he said.Mr. Newsom dismissed his critics as \u201cdefeatist Democrats.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a jaw-dropping thing: to say you support something but it can\u2019t be done,\u201d Mr. Newsom said in an interview a few blocks from his office in Sacramento. \u201cWho the hell is interested in \u2018it can\u2019t be done\u2019? We wouldn\u2019t have marriage equality if I had listened to \u2018it can\u2019t be done.\u2019\u201dAsked what his plan was to pay for it, Mr. Newsom responded: \u201cThe one that works is the one I support. I\u2019m not an ideologue.\u201dStill, the biggest question may well be whether anyone will be able to replace Mr. Brown as California\u2019s counterpoint to Mr. Trump \u2014 and whether the state\u2019s stature as a national leader in this fight will diminish when Mr. Brown retires to his ranch next January.\u201cCalifornia is usually the leading edge,\u201d said Ms. Eastin, one of the Democrats seeking to replace him. \u201cIt\u2019s the sixth-largest economy in the world. I think California will get attention.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jean McFaddin, Who Made the Macy\u2019s Parade What It Is, Dies at 75", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJean McFaddin, who as Macy\u2019s events planner for 24 years created magical Thanksgiving Day parades in Manhattan, a children\u2019s in-store Santaland at Christmastime, exquisite flower shows every spring and spectacular fireworks on the Fourth of July, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 75.Susan Falk, Ms. McFaddin\u2019s spouse, said the cause was cancer.Friends and former associates sometimes said that Ms. McFaddin was able to see into the hearts of little children, like Edmund Gwenn and Maureen O\u2019Hara in the classic 1947 movie \u201cMiracle on 34th Street,\u201d a holiday favorite about the childlike faith aroused by a department-store Santa Claus who claims to be the real thing.Indeed, Ms. McFaddin, Macy\u2019s senior vice president for special productions from 1977 to 2001, entrusted much of her livelihood to the feelings of children. She read their storybooks and letters, watched their television programs and listened to their tales, including those of her own six nieces and nephews, to learn what enchantments and fantasies excited their imaginations.These were essential details for one charged with creating iconic giant balloon characters and assembling a Thanksgiving Day lineup of stars, floats, bands, clowns and blizzards of confetti to stir the wonder of millions of children watching on television and lining the parade route from the Museum of Natural History, down Central Park West and Broadway, to Macy\u2019s flagship store at Herald Square.Steve Krauss, who worked with Ms. McFaddin for years, recalled in an interview: \u201cNo one was more important to Jean than the child \u2014 or the child in all of us \u2014 looking up in awe, whether at a parade balloon, a jolly man in a red suit, a burst of color over the New York skyline or a beautiful gazebo filled with exotic flowers in Herald Square. She loved making it magical for everyone, and she was truly one of the world\u2019s greatest at it.\u201dMacy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, which dates to 1924 and is often called \u201cthe longest-running show on Broadway,\u201d became a celebrated national event under Ms. McFaddin, telecast by NBC to 60 million viewers and attracting tourists from across the country and around the world.The stars were a changing cast of helium-filled balloons that Ms. McFaddin developed with Manfred Bass, Macy\u2019s chief balloon and float designer. Over the years they included Kermit the Frog, Snoopy, Spider-Man, Betty Boop and later Cassie the Dragoness, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Tom Turkey and Blue, the star of Nickelodeon\u2019s \u201cBlue\u2019s Clues.\u201dThe biggest of the marvelous monsters were held down and guided by ropes and strong men trained in what Ms. McFaddin called \u201cballoonology.\u201d Still, many of the characters were obstreperous.\u201cWhen you\u2019re 60 feet tall and 30 feet wide, you go where you like, or try to, despite the 50 people hanging on to your 35 guidelines,\u201d The New York Times reported her saying in 1995.Ms. McFaddin oversaw everything: financing, sponsors and broadcast rights; decisions on who, what and how many would join the parade (some years she auditioned 300 bands); construction of balloons and floats in a warehouse in Hoboken, N.J.; the transporting of everything before dawn into Manhattan; liaison with police, fire and safety units; promotion and publicity; and on and on. It took months.\u201cThe world was Jean\u2019s stage,\u201d said William Schermerhorn, Macy\u2019s creative director for special events, who worked with her for 17 years. \u201cComing from a background in street theater, she could transform a parking lot, a department-store marquee, a park lawn or 34th Street into a wondrous showcase. Above all, I remember the heart, joy and scale she brought to Macy\u2019s events. She shaped the events into what they are today.\u201dWith the wisdom of experience, she urged parents to dress children in layers of bright clothing and to pin name tags (with phone numbers) on them, just in case.\u201cBring garbage bags,\u201d she advised. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to carry. You can sit on them or use them as windbreakers and then use them to collect any trash you left on the street after the parade. They are the ultimate in Thanksgiving Day wear.\u201dBy 6 a.m. every Thanksgiving Day, the balloons were inflated, the floats were lined up and 3,000 volunteer cheerleaders were ready. At 9 a.m., Ms. McFaddin, usually dressed in Macy\u2019s colors \u2014 a red coat, black slacks and a black cowboy hat \u2014 made her way to 77th Street and Central Park West, cut a red ribbon and stepped off, leading the parade on its proud two-and-a-half-mile march to Herald Square.Al Roker, who covered the parade for NBC for years, recalled Ms. McFaddin as an outsize personality with a deep Texas drawl.\u201cAs marchers, balloon handlers, clowns and myriad parade workers got ready,\u201d Mr. Roker said in an email, \u201cshe would be weaving in and out among them with a look of pleasant professionalism, and then she\u2019d spot me, break out into a grin and greet me with, \u2018Al, darlin\u2019, we are gonna have us a beautiful parade!\u2019 \u201dMs. McFaddin and her entourage braved bitter cold, drenching rains and, once, a snowstorm that drove crowds away. Gusting winds often blew down balloons, sometimes injuring spectators. In 1997, the Cat in the Hat struck a lamppost, parts of which hit a woman, who suffered a serious head injury. After that, balloon sizes were limited and restrictions were imposed in high winds.There were other mishaps. Ms. McFaddin once grabbed the trailing rope of a runaway balloon and was briefly carried aloft. Another year, as TV cameras caught the action for a national audience, a little girl trying to catch Santa accidentally pulled his pants down. (To everyone\u2019s relief, he wore jeans underneath.)But the sun was bright and there were no calamities at Ms. McFaddin\u2019s last parade, in 2000. To celebrate her 24th anniversary as its organizer-director, the City of New York renamed Macy\u2019s corner, 34th Street and Broadway, \u201cJean McFaddin Way\u201d for a month.On her watch, the parade had doubled in size to 8,000 marchers, balloons had jumped tenfold to 85 and spectators had swelled into the millions. Ms. McFaddin shared more than a dozen Emmy Awards with NBC for the parade telecasts, and in 1999 she was inducted into the International Festivals and Events Association Hall of Fame, the industry\u2019s most prestigious honor.After a night\u2019s rest, she began her next project \u2014 Santaland. From the day after Thanksgiving until Christmas Eve, 300,000 children and parents visited Macy\u2019s eighth-floor setting for the rites of seeing Santa. They received tickets for the North Pole Express, saw an enchanted forest, chatted with elves who told stories of Santa\u2019s workshop, and finally met St. Nick.\u201cIt was about keeping the magic and miracle of Christmas alive for the thousands of children who came to believe that this was the true Santa,\u201d Mr. Krauss said.A few months later, Ms. McFaddin\u2019s indoor flower show at Macy\u2019s \u2014 filling the main floor with lilac bushes, azaleas, rhododendrons, tulips, amaryllis, primrose and begonias \u2014 unfolded in the first flush of spring. It was an enormous hit every year.Jean Eleanor McFaddin was born in Lufkin, Tex., on July 13, 1942, the second of three children of Ora Lance McFaddin, a real estate developer, and the former Eleanor Clark. Jean and her siblings, Janet and Lance, attended Lufkin High School, from which Jean graduated in 1960.Intending a career in theater, she received an associate arts degree at Stephens College in Columbia, Mo., in 1962 and, at the University of Texas at Austin, earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1964 and a master\u2019s in theater production in 1966.She acted in companies in Oklahoma and California, and in Los Angeles directed the Liquid Theater, whose cast interacted with audiences in unplanned talking and touching. It ran in New York, London and Paris. \u201cIt embraced you,\u201d Ms. McFaddin recalled. \u201cIt asked strangers to be friends and to trust one another.\u201dShe produced \u201cCoucou Bazaar\u201d in New York with the French artist Jean Dubuffet. It caught audiences in psychedelic swirls of pictures flashing on walls and Kabuki-like dancers. She directed a 1975-76 Bicentennial program for the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington and oversaw New York City\u2019s Fourth of July Land Festival in 1977. That drew the attention of Macy\u2019s, a festival sponsor, and she was hired to revive the store\u2019s faded parade.Ms. McFaddin was soon inspiring all of Macy\u2019s holiday celebrations. She rose to senior vice president of public relations and events for Macy\u2019s East, comprising scores of stores. Events included \u201cTap-O-Mania,\u201d a summer gathering of thousands of tap dancers performing on 34th Street.Her Macy\u2019s fireworks display every Fourth of July dazzled millions. Launched from barges in the Hudson River or New York Harbor after dark, it was the city\u2019s biggest pyrotechnic display of the year \u2014 a booming, scintillating barrage of rockets and starbursts that bathed the awed crowds in eerie light and echoed off the facades of a city that lived on imagination.In 2010, she and her companion of 37 years, Susan Falk, were married at their home in Ridgefield, Conn. Besides Ms. Falk, she is survived by her brother, Lance, four nieces and two nephews.In her later years, Ms. McFaddin continued to produce events for corporations, civic groups and charities like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.But she had officially retired in April 2001, a few weeks after her last flower show. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, at a City Hall news conference, proclaimed \u201cJean McFaddin Day in the City of New York.\u201dAnd she received a handwritten note from Maureen O\u2019Hara. \u201cYour wonderful contributions to Macy\u2019s, to New York City and to womanhood will never be forgotten,\u201d it said, and signed off, \u201cfrom one Parade Lady to another.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the name of a college in Missouri that Ms. McFaddin attended. It is Stephens College, not St. Stephen\u2019s College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Democrats Win the House? Ask Texas", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistOhio makes six appearances; Pennsylvania, seven. Wisconsin is present and more promising than ever, with Paul Ryan\u2019s soon-to-be-open spot squarely in Democrats\u2019 sights.But wait, what\u2019s this? Texas once, Texas twice, Texas five times in all. It reads like a typo. It looks like a delusion. Predominantly Republican and perversely gerrymandered, the Lone Star State is where Democrats send their dreams to die. Only 11 of its 36 House seats are in the party\u2019s hands.The appeal of youth, of first-timers, of women, of veterans and of candidates of color will be tested here. And a bevy of compelling characters have emerged from the primaries on March 6 and are poised to prevail in runoffs on May 22.She\u2019s Filipina-American. She\u2019s also openly lesbian, and while Texas political analysts told me that they weren\u2019t sure whether that would affect her bid, Jones has figured out precisely how to handle it: with brief acknowledgment and no special focus.At a recent house party in San Antonio where she introduced herself to a few dozen of the district\u2019s voters, she mentioned that she \u201cserved under \u2018don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell\u2019\u201d but didn\u2019t spell out the significance of that.She talked more about it during an interview with me the next day, comparing her time in the military with the anxiety and vulnerability of many minorities, particularly immigrants waiting to see what happens with the DACA program.Allred is 34. Like Jones, he\u2019s making his first run for office. Also like her, he has an unconventional professional biography. Before getting his law degree at the University of California, Berkeley, he played professional football for the Tennessee Titans, and before that he was a football star at Baylor University in Waco and at a high school in his Dallas district. Many of its voters remember watching him play.And more of them voted for Clinton than for Trump in the presidential election, a sign of the district\u2019s evolution and an outcome for which Democrats were so unprepared that not a single Democrat challenged Sessions in 2016. This time around, seven Democrats entered the race. Allred got 38.5 percent of the votes in the primary, more than twice that of the second-place finisher.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a level of activism here that is off the charts,\u201d he told me after a town hall in Dallas where he spoke with voters about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and the need for gun-safety legislation. Sessions is a major recipient of donations from the National Rifle Association, and Allred, echoing the campaigns of Democrats across the country, is making an issue of that.The mere existence of the runoffs that he, Jones and other Texas Democrats will compete in next month reflects Democrats\u2019 hopes in Texas in 2018, because it means that there were three or more Democratic candidates in districts that had two, one or none in election cycles past.\u201cDemocrats smell blood in the water,\u201d Harold Cook, a former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, told me, \u201cand for the first time in maybe forever, there is a Democrat running in every single congressional district in Texas, including ones where it\u2019s a ludicrous thought that a Democrat could conceivably win.\u201d They\u2019re that angry about Trump and that convinced that his turbulent presidency and failure to nudge his approval rating much above 40 percent could mean an enormous blue wave.Democrats are even eyeing a few districts that Trump won, like the 21st and 31st. The 21st attracted the party\u2019s attention largely because its Republican incumbent, Lamar Smith, isn\u2019t seeking re-election. He decided to retire after more than three decades in the House.Richard Murray, a professor of political science at the University of Houston, told me to keep an eye as well on the 22nd District, a largely suburban swath of the Houston area that he described as a microcosm of demographic changes that are making the state ever more hospitable Democratic turf.\u201cThe suburban counties that led Republicans to dominance here 25 years ago are getting significantly less Republican fast,\u201d he said, adding that Fort Bend County, in the 22nd, is roughly 20 percent Asian-American now. The first-place finisher in the district\u2019s Democratic primary, Sri Preston Kulkarni, is Indian-American. Murray said that if Kulkarni wins his runoff, that could be a significant boost to Democrats\u2019 chances to nab this House seat.Trump took the 22nd by almost 8 points. But Mitt Romney won it four years earlier by more than 25. And bear in mind that Lamb notched his Pennsylvania victory last month in a district that had gone for Trump by a margin of 19 points.But who best understands how the winds are blowing \u2014 the national Democratic Party or local primary voters? And are those voters making smart general-election choices or romantic ones? I suspect they made the right calls with Allred and Jones, neither of whom was anointed by the party and both of whom faced primary opponents with more money and with powerful connections.In Jones\u2019s case that was Jay Hulings, a former federal prosecutor who went to law school at Harvard with the Texas political stars Joaquin and Juli\u00e1n Castro. He finished fourth in the five-candidate primary, with 15 percent of the vote. Jones\u2019s 41 percent tally was more than twice that of her nearest competitor.Allred\u2019s better-financed and more conventionally pedigreed rival was Ed Meier, who has a master\u2019s degree in Middle East studies from Oxford University and worked as a management consultant with McKinsey. He finished fourth among the seven primary candidates.Meredith Kelly, the communications director for the D.C.C.C., told me that Jones\u2019s and Allred\u2019s newness to politics could prove hugely appealing. When the party did focus groups in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District after Lamb\u2019s victory, she said, \u201cOne of the biggest takeaways was that he was seen as a young, fresh face in contrast to Rick Saccone.\u201d Saccone was 60 and had long served in the State Legislature. Lamb was 33 and had never held elected office.Allred put it to me this way: \u201cMy youth is not a bug. It\u2019s a feature.\u201dHe and Jones are potentially formidable for additional reasons. There\u2019s not a whiff of entitlement or the establishment about either of them. Both had single mothers of humble means. Both talk expansively and eloquently about government or community help that was crucial in their lives.Both have deep roots in their districts, where they spent their childhoods. Both are great-looking, as it happens. (That rarely hurts.) And both acknowledge the shock of Nov. 8, 2016 \u2014 and the peril of what they\u2019ve witnessed since \u2014 as factors that motivated them to run and could be central to whether they win or lose. Trump is large in their minds and in their races.Before and immediately after the presidential election, Jones worked in the federal government as an economic and national security adviser. She hadn\u2019t thought about a career as a lawmaker, she told me.But Election Day changed everything. \u201cI remember a sinking feeling in my stomach,\u201d she said, \u201cin no small part because a lot of us thought, \u2018That will never happen.\u2019 That was not an option, because then what does that mean?\u201d\u201cAbout America?\u201d I asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said.She quit her bureaucratic job and became one of a record number of 309 women to file to run for House seats. There\u2019s an unusual bounty of Democratic candidates of all kinds, and as Jones and Allred demonstrate, that\u2019s not merely a numerical phenomenon. It has brought engaging new figures and impassioned new voices into the arena. On Nov. 6, in Texas and elsewhere, we\u2019ll see how much that matters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Picks Monetary Expert for No. 2 Job at Federal Reserve", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump continued a sweeping remake of the Federal Reserve\u2019s leadership on Monday by nominating Richard Clarida, a Treasury official in the administration of President George W. Bush, for the Fed\u2019s second-ranking job.Mr. Clarida, a Columbia University economist, is a scholar in monetary policy whose expertise would complement the background of the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, who is not an academically trained economist.The Fed\u2019s seven-seat Board of Governors is currently functioning with three members, and the vacancies give Mr. Trump the opportunity to put his own stamp on monetary policy.His nomination won quick applause from Fed watchers and some economists, who cast him as a serious thinker unlikely to radically pull the central bank away from its gradual approach to raising interest rates as the economy continues to heal from the financial crisis.\u201cRich Clarida is an outstanding monetary economist whose knowledge of monetary policy and international finance will add greatly to the Fed in this most interesting time,\u201d said R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia\u2019s business school and a former chairman of the second President Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIn addition, Rich\u2019s knowledge of and experience in financial markets will make him a valuable colleague for Chairman Powell.\u201dTim Duy, a University of Oregon economist and the writer of the Fed Watch blog, said in an email that Mr. Clarida was \u201ca solid pick \u2014 a respected academic economist plus market experience via Pimco plus government experience.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think every position needs to be filled by a trained macroeconomist, but given the nature of the job, I think there needs to be a heavy dominance of trained macroeconomists,\u201d Mr. Duy said. \u201cI think he fits within the current consensus as well so, like the elevation of Williams, represents largely a maintenance of the status quo, at least for now.\u201dTony Fratto, a former colleague of Mr. Clarida\u2019s at the Treasury Department, said the nominee\u2019s positions were always driven by data.\u201cHe\u2019s a traditional conservative Republican economist,\u201d Mr. Fratto said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find a lot of controversial positions from him. You\u2019re not going to find him saying things that are particularly ideological. He\u2019s just a strong policy guy.\u201dOne thing his nomination will not do is bring diversity to the Fed\u2019s leadership team, which is all-male and all-white \u2014 a complaint liberal groups made about the New York Fed\u2019s selection of Mr. Williams. But the reaction to Mr. Clarida\u2019s selection among Fed critics was reserved.\u201cLike all nominees, Clarida should be vetted thoroughly for his commitment to the full-employment mandate and to regulating banks to avoid another financial crash,\u201d said Shawn Sebastian, the director of the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of labor and other liberal groups that have pushed the Fed to keep interest rates low to aid job creation.Like Mr. Clarida, Ms. Bowman is a veteran of the second Bush administration, where she worked for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Before returning to her native Kansas in 2010, she led a government and public affairs consulting company in London.Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said he looked forward to hearing more from the nominees, but suggested that he would want assurances that neither would participate in the Trump administration\u2019s rollback of financial regulations established after the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cI hope Mr. Clarida and Ms. Bowman don\u2019t have the same collective amnesia that plagues many in this administration,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If the World Economy Is Looking So Great, Why Are Global Policymakers So Gloomy?", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs officials gather for the I.M.F. and World Bank meetings in Washington, worries about trade and debt are on the rise.By a lot of measures, these are very good times for the global economy. Nearly every major region of the planet is enjoying solid growth and prosperity simultaneously for the first time in a decade.\u201cThe present good times will not last for long,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, as he released the fund\u2019s latest projections, which foresee a solid 3.9 percent expansion of the global economy in 2018.The pessimism among policymakers \u2014 who are attending spring meetings of the I.M.F. and World Bank in Washington this week \u2014 contrasts with financial markets. Despite a bumpy couple of months, stocks and most other financial assets are still priced at levels that suggest growth will continue apace for some time to come.\u201cEconomists are paid to worry,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve. \u201cWe\u2019re paid to find problems and challenges. I think the markets, on the other hand, are pretty good at living in the moment.\u201dWhat are these policymakers so worried about? Is this just a bunch of economists living up to their field\u2019s reputation as the dismal science \u2014 or worse, letting their own policy preferences shape their forecasts? Or is the world economy, for all its apparent prosperity, actually in peril?Let\u2019s look at the interrelated threats the economists see.For now, this remains more a theoretical risk than a cause of major disruption to economic expansion.Essentially the Trump administration pattern so far has been to pair belligerent language with comparatively restrained action. Trading partners have worked to find resolutions rather than let a full-scale trade war erupt. There is a tentative deal to renegotiate the United States\u2019 trade agreement with South Korea, for example, and Nafta negotiations are continuing.Global policymakers are worried about more than conflict over trade. They also see an emerging series of financial imbalances and risks that could cause, or worsen, the next downturn.For years, for example, some countries \u2014 Germany, Japan and China prominent among them \u2014 have persistently run current account surpluses, meaning they export more than they import and essentially export capital to the rest of the world. Others, including the United States and Britain, have run persistent current account deficits.Over time, these patterns can create vulnerability to financial shocks; they helped fuel both the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2010 eurozone crisis. And the I.M.F. projects that they will worsen in the next couple of years, despite steady economic growth.The tools to prevent those shifts are within each country\u2019s purview. Germany could spend more on domestic investment, and the United States could reduce its budget deficit, which might start to reduce those imbalances. Neither has much evident political appetite to do so.At the same time, years of efforts by central banks to fuel economic recovery have left interest rates low worldwide and prices in financial markets relatively high.So, for example, if inflation starts to perk up and the world\u2019s central banks raise rates to try to prevent it from taking root, there could be a cascading series of disruptions to financial markets that have become accustomed to cheap money.Another worry: While the major economies look relatively strong right now, they may also prove brittle when the next shock arises.Rather than using this period of stability and prosperity to pay down debts, some major economies are moving in the other direction \u2014 including with rising public debt levels in the United States and high private debt levels in China.\u201cIn the United States, the fiscal impulse is important, but that is something that at some point doesn\u2019t give you any more mileage in terms of growth,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements and former governor of the Bank of Mexico, in an interview Wednesday. \u201cAnd China need to continue improving the quality of growth from the point of view of the dependency on credit.\u201dThat dependency on debt means that whenever the next economic downturn arrives, governments may have less leeway to deal with it by opening the floodgates of public spending.And with interest rates still low across the entire advanced world, one of the normal tools for dealing with a recession still has limited power. For example, the Federal Reserve entered the last downturn with its short-term interest rate at 5.25 percent, before cutting to nearly zero by December 2008. Currently, that target rate is between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent.The European Central Bank has even less room to maneuver, with its policy rates still near zero.In effect, a decade after the financial crisis, if another recession were to arise, both central banks and fiscal authorities may find themselves short of ammunition to fight it. There is surely an anthropological dimension to the kind of worrying that is emerging from conference halls in Washington this week.The people who end up as central bankers or finance ministers or I.M.F. officials tend to worry a lot about what could go wrong. They also tend to place greater value than most on the kinds of international institutions that underpin the global trade system, of which the Trump administration is deeply skeptical.But there\u2019s also no doubt that the largely good economic news of the moment comes with some warnings worth listening to. Even when enjoying sunny weather, it never hurts to know what you\u2019ll do if it starts to rain. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Says He\u2019s an Innocent Victim. Robert Mueller Says He\u2019s a Spy.", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The man sat at a restaurant table, grasping a glass of white wine. His sandy hair was close cropped, he wore a cardigan sweater and in the afternoon bustle he looked like just another office worker at lunch.While seated, the most notable element of his appearance was hardly noticeable; only when he stood to introduce himself did it become clear that he is short, almost childlike, in stature, a characteristic that earned him the nickname \u201cthe midget\u201d from Russian political operatives.He spoke flawless English, with only a touch of an accent, was gregarious, and casually brushed aside the main question in this rare interview in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, a year or so ago, saying that of course he was not a Russian spy.And last week, Mr. Mueller turned over a card in the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with Russia by asserting in a court document that this person \u201chas ties to a Russian intelligence service\u201d and was in contact with a senior member of the campaign, Rick Gates, during the 2016 election.\u201cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents assisting the Special Counsel\u2019s Office assess that Person A has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016,\u201d the filing said.As Person A, Mr. Kilimnik, a 47-year-old former Russian military interpreter, has appeared now in multiple court filings by the special prosecutor, which suggests that he could become a pivotal figure in the investigation. For about a decade, he worked as an office manager in Kiev for the political consulting business of Paul Manafort, acting as a go-between and fixer for the American and the Russian-leaning politicians who were its clients.The Russian government has denied meddling in the 2016 election and President Trump has denied collusion by members of his campaign staff. But during the years that Mr. Manafort worked in Ukraine, the country was deeply penetrated by Russian intelligence agents. While Mr. Kilimnik continues to deny that he was a Russian agent, it would have been perfectly normal for Moscow to plant someone in the Manafort operation.Konstantin Viktorovich Kilimnik was born in eastern Ukraine in the Soviet period. He studied at the Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, and after the Soviet breakup took Russian citizenship, he said in the interview. The institute trains interpreters for the Russian military intelligence agency, formerly known as the G.R.U. and now called the Main Directorate.He worked for a time in Sweden as an interpreter for a Russian company that exported arms, and later in the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit, where former employees said they suspected he was informing on them to the Russian authorities.He parted ways with the organization, a former employee of the Moscow office said, after the chief of the F.S.B., the successor agency to the K.G.B., talked in a speech about the private meetings of the institute\u2019s officials.They didn\u2019t have evidence, but suspected Mr. Kilimnik had been the source, said the former official, who could not be cited publicly discussing personnel issues.In the interview, Mr. Kilimnik said he had been dismissed for having taken work on the side as an interpreter for Mr. Manafort in Ukraine in the early 2000s.Mr. Manafort\u2019s former client President Viktor F. Yanukovych was deposed in 2014, and Mr. Kilimnik said he stopped working for Mr. Manafort that year.In August of 2016, Mr. Kilimnik was formally investigated in Ukraine on suspicion of ties to Russian spy agencies, according to documents from Parliament and the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, but no charges were filed.A Ukrainian lawmaker, Volodymyr I. Ariev, who requested the investigation, said Mr. Kilimnik\u2019s background in military intelligence deserved scrutiny.\u201cHe was a student of a military school in Russia,\u201d Mr. Ariev said. \u201cEverybody in the former Soviet Union knows what that means. They produce professional spies.\u201dIn person, though, Mr. Kilimnik has been surprisingly nonchalant about the suspicions swirling around his past and role in the 2016 campaign.He said he was never contacted by investigators in Ukraine and called the probe politically motivated. \u201cIf there were any truth to me talking to any security service in the world, they would arrest me,\u201d he said, speaking of Ukrainian law enforcement.Before the United States election, Mr. Kilimnik said, he and Mr. Manafort had spoken \u201cevery couple of months,\u201d at a time when Mr. Manafort served as chairman of the Trump campaign, but he said there was nothing to hide in the calls and meetings. The two mostly discussed Ukrainian politics, not the election, he said: \u201cI was briefing him on Ukraine.\u201dThe filing last week by the special counsel\u2019s office asserted that Mr. Kilimnik had communicated with Mr. Gates late during the 2016 campaign, and that Mr. Gates was aware of Mr. Kilimnik\u2019s background in Russian intelligence.The filing was notable for touching on Mr. Gates\u2019s activities during the campaign. He has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and conspiring to defraud the United States for activities related to his work in Ukraine mostly before joining the Trump campaign, and agreed to cooperate with the investigation.Mr. Kilimnik also played a role in a reported effort by Mr. Manafort to contact a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska, during the campaign.Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kilimnik had cooperated on an ultimately unsuccessful business venture financed by Mr. Deripaska, known as the Pericles investment fund.Mr. Kilimnik has surfaced as a fringe figure in other aspects of the Russian investigation.At the time, about eight years ago, Mr. Akhmetshin was trying to persuade political advisers of Mr. Yanukovych to buy the rights to a book that cast a domestic political opponent in a negative light, and attended meetings with Mr. Kilimnik.In the interview last year, Mr. Kilimnik said he divided his time between Kiev, where he worked, and Moscow, where his wife and two daughters lived in the suburb of Khimki.\u201cI do not want to be part of the U.S. political games and I am not,\u201d Mr. Kilimnik wrote in an email last year. \u201cI am simply a random casualty because of my proximity to Paul,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Manafort.Asked in the interview about the allegation of ties to Russian intelligence agencies, Mr. Kilimnik said, \u201cI vehemently deny it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Courtroom Drama: Producer Offers to Stage Disputed \u2018Mockingbird\u2019 for Judge", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA prominent Broadway producer has offered to stage a single performance of Aaron Sorkin\u2019s theatrical adaptation of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d inside a federal courthouse in an effort to prove that the play is faithful to the novel.The producer, Scott Rudin, made the proposal on Monday as part of a blistering federal lawsuit he filed in Manhattan, in which he demanded $10 million from novelist Harper Lee\u2019s estate for challenging Mr. Sorkin\u2019s adaptation. Mr. Rudin threatened to cancel the much-anticipated Broadway production of the play, starring Jeff Daniels as Atticus Finch, which has been scheduled to open in December under the direction of the Tony winner Bartlett Sher.Mr. Rudin said the efforts by the estate to assert control over the script had already damaged the process, making it difficult to secure the money needed to finance the production.\u201cInvestors are not willing to invest millions of dollars when a cloud exists,\u201d the lawsuit said.Ms. Lee had agreed before her death in 2016 to allow Mr. Rudin and Mr. Sorkin to develop a new stage adaptation of the novel. But the executor of her estate, Tonja B. Carter, objected in a lawsuit of her own last month, filed in Ms. Lee\u2019s home state of Alabama, that the script had deviated too much from the novel.The new lawsuit from Mr. Rudin\u2019s production company, Rudinplay, significantly escalates the dispute as it questions the conduct, qualifications and motivations of Ms. Carter.Ms. Carter\u2019s lawyer, Matthew H. Lembke, rejected the new complaint as \u201cfull of wild and baseless allegations that seem only meant to distract from the real issue \u2014 whether Rudinplay has violated its written contractual promise that it would not alter the characters in Harper Lee\u2019s classic novel, \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019.\u201dMs. Carter has taken particular issue with Mr. Sorkin\u2019s depiction of Atticus as a morally ambiguous figure who gradually comes to hold more enlightened views about racial equality; she objected to multiple other elements of the script, but omitted many of those objections in an amended complaint.Mr. Rudin, who is co-producing the play with Lincoln Center Theater, has insisted the play is faithful to the novel. His lawsuit states that \u201cthe character of Atticus in the draft script remained noble and idealistic, and true to the character as he appeared in \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird.\u2019\u201d But the complaint also argues that Mr. Sorkin is a leading writer with a unique voice and \u201chis participation as playwright would hardly be necessary, or appropriate, if the Play were to be a mere transcription of the Novel.\u201dMr. Rudin seeks to have the Alabama lawsuit dismissed. He is also asking for the New York court to declare that the play does not violate his agreement with Ms. Lee and that Ms. Carter does not have the authority to act on behalf of Ms. Lee\u2019s estate. He is demanding that the estate award him damages \u201cin no event less than $10 million.\u201d\u201cThe Agreement did not give Ms. Lee approval rights over the script of the Play, much less did it give her a right to purport to edit individual lines of dialogue,\u201d he argued in the lawsuit. \u201cIt certainly did not give such rights to Ms. Carter, who is not an author, editor, literary agent or critic, and has no known expertise whatsoever in theater or writing.\u201dIn a statement Monday, Ms. Carter said, \u201cAs the personal representative of the Estate of Nelle Harper Lee, I must protect the integrity of her beloved American classic, and therefore had no choice but to file a lawsuit against Rudinplay for failing to honor its contract with Ms. Lee. It is my duty and privilege to defend the terms of Ms. Lee\u2019s agreement with Rudinplay, and I am determined to do so.\u201dBut, in his lawsuit, Mr. Rudin questioned Ms. Carter\u2019s status as a representative of Ms. Lee\u2019s will and for the first time accused Ms. Carter of having an ulterior motive in challenging the play: a desire to force the cancellation of the Broadway production because of a separate dispute between Ms. Lee\u2019s estate and the heirs of Gregory Peck, who played Atticus Finch in the movie adaptation, over stage rights.While a local theater group in Ms. Lee\u2019s hometown Monroeville, Ala., has staged a production based on the novel annually for nearly three decades, there has never been a Broadway adaptation of \u201cMockingbird,\u201d one of the most beloved novels in American literature. In the lawsuit, Mr. Rudin suggests he already intends to postpone the new production, writing that the legal dispute \u201chas rendered it impossible for the play to premiere as scheduled in December, 2018, and unless this dispute is resolved in the immediate future, the play will be canceled.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Rudin said he was willing to take the unusual step of performing the play in a courtroom so a jury could determine whether or not the production is true to the spirit of the novel. \u201cA play and a book are two different things. A book is meant to be read; a play is meant to be performed,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Could Happen if Trump Fired Rosenstein", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe clear idea behind the suggestion \u2014 which Mr. Trump is also said to be weighing \u2014 is that ousting Mr. Rosenstein would enable the White House to put the criminal investigations encircling the president\u2019s associates on a tighter leash, or even to shut them down.Here is a look at some of the issues at stake.A longtime Justice Department official, Mr. Rosenstein was not part of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle before Attorney General Jeff Sessions persuaded the president to designate him as deputy.After Mr. Sessions recused himself from investigations related to the 2016 election, Mr. Rosenstein became acting attorney general for those matters. He appointed Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to scrutinize ties between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s interference in the election. He signed off as Mr. Mueller\u2019s focus expanded to whether Mr. Trump committed obstruction of justice and whether Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime campaign manager, Paul Manafort, committed crimes related to his work for Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian government. Mr. Rosenstein also approved the decision to get search warrants for Mr. Cohen\u2019s files.Mr. Trump has bitterly denounced Mr. Sessions\u2019s recusal, saying he needs an attorney general who will protect him.Mr. Rosenstein could have expanded Mr. Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction to include that matter, but instead he apparently handed it to a different office. As a result, there is now a separate prosecutorial team that has seen evidence about matters close to the president that it \u2014 and the federal magistrate judge who issued the search warrant \u2014 found worth investigating.However, the impression created by that article appears to have been somewhat overstated. Mr. Schneiderman has no clear jurisdiction to file charges in some of the potential crimes at issue in the core Justice Department investigations, like federal election law offenses. Law enforcement officials familiar with the talks cautioned that neither side was routinely sharing investigative materials.It might make it easier to constrain the investigations or even to fire Mr. Mueller \u2014 and now, perhaps, Mr. Khuzami, too. Mr. Rosenstein has said he will refuse any order to fire Mr. Mueller if he did not believe the special counsel committed misconduct, citing a Justice Department regulation that says such a prosecutor may be removed only by the attorney general and only for good cause.A successor who is more of a loyalist to Mr. Trump might be more amenable to interpreting Mr. Mueller\u2019s jurisdiction narrowly or to firing him, either by declaring that Mr. Mueller has overstepped or by removing the regulation that protects him from arbitrary removal.No. In and of itself, the removal of Mr. Rosenstein \u2014 or Mr. Mueller and Mr. Khuzami \u2014 would not stop the law enforcement officials working for them from continuing to pursue those cases.Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Confidential N.F.L. Meeting to Discuss National Anthem Protests", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was an extraordinary summit; rarely do owners and players meet in this manner. But the president\u2019s remarks about players who were kneeling during the anthem had catalyzed a level of public hostility that the N.F.L. had never experienced. In the spirit of partnership at the meeting, the owners decided that they and the players should sit in alternating seats around the large table, which featured an N.F.L. logo in the middle.\u201cLet\u2019s make sure that we keep this confidential,\u201d Commissioner Roger Goodell said to begin the session.The New York Times has obtained an audio recording of the roughly three-hour meeting, and several people in the room corroborated details of the gathering. The unvarnished conversation reveals how the leaders of the most dominant sports league in the country and several of its most outspoken players confronted an unprecedented moment \u2014 mostly by talking past one another.[\u2018Divisive\u2019 and \u2018Disastrous\u2019: Here are the most biting comments N.F.L. owners made about Trump.]The players sounded aggrieved. After discussing a proposal to finance nonprofit groups to address player concerns, they wanted to talk about why Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who started the anthem protests to highlight social injustice and police brutality against African-Americans, was, they believed, being blackballed by the owners. The owners sounded panicked about their business under attack, and wanted to focus on damage control.\u201cIf he was on a roster right now, all this negativeness and divisiveness could be turned into a positive,\u201d Philadelphia Eagles defensive lineman Chris Long said at the meeting.Long said he did not wish to \u201clecture any team\u201d on what quarterbacks to sign, but \u201cwe all agree in this room as players that he should be on a roster.\u201d The owners\u2019 responses were noncommittal. The Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said that fighting for social justice is not \u201cabout one person.\u201dThe New England Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft pointed to another \u201celephant in the room.\u201d\u201cThis kneeling,\u201d he said.\u201cThe problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don\u2019t feel is in the best interests of America,\u201d said Kraft, who is a longtime supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s divisive and it\u2019s horrible.\u201dThe owners were intent on finding a way to avoid Trump\u2019s continued criticism. The president\u2019s persistent jabs on Twitter had turned many fans against the league. Lurie, who called Trump\u2019s presidency \u201cdisastrous,\u201d cautioned against players getting drawn into the president\u2019s tactics.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else,\u201d Lurie said. \u201cWe have to find a way to not be divided and not get baited.\u201dThe Buffalo Bills owner Terry Pegula sounded anguished over the uncertainty of when Trump would take another shot at the league. \u201cAll Donald needs to do is to start to do this again,\u201d Pegula said. \u201cWe need some kind of immediate plan because of what\u2019s going on in society. All of us now, we need to put a Band-Aid on what\u2019s going on in the country.\u201dThe Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan countered that the worst was behind them. \u201cAll the damage Trump\u2019s going to do is done,\u201d he said.The owners kept returning to one bottom-line issue: Large numbers of fans and sponsors had become angry about the protests. Boycotts had been threatened and jerseys burned and \u2014 most worrisome \u2014 TV ratings were declining.Pegula complained that the league was \u201cunder assault.\u201d He unloaded a dizzying flurry of nautical metaphors to describe their predicament. \u201cTo me, this is like a glacier moving into the ocean,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting hit with a tsunami.\u201d He expressed his wish that the league never be \u201ca glacier crawling into the ocean.\u201dThe Houston Texans owner Bob McNair was more direct. He urged the players to tell their colleagues to, essentially, knock off the kneeling. \u201cYou fellas need to ask your compadres, fellas, stop that other business, let\u2019s go out and do something that really produces positive results, and we\u2019ll help you.\u201dAfter the Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross raised the idea of a \u201cmarch on Washington\u201d by N.F.L. players and owners, Eric Reid, Kaepernick\u2019s former teammate and the first player to kneel alongside him, brought the discussion back to Kaepernick.Reid, who attended the meeting wearing a Kaepernick T-shirt over his dress shirt and tie, said that his former teammate was being blackballed.\u201cI feel like he was hung out to dry,\u201d Reid said of Kaepernick. \u201cEveryone in here is talking about how much they support us.\u201d The room fell quiet. \u201cNobody stepped up and said we support Colin\u2019s right to do this. We all let him become Public Enemy No. 1 in this country, and he still doesn\u2019t have a job.\u201dPegula offered that he thought the league was battling a perception and \u201cmedia problem.\u201d He said it would be great for the league to find a compelling spokesman \u2014 preferably a player \u2014 to promote all of the good things they were doing together. He suggested that the league could learn from the gun lobby in this regard.\u201cFor years we\u2019ve watched the National Rifle Association use Charlton Heston as a figurehead,\u201d Pegula said. \u201cWe need a spokesman.\u201dAnquan Boldin, a former N.F.L. wide receiver who was at the meeting, said that owners needed to be spokesmen, too. \u201cLetting people know it\u2019s not just the players that care about these issues, but the owners, too,\u201d Boldin said.Pegula didn\u2019t address Boldin\u2019s point except to add that it would be important for the spokesman to be black. (None of the owners in the N.F.L. are black.)\u201cFor us to have a face, as an African-American, at least a face that could be in the media,\u201d Pegula continued, \u201cwe could fall in behind that.\u201dKaepernick\u2019s name was not mentioned again. He continues to pursue a labor grievance accusing the owners of colluding to keep him out of the league. He remains unsigned.Before the meeting ended, owners had quoted Thomas Paine (the Falcons owner Arthur Blank), invoked Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s Selma march (Ross of the Dolphins) and expressed great hope for what they all could accomplish together (\u201cWe have a chance to do something monumental,\u201d declared the Giants owner John Mara).The meeting concluded with some participants saying how positive the session had been, and how they would all keep talking. Goodell told the group that another meeting was being scheduled. They planned to issue a \u201cjoint statement\u201d to underscore their shared commitment.Kraft said the statement should reflect how everyone had come together for a good cause. \u201cIt would be good if you could work in the word \u2018unified\u2019 or \u2018unity\u2019 in some fashion,\u201d he said, referring to the joint statement.\u201cWe could say simply, today we had a reset, and the players\u2019 issues are our issues, and we recognize them and will work together,\u201d Ross said.\u201cI like the language of \u2018our issues,\u2019\u201d said DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the players\u2019 union.About an hour later, the league released its joint statement:\u201cToday owners and players had a productive meeting focused on how we can work together to promote positive social change and address inequality in our communities. NFL executives and owners joined NFLPA executives and player leaders to review and discuss plans to utilize our platform to promote equality and effectuate positive change. We agreed that these are common issues and pledged to meet again to continue this work together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Ramaphosa announced plans to raise $100 billion in foreign investment over the next five years.In a speech at the summit meeting, Mr. Ramaphosa said his country had entered \u201ca new era of confidence and hope,\u201d and he named four envoys, including two well-respected former Finance Ministry officials, to campaign for investments.While in London, Mr. Ramaphosa addressed investors\u2019 anxiety about possible land reform in South Africa while acknowledging some constituents\u2019 demand for radical change. He tried to allay fears of a violent land grab as had happened in Zimbabwe.When the A.N.C. took power, it wanted to address the issue of land ownership in South Africa, but \u201cit has not quite worked as we had intended it to work,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said in the television interview.Another gargantuan task Mr. Ramaphosa faces is to deliver on his promise of a \u201cnew dawn\u201d following public outrage over corruption and of an Indian business family\u2019s influence on the previous administration. Endemic corruption has engulfed South Africa and eroded virtually every institution in the country, including state enterprises.While the police and prosecutors are investigating multiple cases of corruption and plan to recover more than $4 billion lost from state coffers, they have done little to prosecute political leaders who enabled malfeasance across many sectors of the economy.The president\u2019s recent appointments to his cabinet have also cast doubt on his promises of reform. After he became party leader by a razor-thin margin, Mr. Ramaphosa appointed several officials who had been accused of corruption in the past.Earlier this week, South Africa\u2019s public ombudsman announced an investigation into two high-ranking members of the A.N.C. after $21 million of public funds, meant to help struggling black farmers, went to politically connected companies and individuals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica and the Coming Data Bust", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe queasy truth at the heart of Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, which is so far the company\u2019s defining disgrace of 2018, is that its genesis became scandalous only in retrospect. The series of events that now implicate Facebook began in 2014, in plain view, with a listing on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk service, where users can complete small tasks for commensurately modest sums of cash. In exchange for installing a Facebook app and completing a survey \u2014 in the process granting the app access to parts of your Facebook profile \u2014 you would get around a dollar. Maybe two.This was a great deal, at least by the standards of the time. Facebook users were then accustomed to granting apps permission to see their personal data in exchange for much less. It was the tail end of a Facebook era defined by connected apps: games like FarmVille, Candy Crush and Words With Friends; apps that broadcast your extra-Facebook activities, like Spotify and Pinterest; and apps that were almost explicitly about gathering as much useful data as possible from users, like TripAdvisor\u2019s Cities I\u2019ve Visited app, which let you share a digital pushpin map with your friends.Most of these apps, when installed, demanded permission to access \u201cyour profile info,\u201d which could include things like your activity, birthday, relationship status, interests, religious and political views, likes, education and work history. They could also collect information about users\u2019 friends, multiplying their reach. In providing a marketplace for such apps, Facebook made it easy for users to extend their extraordinarily intimate relationship with the site to thousands of third-party developers. One of them turned out to be connected to Cambridge Analytica, which was using the data for right-wing political campaigns \u2014 a fact that was lucidly and widely reported as early as 2015 but promptly lost in the roiling insanity of primary season. (As of Facebook\u2019s most recent admission, data was collected on as many as 87 million users.)Not that more exposure in the news cycle would have mattered much back then. It was self-evidently absurd to grant a virtual-farming game access to your religious views, but that\u2019s just how the platform worked at the time, and so we got used to it, much in the same way we got used to conducting our private lives on any other corporate platform. (When Gmail first started in 2004, the fact that it placed ads based on the contents of users\u2019 emails was considered invasive. That feeling passed; Google continued scanning consumer email until 2017, and Gmail now has more than a billion users.) Still, these individually trivial decisions never gave us cause to confront just how much we had come to trust Facebook.Whenever you sign up for any free service, you\u2019re aware, in the loosest terms, that you\u2019re giving up something. It usually includes a license to use the content you create \u2014 be it capital-C Content, like public posts, or things you would intuitively understand as more private, like your direct messages and which profiles you look at \u2014 however the service pleases. You could imagine the problem with all this, if asked: You\u2019re giving up your privacy to a company that owes you nothing and could end up doing basically anything. But a user concerned about how ad-supported web services would infringe on his privacy is trapped in a sort of predictive hell: always right, but always feeling wrong; never quite able to say what will happen, but always expecting it; both constantly vindicated and yet feeling he\u2019s crying wolf.And its users unwittingly took part in a social-data boom and are only now starting to feel the consequences. The ease and speed with which internet users trust tech companies with the data they crave are wildly out of proportion with the risks they\u2019re assuming in doing so, in no small part because, out of negligence or institutional blindness, the companies couldn\u2019t anticipate the risks themselves. After all, Facebook spent years fortifying itself against hackers and spammers only to be rolled by political actors posing as app developers.This pattern \u2014 a boom based on credible-seeming promises that are a little too good to be true, followed years later by a bust confirming that they indeed were \u2014 is familiar from a different world: finance. The financial crisis was materially devastating in a way that a privacy crisis couldn\u2019t be; poor stewardship of user data isn\u2019t going to evict people from their homes. But among the lingering and underrated consequences of the collapse of the global financial system was a total loss in trust in the institutions that were supposed to prevent it. The disorienting and thoroughly unsatisfying Cambridge Analytica saga is a preview of what trailing indicators of the collapse of the data boom might look like: revealing signs, evident years later, that something was rotten with these arrangements, arriving too late to be actionable but soon enough to foster resentment against companies and services on which we\u2019ve come to depend.Experiences that test our trust of the free-services-for-personal-data internet are accumulating and threaten to become more personal: the failure of Twitter to ban someone who harassed or threatened you; a small but embarrassing email hack resulting in a scammer asking old friends for money and concluding with an admonishment from your provider that you just needed a better password; an identity theft, a suffering credit score and then news of a hack at Equifax, a service to which you never even chose to provide data. Or it could be nothing more than an eerily well-targeted ad, one that suggests that a certain service \u2014 maybe one you never even meant to interact with \u2014 knows things about you that you don\u2019t remember telling it.The wider consequences of these arrangements are harder to quantify and sometimes even to see. They are: a social-media ecosystem that has annexed the news and the public sphere; nascent but increasingly assertive systems of identity and social currency that seek to transcend borders while answering only to investors; billions of lives\u2019 worth of trustingly volunteered data in the hands of companies that might want to make money from it, or that might have no need for it anymore, or that might go out of business, change ownership or simply forget what they had in the first place. Perhaps someone \u2014 a new partner, an enterprising researcher, a repressive government \u2014 might, one day, discover new uses for the data.A loss of faith in tech companies as semipublic infrastructure would also arrive simultaneously with an understanding that that\u2019s what they had been all along: services that we depended on, ones we gave ourselves to, and that revealed themselves to be \u2014 or merely became \u2014 the sorts of services we\u2019d rather not. They\u2019re not too big to fail in the banking sense. But they\u2019re similarly hard to budge, having constructed entire modes of interaction, consumption and identity verification that are now intimately interwoven with our lives, so all-encompassing that they\u2019ve practically become invisible. To stop using these products is to leave the internet, and these companies made it their mission to make sure there isn\u2019t anywhere else to go.In a recent conference call with reporters, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, confessed that Facebook ought to do a better job of putting privacy tools in front of users, but in the same breath he encouraged people to use the tools and to \u201cmake sure that they\u2019re comfortable with how their information is used on our services and others.\u201d It was a gesture at dusty old user agreements \u2014 an emphasis on the fact that we technically consented to this, and that if he was expected to hold up his end of the deal, we should be too. It called to mind a line of the financial industry\u2019s post-crisis defense: Borrowers should have read the fine print. But for the tech industry, this posture is even more of a stretch: It\u2019s an argument for honoring the status quo, coming from the people who have made it their mission to destroy it.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury\u2019s Tax Law Architect, Justin Muzinich, Is Tapped as Deputy Secretary", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ascendance of Mr. Muzinich comes as Mr. Trump reshuffles his economic team, most notably replacing Gary D. Cohn with Larry Kudlow as the director of the National Economic Council. Far from a flamethrower, Mr. Muzinich, who spent most of his career on Wall Street, will add a more moderate voice with traditional conservative economic ideas to the table.Mr. Muzinich, 40, has been serving as Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s tax counselor and played a central role in crafting and negotiating the terms of the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that Congress passed late last year. He was previously under consideration to be promoted to under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, but now is in line to be Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s No. 2.\u201cI am delighted by the president\u2019s decision to nominate Justin to serve as deputy secretary of the Treasury,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement. \u201cJustin has established himself as a leader in the department, and played a key role in the passage of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.\u201dHe added: \u201cHe brings significant experience in financial services and in public policy and has become a reliable and trusted adviser on a number of important issues.\u201dA relative newcomer to Washington, Mr. Muzinich has brought a mix of financial and political experience to the Treasury Department. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he served as policy director for Jeb Bush and helped to craft Mr. Bush\u2019s tax plan. He also previously taught at Columbia Business School and has published essays on foreign aid and the role of the Federal Reserve.Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, has also worked as a banker at Morgan Stanley and was the president of Muzinich & Company, an international investment firm founded by his father.During the development of the tax legislation last year, Mr. Muzinich was frequently by Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s side or negotiating on behalf of the Treasury Department during meetings with congressional staff members. Tax policy staff members on Capitol Hill often noted that Mr. Muzinich was a good listener and fast learner considering that he was not steeped in the arcana of the tax code.Those abilities will be crucial as deputy secretary, as Mr. Muzinich will have a much wider mandate. While the tax law has been passed, the carrying out of such a major piece of legislation will be a consuming task for an understaffed Internal Revenue Service, which is part of the Treasury Department. The department is also responsible for developing and executing economic sanctions on terrorist groups and on countries such as North Korea and Russia. And the department is at the center of Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to prevent China from capturing intellectual property through corporate mergers and acquisitions.\u201cIt has been mystifying to me that they could go so long without a deputy at Treasury,\u201d said Sarah Bloom Raskin, who served as Treasury\u2019s deputy secretary during the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy role to keep vacant. It seems to have taken Treasury off the field in several major policy battles.\u201dJosh Bolten, a former chief of staff for President George W. Bush who got to know Mr. Muzinich during Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign, said that Mr. Muzinich\u2019s range of experiences would serve him well in a position that will require him to frequently speak on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s behalf.\u201cHe\u2019s a high-quality person who, I think, will in the most civil of ways always speak up when he thinks something is wrong and will always, again in a very civil way, give a good, reasoned judgment,\u201d Mr. Bolten said.Advertisement"}

Henson\u2019s collarbone glitter.A jeweler to the stars, Mr. Modi attained wealth and fame at home in India in a few short years. He socialized with British royalty and rubbed elbows with Donald Trump Jr. He opened an opulent outlet on Madison Avenue in New York. In January, he met with Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister and no relation, at the annual gathering of the world\u2019s elite in Davos, Switzerland.Today, he is on the run.The chase has enraged and captivated India at a time when the public increasingly believes the country\u2019s debt-laden government banks are enriching its flashiest, most corrupt business tycoons. Parliament sessions have deteriorated into screaming matches, with political opponents exchanging accusations of collusion with the jeweler.Finding Mr. Modi has become something of a national pastime. Reporters in New York camped outside a luxury hotel, the JW Marriott Essex House, where they believed Mr. Modi was staying. One who rang the bell outside what they believed to be his room found only a servant and a fluffy white dog.Before Mr. Modi, India watched as Vijay Mallya, an airlines-and-liquor magnate known as the King of Good Times, fled to Britain as banks tried to collect $1.4 billion. Many of the banks left on the hook were state-owned. He has denied wrongdoing.The state-owned Bank of Baroda has drawn news media attention over its business with the three Gupta brothers, who left India in 1993 and built a sprawling corporate empire in South Africa. They have been caught up in a political scandal there that led to the resignation of South Africa\u2019s president, Jacob Zuma.Bank of Baroda denied wrongdoing in a written response to questions, asserting that it acted in good faith and that many of the transactions it handled for the Gupta brothers were received from other banks.In February, the Indian authorities arrested Vikram Kothari, a ballpoint pen magnate, saying he had diverted loans given to his company by seven government-owned lenders. He also denied wrongdoing.The allegations against Mr. Modi have only strengthened people\u2019s wariness of the state banks. Indian officials have publicly accused him of working with tellers at a single branch of one of them, Punjab National Bank, to obtain $1.8 billion from branches of other banks. So far, five Indian banks have been swindled in the scandal, four of them government-owned, the authorities in New Delhi say.Just a decade ago, during the global financial crisis, Indian lenders were held up as a bastion of stability. Today, they are considered more vulnerable than those in other leading emerging markets, mostly because state-controlled lenders dominate the sector, according to the International Monetary Fund.Of the $6.5 billion in fraudulent loans that have hit the industry over the past two years, the most egregious cases were at government-owned banks, according to figures released by Parliament. Executives at those lenders are more likely to be appointed for their political connections than for their talent, financial analysts say.\u201cFor every Nirav Modi in this country, there\u2019s 10 more, and they are emboldened when they see the government failing to take action or pursue the right protocols,\u201d said Vineet Dhanda, a lawyer who is urging the Indian government to tighten up the banking sector.Mr. Dhanda questioned how major business figures like Mr. Modi could raise billions from banks without providing collateral, yet the average farmer struggles to get a few hundred dollars for a loan.\u201cThe money they are stealing is from the poor people of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this money is swindled away, then it comes from the taxpayers to fix the banks.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, denies his client defrauded banks and says there is only a misunderstanding over a much smaller loan worth about $40 million. He accused the banks and government authorities of damaging his client\u2019s reputation and the Nirav Modi brand\u2019s value, making it harder for the company to settle its debts.\u201cThis was a case of civil transaction which the authorities have converted into a criminal one unnecessarily,\u201d Mr. Aggarwal said in an interview.Diamond traders and jewelers have long marveled at Mr. Modi\u2019s rise. Nicknamed NiMo in the press, from the first syllables of his name, Mr. Modi was known for wearing custom-made cuff links with the fish from \u201cFinding Nemo.\u201dBorn in Antwerp, Belgium, to a relatively small diamond trading family, Mr. Modi attended the prestigious Wharton School of Business before dropping out at 19 to join the family business in Mumbai.He first rose to international prominence in 2010, when he designed a necklace featuring a 12.29-carat diamond set with smaller pink diamonds. It was auctioned by Christie\u2019s in Hong Kong for $3.56 million, nearly $1 million more than its asking price.The bidding war landed Mr. Modi on the cover of the Christie\u2019s catalog, the first Indian to be featured so prominently by the auction house. He formed his Nirav Modi brand later that year and announced plans to open 100 stores around the world by 2025.In 2015, Mr. Modi opened his flagship store on Madison Avenue, a few blocks from the luxury giants Cartier, Saks and Dior. Donald Trump Jr. was there, taking a break from his father\u2019s presidential campaign, as were actors and models: Naomi Watts and Coco Rocha posed for photos on the red carpet in front of the Nirav Modi logo. The next year, Mr. Modi designed 100 carats\u2019 worth of diamonds that Ms. Winslet wore to the Oscars.His rapid ascent puzzled some in the diamond industry, who say building a luxury brand takes both time and money.\u201cUsing models and actresses that are world-renowned to consumers \u2014 that makes a brand seem solid,\u201d said Karma El Khalil, a jeweler based in New York. \u201cBut it\u2019s incredibly expensive.\u201dHis lifestyle rose with his fame, according to interviews with colleagues and friends and local news reports that tracked his purchases. He bought a Rolls-Royce for family use. He had an aquarium built that covered an entire wall of his office. He bought an apartment in an exclusive, seaside high-rise called Sea Palace that is home to some of Mumbai\u2019s wealthiest people, including one of the founders of the information technology giant Infosys.But the authorities in New Delhi say he projected an image of success built on bank loans and fraudulent letters of understanding, part of a strategy to expand his business in the hope that profits would eventually outstrip debts.\u201cThe arms of the law are long,\u201d said Abhishek Dayal, a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Investigation, the main government body investigating the case. \u201cWe will get them.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s flight has shaken diamond traders in Antwerp and Mumbai.Until the allegations surfaced, he seemed to fit well in an international industry that often works based on trust and personal relationships. For example, a trader will often mail a diamond to another and give the other person a window of up to four months to evaluate the gem before expecting payment.Mr. Modi quickly won a reputation as someone who could be trusted, say diamond traders. He often paid within days after receiving diamonds.Now traders are wondering whether the industry trusted him too quickly, and what the fallout on the international diamond trade will be. A diamond dealer in Antwerp said he and his colleagues became anxious last month when the Indian government banned its banks from issuing letters of credit to finance trade abroad, making it harder for Indian diamond traders \u2014 some of the biggest players in the industry \u2014 to buy stones.\u201cYour reputation is based on today,\u201d said Sabyasachi Roy, the executive director of India\u2019s Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, sponsored by the Ministry of Commerce.\u201cToday you\u2019re great until you\u2019re not. Today you have actresses wearing your designs; tomorrow no one will look at you. But everyone was surprised by his quick rise.\u201dHari Kumar and Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi, and Ayesha Venkataraman from Mumbai, India.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Caught in the Cross Hairs, Farmers Brace for a Trade War", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Farmers across California\u2019s agriculture industry are worried over the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, with steep new tariffs specifically targeting some of the state\u2019s most lucrative exports.The Chinese finance ministry announced over the weekend that it would impose tariffs on more than 100 American products, including many of California\u2019s staples like wine and pistachios, in retaliation against tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum by President Trump.\u201cWe have heard a lot of concerns from our wine grape growers and our pistachio and almond growers. Those markets are definitely going to take the largest hit,\u201d Sara Neagu-Reed, of the California Farm Bureau Federation, said. \u201cPutting us in the middle of this issue is just not fair for our farmers.\u201dThat could mean trouble for the state\u2019s farmers in the Central Valley and elsewhere. China is California\u2019s third most valuable destination for agriculture products, according to the California Farm Bureau Federation, just behind the European Union and Canada. The state\u2019s exports to China totaled more than $2 billion in 2016. Three products alone, all facing tariffs, accounted for most of those exports: $530 million in pistachios, $518 million in almonds and $161 million in wine.The tariffs add another layer of uncertainty for growers in California, and in particular those in the wine industry, which already faces growing production costs. The full impact of the tariffs is not yet clear, but experts are warning of significant decreases in exports of those products. Fluctuating prices in steel could also affect the price of farm equipment.John Aguirre, the president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, said that the trade war with China threatened to derail long-running efforts by winemakers to expand into the Chinese market. That could carry repercussions well into the future.\u201cWe not only face the prospect of short term harm to wine grape prices, but really missing out on the longer term opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you lose market share, other countries have filled that void and it\u2019s very difficult to reclaim lost ground.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Hundreds of Angelenos gathered Saturday at the Kenneth Hahn Park in Los Angeles to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose contributions to American life are being remembered today across the country on the 50th anniversary of his assassination.Community members marched to the highest point of park, where a tree grove has been dedicated in Dr. King\u2019s honor. They played music, banged on drums and waved portraits of Dr. King as they walked in procession.The ribbon cutting ceremony officially opened the space. The event featured remarks by the Rev.

{"Headline": "How to Clean Up the Student Loan Mess", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn fact, new research on student loans is reinforcing a key lesson of behavioral economics: Seemingly minor details matter in a major way. Who answers the phone at the loan company, what choices you\u2019re offered and how they are framed can have profound effects on your financial well-being.Federal policy ignores these simple truths. While the federal government owns the loans, private companies collect payments, keep records and communicate with borrowers.It might seem trivial to worry about who collects payments on student loans. How complicated can it be to send out a monthly bill and credit a borrower\u2019s account?Say a borrower has fallen behind on her monthly payments, and her loan company calls to check in. The rules are complicated, and the responses of an individual call agent are critical.One agent might guide her into enrolling in an income-based repayment plan that resets her payment to zero, with the balance eventually forgiven. Even if she qualifies for the income-based plan, a different agent might put her onto a less desirable path: what is known as forbearance, with her payments suspended, interest mounting and no progress made toward ending her obligation.All this points to lower default rates for people on income-based plans. In such plans, payments are zero for the very lowest earners and a percentage of income for those with higher pay. Reducing default matters, because it can have devastating personal consequences, including damaged credit ratings and reduced job and housing prospects because employers and landlords check credit reports.The bottom line is that the decisions made during loan servicing matter enormously to the financial well-being of millions of people. Market pressures alone won\u2019t improve the student loan industry because borrowers are locked to the servicer selected for them by the government and can\u2019t vote with their feet.What\u2019s the solution? We could make the loan system less difficult for borrowers to navigate. In particular, borrowers should be enrolled automatically in an income-based program if they fall behind on their payments. The lengthy process for enrolling and staying in these programs should be simplified, with tax records used to automatically determine payments.As it is, we have a punishing system of garnishment in place for student loans. In 2017, the blandly named Treasury Offset Program seized $2.8 billion from student borrowers who were in default. These funds were taken from federal earned-income tax credit, Black Lung Benefits and Social Security payments that would have gone to retired, disabled or deceased workers and their families.It makes little sense to have the federal government seize money from these most vulnerable families while shying away from a sensible system of payroll withholding for active workers.Advertisement"}

When the credit union held its 25th anniversary gala that year and named Occupy Wall Street as its honoree, Goldman Sachs rescinded the $5,000 it said it was going to donate to the credit union. (In response, other credit unions and Community Development Financial Institutions collectively donated $30,000. Those donations, Ms. Levy said, \u201ccame from people interested in our mission.\u201d)The Lower East Side People\u2019s Federal Credit Union serves a mostly low-income, largely immigrant population, and it uses deposits to make loans for things like affordable housing and small businesses.It got its start after Manufacturers Hanover Bank \u2014 now part of JPMorgan Chase \u2014 closed its Lower East Side branch in 1984, creating a financial services desert in the neighborhood. In response, Cliff Rosenthal, then the chief executive officer of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, suggested that the community begin assessing whether it could raise the capital to start a credit union.\u201cThe community was struggling to save itself,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said in a recent interview.During the 1970s and 1980s, landlords who wanted to get out of the drug-infested neighborhood would go so far as to hire someone to torch their buildings.\u201cThere were buildings burning on a nightly basis,\u201d said Lisa Kaplan, a founding member of the credit union.In early 1986, the credit union received its charter from the National Credit Union Administration and took its first deposits that May.The space on Avenue B was not a glamorous one. The floors of the credit union were covered with dirty rugs, and the lighting was dim. The windows were boarded, and the doors were sheets of plywood, with a padlock to secure them.But one day, soon after to moving to the neighborhood, Ms. Levy noticed that the name of the credit union had been spray-painted on the side of its building, reflecting the graffiti art that was beginning to emerge at that time.\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, that looks really cool,\u2019\u201d she recalled.Ms. Levy was working in food cooperatives in Brooklyn. Earlier, while attending the University of Pennsylvania, she had protested the Vietnam War and participated in hunger marches.Ms. Levy was interviewed by the board in the middle of June and was given the position in July despite having no background in finance. (Her acquaintance with Mr. Rosenthal through their mutual work at food banks apparently helped in her interview.)At the time, the credit union had only one other employee. Helen Scalia, a 22-year-old who had just graduated from New York University with a degree in marketing and an interest in community development finance.\u201cIt was a total start-up,\u201d Ms. Scalia said.Ms. Levy and Ms. Scalia split the labor evenly. Both women opened accounts, balanced the books and washed the floors, while Ms. Levy also spent much of her first year attending daily training sessions organized by the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions.\u201cHer fighting spirit was dedicated to the survival of this fragile community-based credit union,\u201d Ms. Scalia said of Ms. Levy. \u201cWe had to figure out how to open checking accounts, learn how to work with cash on site in a dangerous neighborhood and how to work with safe deposit boxes.\u201dThere have been struggles, as well as successes, over the years. During the financial crisis that began a decade ago, the credit union was hit with a rise in delinquencies, and some of its grant funding was lost. The staff took a 10 percent salary cut for a full year. The credit union instituted a hiring freeze. Some members lost jobs and homes.\u201cEven if our institutions aren\u2019t engaged in predatory lending, it doesn\u2019t mean that our communities aren\u2019t harmed by these broader problematic practices,\u201d said Deyanira Del Rio, chairwoman of the credit union\u2019s board of directors.Now, more than 30 years after its start, the credit union\u2019s next challenge is finding a chief executive to succeed Ms. Levy, who is retiring at the end of the month.\u201cWorking at a community-based, nonprofit financial institution comes with resource constraints and other challenges \u2014 though we also are fortunate to be in a strong financial position and to serve a broad field of membership that includes several underserved neighborhoods, low income people citywide, dozens of nonprofit and business partners, and low income housing cooperatives,\u201d Ms. Del Rio said.The search began in the fall, and the board hopes to have someone in place by the time that Ms. Levy leaves.The position requires an \"extraordinary combination of being very focused on the business aspect and yet being in tune with the political and social aspirations of that community,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said. \u201cThose things are not easy to find.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "R.N.C. Official Who Agreed to Pay Playboy Model $1.6 Million Resigns", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA major donor with close ties to the White House resigned on Friday as deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee after the revelation that he had agreed to pay $1.6 million to a former Playboy model who became pregnant during an affair.One of the women, a former Playboy model named Karen McDougal, sold the rights to her story for $150,000 to American Media Inc., the publisher of The National Enquirer. The other woman, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, received a payment of $130,000 that Mr. Cohen said came out of his own pocket.Both of the women were represented by Keith M. Davidson. Mr. Davidson also represented the woman in the agreement Mr. Cohen struck on behalf of Mr. Broidy, further establishing a pattern of collaboration between the lawyers in striking for-pay accommodations to silence women\u2019s allegations about powerful men.The deal involving Mr. Broidy was not known to be a subject of the federal investigation. It is unclear whether the F.B.I. has scrutinized Mr. Davidson, who is no longer representing the former Playboy model. Her new lawyer is Peter K. Stris, who also now represents Ms. McDougal.The model involved in the deal with Mr. Broidy is Shera Bechard. In a statement, Mr. Stris said she was \u201cdeeply distressed\u201d that the arrangement had been revealed. Though Mr. Stris did not say whether she was challenging the deal, he accused Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson of \u201cprofoundly disturbing and repeated collusion.\u201dIn his statement, Mr. Broidy apologized to his wife and family while acknowledging the affair. He said that \u201cshe alone decided that she did not want to continue with the pregnancy, and I offered to help her financially during this difficult period.\u201dHe lamented that the issue had become a national news story, which he attributed to the publicity surrounding the federal investigation of Mr. Cohen. He said that the lawyer \u201creached out to me after being contacted by this woman\u2019s attorney, Keith Davidson,\u201d and that he hired Mr. Cohen after Mr. Cohen \u201cinformed me about his prior relationship with Mr. Davidson.\u201dIn fact, the contract in Ms. Bechard\u2019s case included the same aliases that were used in the 2016 contract with Ms. Clifford \u2014 \u201cDavid Dennison\u201d and \u201cPeggy Peterson\u201d \u2014 according to a person familiar with it.A spokesman for Mr. Davidson said he could not confirm or deny the details of the agreement. In a statement, Mr. Davidson said, \u201cI\u2019ve always acted in my client\u2019s best interest, and appropriately in all matters.\u201dMr. Cohen declined to comment.Mr. Davidson\u2019s relationship with Mr. Cohen forms part of the basis for a lawsuit Ms. McDougal has filed seeking to get out of her contract with A.M.I.; The Enquirer never ran her story after buying it in August 2016.In the lawsuit, she contends that Mr. Cohen played a secret role in the negotiations for that deal, though he had no formal reason to be involved, given that the talks were between Ms. McDougal and the tabloid media company. The Times reported earlier this year that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson discussed the deal the day before Ms. McDougal signed the contract.Mr. Broidy was a major fund-raiser for former President George W. Bush, but he is particularly connected in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit.He got his start in business as an accountant and then as an investment manager for Glen Bell, the founder of Taco Bell. He was a vice chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, has met frequently with top White House officials and had an Oval Office meeting with the president in October, according to documents obtained by The Times.The documents show that Mr. Broidy has worked closely with George Nader, an adviser to the U.A.E. and a witness in the special counsel\u2019s investigation, to help steer Trump administration policy on numerous issues in the Middle East. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, is examining Mr. Nader\u2019s possible role in funneling Emirati money to finance Mr. Trump\u2019s political efforts. There is no indication that Mr. Mueller\u2019s team is looking into Mr. Broidy.In 2009, Mr. Broidy pleaded guilty to charges that he made nearly $1 million worth of illegal gifts to New York State officials in order to win an investment of $250 million from the state\u2019s public pension fund. Among the gifts were trips to Israel and Italy, payouts to officials\u2019 relatives and girlfriends and an investment in one relative\u2019s production of a low-budget movie called \u201cChooch.\u201dMaggie Haberman, David D.

{"Headline": "Tired of Your Cubicle? Try a Trade", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter Hannah Grey of Pittsburgh earned an undergraduate degree in interior design, she spent several years working for an architectural firm as a commercial interior designer. \u201cI enjoyed it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it was definitely more of a desk job.\u201dThen she participated in a workshop for architects and designers. \u201cThe basis of the program was to show us how the blueprints we design actually translate to real life,\u201d said Ms. Grey, 38. It kicked in her memories of growing up in Bedford, Mass., in a mansard-style house built in 1840 and learning from her father how to repair and restore woodwork.\u201cIt was a fun thing I did with him, working with my hands and helping him fix things,\u201d she said.Switching from a white-collar position to learning a trade is a path that is getting more traction these days. \u201cI have met a lot of people in the program who have college degrees, worked in office jobs and have decided to do this,\u201d Ms. Grey said.Mr. Nobers said that he was seeing more people who had graduated from college and started a white-collar career moving into the trades. \u201cThey got out and worked for a few years and determined they didn\u2019t like what they were doing, or realized there was no real upside future,\u201d he said.Most transitioning workers learn the trade through an apprenticeship. These programs generally run from three to five years, based on a 2,000-hour year. That breaks down to 10 percent in the classroom, or 200 hours a year, where apprentices learn specific trade skills along with local building codes, blueprint reading, mathematics and more. The bulk of their time, 1,800 hours, is on the job, Mr. Nobers said.\u201cThese manufacturing apprenticeships are no longer blue-collar work,\u201d Mr. Kamm said, \u201cbut require highly technically advanced skills that include a great command of mathematics, physics, hydraulics, robotics and information technology.\u201dBy 2025, nearly three and a half million manufacturing jobs will likely need to be filled and the skills gap is expected to result in two million of those jobs going unfilled, according to the analysis. Factors contributing to the gap: baby boomer retirements and economic expansion.There is not a lot of hard data to suggest a big shift from white-collar workers into blue-collar jobs, but there is a strong push to recruit them.\u201cIf you talk to manufacturers, they will tell you they are working hard to change the image of manufacturing jobs from dirty, dangerous jobs to being quasi-white collar,\u201d said Paul Osterman, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-director of the M.I.T. Sloan Institute for Work and Employment Research. \u201cAnd today many of these workers need to be skilled with computers and statistical quality control processes. In some sense, manufacturing looks a lot more white-collar-ish than it used to.\u201dAnthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, said there was not a clear pathway to go from white collar to blue collar. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have some transferability between the skills you did in one job that transfer to the next job,\u201d Mr. Carnevale said. \u201cFor most people, there is very little transfer between white-collar work, and say, plumbing. There is some transferability, but it\u2019s rare.\u201dScott Lacerra, 37, of Rockford, Ill., is another rare one. He has a bachelor of science degree from Drake University, where he majored in finance. After college he worked as a credit analyst, but he said he was miserable crunching numbers on a spreadsheet all day and sitting in a cubicle.Three and a half years ago, he walked into a local manufacturing shop looking for new opportunities.Mr. Lacerra started as a part-time operator running a computer numeric controlled heavy machine. Soon he was driving a fork lift, making steel deliveries and training apprentices. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any experience, but I showed up every day and after a couple of weeks, I realized I really enjoyed it,\u201d he said.In May, he will complete his apprenticeship and be awarded a journeyman certificate as a C.N.C. precision machinist. \u201cWe pay for the classes and the books, which run $650 a class for 10 classes,\u201d said Ed Schroeder, the owner of RG Manufacturing and Machining. \u201cHe already had a college education, and people who have that can see the value in it and of striving to do more.\u201dMs. Grey said that as a college graduate and someone who had a job at an architecture firm, she was now very proud to tell people that this is what a woman in construction looks like. \u201cIt\u2019s not Bob the Builder,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

How about you?The strike really was classic Trump: A show of force mainly for the sake of show, without any strategy behind it. Iran has entrenched itself in Syria alongside Russia, while Israel is quietly preparing for war on its northern front. The administration looks likely to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal next month, but little thought seems to have been given to what comes after. In all, just another reminder that the Trump disaster is global.Now, let\u2019s be cowards and talk about domestic issues. Can we start with Paul Ryan? You wrote a wonderful column about what a weenie he\u2019s being by bailing out at this crucial moment. But I think we still disagree about his overall career.

Seems to be a pattern.I agree that if Ryan had control of \u2026 the world \u2026 he would pass a balanced budget with low taxes and slashed entitlements. But the reason he can\u2019t do that isn\u2019t just the Democrats. It\u2019s all his own party members, who are well aware their constituents would go bonkers if they tried to cut Social Security or Medicare. Pretending that\u2019s going to happen is just faking.It would probably be good for our politics in general if we just owned up to the fact that we aren\u2019t going to get our fiscal virginity back and have a real argument about spending priorities rather than a fake one about budgetary virtue. We\u2019re not going to pay down the debt in our lifetimes. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have a thriving economy to make sure we\u2019re able to finance it.So that\u2019s my pro-Comey thought. On the other hand, I came of age during the J. Edgar Hoover period, when the idea of a we-rule-the-world F.B.I. was very scary. And Comey is a self-centric dude who is not the ideal person to run an agency that has so much power.My third thought is that whenever I mull the Clinton-Comey story, I return to the fact that Anthony Weiner changed the course of American history. Yipes.I was never a Comey fan: I wrote a long editorial for The Wall Street Journal opposing his nomination as F.B.I. director back when Barack Obama appointed him in 2013. Comey\u2019s behavior in 2016 was a long series of legal misjudgments and political blunders that wound up costing Hillary Clinton the election.That said, I fear that Comey is damaging himself \u2014 and the credible case he makes against the president \u2014 by putting his obvious distaste for Trump into the service of selling his book. It allows Trump and his defenders to paint Comey as disgruntled and self-serving. If Trump is a pig, Comey\u2019s a prig. I wonder who comes out looking better to most Americans in that particular contest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finland Has Second Thoughts About Giving Free Money to Jobless People", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 For more than a year, Finland has been testing the proposition that the best way to lift economic fortunes may be the simplest: Hand out money without rules or restrictions on how people use it.Now, the experiment is ending. The Finnish government has opted not to continue financing it past this year, a reflection of public discomfort with the idea of dispensing government largess free of requirements that its recipients seek work.Finland has actually reversed course on that front this year, adopting rules that threaten to cut benefits for jobless people unless they actively look for work or engage in job training.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that it will end like this,\u201d said Olli Kangas, who oversees research at Kela, a Finnish government agency that administers many social welfare programs and has played a leading role in the basic-income experiment. \u201cThe government has chosen to try a totally different path. Basic income is unconditional. Now, they are pursuing conditionality.\u201dIn much of the world, the concept of basic income retains appeal as a potential way to more justly spread the bounty of global capitalism while cushioning workers against the threat of robots and artificial intelligence taking their jobs.But the Finnish government\u2019s decision to halt the experiment at the end of 2018 highlights a challenge to basic income\u2019s very conception. Many people in Finland \u2014 and in other lands \u2014 chafe at the idea of handing out cash without requiring that people work.\u201cThere is a problem with young people lacking secondary education, and reports of those guys not seeking work,\u201d said Heikki Hiilamo, a professor of social policy at the University of Helsinki. \u201cThere is a fear that with basic income they would just stay at home and play computer games.\u201dFor centuries, thinkers across the ideological spectrum have embraced the notion of basic income. It has gained favor with the social philosopher Thomas More, the laissez faire economist Milton Friedman and the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., an unusual diversity of support that has enhanced the appeal of the idea as a modern-day solution to economic anxiety in much of the world.Silicon Valley technologists have suggested that basic income could enable humanity to exploit the labor-saving promise of robots absent the fear of mass joblessness.Labor advocates have focused on basic income as a means of increasing bargaining power among workers, limiting the pressure for people to accept poverty wages at dead-end jobs.Other people have advanced basic income as a way of enabling parents to spend more time with their children.Finland\u2019s goals have been modest and pragmatic. The government hoped that basic income would send more people into the job market to revive a weak economy.Under Finland\u2019s traditional unemployment program, those lacking jobs are effectively discouraged from accepting temporary positions or starting businesses, because extra income risks the loss of their benefits.The basic income trial, which started at the beginning of 2017 and will continue until the end of this year, has given monthly stipends of 560 euros ($685) to a random sample of 2,000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58. Recipients have been free to do as they wished \u2014 create start-ups, pursue alternate jobs, take classes \u2014 secure in the knowledge that the stipends would continue regardless.The Finnish government was keen to see what people would do under such circumstances. The data is expected to be released next year, giving academics a chance to analyze what has come of the experiment.In the meantime, Finland has already moved on to consider a broader revamping of its social service programs. It is studying a new form of social welfare policy now in effect in Britain: so-called universal credit, which rolls existing government aid programs into one monthly lump sum payment.\u201cThe social security system is fragmented and has a lot of bureaucracy,\u201d said Liisa Heinamaki,who is overseeing a project exploring ways to reorganize that system. \u201cDiscussion about basic income is not over, but it is a part of the larger discussion now.\u201dIn Britain, the shift to universal credit has poor people reeling, depriving many of them of government support while their cases shift from the old system. Benefits have increased for some people, but many recipients have wound up with less.In Finland, where the social safety net is famously generous, a structure like Britain\u2019s could yield the very thing basic income is supposed to deliver: a guarantee that every member of society can be assured of sustenance and shelter.This may be the main reason that basic income has lost momentum in Finland: It is effectively redundant.Health care is furnished by the state. University education is free. Jobless people draw generous unemployment benefits and have access to some of the most effective training programs on earth.\u201cIn a sense,\u201d said Mr. Hiilamo, the social policy professor, \u201cFinland already has basic income.\u201dMari-Leena Kuosa contributed reporting from Helsinki.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Pakistani News Channel Is Forced Off Air, and Eyes Are on the Military", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan\u2019s largest television network says it has been forced off the air by cable operators in most parts of the country, in a move widely seen as being forced by the military as it flexes its authority over civilian institutions.\u201cWe are off the air in 80 percent of the country,\u201d Mir Ibrahim Rahman, the chief executive of the network, Geo, said in an interview Thursday.In the first week of March, Geo News was shut down in cantonment areas across the country and residential neighborhoods that are administered by the military. Then, this month, all Geo channels \u2014 including news, entertainment and sports channels \u2014 started being blocked across the country by cable operators. The network\u2019s channel assignment on the cable distribution network has also been lowered.The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority has insisted that it is not behind the move, and put out a notice for cable operators not to disrupt Geo\u2019s transmissions.Geo officials took pains not to publicly blame the military, and the military did not respond to requests for comment about whether it was punishing the network. Nonetheless, the action against Geo is being seen as an unmistakable message from the country\u2019s generals that they would accept no negative reporting.\u201cThe arbitrary suspension of Geo TV on cable TV is a direct assault on Pakistan\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed right to access information,\u201d Steven Butler, the committee\u2019s Asia program coordinator, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that the authorities are either unable to find or too frightened to name those powerful enough to orchestrate the blocking of the news distribution.\u201dThe censorship has sent a chill through the country\u2019s news media networks, most of which have given scant coverage to Geo\u2019s suspension.A senior official of another television news network based in Karachi said his channel was backing off from any coverage of Geo\u2019s blockage. \u201cThe channels are falling in line to avoid a similar fate,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns.In Karachi, the country\u2019s commercial hub and center of the media industry, attempts to tune into Geo are met with a screen warning reading \u201cYou are not authorized to watch this channel,\u201d even though the network is not a premium offering.The action against Geo is coming at a time of increased tension between the military and the civilian government, led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s political party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz.Mr. Sharif was ousted from power last year in a controversial verdict by the Supreme Court, and he and his children are on trial over corruption charges in a special court.Mr. Sharif denies any financial wrongdoing and has led a forceful public campaign against his ouster, accusing the military and the judiciary of being in cahoots to have him removed from office. Both the military and judiciary deny the accusations.A verdict in the case is expected in the next few weeks, and a conviction \u2014 which is also expected \u2014 would surely lead to more political chaos, and to more public accusations that the military is pressing to have the Sharifs jailed.Geo News, which is owned by Jang Group and considered to be the most influential and watched news network, has been sympathetic to Mr. Sharif and critical of his chief political rival, Imran Khan.The military has been uneasy with Geo\u2019s editorial line in the past, as well. In 2014, the channel\u2019s license was temporarily suspended after unknown gunmen attacked one of its popular talk show hosts, Hamid Mir, and his relatives accused the military\u2019s spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, or ISI, of being behind the assault. The military has also spurned the channel\u2019s campaign to have friendlier ties with India some years ago.Saqib Nisar, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, expressed disapproval of the blockage of Geo\u2019s transmission during a court hearing Wednesday in a separate case dealing with media\u2019s code of conduct. \u201cExcept God, no one on Earth can block transmission of Geo channels unlawfully,\u201d the chief justice was quoted as saying after being informed that most of Geo\u2019s transmission was suspended.But the chief justice has also questioned the high placement of Geo on the distribution lists and objected to Geo getting the highest number of government advertisements from the governing political party.Mr. Rahman, the network\u2019s chief executive, said that hopes of any legal reprieve seem dim.\u201cWe are going to the Supreme Court,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have been told not to expect justice.\u201dMeher Ahmad contributed reporting from Karachi, Pakistan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the F.B.I. Raid Is Perilous for Michael Cohen \u2014 and Trump", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter a year of almost weekly revelations about Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, even indictments and guilty pleas of campaign officials have grown familiar. It\u2019s not that the special counsel, Mr. Mueller, is crying wolf; it\u2019s that we\u2019ve gotten used to real wolves. Only truly startling developments engage a lot of us.The F.B.I. search of the office, home and hotel room of Mr. Trump\u2019s attorney Michael Cohen is such a development. It\u2019s historic, even in the lofty context of a special counsel investigation of the president.This is what we know, in part from Mr. Cohen\u2019s attorney: The United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, acting on a referral from Mr. Mueller, sought and obtained search warrants for Mr. Cohen\u2019s law office, home and hotel room, seeking evidence related at least in part to his payment of $130,000 in hush money to the adult actress Stephanie Clifford, who goes by her stage name, Stormy Daniels. There are reports that the warrant sought evidence of bank fraud and campaign finance violations, which is consistent with an investigation into allegations that the Daniels payment was illegally sourced or disguised. (For example, routing a payment through a shell company to hide the fact that the money came from the Trump campaign \u2014 if that is what happened \u2014 would probably violate federal money-laundering laws.)What does this tell us? First, it reflects that numerous officials \u2014 not just Mr. Mueller \u2014 concluded that there was probable cause to believe that Mr. Cohen\u2019s law office, home and hotel room contained evidence of a federal crime. A search warrant for a lawyer\u2019s office implicates the attorney-client privilege and core constitutional rights, so the Department of Justice requires unusual levels of approval to seek one. Prosecutors must seek the approval of the United States attorney of the district \u2014 in this case the office of Geoffrey Berman, the interim United States attorney appointed by President Trump.Prosecutors must also consult with the criminal division of the Justice Department in Washington. Finally, prosecutors must convince a United States magistrate judge that there\u2019s probable cause to support the search. Faced with a warrant application destined for immediate worldwide publicity, the judge surely took unusual pains to examine it. This search was not the result of Mr. Mueller or his staff \u201cgoing rogue.\u201dSecond, the search demonstrates that federal prosecutors and supervisors in the Justice Department concluded that Mr. Cohen could not be trusted to preserve and turn over documents voluntarily. The same regulations that require prosecutors to seek high-level approval for a warrant to search a law office also instruct them to use the least intrusive means to obtain evidence from a lawyer, and to consider requesting voluntary cooperation or serving a subpoena. Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer has loudly protested that he had been cooperating. This search warrant means that prosecutors \u2014 including the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the criminal division at the Justice Department \u2014 believed that Mr. Cohen could not be trusted to respond fully to a subpoena or might destroy documents.Third, the search suggests that prosecutors most likely believe that Mr. Cohen\u2019s clients used his legal services for the purpose of engaging in crime or fraud. Attorney-client communications are privileged, which is why it\u2019s so unusual and difficult for prosecutors to get approval to search a law office. Justice Department regulations require federal prosecutors to set up a system to have a separate group \u2014 a so-called dirty team \u2014 review the files and separate out attorney-client communications so that the investigators and prosecutors won\u2019t see anything protected by the privilege.But if a client is using a lawyer\u2019s services for the purpose of engaging in crime or fraud, there is no privilege. The very aggressive search of Mr. Cohen\u2019s office for attorney-client files suggests that the prosecutors believe they can convince a judge that communications between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen fall under the crime-fraud exception. If you think they can\u2019t pull that off, think again \u2014 they\u2019ve already done it once: Mr. Mueller persuaded a judge to apply the exception to compel testimony from Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyer, arguing successfully that he engaged her services in order to commit fraud.A federal criminal defense lawyer\u2019s favorite advice, delivered with varying degrees of diplomacy and accompanying obscenities, is \u201cshut up.\u201d Mr. Cohen would not be the first person to ignore such advice, nor the first person to talk himself into trouble. Many of the people Mr. Mueller has snared to date have fallen into that category, finding themselves charged for lying to the investigative team.But consider this: The Stormy Daniels payout may be outside the scope of the Russia investigation, but it\u2019s possible that Mr. Cohen\u2019s records are full of materials that are squarely within that scope. And the law is clear: If investigators executing a lawful warrant seize evidence of additional crimes, they may use that evidence. Thus Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, with their catastrophically clumsy handling of the Daniels affair, may have handed Mr. Mueller devastating evidence.It\u2019s easy to conclude that after so many bombshells, this is just another overfrantic news cycle. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s highly dangerous, and not just for Mr. Cohen. It\u2019s perilous for the president, whose personal lawyer now may face a choice between going down fighting alone or saving his own skin by giving the wolves what they want.Ken White is a criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor at Brown White & Osborn LLP in Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Albany Balance of Power at Stake, 2 Women Vie for Senate Seat", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere have been millions of dollars in campaign spending. Churlish television ads. Allegations of ignoring sexual misconduct complaints.The deal gave the Democrats a chance to sweep the Legislature and governor\u2019s office. There was just one hitch: two Senate seats that had previously been occupied by Democrats will be decided on Tuesday in special elections.With such high stakes, the Democratic challenger, Shelley B. Mayer, an assemblywoman from Yonkers, is now engaged in a heated clash with Julie Killian, a moderate Republican and former councilwoman and deputy mayor in the City of Rye.In a county where Democrats outnumber Republicans by two-to-one, the presidency of Donald J. Trump has loomed large in the race. Ms. Mayer\u2019s campaign is running ads in which Ms. Killian is made to look like a Trump clone. In an interview, Ms. Killian declined to address Mr. Trump\u2019s record or rhetoric, saying she had been too focused on her race to follow the news out of Washington.\u201cThe perspective I want to bring to Albany is that of a mother, chemical engineer, finance person and community advocate involved in substance abuse and mental health issues,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s my on-the-ground experience that has shaped my views on the issues.\u201dA mother of five, Ms. Killian, 57, studied engineering in college and, after earning a master\u2019s in business, worked in finance. In 2012, she created a coalition to fight the opioid epidemic, which claimed the lives of several young people in Rye in recent years alone.At a time of national reckoning for women who were victims of sexual abuse, Ms. Killian\u2019s campaign has sought to show that Ms. Mayer dropped the ball in addressing sexual misconduct complaints when, before running for the Assembly, she served as legal counsel to the Senate Democrats.In recent debates, Ms. Mayer, 64, acknowledged that she met with one of the women, and learned about the other incident through the woman\u2019s boyfriend. She followed the protocol in place at the time, which was to refer allegations to the secretary of the Senate, a political appointee.\u201cIn both cases, I went to the secretary of the Senate and I made the case that they need to do more,\u201d she said in a debate held in the studios of WRNN-TV on Tuesday. \u201cThey failed to do so. \u201dIn an interview, Ms. Mayer said that the Assembly has a rule that requires mandatory reporting of any allegation of sexual misconduct to an outside law firm. \u201cI believe the policy in the Senate was very flawed then, and the Senate Republicans just adopted it again,\u201d she said.Ms. Killian has nonetheless seized on the report in an effort to cast doubt on Ms. Mayer\u2019s feminist credentials. \u201cShe\u2019s no champion of women,\u201d Ms. Killian said. \u201cShe had the opportunity to help them. She was the most senior woman in the Senate Democrats at the time.\u201dSome newly minted activists are not buying the portrayal. \u201cThere are two females in this race, but only one is pro-woman,\u201d said Jenny Geer, who leads a progressive group called Blue Blast in Larchmont and Mamaroneck and who has canvassed for Ms. Mayer. \u201cI think it\u2019s convenient for Julie Killian to piggyback on the #MeToo movement and exploit it.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Mayer, who has championed legislation on gun safety, voting rights and redressing sexual abuse, expressed skepticism of Ms. Killian\u2019s self-proclaimed centrist politics, saying she was trying to appeal to the county\u2019s leftward tilt in the age of Trump. \u201cI think she has become a moderate now,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has not disavowed this president or anything he has done.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s crucial for us in Westchester,\u201d said Douglas A.

{"Headline": "Kushner Partner in 666 Fifth Ave. Says It Has Deal to Sell", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Kushners\u2019 partner, the publicly traded Vornado Realty Trust, has indicated for months that it was interested in selling its stake in the building, and on Friday, Steven Roth, Vornado\u2019s chairman, said in the filing that it had reached a handshake deal \u201cto sell our interest to our partner.\u201dThe Kushners have attracted enormous public attention because of their connection to President Trump. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, was chief executive of the company until he joined the White House last year as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s key advisers.The Kushners have spent the last three years on a worldwide hunt for a new partner and financing to build either a new super-tower designed by the architect Zaha Hadid on the site of 666 Fifth Avenue, near Rockefeller Center, or to renovate and reposition the 41-story, aluminum-clad tower as a first-class building.Mr. Kushner\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, has scrambled to find partners to bail out its investment in the building, which also serves as the headquarters of Kushner Companies. The company has a $1.4 billion mortgage on the building that is due in 10 months. Real estate analysts doubt that the office space is worth that much, making a traditional refinancing of the building problematic.Charles Kushner also sought a $500 million investment from the former prime minister of Qatar, according to The Intercept, the online news site. That entreaty was also unsuccessful.The negotiations have drawn scrutiny because Jared Kushner\u2019s White House responsibilities involve both China and the Middle East.It is unclear if the announcement from Vornado means the Kushners have found a new partner, or who might be providing the financing for such a deal.Vornado declined further comment through a spokeswoman. A spokeswoman for Kushner Companies said Charles Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, was unavailable to comment because he was observing the Sabbath.The Kushners made a huge splash in 2007 when they bought 666 Fifth for $1.8 billion, setting a record price for an office tower. Before then, Mr. Kushner was known mainly as a developer of garden apartments in New Jersey, where he lived, and a major Democratic Party contributor.The Fifth Avenue building was meant to signal a significant change in direction for the Kushners, who moved into Manhattan, installed the family headquarters on the building\u2019s 15th floor and went on a real estate shopping spree that has left them with properties in Brooklyn, Jersey City and Maryland.But 666 Fifth was bought mostly with borrowed money. To pay off some of the debt, the Kushners sold the building\u2019s most valuable asset, the retail space, to Carlyle Group and Crown Acquisitions for $525 million.The family had expected to boost rents in the building. But as the 2008 recession set in, the building lost some of its largest tenants and the financial bleeding started. Fearing a possible default, its lender appointed a \u201cspecial servicer\u201d to oversee the building.In 2011, the Kushners sought to restructure their debt. Vornado bought a 49.5 percent interest in the building\u2019s office space and agreed to invest up to $80 million and take responsibility for a portion of the mortgage. The mortgage was divided into a $1.1 billion note and a $115 million secondary loan.But Vornado imposed stiff terms. It was getting 11 percent interest on money it actually invested in the building, and a 3 percent return on the remaining money, if any, according to a financial report from Trepp, a company that tracks real estate debt.The mortgage has swelled to $1.4 billion with accrued interest. The partners have been forced to cover shortfalls on the mortgage payments. And Vornado subsequently bought much of the retail space along Fifth Avenue from Crown and Carlyle for $707 million, except for a portion owned by Zara, the Spanish clothing chain. Vornado is expected to hang onto the retail space.In the filing Mr. Roth said the price Vornado was receiving would repay the company\u2019s investment: \u201cThe existing loan will be repaid including payment to us of the portion of the debt we hold.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australians Are the World\u2019s Biggest Gambling Losers, and Some Seek Action", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 In pockets of suburbia all across Australia, electronic gambling machines known as pokies await their many customers in pubs, hotels and sports clubs, as common a fixture as A.T.M.s in a shopping mall.As those figures swell, a public war is brewing between venue operators and people against gambling, with each trying to win the hearts and minds of state governments that rely on revenue from the machines.The electronic gaming machines are similar to slot machines seen in casinos elsewhere. Pokies aren\u2019t the only major form of gambling in Australia \u2014 casinos account for around 20 percent of gambling losses here \u2014 but they remain by far the most profitable for operators and most damaging for gamblers, gaming opponents say. And they permeate small towns with a prominence that is unmatched around the world.\u201cWhat makes Australia unique is that we\u2019ve allowed these machines to be embedded in our local communities,\u201d said Angela Rintoul, a research fellow at the Australian Gambling Research Center, a government-financed organization. \u201cWe haven\u2019t contained them just to casinos, where many jurisdictions in the world have.\u201dIn Australia, the pubs, clubs and hotels that house the machines usually resemble typical English pubs, replete with a bar and dining area but with the addition of a dedicated gaming room.\u201cOften, Australians don\u2019t realize it,\u201d she said of the ubiquity of the machines. \u201cIt\u2019s like being a fish in water.\u201dTheir operators are often prominent community entities: Woolworths, one of Australia\u2019s largest supermarket chains, is the biggest operator of pokies in the country, controlling about 12,000 machines through its majority stake in the Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group, a large company that encompasses bars, restaurants and wagering.Pokies are regulated on a state-by-state basis, instead of by the federal government. Western Australia is the only state or territory that bans the operation of pokies outside casinos.State budgets are increasingly made up of revenues from the machines, and legalized gambling, including from pokies, accounted for 7.7 percent of total tax revenues for Australian states and territories in 2016. In some parts of Australia, gamers can deposit 7,500 Australian dollars into a machine in one transaction, and can lose more than a thousand dollars per hour.\u201cThe people who can least afford to be losing large sums of money are losing the most,\u201d she said.Dr. Rintoul described the casino-like methods used by venues to maximize revenue, including rewarding patrons with free food and drinks, and hiring part-time models as wait staff.One gaming floor at a venue in Sunshine, the region Dr. Rintoul\u2019s study focused on, enjoyed a busy gaming floor one recent Wednesday night. Gamblers placed \u201cRESERVED\u201d signs under their machines of choice, which Dr. Rintoul said reflected how frequent gamblers come to relate to the machines: picking favorites, and believing that a particular one can get \u201chot\u201d or due for a win.A few hours later, in Balaclava, a suburb on the opposite side of Melbourne, patrons filled the gaming room at an Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group venue open until 6 a.m. A large Woolworths supermarket across the road keeps foot traffic in the area high.\u201cWe regularly had people tell us that they often ended up in a gambling venue even when they weren\u2019t intending to gamble when they left the house,\u201d Dr. Rintoul said.Gordon Cairns, the chairman of Woolworths, said that the company was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the findings and that the matter was being reviewed by external auditors.The Rev. Tim Costello, a spokesman for the Alliance for Gambling Reform, compares pro-gambling bodies to the National Rifle Association in the United States in their ability to sway politicians.Australians, he said, \u201csay Americans have a blind spot on guns.\u201d\u201cHere, we have a blind spot on pokies,\u201d he added.Pro-gambling groups frequently refer to Mr. Costello and other gambling opponents as \u201cprohibitionists,\u201d and are quick to point to support services they have developed for frequent gamers. They also argue that tighter regulation of pokies would lead to huge job losses at the venues that operate them.The groups have increasingly flexed their muscles in state elections. Anti-gambling candidates who ran in Tasmania and South Australia this year faced a barrage of negative advertising from pro-gambling bodies.In the run-up to the South Australian election, the Australian Hotels Association \u2014 which counts Australian Leisure and Hospitality as a member \u2014 donated to several opponents of Nick Xenophon, an independent whose new party, S.A.-BEST, vowed to cut in half the number of pokies per venue, and institute smaller betting limits. After positive early campaign polling, Mr. Xenophon and his party ultimately failed to win a single lower-house seat. It was the first election loss of Mr. Xenophon\u2019s 20-year career.\u201cHow much influence they wield, it\u2019s unhealthy,\u201d said Frank Pangello, Mr. Xenophon\u2019s media adviser in the recent election.\u201cThey bought an election in Tasmania, they bought one in South Australia,\u201d Mr. Pangello added. \u201cThey\u2019re like the N.R.A. in America: You take them on, they\u2019ll crush you.\u201dThe Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group declined to comment for this article or discuss whether it spent money on the Tasmanian and South Australian state elections.Mr. Costello said that with governments so dependent on gambling revenues, it may be difficult to pass tighter regulation of pokies.\u201cThe states are Dracula in charge of the blood bank,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Four Books Explore Various Aspects of Cities Past and Present", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistOf particular value is Dawson\u2019s discussion of the way climate change adaptation has been sabotaged, even hijacked, by real estate interests. Cities like Miami and New York continue to build luxury buildings on waterfront land that rising sea levels are expected to overrun. Even in developing world cities like Jakarta, projects billed as climate change mitigation, like constructing artificial barrier islands, are really gussied up luxury real estate boondoggles. The challenge is that these solutions are of necessity particular to each city, requiring a careful assessment of local assets, politics, etc. And some level of leadership capability must already be in place to pull them off. Still, with the federal government missing in action, there\u2019s little alternative to cities having to do the difficult and time-consuming work. Whether they can succeed in time to fend off populist insurgency remains an open question.This book by an editor at The New York Times uses a mostly intact block of mansions on the Upper West Side of New York as a window into some of the city\u2019s colorful history. The mansions, just around the corner from Wakin\u2019s boyhood (and current) home, mostly managed to dodge being demolished for apartment buildings. And generally they remain very beautiful.Much of the book\u2019s action is only tangentially related to the homes, however, especially the armored car heist that forms the book\u2019s spine. This caper actually took place in Brooklyn, with an Upper West Side mansion featuring as the site of a gruesome postrobbery amputation during a time when one of its seedier owners lived there.The history of New York is so vast that it lends itself to volumes of extreme length. This slim book is a welcome breezy complement to those encyclopedic accounts.Aaron M. Renn is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Universities Face Uncertainty as Brexit Looms", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Nicole Grobert is German, but she has spent almost all of her career in Britain, developing tiny nanomaterials and figuring out how to use them in everything from artificial bones to super-efficient batteries. Young scientists have an unusual degree of autonomy here, she has found, and European Union funds enabled her to build her own research group at the University of Oxford.These days, though, Dr. Grobert says her future at Oxford looks cloudier than it used to. Since Britain voted to quit the union, she has been getting calls from universities on the Continent, and farther abroad, gauging her interest in a new job. For now, she is staying put, but if grants grow scarce or immigration rules create new hassles, she is ready to move.\u201cI came with a suitcase,\u201d Dr. Grobert said. \u201cI can grab that suitcase and go.\u201dFor decades, the European Union has provided a collaborative, cross-border framework in which British universities have grown and thrived. European grants fund research like Dr. Grobert\u2019s and nurture the international back-and-forth crucial to scholarly work in disciplines from archaeology to economics.Free movement within the bloc has meant faculty from other European nations can live and work in Britain visa-free, and students from elsewhere in the union pay the same tuition as Britons.Now, university administrators are watching anxiously as negotiations between London and Brussels lurch along, with little clarity about how drastically ties may change after the divorce, known as Brexit, which is expected next March. Last month, negotiators announced a 21-month transition period, which may postpone the biggest shifts, but like everything about Brexit, it remains subject to change.\u201cThis is the single biggest challenge to our universities, in the same way it is the single biggest challenge to our nation, since the Second World War,\u201d said Alastair Buchan, Oxford\u2019s head of Brexit strategy.\u201cBeing in Europe has absolutely transformed the serious U.K. universities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat Brexit brings, in this existential way, is that we won\u2019t be able to access the talent, the scholars\u201d from neighboring countries.Dr. Buchan worries, too, that with financial support coming from one government, rather than a large bloc with well-established grant-making structures, future funding decisions may be driven by political imperatives rather than academic excellence.At University College London, where 50 million pounds, or about $70 million, in annual European grants make up 12 percent of the research budget, a Brexit mitigation group has met dozens of times since Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union, said Michael Arthur, the president and provost.Anxiety among European faculty members has eased a bit since Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government said in December that citizens from other European Union countries already in Britain would be able to register to stay. But the caveat that no one provision is final until the entire Brexit deal is done means nothing is for sure.University College London has sought to reassure its employees, but the uncertainty \u201changs over people,\u201d Dr. Arthur said. More than 90 percent of Europeans on staff have been contacted by overseas universities asking if they\u2019d consider a move, he said.Recruiting new researchers is proving even harder than holding on to existing ones. In one fellowship program for young researchers, about 30 of the 100 applications the university usually gets come from continental Europe. This year, there were none.That\u2019s before Brexit is finalized, \u201cso imagine what it might be like after,\u201d he said.Downstairs from Dr. Arthur\u2019s office, a group of European undergraduates in the corner of a noisy cafe said they\u2019d felt less welcome in Britain since the referendum. European Union students already enrolled here, and those arriving this autumn, will be able to finish their degrees without immigration constraints or tuition changes, and the transition arrangements may extend that further, but the rules for those coming later are unclear.Konrad Gradalski, who studies politics and East European affairs, said when he was finishing secondary school in Poland, Britain was a popular destination among his peers.\u201cPeople had dreams like U.C.L., Oxford, Cambridge,\u201d Mr. Gradalski said, referring to Britain\u2019s elite universities. \u201cMost of my friends no longer want to come here. They\u2019re scared of the racism,\u201d because of reports of anti-immigrant feeling among Britons. And, \u201cmore pragmatically, it\u2019s about finance,\u201d with worries fees will double or more to the level non-European Union citizens now pay, and Europeans will lose eligibility for loans.There are plenty of other options. Institutions in Canada and Australia, as well as continental European universities offering studies in English, are competing with big British and American names in the lucrative international higher education market.Now, \u201cwe realize there are other things than Cambridge and Oxford and Harvard,\u201d said Alix Dumoulin, a Parisian studying philosophy, politics and economics at University College London.Brexit could have a similar effect, putting off not just Europeans, but applicants from places like India, China and Malaysia, for whom \u201cthe general sense that Britain has become a less welcoming and hospitable place for foreigners is quite palpable,\u201d said James Wilsdon, a professor of research policy at the University of Sheffield.Saying it did not want to pre-empt negotiations, the Department of Education declined to comment on Brexit\u2019s effects on universities, but said European Union students make an important contribution \u201cand we want that to continue.\u201dSam Gyimah, the government\u2019s minister for universities and science, has said Britain will continue welcoming international researchers, and hopes to remain part of the European Union\u2019s main research program. \u201cBut we are not going to participate at any price,\u201d he said in February at a parliamentary meeting on Brexit and science.That underlines the reality that universities\u2019 concerns are just one piece of a much larger, fiendishly complex Brexit puzzle. So their priorities, even those government shares, \u201ccould be derailed by the bigger politics,\u201d said Sarah Main, executive director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, an advocacy group.The stakes are high. With deep ties to research-driven industries like tech, aerospace and pharmaceuticals, universities are an important economic engine. Their prestige, said Dr. Main, is also central to Britain\u2019s international reputation. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the U.K.\u2019s character.\u201dAt University College London, Ms. Dumoulin said that while Brexit might make it harder to stay in London after graduation, she will have lots of other choices. As a French citizen, she will still be able to live and work anywhere in Europe, unlike her British classmates, who are likely to lose that right.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m really lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not France who\u2019s exiting the E.U.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Message to Trump, Europe and Mexico Announce Trade Pact", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The European Union and Mexico on Saturday announced a major update to their existing free trade pact signed nearly two decades ago, a development that will allow almost all goods, including agricultural products, to move between Europe and Mexico duty-free.The deal, which has yet to be formally signed, is expected to increase trade in dairy, pork, services, digital goods and medicines between the economies. It will also give Mexico greater access to an advanced consumer market, as negotiations with the Trump administration over the modernization of the North American Free Trade Agreement still appear to be on uncertain ground.And it sends a message to Mr. Trump that some of America\u2019s closest trading partners are moving ahead with deals of their own \u2014 potentially leaving American exporters on the losing end in foreign markets.In its announcement, Mexico said the agreement would help modernize its existing commercial relationship.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said in a statement that \u201ctrade can and should be a win-win process and today\u2019s agreement shows just that.\u201d He added, \u201cWith this agreement, Mexico joins Canada, Japan and Singapore in the growing list of partners willing to work with the E.U. in defending open, fair and rules-based trade.\u201dThe European Union and Mexico said they had reached an agreement in principle on the most important elements of the agreement, with some technical details yet to be resolved. They are aiming to finalize it by year\u2019s end, after which it must be ratified by the European Parliament and the Mexican Senate.The original trade pact, signed in 1997, was relatively narrow, mainly eliminating tariffs on cars and machinery. The deal came into force in 2000 and was the first free trade pact between Europe and a Latin American country.Since then, the European Union has added 13 members, and the internet has dramatically changed global business. In May 2016, the countries started negotiations to update the pact. The revised deal adds in a variety of new rules governing agricultural goods, telecommunications, digital trade, intellectual property, climate change, anti-corruption measures, finance and energy.The deal is particularly notable for giving Mexico access to another wealthy market similar to the United States. The European Union is Mexico\u2019s second-biggest export market after the United States. Yet it is a distant second to the United States, where roughly 80 percent of Mexican exports go.\u201cThe E.U. has for at least 10 years been knocking on the door of Mexico to upgrade the trade agreement, and it is only very recently that they have come along,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly obvious that what has prompted them to change their minds is Donald Trump.\u201dBoth Europe and Mexico have actively been pushing forward with new trade deals amid a global resurgence of skepticism about the benefits of free trade.Mexico remains part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal that President Trump criticized and withdrew from on his fourth day in office. The remaining members, including Canada, Japan, Australia and Chile, signed a deal without the United States in March. Mexico is also negotiating with Argentina and Brazil, and has sought out potential alternatives to purchases of American grain and meat if Nafta were to fall apart.Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Milan Schreuer from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dance Like the Principal Is Watching", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorks in ProgressAt a recent rehearsal for their annual Kids Dance show, 23 middle schoolers at Ballet Tech were limbered up and ready to fly. A violin cried out as four boys strutted confidently across the studio floor, followed by a group of equally poised girls.\u201cJustin,\u201d yelled the ballet master Patrice Hemsworth. \u201cMove your arms. Good, good, good. Boys, you look beautiful. Go girls. Use your shoulders.\u201d She watched silently for another few beats and then, as the recorded music stopped, yelled out: \u201cThe feet were good but, the arms have to work with it. And you\u2019re rushing like crazy.\u201dMoments later, a 58-pound sixth grader named Roman Lattanzio \u2014 wearing a padded shirt to protect his small body from a series of backward rolls \u2014 came out for his solo, intense but joyful, and was eventually joined by three bigger boys who lifted him up and repeatedly swung him into the air.\u201cAt first it was scary,\u201d said Roman, after a water break. \u201cBut not anymore.\u201dTwice a week since October, the chosen few at Ballet Tech \u2014 \u201cthe NYC Public School for Dance,\u201d as it bills itself \u2014 have been rehearsing the Meshugana Dance and five other pieces for their upcoming June performance at the Joyce Theater. During repertory class in summer and early fall the children are taught the choreography. \u201cAnd we see who takes to it best, basically,\u201d said Ms. Hemsworth, who serves as director of the lower school. As the show gets closer, the rehearsal schedule intensifies. Dress, lighting and spacing rehearsals all take place the week before the show.Back on the floor, six understudies watched intently and practiced a few moves in the corner as the cast made its way in crisscrossing groups across the room. \u201cYou need to take gigantic steps out and then fly,\u201d yelled Ms. Hemsworth over the frantic klezmer music. \u201cFly through the air!\u201dEasier said than done.But by the end of the number, all 12 boys and 11 girls were jet\u00e9-ing across the studio like baby gazelles, seemingly pausing in midair and hovering just for a second as if weightless.In the next studio over, seven high school girls in black leotards and white toe shoes were rehearsing Pointing 2, a new dance that the school founder, Eliot Feld, had choreographed expressly for them. The piece was very modern and serious, as they slowly stepped their way across the room like a flock of graceful, long-legged egrets. Mr. Feld, a short man with a big personality, sat and watched quietly for a while. Then he leapt up and went over to talk to them.\u201cThe floor is your best friend or your worst enemy,\u201d Mr. Feld lectured them. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing you can\u2019t do without. You can pretend there\u2019s no gravity. But you need to embrace it. You can\u2019t swim without water. You can\u2019t dance without gravity.\u201dMr. Feld, a Brooklyn-born prodigy who danced the part of the prince in George Balanchine\u2019s original production of the Nutcracker and also appeared as Baby John in the film version of \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d founded his New Ballet School in 1978 (the precursor to Ballet Tech) for city kids who wouldn\u2019t normally get a chance to study ballet technique. The idea came to him one day on the subway, watching an energetic bunch of public school students on the train.In search of raw talent, recruiters from Ballet Tech visit over 200 public elementary schools across the city each year (though not Staten Island, since the commute would be too long). Ninety percent of the 181 students are chosen through those visits. The rest are picked through five open auditions throughout the school year.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for untapped potential,\u201d said Mr. Feld, 75. Students from Ballet Tech have gone on to dance at Alvin Ailey, Martha Graham and New York City Ballet.Middle school students study and dance all day in the Ballet Tech building on Broadway and 19th Street, but the high school students attend academic classes on 48th Street at Professional Performing Arts School until 1:18 and are then bused over for dance classes and rehearsals starting at 2 p.m.The Department of Education funds Ballet Tech\u2019s academics, though the dance program is primarily self-financed through contributions, grants and rent from other space it owns in the building at 890 Broadway, a former belt factory that was bought back in the 1980s before the neighborhood was hip. The building is also home to American Ballet Theater, the company Mr. Feld danced with before forming his own company. In late afternoon, a rush of girls with buns stream out of the building onto the street.Upstairs, the Pointing 2 girls were taking off their pointe shoes and getting ready to go home at 5 p.m. All of them have been dancing on pointe since sixth grade and have been working with Mr. Feld since middle school.\u201cThe fact that he choreographed this for us, I think it\u2019s a privilege,\u201d said Lucy Hu, a 12th grader.\u201cAt first I was kind of terrified of him,\u201d said Kyunghee Hori, another 12th grader. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to react.

{"Headline": "The Lawyer at the Side of de Blasio, Cuomo and Conor McGregor", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo months into his first term as mayor, Bill de Blasio offered resounding praise for the lawyer he worked with during his campaign to oppose the closing of a cherished Brooklyn hospital.\u201cIf there is magic in the law, Jim Walden has found it,\u201d the mayor said at a news conference, with Mr. Walden looking on.Four years later, Mr. Walden received more effusive words about the \u201cpowerful lawsuit\u201d he wrote on behalf of New York City Housing Authority tenants over their living conditions. This time, the praise came from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.\u201cJim Walden is only as strong as you,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, addressing the tenants.Partisan politics does not enter into his decision about whom to represent, he said, except to the extent that an understanding of the political and media playing fields can help in litigation efforts.\u201cI\u2019ve sued Cuomo; I\u2019ve sued Bloomberg; I\u2019ve sued Obama; I\u2019ve sued de Blasio,\u201d he said in an interview in the Lower Manhattan offices of Walden Macht & Haran, a boutique firm he started in 2015. \u201cAt some point in the near future, there may be some others added to that list who are in important positions to do harm to our country,\u201d he added, hinting that he had an immigration-related case in the works.Nonetheless, it seems clear that if Mr. de Blasio still believes Mr. Walden possesses some form of magic, it is now a darker art.Asked if Mr. de Blasio had a comment to offer on working with Mr. Walden, a spokesman for the mayor said, \u201cHe does not.\u201dMr. Walden, who donated to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign, then worked on the hospital-closing lawsuit with community groups and Mr. de Blasio, then the public advocate. Mr. Walden stood at his side in February 2014 when Mr. de Blasio, then the mayor and no longer a client, announced a settlement that would lead to the hospital\u2019s closing \u2014 angering some community members.\u201cI didn\u2019t believe that they had accomplished anything,\u201d said Roy Sloane, who was the president of the Cobble Hill Association at the time. He hired Mr. Walden to keep fighting after the settlement.The experience appears to have left Mr. Walden with the feeling that Mr. de Blasio had turned his back on some of his supporters. \u201cThe community felt, with a lot of justification, that we helped get him elected,\u201d said Mr. Walden, who lives nearby in Brooklyn Heights with his wife and three children.Not all his cases brought praise: He faced criticism for representing opponents of a bicycle lane along Prospect Park West in Brooklyn, an ultimately losing battle in which he argued for some powerful residents like Iris Weinshall, a former transportation commissioner and Senator Chuck Schumer\u2019s wife, against bike advocates.\u201cI would describe his personal politics in the same way that I would describe my own: It\u2019s not about whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat; it\u2019s about justice,\u201d said Mr. Mastro, a partner at Gibson Dunn who years ago hired Mr. Walden to the firm.A professed centrist and unaffiliated New York voter, Mr. Walden once explored running for office himself, meeting with political consultants to discuss a possible run for Brooklyn district attorney in 2009. He applied to become the United States attorney in the Eastern District under President Barack Obama and went so far as to share a cigar with the Rev. Al Sharpton as he sought to marshal support. (He was not selected for the job.)But the more he delved into the world of politics and fund-raising, the less he liked what he saw.\u201cI think that party politics and campaign finance problems almost compel bad candidates to run, and you\u2019ve seen it again and again, and once they get into office they show their true stripes \u2014 to have things their way, to get their way, to tamp down media and groups that don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very Stalin to me.\u201dHe added, \u201cThese people think we\u2019re stupid, and we\u2019re not.\u201dGrowing up, he watched his father struggle with alcoholism and eventually leave the family when Mr. Walden was in the ninth grade. Soon afterward, he found himself alone in dealing with a persistent bully at school \u2014 a childhood trauma that, in not-so-subtle ways, appears to have marked his legal career.The walls of his Lower Manhattan office are arrayed with Philadelphia Phillies memorabilia, an enduring marker of his upbringing in Levittown, Pa. Near his desk, Clint Eastwood stares out from a poster for his favorite film, \u201cThe Outlaw Josey Wales,\u201d a 1976 Western with the tagline \u201cAn Army of One.\u201d (He named one of his daughters Josey.)Hollywood has recently been more present in his life, if only by happenstance. Two of Mr. Walden\u2019s clients were the subjects of films at the Academy Awards this year: Grigory Rodchenkov, the Russian doctor who blew the whistle on his country\u2019s sports doping program and is the subject of the documentary \u201cIcarus,\u201d and Molly Bloom, the high-stakes poker-game organizer portrayed in the film \u201cMolly\u2019s Game.\u201d\u201cMy mom cries every time she sees him!\u201d Ms. Bloom said of Mr. Walden, whom she credits with keeping her out of prison. \u201cJim had done such a great job that even the prosecutors were advocating.

{"Headline": "How to Prepare a Post-Trump Renaissance in Diplomacy", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIt has been just over a year since American diplomacy entered a dark age, but the time for mourning has passed. The Trump White House\u2019s disdain for diplomacy persists, and that probably won\u2019t change. The new national security adviser, John Bolton, is no fan of diplomacy or diplomats.The best that the Foreign Service and those outside government in academia and at think tanks can do now is prepare wisely for the day after Mr. Trump leaves office to make sure that a renaissance follows the dark age.Many career diplomats in Washington have little to do these days. Some are between assignments because of the administration\u2019s failure to fill hundreds of State Department positions. Others have jobs but find themselves increasingly ignored or sidelined. The silver lining is, they now have time to turn inward and find solutions to their problems \u2014 both those created by Mr. Trump\u2019s neglect and those that have long plagued the department.One of the modern Foreign Service\u2019s biggest cultural challenges has been to organically produce true \u2014 even if informal \u2014 leaders within its ranks, regardless of their formal positions or titles. This is one reason nobody has emerged as the face of the current discontent with the administration\u2019s war on diplomacy. Even in normal times, career diplomats are conditioned to keep their heads down and not make much noise.The diplomats have to get over that. Abnormal times like these demand that grass-roots leaders take the initiative and mobilize their colleagues to create a path to a revival.Worthy ideas are more likely to emerge from the professional ranks \u2014 but not by the boss\u2019s order. Any major changes would have to be approved by the department\u2019s leadership, but in a normal administration, career diplomats are entrusted with some of those top posts, along with political appointees, and can exert outsize influence. That would be easier with compelling and innovative ideas. And it won\u2019t hurt to have powerful allies on Capitol Hill \u2014 after all, Congress is the only reason the State Department\u2019s budget didn\u2019t get slashed by the 30 percent the White House wanted.It would be crucial for such an effort to focus on the right issues, such as long-term abilities and the institutional culture, rather than on technical matters. For example, United States diplomacy has been more reactive than proactive for far too long. How do we fix that? The Foreign Service\u2019s culture relies too heavily on improvisation and not enough on strategic thinking. William J. Burns, a former deputy secretary of state, once told me that career diplomats \u201cperversely pride ourselves on our ability to adapt quickly to different circumstances, and we are not particularly systematic about how we go about doing that.\u201dAnother problem is the stupefying amount of administration that diplomats overseas have to contend with, instead of practicing diplomacy; many have taken to calling it \u201ce-hell.\u201d It gets in the way of the very reason they live in foreign countries \u2014 to understand and analyze developments in those countries and engage with their societies to better inform United States policies.What about the staffing gaps overseas every summer, when officers start new assignments at embassies and consulates weeks or even months after their predecessors have left? Even in the age of instant communication, this leads to a lack of continuity and a need for almost every new officer to reinvent the wheel.As for those outside government, internationally focused think tanks could play a role in producing research on trends and innovation in diplomatic practice. They have largely ignored that, saying their job is to study foreign policy, not what some call \u201cthe machinery\u201d that carries it out. The main reason for that is funding \u2014 it\u2019s much easier to find donors willing to finance policy research, which they hope will influence official government decisions. However, given the damage being done to the machinery, getting the process right will be as important as the policy substance on the other side of the dark age.So it\u2019s vital to keep alive the young generation\u2019s interest in and pursuit of diplomacy as a career. But it\u2019s difficult to find colleges and universities in the United States (and globally, for that matter) that teach diplomacy. Not international relations, but diplomatic practice. Even schools whose names include the words \u201cdiplomacy\u201d or \u201cforeign service\u201d offer no more than a couple of diplomacy-related courses, one of which is usually in diplomatic history.The longer the United States fails to exercise its diplomatic muscle, the worse its atrophy will get. Future Foreign Service leaders could emerge from its current ranks or among Americans still in college. Naturally, they will aspire to become ambassadors and assistant secretaries. But once at the top, despite the huge political demands of those jobs, they should find time to take care of their colleagues in the service. Dark age or renaissance, no one else will.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fearing Chaos, National Democrats Plunge Into Midterm Primary Fights", "Date": "2018-04-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFULLERTON, Calif. \u2014 The Democrats\u2019 message to Mai Khanh Tran was polite but unsparing. With half a dozen Democrats running for Congress in her Orange County district, they showed her a discouraging poll and argued that she could not win \u2014 and risked fracturing the party in the June primary election.Ms. Tran pointedly replied that she was \u201cthe only qualified woman, the only immigrant and the only physician in the race.\u201d\u201cI said to them, frankly, let the voters decide,\u201d recalled Ms. Tran, a pediatrician.The national Democratic Party was not chastened: On Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee took sides in that House race and backed Gil Cisneros, a Navy veteran and former Republican.With their forceful intervention in Orange County, national Democrats have lunged into an impatient new phase of the 2018 primary season \u2014 one in which they are clashing more openly with candidates and local political chieftains in their drive to assemble a slate of recruits for the midterms.In districts from Southern California to Little Rock, Ark., and upstate New York, the party has begun interceding to help the Democrats it sees as best equipped to battle Republicans in the fall.But in some areas, Democratic leaders have concluded it is worth enduring backlash to help a prized recruit or tame a chaotic primary field.House Majority PAC, a heavily financed Democratic group that spends millions in congressional elections, recently polled all four races and has been conducting digital surveys that simulate the complicated California ballot, according to people briefed on the group\u2019s strategy. The super PAC has run ads in California in the past when Democrats have faced disaster in primary season.Representative Judy Chu, a Los Angeles-area Democrat, said the open primaries had led Democrats to take unusual steps to prevent Republicans from dominating the first round of voting.\u201cThat would stop our goal of taking the House back,\u201d Ms. Chu said. \u201cWe have to have a viable candidate, and I think that if it does turn out to be a Democrat versus a Republican, the Democrat will win.\u201dMs. Chu said the campaign committee\u2019s endorsement of Mr. Cisneros was a signal to donors and volunteers that it was time to close ranks.But picking favorites is not easy for Democrats: Until mid-March, Southern California lawmakers were divided in the 39th District race between Mr. Cisneros, who is backed by Representative Linda T. S\u00e1nchez, an influential member of the Democratic leadership team, and Jay Chen, another Democrat who was endorsed by Ms. Chu. It was only after Mr. Chen opted against running, with a call for party unity, that Ms. Chu and other Democrats swung behind Mr. Cisneros.Ms. S\u00e1nchez said the glut of Democratic candidates remained concerning across California, and acknowledged having lobbied the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to back Mr. Cisneros. National leaders, Ms. S\u00e1nchez said, had \u201ca role to play in terms of trying to talk to nonviable candidates and urging them to be team players.\u201dMeredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the committee, said the group was taking action in California because voters \u201cdeserve to have a Democrat on the ballot in November.\u201d\u201cAny decision to get involved in these races is toward that goal and based on intelligence from the ground in California, extensive data and partnerships with as many local allies as possible,\u201d Ms. Kelly said.In the 39th District, Democrats went beyond prodding underdogs like Ms. Tran, 52, to stand down. Mr. Thorburn said the D.C.C.C. presented him with polling that suggested attacks on his finances and business record would be damaging in the general election \u2014 data Mr. Thorburn dismissed out of hand. He said the committee clearly indicated its preference for Mr. Cisneros.Mr. Thorburn, 74, is now the most unsettling rival for Mr. Cisneros and national Democrats, pairing a pointed ideological message with a personal fortune to spend on advertising. Deriding Mr. Cisneros as a \u201cwishy-washy\u201d newcomer to the party, Mr. Thorburn said he would strike back hard if the committee were to attack him, as it did Ms. Moser.\u201cI\u2019m much more of a fighter than the national party,\u201d Mr. Thorburn said, warning: \u201cIf they do something like they did in Texas, we would come back guns blazing.\u201dMr. Cisneros has won over important state groups, including the muscular California Labor Federation. But his campaign office, at a strip mall in Brea, about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles, showcases his national allies: One wall boasts an enormous sign from the gun-control group Giffords, which supports him, while another displays photographs of Mr. Cisneros with Barack and Michelle Obama.Mr. Cisneros, a soft-spoken 47-year-old who became a philanthropist and Democratic donor after winning the California lottery in 2010, said his unlikely biography was at the core of his message, along with issues like gun violence and health care. He said his views on those subjects had been consistent, though his party registration had changed. \u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d Mr. Cisneros said, \u201cit\u2019s always been about getting my story out.\u201dInterviews with voters in the Republican-held district revealed why the race is so promising and tumultuous for Democrats. A labyrinth of highways and shopping centers and residential developments, the district has shifted in recent years as its Latino and Asian-American communities have grown. But a dozen voters there said they were not following the race or remained undecided.At a shopping mall in Fullerton, a hospital worker named Lynn \u2014 who declined to give her surname because she did not want to be identified at work \u2014 said she wanted to repudiate Republicans but had not picked an alternative. An Asian-American woman in her 40s, she said she was alarmed by President Trump\u2019s environmental policies and what she described as an outpouring of overt bigotry.\u201cIt\u2019s not because I want a Democrat \u2014 I just don\u2019t want a Republican,\u201d she said. \u201cEver since you-know-who became president, people are really racist and it\u2019s really, really obvious.\u201dSome voters sounded unlikely to take their cues from national parties. Outside a Fullerton coffee shop where Mr. Jammal was greeting voters, Adam De Leon said he was suspicious of the candidates using personal wealth to sway the race. Mr. De Leon, 72, said he favored Mr. Jammal, 36, because of his government experience.\u201cWhat does it tell you when people spend millions of dollars to get into a position that pays maybe $140,000 a year?\u201d Mr. De Leon said, somewhat underestimating the $174,000 congressional salary. \u201cIt\u2019s all about power and connections.\u201dThe Republican field is in flux, too. Young Kim, a longtime aide to Mr. Royce, is the front-runner but has several candidates challenging her from the right. With Republicans in Washington focused on defending beleaguered incumbents, they have been less intent than Democrats on shaping open primaries.For Democrats, that project extends beyond California: On the same day the D.C.C.C. endorsed Mr. Cisneros, it also boosted candidates in New York and Arkansas who face contested primaries. In New York, the committee enlisted Juanita Perez Williams, a former candidate for mayor of Syracuse, to challenge Representative John Katko this month, though a lower-profile Democrat was already running with the support of local party leaders.That kind of big-footing may be trickier in California. Mr. Chen, the Democrat who opted out of the 39th District race, said the party still faces a \u201cprecarious situation\u201d there. He said he had decided against running after conducting a poll that showed him neck and neck with Mr. Cisneros and Mr. Thorburn \u2014 but with Democratic voters fragmented enough to create an all-Republican general election.He predicted none of the remaining Democrats would follow his lead and get out.\u201cIf you\u2019ve never been involved in the party before and you just ran because you want to run, then you don\u2019t really have those considerations,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThey are new to this. They don\u2019t have bridges to burn.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It did not escape Mr. Kaiser\u2019s notice that, being white, he received excellent medical attention from a white doctor, while the country\u2019s nonwhite population was chronically underserved by the health system, in part because few medical professionals were people of color.A decade later, after he had retired from the State Department, Mr. Kaiser and his wife, Joy, thought back on that experience and looked into the disparities.The Kaisers did something about the problem. In 1985 they founded Medical Education for South African Blacks, a nonprofit organization that provided financial and other support to students of color seeking health careers.Mr. Kaiser died on March 30 at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 94. His son Timothy said the cause was heart failure.By the time the Kaisers\u2019 organization disbanded in 2007 it had helped some 10,000 South Africans of color receive training as doctors, nurses, midwives and more.Herbert Kaiser was born on June 8, 1923, in Brooklyn. His father, Max, was a house painter, and his mother, the former Nettie Slavititski, was a caretaker.He attended Swarthmore on the G.I. Bill, graduating in 1949, the same year he married Joy Dana Sundgaard, a fellow student. He took a job with the State Department and was posted to Glasgow in 1950. Later in that decade he developed an expertise in Eastern European affairs, and his career included postings to Yugoslavia, Austria, Poland and Romania. He retired in 1983.Mr. Kaiser was fluent in a number of languages, which enabled him to understand the nuances at play in the politically and socially divided areas where he worked. He needed those skills when he and Joy set up their nonprofit.Scholarship money alone, though, wasn\u2019t the answer. The organization found that it also needed to provide other kinds of support for students, both during apartheid and after.Thus, accommodations were made for the program\u2019s students, like allowing them to repeat failed courses or to cut back on their course load if they were having academic trouble. A mentoring program was established.And Mesab responded to the AIDS crisis with a palliative care program that financed the training of professionals and community caregivers in treating those with the disease.In addition to his wife and his son Timothy, Mr. Kaiser is survived by another son, Paul; a daughter, Gail; and six grandchildren.The Kaisers\u2019 efforts, which wound down in 2007, drew praise from some of the leading figures in modern South African history, including President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. When, in 2013, the Kaisers published a book, \u201cAgainst the Odds: Health & Hope in South Africa \u2014 The Story of Medical Education for South African Blacks,\u201d the archbishop wrote the foreword.\u201cIf someone had told me in the 1980s that 10,000 blacks would have been trained as health professionals \u2014 doctors, dentists, nurses, etc. \u2014 in the space of 22 years, I would have recommended that they go and consult their psychiatrist,\u201d Archbishop Tutu wrote.\u201cAnd then to add to such an unlikely scenario the prediction that over 27 million U.S. dollars would be raised for this enterprise,\u201d he continued, \u201cwould have confirmed for me that someone was in desperate need of psychiatric treatment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How\u2019s That Tax Cut Working Out?", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistSo far, Donald Trump and his allies in Congress have achieved one and only one major legislative victory: passing a large tax cut, mainly aimed at corporations and business owners. The tax cut\u2019s proponents promised that it would lead to a dramatic acceleration of economic growth and produce big gains in wages; they hoped that it would also yield big political dividends for the midterm elections.Let\u2019s talk about the economics here.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]Furthermore, any short-term boost will probably be quickly squelched by the Federal Reserve, which believes that we\u2019re at full employment and which is gradually raising interest rates to keep the economy from overheating. You can argue that the Fed is wrong, but the case for easier monetary policy has nothing to do with the Trump tax cut.No, the case for a corporate tax cut is the claim that in the long run it will raise wages. How is that supposed to work?It never made sense to believe that corporations would immediately share their tax-cut bounty with workers, and they haven\u2019t. Any news organizations that let themselves be bamboozled by cherry-picked stories of firms announcing worker bonuses after the tax bill passed should be ashamed of their credulity.The real logic behind corporate tax cuts is that they\u2019re supposed to lead to higher investment. This investment, in turn, would gradually increase the stock of capital, simultaneously driving down the pretax rate of return on investment and pushing up wages.In short, the effects of the Trump tax cut are already looking like the effects of the Brownback tax cut in Kansas, the Bush tax cut and every other much-hyped tax cut of the past three decades: big talk, big promises, but no results aside from a swollen budget deficit.You might think that the G.O.P. would eventually learn something from this experience, realize that tax cuts aren\u2019t magical, and come up with some different ideas. But I guess it\u2019s difficult for a man to understand something when his campaign contributions depend on his not understanding it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Climate Lawsuits, Once Limited to the Coasts, Jump Inland", "Date": "2018-04-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil recently, communities suing fossil fuel companies over the costs of climate change have been located on the coasts: cities and counties in California, and New York City. But now, the litigation has jumped inland.Industry pressure has not deterred officials like Kathrin Sears, the supervisor for District 3 of Marin County, Calif., which brought one of the first suits. \u201cWe expected from the get-go that there would be strong pushback, and that this would be a fight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not intimidated by this stuff.\u201dAs for the newcomers, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to have company.\u201dThe new wave of cases relies on the nuisance doctrine at the state level, working from the theory that state common law has not been similarly displaced. The companies, understandably, have tried to get the cases moved to federal court, with mixed success.Daniel A. Zarrilli, New York City\u2019s chief resilience officer, rejected the industry\u2019s argument that local governments are being enticed into filing the suits by trial lawyers. \u201cThey\u2019re going to throw a lot of things at the wall and see what sticks,\u201d he said.Jerry Taylor, the group\u2019s president, said there was a conservative case for the suits. Rather than push for regulations, he said, it is better to deal with climate change in the courts, as a property rights issue.David Bookbinder, a litigator who is working on the case with Niskanen, said that the companies had performed extensive research into climate change while paying others to help disseminate climate misinformation. \u201cThey knew this was going to happen,\u201d he said of the companies, \u201cand our taxpayers did not.\u201d He added: \u201cSo why should we have to bear the burden of it?\u201dWhile the cases are generally considered long shots, legal underpinnings exist for the arguments, said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. But, he said, \u201cThe lawsuits are, without question, pushing the envelope of nuisance law and tort law.\u201dSerge Dedina, the mayor of Imperial Beach, Calif., who brought one of the first suits, said he expected more pressure to come from companies like Exxon. \u201cThey\u2019re really good at that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Exxon Mobil spent as much time cleaning up their operations as they do fighting people who are trying to protect the planet, we\u2019d be a lot better off.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Endangered Is American Democracy?", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistLevitsky and Ziblatt lay out a four-part test for identifying authoritarian leaders: rejecting democratic institutions, denying the legitimacy of political opponents, tolerating or encouraging violence and curtailing civil liberties. \u201cWith the exception of Richard Nixon, no major-party presidential candidate met even one of these four criteria over the last century,\u201d they note. \u201cDonald Trump met all of them.\u201dYet the authors show that he wasn\u2019t the first in his party to shatter democratic norms. They highlight Newt Gingrich\u2019s moves to impeach Bill Clinton and Mitch McConnell\u2019s blocking of President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. And they worry that even if Trump fails, what \u201cwas once considered unthinkable in American politics is becoming thinkable.\u201dFor \u201ca possible glimpse into America\u2019s future,\u201d Levitsky and Ziblatt point to North Carolina, where the Republican legislature has passed laws to curtail the voting power of African-Americans, ruthlessly gerrymandered the state and undermined the independence of the judiciary. What the authors call \u201cdemocracy without solid guardrails\u201d could also be called Authoritarianism 2.0.Van Reybrouck is a skilled polemicist, but his solutions to remedy \u201cdemocratic fatigue syndrome\u201d are na\u00efve and unfeasible. Echoing the ancient Greek practice of drawing lots, he suggests replacing the American House of Representatives with a random sample of citizens, like a jury pool. That seems like an utterly impractical way to govern nowadays and reflects the same demonization of political experience that led the country to favor a reality television star over a former secretary of state in 2016.Van Reybrouck fetishizes direct democracy, like citizens\u2019 councils, but ignores the way existing electoral institutions could be made more responsive to the popular will through reforms like proportional representation or nonpartisan redistricting. The solution to democratic fatigue syndrome is to make elections more democratic, not to get rid of them altogether.\u201cThe two greatest forces devaluing the value and power of an individual citizen\u2019s vote in America are gerrymandering and money,\u201d Califano says. In one telling anecdote, he recalls Johnson complaining about how demeaning it was to \u201cbeg for money from folks that all want something.\u201d Califano urged him to propose public financing for presidential and congressional campaigns. \u201cThe House will never go for it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere are about 100 members who run without any serious opposition. If there\u2019s public financing they\u2019ll all face serious opponents in running for re-election. Forget it.\u201dToday, Califano writes, there are 402 safe House seats, referring to House members who won by 10 points or more in 2016. It\u2019s hard to argue with his analysis, although his book often reads like a laundry list of problems \u2014 from an imperial presidency to a dysfunctional Congress to a polarized public \u2014 without a coherent narrative. What would Johnson think of Donald Trump? Califano doesn\u2019t say, but one can only imagine.Mounk\u2019s material is densely packed and he has a tendency to repeat himself, but his book provides important insights into the present political moment. He cites three reasons for the weakening of liberal democracy: the rise of social media, which is \u201cempowering once-marginal movements and politicians\u201d in ways good but often bad; an increase in economic inequality, which he calls \u201caffluence without growth\u201d; and a nativist backlash against an upsurge of immigration and ethnic diversity, which politicians like Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orban in Hungary have exploited.\u201cTo save democracy,\u201d Mounk writes, \u201cwe need \u2026 to unite citizens around a common conception of their nation; to give them real hope for their economic future; and to make them more resistant to the lies and the hate they encounter on social media each and every day.\u201d As his book shows, that\u2019s easier said than done.Ari Berman is a senior reporter at Mother Jones, a fellow at the Nation Institute and the author of \u201cGive Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michelle Wolf\u2019s Next Gig Is Hard Work: Making Washington Laugh", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "Ms. Wolf, a comedian from the world of late-night TV, is honing her set for the White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner and preparing a new Netflix series.Supported byA high jumper, Ms. Wolf recently explained, must leap over a bar raised to increasingly greater heights until she inevitably fails to clear it.\u201cYou could have the best jump of your career, and then you still end on a failure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, that was your best \u2014 but you could do better.\u2019\u201dThat nagging insecurity has gone hand in hand with the rapid accomplishments of Ms. Wolf, a 32-year-old stand-up who has contributed to \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d and \u201cThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah.\u201dThen on May 27, her new topical comedy series, \u201cThe Break With Michelle Wolf,\u201d will make its debut on Netflix.These are opportunities that Ms. Wolf sees as sources of both prestige and anxiety \u2014 the fruits of her hard work and obligations to make herself work even harder, while she waits for the bottom to drop out.\u201cI think I\u2019m a good joke writer,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m also very scared that the last joke I wrote is the last joke I\u2019ll ever write.\u201dOn a Friday afternoon earlier this month, Ms. Wolf was in her office at the Midtown Manhattan studio where \u201cThe Break\u201d is being produced. Stretched out on a velvet couch, she was explaining the sensibility that she is shooting for at the dinner and in her Netflix show.Ms. Wolf is no fan of President Trump\u2019s, and was relieved when it was announced that for the second year, he would not be attending the dinner.\u201cI thought, oh, thank God, I don\u2019t have to hear him eat,\u201d she said.Still, she said there was limited value in standing in front of a crowd and cracking a bunch of knee-jerk jokes about Mr. Trump.\u201cThe audience cheers, but that isn\u2019t comedy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rally.\u201dMs. Wolf said she was not interested in what she called \u201ccool-teacher comedy \u2014 we\u2019re going to learn and have fun at the same time.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to say what people want you to say,\u201d she added. \u201cYou want to say what people didn\u2019t know they wanted you to say.\u201dMs. Wolf, who grew up in Hershey, Pa., has been following her own muse since she quit her career in finance (where she\u2019d worked at banks like Bear Stearns and JPMorgan Chase) to take improv classes at Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and the Pit in New York.\u201cEventually people in improv were like, \u2018You\u2019re more of a stand-up,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wolf said. \u201cI think they were gently trying to tell me I was selfish.\u201dIn performance, Ms. Wolf can be her own harshest critic, then suddenly turn that scathing sensibility on her audience and its unexplored assumptions.But Ms. Wolf also laments the expectation that women must surrender their likability to attain power. \u201cIf you\u2019re in charge of things and you think you\u2019re a nice lady, no one else does,\u201d she says in the set. \u201cThere are whole email chains about how much you\u2019re not a nice lady.\u201dHer stand-up shows attracted the attention of producers at \u201cLate Night,\u201d where Mr. Meyers hired her when he became its host in 2014.\u201cShe\u2019s self-deprecating, yes, but very good at deprecating others,\u201d Mr. Meyers said. \u201cShe\u2019s either the meanest nice person I know or the nicest mean person I know.\u201dThough she was hired primarily to write comedy sketches and jokes for Mr. Meyers\u2019s monologue, Ms. Wolf often appeared on camera, performing her own stand-up and playing characters like a grown-up version of Little Orphan Annie.When \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d hired her away in 2016, Mr. Meyers said he did not begrudge her departure.\u201cHer whip-crack of a cackle was a fun thing to hear when my jokes were bombing,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish she\u2019d take more pleasure in my successes, but she really seems to enjoy when I fail.\u201dShe also worked relentlessly on her stand-up outside the show, performing as many as 15 or 20 sets a week, by her estimate, at clubs like the Comedy Cellar and Village Underground.Neal Brennan, the \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d co-creator who directed Ms. Wolf in \u201cNice Lady,\u201d invoked her history as an athlete to describe her work ethic.\u201cShe is competitive, without being competitive against specific people,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cShe is competitive against the track and the time. And she really pushes herself. I know some very hard-working people, and you\u2019re not going to outwork her.\u201dThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner has previously been hosted by late-night stars like Mr. Meyers, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, but its M.C.s can expect to come under intense scrutiny and have their monologues picked apart on a joke-by-joke basis.When Ms. Wolf was approached about the gig, she said she was ambivalent.\u201cIt\u2019s a weird time, if you\u2019ve noticed,\u201d she said with a laugh. That same day she sat herself down and wrote \u201ca ton of jokes,\u201d just to prove to herself that she could do it. The Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, she said, is \u201creally a homework assignment.\u201dHaving to prepare her set at the same time she is readying her Netflix show was \u201cnot the dream timeline,\u201d Ms. Wolf said, but the side-by-side assignments were helping her to focus.Ms. Wolf is just one of many \u201cDaily Show\u201d alums who are stepping out with new comedy programs. In addition to the many late-night shows already on broadcast and cable TV, HBO recently introduced \u201cWyatt Cenac\u2019s Problem Areas,\u201d and Netflix is preparing a weekly talk show starring Hasan Minhaj for later this year.Still, Ms. Wolf\u2019s peers and admirers feel that her voice is distinctive enough to break through.Watching Ms. Wolf perform, he said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re eating your vegetables. It never feels like you\u2019re patiently sitting through her ideology to get to the joke.\u201dHaving seen and appeared on every late-night show of the modern era, Mr. Rogen said, \u201cI\u2019m much more inclined to watch things that are not traditional talk shows, rather than a person on a super-glitzy stage in some theater that\u2019s been used for the last 250 years.\u201dAt her Manhattan office \u2014 whose previous occupants have included Jon Stewart, Mr. Colbert and Larry Wilmore \u2014 Ms. Wolf was getting ready to tape her first episodes of \u201cThe Break,\u201d which she said would mix stand-up monologues with comedy sketches.She was also trying to figure out how to strike the right balance between breaking the mold of late-night TV and carrying on its familiar traditions.A few days earlier, she had taken her first look at the set she will use on \u201cThe Break.\u201d Initially, Ms. Wolf had told her set designer that she did not want it to have the familiar element of a city skyline in the background. Nonetheless, the designer showed her two options: one with a skyline, and one without.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Foreign Money, G.O.P. Donor Pushed for Trump to Golf With Malaysian Premier", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut that did not stop a top Republican fund-raiser, Elliott Broidy, from seeking to use his White House ties to press for Mr. Trump to play a golf game with Mr. Najib, who had the authority over negotiations for a lucrative Malaysian contract with Mr. Broidy\u2019s private defense company, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.In addition to providing new details about Mr. Broidy\u2019s attempts to exploit his White House connections for personal gain, the documents also raise questions about whether Trump administration officials were aware of his efforts.Mr. Broidy also explored separate plans to force the exit from the United States of a Chinese billionaire and dissident, Guo Wengui, evidently to please Chinese allies in Malaysia while reaping payoffs from both the Chinese and, improbably, the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Broidy proposed working with George Nader, an adviser to the Emiratis who is cooperating in the special counsel investigation.In a statement, Mr. Broidy said, \u201cThis whole narrative is a fabrication driven by hackers who want to undermine me.\u201dThe results of Mr. Broidy\u2019s efforts on Mr. Guo\u2019s case are unclear. China has charged Mr. Guo with corruption, but he remains in New York, where he has become an outspoken critic of Chinese government self-dealing and is seeking asylum.Mr. Broidy\u2019s attempts to curry favor with Malaysia through the golf date, however, entailed more direct and insistent communications with the White House, illustrating the influence he hoped to use for the benefit of both Asian countries.\u201cI have done work in Malaysia over many years and know Prime Minister Najib Razak well,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote in an email to the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, dated Aug. 31, 2017, early in Mr. Kelly\u2019s tenure.Mr. Broidy had personally appealed to Mr. Trump in June for a one-on-one golf date with Mr. Najib during the prime minister\u2019s coming visit to Washington, and \u201cthe president told me he would be happy to play golf with the PM,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote in the email. The president\u2019s previous chief of staff, Reince Priebus, had confirmed the golf date to Mr. Broidy, but \u201cunfortunately, the golf game is not appearing on the schedule that has been provided through protocol to the PM,\u201d he wrote.\u201cI look forward to discussing this with you,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote to Mr. Kelly, thanking him for his assistance. A person close to Mr. Broidy said Mr. Kelly did not reply.For Mr. Trump, a golf date with Mr. Najib could have fueled criticism that the president is indifferent to the appearance of corruption. Mr. Najib is under investigation by prosecutors in both the United States and Malaysia on suspicion of embezzling from a state investment fund, the 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit seeking to seize $540 million in American assets purchased with money stolen from the fund.A person close to Mr. Broidy said the golf date never happened and his business discussions with Malaysia never passed the preliminary stage.The Chinese dissident, Mr. Guo, made a fortune in real estate and finance in China but fled in 2014 in anticipation of charges of corruption. He has said the allegations were fabricated by business and political opponents, and he has since styled himself as a whistle-blower exposing the corruption of the Chinese elite. He lives primarily in a 9,000-square-foot apartment overlooking Central Park that he bought three years ago for more than $67 million.Mr. Broidy wrote a draft memo dated May 6, 2017, to Mr. Nader, the Emirati adviser, laying out a complex proposal for both men to profit from an unusual three-way trade relying on their combined influence in Washington and Abu Dhabi, the capital of the U.A.E.Mr. Nader would encourage his patron, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, to ask the United States to hand over Mr. Guo in connection with a business dispute with the U.A.E.Mr. Broidy, meanwhile, would prod the Trump administration to comply with the extradition request from the U.A.E. while avoiding the appearance of turning a Chinese dissident over to China.The Emiratis might then agree to deliver Mr. Guo to China, Mr. Broidy wrote, because they believe Mr. Guo owes $3 billion to Emirati investment funds. In exchange, the Chinese might pay off that debt, Mr. Broidy wrote.\u201cChina would agree to pay\u201d Mr. Nader and himself, Mr. Broidy wrote, and \u201cAbu Dhabi would pay\u201d them as well.He and Mr. Nader \u201ccan assist members of the Trump administration, including President Trump, Mr. Kushner, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly, and National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, see the value of cooperating with Abu Dhabi in getting custody of Mr. Guo, which in effect helps China get one step closer to acquiring custody of Mr. Guo,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote.A person close to Mr. Broidy and familiar with the case said he did not send the email but still approached Mr. Nader in general terms about the proposal. In his statement, Mr. Broidy said: \u201cI have never had a strategy or plan regarding Mr. Guo nor was there any compensation given or even discussed. And, to be clear, at no time was I told by George Nader or anyone that anyone from U.A.E. had any interest whatsoever in Mr. Guo.\u201dMost of the documents appear in 20 pages of emails from Mr. Broidy\u2019s account that were provided to The Times by an anonymous group critical of his advocacy of foreign policies in the Middle East. Lawyers for Mr. Broidy have filed a lawsuit charging that hackers working for Qatar stole his emails in retaliation for his criticism of the country; Qatar has denied responsibility. The email to Mr. Kelly was provided by a different person.Mr. Broidy drafted another memorandum, dated May 21, 2017, to Mr. Sessions. In it, Mr. Broidy wrote that \u201cwhile conducting business in Malaysia\u201d he had learned of \u201ca potential opportunity for the U.S. and China to increase their law enforcement cooperation.\u201dA delegation from China was on its way to Washington four days later, Mr. Broidy wrote, and \u201cthe one request China will make\u201d is the extradition of Mr. Guo, \u201cwho China alleges has conspired with others who have been arrested and charged with violations of numerous criminal laws of China.\u201dA person close to Mr. Broidy said he never sent that memorandum, and a Justice Department spokeswoman said Mr. Sessions never received it. But as late as the end of 2017 Mr. Broidy was evidently seeking to encourage Mr. Guo\u2019s expulsion, in part by generating negative publicity about him. \u201cSlam him,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote in October to an associate seeking to promote negative articles about Mr. Guo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Former Top Wall Street Regulator Turns to the Blockchain", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Gary Gensler was one of the top financial regulators in the Obama administration, the finance chief for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and, before both of those jobs, a partner at Goldman Sachs.Now, like many other big names from business and government, he is plunging into the world of the blockchain, the data-tracking technology introduced by Bitcoin.Mr. Gensler, 60, has recently gone to work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he will write and teach about the potential he sees for blockchains to change the financial world.He will also use his position to warn about how many of the current projects in the world of virtual currencies, including some of the biggest, are likely to face a significant moment of reckoning with regulators.Mr. Gensler is set to say in a speech at M.I.T. on Monday that the second and third most widely used virtual currencies, Ether and Ripple, have most likely been issued and traded in violation of American securities regulations.\u201cThere is a strong case for both of them \u2014 but particularly Ripple \u2014 that they are noncompliant securities,\u201d he said in an interview. He believes Bitcoin, the original virtual currency, can remain exempt from securities regulations.Mr. Gensler will be one of the most influential voices to weigh in on a series of questions that are likely to shape the future of the nascent industry.But Mr. Gensler believes that better-known virtual currencies like Ether and Ripple should be in that conversation as well and should likely be categorized as securities, given the way they have been created and sold.\u201c2018 is going to be a very interesting time,\u201d Mr. Gensler said. \u201cOver 1,000 previously issued initial coin offerings, and over 100 exchanges that offer I.C.O.s, are going to need to sort out how to come into compliance with U.S. securities law.\u201dAll the outstanding Ether were worth around $65 billion at Sunday\u2019s price, while the Ripple tokens in the hands of investors are worth around $35 billion.If they are deemed to be securities, it could become illegal for Americans to trade them on most of the exchanges where they are now traded. That would make it harder to buy and sell them and depress their prices.Mr. Gensler developed a reputation for standing up to powerful financial interests when he was the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Before he got into office, some worried that his background at Goldman Sachs would make him hesitant to take on the big banks. But as the chairman of the commission he became one of the most aggressive watchdogs in the effort to rein in Wall Street after the financial crisis.Joi Ito, the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times, said the combination of Mr. Gensler\u2019s record of independence and his knowledge of finance and policy was what made him so attractive to M.I.T.Mr. Ito has built the Digital Currency Initiative at the Media Lab in an effort to gather a collection of virtual currency experts who don\u2019t have a financial interest in them, though the initiative does provide financial support for some developers working on the Bitcoin software.\u201cIt\u2019s important that you have a core group of people who aren\u2019t in it for the money, and who care about the proper architecture for the long run,\u201d he said.Mr. Gensler has a dual appointment as a special adviser to the Media Lab and a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, where he will teach a class on the blockchain in the fall.The original blockchain is the ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. The Bitcoin blockchain is updated by a network of computers so that no central authority is needed.While most blockchain experiments are in an early stage, Mr. Gensler said he had become convinced that blockchains could replace many of the middlemen in the financial industry.For now, though, his words are likely to have their greatest impact on the quickly evolving debate about how virtual currencies should be regulated.Most industry experts, including Mr. Gensler, assume that Bitcoin is safe from being categorized as a security because it was not originally issued through an initial coin offering or a central organization, and the software is maintained by a decentralized group of developers. Some other virtual currencies, like Litecoin and Monero, have similar designs.But Mr. Gensler said Ether could have more problems because the first Ether tokens were sold in 2014, before the network was functional, by the Ethereum Foundation.Ether could get off the hook, Mr. Gensler said, because its development has been more decentralized recently, and new Ether tokens are now given out to so-called miners through a network.Aya Miyaguchi, the head of the Ethereum Foundation, said in an email that the foundation \u201cneither controls the supply of nor has the ability to issue Ether, and the quantity of Ether that the foundation holds (under 1 percent of all Ether) is already lower than that held by many other ecosystem participants.\u201dBut Mr. Gensler said it would be much harder for the Ripple token, known as XRP, to avoid being categorized as a security. The company that oversees Ripple\u2019s development still holds most of the XRP tokens and does most of the work to make the software and the token valuable, he said.A spokesman for the company Ripple, Tom Channick, said XRP should not be a security.\u201cXRP does not give its owners an interest or stake in Ripple, and they are not paid dividends,\u201d he said. \u201cXRP exists independent of Ripple, was created before the company and will exist after it.\u201dMr. Gensler, who has no virtual currency investments, said he was not tied to any coin\u2019s winning the race. But he does think changes are necessary before blockchains can go mainstream.\u201cI would be surprised if 10 years from now this isn\u2019t somewhere in the financial system in a meaningful way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut so much of the stuff that is being promoted now will not be around.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Prokhorov, the controlling owner of the N.B.A.\u2019s Brooklyn Nets.Jim Walden, a lawyer for Dr. Rodchenkov, said of the biathletes\u2019 suit: \u201cIt\u2019s a frivolous suit that I believe is intended to flesh out where exactly he is,\u201d adding that his client continued to fear potential retaliation from Russia.Scott S. Balber, a New York lawyer representing the Russian athletes, said on Monday that his clients had \u201clots of evidence that supports our claims that, in fact, Rodchenkov fabricated a lot if not all of the storyline\u201d as it related to the three biathletes.The escalating legal battle comes as Dr. Rodchenkov, who has been living in the United States since fleeing Moscow in November 2015, awaits a decision on his application for political asylum. It also comes as global sports officials are seeking to move beyond the yearslong doping scandal, which culminated in a ban of Russia at the 2018 Winter Games, though a significant number of its athletes competed as neutral participants.Acting on Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s evidence as well as evidence gathered by antidoping regulators, the International Olympic Committee disciplined nearly four dozen Russian athletes last year for connections to the doping system. Among them are the three biathletes suing Dr. Rodchenkov: Olga Zaytseva, Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina. Each woman was stripped of a silver medal and is seeking $10 million in damages.Last week, the court published its first full reasoning for one such decision, in which the cross-country skier Alexander Legkov had his punishment overturned because, the court said, it could not be certain the athlete himself had been personally involved in the cheating scheme, in spite of suggestive evidence that his urine sample had been manipulated.Russian officials have seized on victories like Mr. Legkov\u2019s, calling them a vindication of the nation\u2019s athletes and a repudiation of Dr. Rodchenkov. In recent days, Russian officials have claimed that Dr. Rodchenkov has walked back or retracted his statements about Russia\u2019s cheating.But Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s lawyers \u2014 Mr. Walden, of Walden Macht & Haran, and Gregory L. Diskant of Patterson Belknap in New York \u2014 said their client \u201chad not wavered,\u201d calling him \u201cvery clear and very highly corroborated.\u201dDr. Rodchenkov\u2019s countersuit is likely to seek in depositions the names of the others who are financing the lawsuit against him, as well as information on the assets of Mr. Prokhorov, who this spring sold 49 percent of his stake in the Nets but remains the team\u2019s controlling owner.\u201cProkhorov has assets here,\u201d Mr. Walden said. \u201cWe need to go about expeditiously securing them, so he doesn\u2019t go about taking them out of the country. You can expect that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be looking at next.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. Makes a Sharp \u2018Pivot\u2019 on Digital", "Date": "2018-04-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast November, Mr. Flannery told investors that expenses at GE Digital would be cut this year by more than 25 percent, or about $400 million. While he insisted the digital initiatives at G.E. are \u201cvery key\u201d to the company, he added, \u201cwe want a much more focused strategy.\u201dBut the rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.G.E.\u2019s technical prowess, they said, lies in designing and manufacturing big machines like power-plant turbines, jet engines and medical-imaging equipment. Its traditional software skills have been in the specialized programs that control the machines and factory operations. GE Digital was a striking departure into cloud-based internet software, data analytics and artificial intelligence tools like machine learning.\u201cG.E. reached too far outside its expertise and too fast,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at UBS. \u201cAnd it became a financial black hole.\u201dG.E.\u2019s digital effort dates to 2011, when Mr. Immelt recruited William Ruh, an executive at Cisco Systems. Later that year, the company set up a center in San Ramon, Calif., east of San Francisco. At the time, Mr. Ruh announced big plans to hire as many as 400 software engineers to write code for the industrial internet.The San Ramon work force swelled sharply to 1,400 in the summer of 2016, and to a peak of 2,000 last summer \u2014 before coming down to about 1,800, after a round of cuts earlier this year.During the buildup, G.E. recruited veteran software managers who had worked at leading tech companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple. With the cuts at GE Digital and its narrowed focus, some of them have departed.The product plan later broadened to include a cloud-based software platform for handling all kinds of sensor and machine data, and secure communications from the factory floor to data centers. G.E. even built its own data centers.The software platform under development was often referred to as an operating system for the industrial internet. When the product concept expanded, so did the Predix brand.Today, according to former G.E. engineers, Predix has been pared back to mainly a set of software tools to help write applications rather than being connected to layers of code for automating data analysis.The priority at GE Digital is now on selling products for specific industrial applications, sold as offerings in the \u201cPredix portfolio,\u201d and tailored for G.E.\u2019s roster of existing industrial customers. Less emphasis is being put on all-purpose software for the wider industrial world.In an interview, Mr. Ruh described the change at GE Digital as \u201ca pivot\u201d rather than a retreat. \u201cWe\u2019re still 1,000 percent behind our Predix portfolio,\u201d he said.The current strategy, Mr. Ruh said, \u201cis about industrial apps\u201d like those. It is a measured, step-by-step approach but one, Mr. Ruh said, that capitalizes on G.E.\u2019s strengths \u2014 its industry knowledge and deep customer relationships \u2014 and is lifting sales.GE Digital remains a large player in an increasingly crowded field of companies offering industrial internet software of various kinds, in different market niches. The entrants include the big cloud suppliers like Amazon, Microsoft and Google; major business software companies like Oracle, SAP, IBM and SAS Institute; G.E.\u2019s industrial peers such as Siemens, Honeywell and ABB; and start-ups like C3 IoT, Uptake and FogHorn Systems.The opportunity for G.E., analysts said, centers on its longstanding relationships with customers and selling to them. And so far, only 8 percent of its industrial customers are using Predix portfolio products, the company said.The New York Power Authority, the nation\u2019s largest state-owned utility, is one of them. The utility is working with GE Digital to build apps that improve the efficiency of its power generation and distribution network. In pilot projects, the partnership has saved or avoided $3 million in costs, said Gil Quiniones, chief executive of the state power authority. The goal is $500 million in savings over the next decade.But for a technology project to help its customers reduce energy consumption, the state authority went with a start-up, C3 IoT.Brian Hurst, chief analytics officer at Exelon Utilities, a large electric utility corporation based in Chicago, is also working on early-stage projects with GE Digital. Mr. Hurst said the progress was encouraging and he saw no evidence that the cuts at GE Digital had affected their joint work.But it is something he is watching closely. \u201cThe technology is moving so fast,\u201d Mr. Hurst said. \u201cToday\u2019s players may not be tomorrow\u2019s players.\u201dGE Digital, Mr. Ruh insisted, is building a business for the long term. Revenue from the Predix portfolio products reached $550 million last year, he said, and sales are growing rapidly. GE Digital\u2019s total revenue of $4 billion also includes all of G.E.\u2019s traditional industrial software, and the unit\u2019s global work force is more than 4,000.\u201cOur approach is heads-down,\u201d Mr. Ruh said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show you success.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Flannery has consistently declared his support for G.E.\u2019s digital-industrial vision \u2014 but that does not guarantee the future for GE Digital. Mr. Flannery is selling off businesses to streamline the company. The lighting and railway locomotive divisions are up for sale, and others could follow.A smaller G.E. might not need a stand-alone digital unit. Some analysts recommend putting all the software in the industrial divisions, like power and aviation, closer to customers.\u201cSan Ramon shouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Amazon\u2019s New Headquarters Could Mean for Rents", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWinning the contest could mean a steeper increase in local housing costs over the next decade, a study finds. Nashville is already contemplating the impact.To some locals, Amazon represented something else: more people, more traffic and, most of all, higher rents in a city where a rising share of residents were already struggling to afford a place to live.Other cities could also see big increases if Amazon picks them. Monthly rents in Boston and Los Angeles could jump by even larger amounts in dollar terms \u2014 albeit from a higher starting point \u2014 reflecting a shortfall in rental housing construction. Denver \u2014 like Nashville, a midsize city that has seen brisk population growth in recent years \u2014 could see its already rapid rate of rent increases hit nearly 6 percent per year, triple the overall rate of inflation.Some potential locations would be less severely affected. Atlanta and Chicago, big cities that have made it relatively easy to build new housing in recent decades, would see only a small rent increase if they won the Amazon project. And Indianapolis, where population growth has been slow and housing is plentiful, would see no effect on its rents at all, according to Zillow\u2019s model. Even in those cities, however, neighborhoods near the Amazon campus would most likely see significant rent increases. (The study did not look at the effect on prices of owner-occupied homes.)Zillow cautions that its estimates are rough, based on a simple model that looks at how rents in each city have responded to past influxes of workers. If the cities respond differently to Amazon\u2019s arrival \u2014 for example, by building more housing \u2014 the impact on rents could be smaller than Zillow\u2019s model estimates. But there are also reasons to think Zillow\u2019s analysis could understate Amazon\u2019s potential impact. The model looks only at the effect of the jobs that the new campus is expected to create directly. If Amazon\u2019s presence draws other businesses to the area, rents could rise even faster.That\u2019s what has happened in Seattle, where a mini-Silicon Valley has sprung up around Amazon\u2019s downtown campus. Facebook, Google and other internet giants have opened satellite offices nearby, and start-ups \u2014 including Zillow itself \u2014 have their headquarters there. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important is once a city is selected that they start to get ahead of the curve,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said.In Nashville, the debate over HQ2 has gotten caught up in a broader discussion of gentrification, race and the consequences of growth. Residents long described Nashville as a small town disguised as a big city. But over the last decade, the city\u2019s tourism industry has taken off, and some of those tourists liked Nashville enough to stay. For years, the Nashville metropolitan area grew by more than 100 residents per day, with many of them moving into newly built downtown apartment complexes.\u201cIf we\u2019re only addressing housing, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting to the root of the issue,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cWage growth is critical in this conversation.\u201d\u201cWe welcome technology, we welcome great jobs to the city, and I think people would even welcome Amazon, but it would have to be a trade-off there,\u201d Mr. Bedne said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to sign a suicide pact.\u201dAmazon, Ms. Schuetz added, should also take housing costs, traffic congestion and related issues into account. After all, she said, Amazon won\u2019t benefit if its workers can\u2019t find places to live, or if they are viewed by existing residents as a hostile force.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long-term relationship,\u201d Ms. Schuetz said. \u201cTo retain good workers over the long haul, you should care about what housing costs could be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Mayor de Blasio\u2019s Brooklyn-Queens Streetcar Dead?", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was an ambitious idea by Mayor Bill de Blasio and the focus of his 2016 State of the City speech: a sparkling streetcar running along the waterfront in Brooklyn and Queens.Mr. de Blasio has said little about the streetcar in recent months and his office has not identified a route, leading to persistent speculation that the proposal is dead. At the very least, it is delayed. Supporters now question whether a groundbreaking could happen before Mr. de Blasio leaves office at the end of 2021.In a recent radio interview, Mr. de Blasio insisted that the streetcar was still on.\u201cWe\u2019re moving forward, but we have to get the exact details right,\u201d the mayor said on WNYC on Friday, calling the proposal \u201ca big complicated endeavor.\u201dSupporters of the streetcar, which is known as the Brooklyn Queens Connector and would run from Astoria in Queens to Sunset Park in Brooklyn, have grown restless.A group of real estate and transit leaders who have lobbied for the streetcar sent a letter to Mr. de Blasio on Monday urging him to make it a priority.\u201cWe are calling on your administration to take concrete steps to indicate that this critical infrastructure project will indeed break ground during your mayoralty,\u201d the letter from the board for the Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector, which was obtained by The New York Times, said.The letter said that the streetcar could cement the mayor\u2019s legacy, but it would require \u201cbold, visionary leadership.\u201dThe streetcar was pitched as a way to help address the city\u2019s transit crisis and a project Mr. de Blasio could tackle on his own, without meddling from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, his frequent adversary. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the city\u2019s poor-performing subways and buses.Mr. de Blasio said he wanted to connect a string of growing neighborhoods along the waterfront and claimed that rising real estate tax revenue could finance the streetcar. But his deputy mayor, Alicia Glen, raised doubts last week about whether that model was still feasible.Mr. Schumer\u2019s daughter, Jessica Schumer, is the executive director of the Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector group. Mr. Schumer's office did not respond to a request for comment.From the beginning, some said the streetcar idea was a gift to real estate developers on the waterfront instead of a response to a real transit demand. Among the leaders of the Friends group is Jed Walentas, a prominent developer.\u201cIt seemed destined to be a low ridership, niche project with some faulty underlying assumptions,\u201d Mr. Kabak said.If Mr. de Blasio is committed to building the streetcar, it is far behind schedule. The city had aimed to start the public approvals process last year and major design work in 2018. It said it would pick an operator and hold a groundbreaking in 2019, with service starting in 2024.Now it is unlikely construction could start before 2020 or 2021.Wiley Norvell, a City Hall spokesman, said workers had dug trenches along the route to identify the utilities under city streets and officials were still calculating the exact project costs and anticipated real estate revenues.\u201cI know people are trying to read the tea leaves or coffee grounds, but real work is happening behind the scenes,\u201d Mr. Norvell said.For those hoping to ride the streetcar in the next decade, the silence from City Hall over the last year has been frustrating. The Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector displayed a sleek life-size prototype of the streetcar at the Brooklyn Navy Yard last fall to try to muster enthusiasm for the project. The group announced that its first executive director, Ya-Ting Liu, was stepping down a short time later.Now, the streetcar could be vying for federal dollars in a crowded field of transit projects, including the Gateway plan to build a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. Mr. Schumer and President Trump have been at odds over the rail tunnel and a broader infrastructure program.Still, the streetcar project has its fans. Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, said the corridor was thriving and needed more transit options, even if the streetcar would not pay for itself.\u201cThe criteria should not be whether it covers all of its costs,\u201d he said, \u201cbut will it encourage housing and investment on the waterfront? And the answer is yes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Order on Public Housing May Carry Big Costs for City", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut when they took their places alongside the governor for the signing, most of the city elected officials had not been given a copy of the emergency order. Now, they are scrambling to decipher how the executive order might affect the city\u2019s finances and how the city will fund repairs to the largest public housing system in the country.At a news conference two days later, Mr. de Blasio voiced his frustration. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you write an executive order like this without having a consultative process with the city,\u201d he said. Last week Mr. de Blasio said he \u201cdid not expect the hits from Albany to be as bad as they ended up being\u201d and that Nycha would \u201chave a serious price tag attached\u201d in this year\u2019s budget.Before the governor\u2019s mandate, the city had no legal obligation to fund Nycha, according to experts and city officials. The housing authority, like other public authorities in New York, is a state-chartered entity, though the mayor appoints its seven-member board. Its budget is not part of the city\u2019s budget, and it relies primarily on dwindling federal subsidies and on rental payments from the system\u2019s 176,000 units.In recent years, the city has nonetheless chosen to voluntarily fund Nycha in response to the authority\u2019s growing deficit, investing $3.7 billion in the agency since Mr. de Blasio took office, city officials said.Mr. Johnson said his office was \u201cevaluating its impact on the city.\u201d Ms. James said the order \u201cconstitutes an unfunded mandate.\u201d She said Mr. Cuomo should reconsider forcing the city to pay for the repairs and called on the state to fund them instead.The eagerness of Mr. Johnson and Ms. James to jump on the governor\u2019s bandwagon, even as they knew little about the specifics of the order, underscored how the beleaguered housing agency has ended up in the middle of bitter political and legal fights, and how elected officials are striving to be on the right side of an issue that affects the well-being of 400,000 New Yorkers.The full cost of immediate repairs won\u2019t be clear until a monitor is appointed and drafts an emergency plan. But the authority\u2019s needs are staggering: more than $17 billion in unmet capital needs, including roofs and boilers that need to be replaced. Since Mr. Cuomo took office in 2011, the state has pledged only $550 million to Nycha.Despite the governor\u2019s order, some say it\u2019s unlikely that the city will foot the whole bill. \u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to think the city can give Nycha a blank check, but it puts pressure on the mayor to do more,\u201d said Maria Doulis, the vice president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a city budget watchdog. \u201cThe city is a creature of the state and state actions are always a wild card for the city.\u201dMr. Cuomo has said that the main issue is not funding, but the agency\u2019s inability to manage its spending. \u201cDelivering money to Nycha is like throwing it out the window,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said when he signed the order. As it is, the housing authority\u2019s spending is already under close watch. After the agency was found to have been filing false paperwork related to lead-paint inspections, the federal government said Nycha could not draw on federal funds without permission.The city-state squabble comes on the heels of the tug-of-war between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio over who should pay for the city\u2019s ailing subway system, which is run by the state-controlled Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Last month the mayor acquiesced to the governor\u2019s demands that the city pay for half of the subway\u2019s emergency repair plan.While some officials, like Mr. Johnson and Ms. James, say they are concerned about the costs the city may have to bear, others stood by the executive order, saying it provided the accountability Nycha urgently needed.\u201cNo responsible executive should stand on the sidelines of a humanitarian crisis,\u201d said Councilman Ritchie Torres, who has been a vocal advocate for public housing residents.Mr. Torres said he had not read the executive order beforehand and acknowledged that the powers of the emergency manager under the executive order \u201care far more extensive than people might realize.\u201dHousing officials and experts agree that disinvestment at all levels of government led to Nycha\u2019s precarious situation.The federal government has cut about $2.7 billion in funding to Nycha since 2001, housing officials said.And for decades, the city and state financed a small pool of Nycha developments until those subsidies were phased out, burdening the agency with having to finance those buildings.Under the Bloomberg administration, the city terminated subsidies to six Nycha developments, leaving the agency with a shortfall of $240 million until 2010, when the developments were federalized.\u201cThe state has been, in a sense, starving Nycha from 1998 on,\u201d said Victor Bach, the author of the report and a senior housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society.Now, the state has stepped in as Nycha\u2019s savior. But Judith Goldiner, head of the Legal Aid Society\u2019s civil reform unit, said the governor\u2019s executive order raised questions about the extent of the city\u2019s liability and whether the monitor would just be \u201canother layer\u201d of bureaucracy.\u201cYou appoint a monitor and they have a blank check,\u201d Ms. Goldiner said. \u201cIs that best for the tenants?\u201dAdvertisement"}

That would sharply reduce American exports of gasoline to Mexico.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and his top energy adviser, Roc\u00edo Nahle, a former legislator who is in line to become energy minister, have called for a freeze on future deepwater drilling auctions and a review of contracts with international oil companies.\u201cWe cannot irresponsibly deliver our oil reserves to the transnational companies,\u201d Ms. Nahle, who was trained as a chemical engineer, wrote on Twitter this month, summing up her message to a gathering of oil workers in the Mexican oil town of Poza Rica. \u201cThis July 1, this town will end the looting of Mexico.\u201dMs. Nahle has said she wants the government to slash the price of electricity and gasoline, and to reduce Mexico\u2019s dependence on natural-gas imports from the United States by investing more in hydroelectric power. Any reduction in sales to the No. 1 foreign customer for gas from the United States would increase a glut that has depressed prices in America over the last four years.Such positions hark back to the 1930s, when Mexico nationalized its oil industry. Under the current government, a constitutional change enacted in 2014 let foreign companies invest in exploration, drilling, pipelines and even gas stations, and to team up on projects with the state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, or Pemex. The move allowed companies like Exxon Mobil to invest billions of dollars to develop vast fields offshore.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s nationalistic policies are resonating in Mexico as the Trump administration vows to curtail Mexican immigration into the United States and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement.The election outlook has caused concern among American oil executives.\u201cMexico is very critical as an energy partner of the United States, so a retreat from current policies would be a tragedy for both countries,\u201d said Scott D. Sheffield, chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas oil and gas producer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt Mexico long term and the United States long term.\u201dMr. Sheffield and other Texas oil executives are particularly worried that Mexico could slow its importing of American gas.In recent years, Mexico has replaced coal and diesel with cleaner American natural gas to produce about 30 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity. The shale-drilling revolution north of the Rio Grande has yielded an abundance of cheap natural gas for American and Mexican consumers, and Mexico announced a five-year plan in 2015 to increase imports.About 20 pipelines carry 4.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day to Mexico, and more are being built or planned.The gas sales to Mexico are an important source of revenue for American oil and pipeline companies, and they relieve a bulge of gas that is bubbling up with oil from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the nation\u2019s most prolific shale field. California is switching from natural gas to renewable energy sources, while a shortage of pipelines and export terminals for liquefied natural gas means that if sales to Mexico dwindle, there will be excess gas with nowhere to go.That gas will have to be flared, or oil drilling and production will need to decrease, a choice between increasing climate-warming carbon-dioxide emissions or decreasing profits.American refineries also face problems. Before the boom in shale oil production, refineries along the Gulf of Mexico were designed to process heavy oil grades from Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. Imports from Canada continue to increase, but they are limited by scarce pipeline capacity. Production in Venezuela is plummeting, and an expected ratcheting up of sanctions by the Trump administration could further hamper imports.That makes Mexico, which accounts for about 8 percent of American crude-oil imports, an even more critical source. American refineries can process lighter grades of oil but much less efficiently, or they can undertake expensive overhauls of their equipment. Either way, profits would slump.Mexico, for its part, has been importing higher-quality transportation fuels from the United States, in an effort to clean up its cities\u2019 air. Last year, Mexico bought more than one million barrels of American petroleum products a day, providing $23 billion in revenue to American energy companies.Ms. Nahle, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s energy adviser, has said Mexico\u2019s own refineries can be retooled to handle a changeover from American gasoline and diesel.Mexican oil officials, expecting at least a slowdown of their policies, are holding offshore auctions as fast as they can to lure investment before President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is barred by law from seeking a second term, leaves office in December. More than 100 development contracts have already been awarded. The nation\u2019s oil production remains in decline, but officials hope they can reverse the trend as international companies begin to produce large amounts of oil in the Gulf of Mexico over the next two years.Independent energy analysts have viewed Mexico\u2019s moves as a model for economic development, and some worry about a reversal. \u201cTo make a U-turn from the current reforms would be detrimental to the Mexican economy,\u201d said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.Some oil executives and energy experts say they are not overly worried that the new contracts will be overturned. They note that Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador will almost certainly not have the congressional support to entirely rescind the constitutional energy change. Campaign oratory could give way to the realities of governing, especially when the oil industry offers financing for more social services. The government has earned signing bonuses of $525 million from investors so far this year as a result of its efforts.\u201cMexico needs this change more than anybody else,\u201d said Ali Moshiri, who retired last year as Chevron\u2019s top executive in Latin America and is forming his own oil company to seek international opportunities. \u201cPemex has been a disaster, so they have to continue with the reform, though they could slow things down.\u201dIf necessary, international companies could focus less on Mexico and more on other Latin American countries, like Brazil, which also has huge offshore potential, or Colombia, which has significant potential for shale drilling. Both countries also have elections this year in which major candidates have expressed either opposition to giving foreign companies control over natural resources or environmental concerns about developing fossil fuels at all.\u201cThat creates a lot of uncertainties for energy policy,\u201d said Lisa Viscidi, an energy expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank. \u201cAround Latin America, there are serious contenders who want to make big changes in the oil sector and want to reverse previous reforms. L\u00f3pez Obrador particularly represents a lot of direct threats.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Qatar Charm Offensive Appears to Have Paid Off, U.S. Officials Say", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Qatar may score an important victory on Tuesday if President Trump, as expected, tells the leader of the tiny Persian Gulf nation that he now views Qatar\u2019s rivals as stonewalling a solution to an important regional dispute.With urgent conflicts piling up across the Middle East, Mr. Trump is eager to resolve the Sunni Muslim regional feud as he considers the imminent prospect of launching a punishing military strike in Syria over a suspected chemical weapons attack. Qatar is host to al-Udeid Air Base, which is home to nearly 10,000 American troops and is the overseas headquarters for United States Central Command that would launch any strike against Syria.It has also troubled American forces and strategy in the region, which envisions a united Arab effort to combat terrorism and contain Iran.Still, Qatar has signed agreements with the United States for sharing information on terrorists and terrorist financing. And on Monday, the State Department notified Congress that it had approved the potential sale of $300 million in advanced rocket systems to Qatar, which a statement called \u201can important force for political stability and economic progress in the Persian Gulf region.\u201dNow, the administration official said, Mr. Trump believes the holdout against settling the embargo is not Qatar but the United Arab Emirates and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed. And Mr. Trump is pushing for a settlement because the dispute suddenly seems to be an unneeded distraction in a region roiled by conflict, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the sensitive diplomatic issue publicly.\u201cWe are meeting with our military and everybody else, and we\u2019ll be making some major decisions over the next 24 to 48 hours,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Monday morning. A chemical attack, he said, \u201ccan\u2019t be allowed to happen.\u201dConfusion over the Trump administration\u2019s regional policy goals has led a caravan of Middle Eastern leaders to come to Washington to lobby directly for their interests. Three weeks ago, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia was hosted at the White House and then toured the United States; he headed home this past weekend, after a reunion with Presidents George Bush and George W. Bush.Now, Mr. Al-Thani will get his moment.\u201cThe visit of His Highness will showcase the strength and honesty that exists between the U.S. and Qatar,\u201d said Jassim Al-Thani, a spokesman for Qatar\u2019s embassy in Washington.The Trump administration had hoped to bring all of the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council together for a summit meeting in Washington this month. But Prince Mohammed of Saudi Arabia and leaders of the United Arab Emirates said they would decline such an invitation were it issued, since such a meeting would have required an end to their Qatar embargo, senior administration officials said.Jon B. Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the growing disarray in the Middle East was in some ways reflected and grows out of a chaotic White House.\u201cHow do you pursue a coordinated interagency U.S. government strategy when the U.S. government isn\u2019t coordinating?\u201d Mr. Alterman asked, citing the absence of ambassadors in Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Qatar and dozens of other countries along with vacancies in Washington.\u201cThis is precisely the kind of thing where you need a process to make decisions, and this administration has a really hard time with processes.\u201dThe dispute between the Emiratis and Qataris has become remarkably nasty, with each side accusing the other of computer hacking \u2014 with some resulting revelations that have embarrassed the White House.Last week, Federal District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ruled in Washington that a plausible case existed that the Emirates hacked the email accounts of Farhad Azima, an international businessman, for information to assault his character.In a separate lawsuit in California, Federal District Judge John Walter refused to order Qatar to stop disseminating emails and other documents from Elliott Broidy, a top Republican fund-raiser and a contractor for the Emiratis. The judge concluded that Mr. Broidy lacked evidence of Qatar\u2019s involvement.Both rulings were wins for the Qataris.\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how seriously Qatar is taking this issue,\u201d said Mr. Al-Thani, the Qatari Embassy spokesman. \u201cWe are upping our game to protect our sovereignty and independence.\u201dKenneth P.

Mr. Ortega\u2019s brother died fighting in this town, and an old national guard post still stands as a landmark to the uprising that brought their leftist guerrilla movement to power.But in recent days, the guard post has been turned into a charred, vandalized mess. Protesters have even taken a famous war slogan and spray-painted it on the walls in a mocking warning to Mr. Ortega.\u201cLet your momma surrender,\u201d it says.Nicaragua is undergoing its biggest uprising since the civil war ended in 1990.\u201cI have only ever voted for Daniel Ortega,\u201d said Reynaldo Gait\u00e1n, 32, a baker who took to the streets in this town\u2019s historic Monimb\u00f3 neighborhood to denounce his former hero. \u201cDaniel is over. His term ends here.\u201d\u201cNicaragua changed,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ad\u00e1n Aguerri, president of Cosep, the country\u2019s influential business organization, which is pushing for dialogue with the government. \u201cThe Nicaragua of a week ago no longer exists.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re destroying the image of Nicaragua, with all that it cost us to construct that image,\u201d Mr. Ortega said in a televised speech. \u201cThe image of Nicaragua was an image of war. War. Death. How much tourism and investment and jobs will this cost us?\u201dThe Roman Catholic Church has agreed to serve as a mediator and a witness to talks, but the students who took over the Polytechnic University in the capital, Managua, had said they would not negotiate while the president was still in office. They decided early Thursday to join the discussions, providing certain conditions were met.\u201cWe don\u2019t want Daniel,\u201d said Lester Hamilton, 35, who was struck by rubber bullets in protests last week and remained encamped at the university.By \u201cDaniel,\u201d he was referring to Mr. Ortega, the former guerrilla fighter who was a main figure in the revolution against the right-wing dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza.Mr. Ortega agreed to elections in 1990 and lost. But even after giving up the presidency, he never gave up power. The Sandinistas still controlled student groups and unions and exercised important influence over the police, army and judiciary.If presidents enacted policies that Mr. Ortega disagreed with, he would unleash students or unions to protest.\u201cHe always had veto power,\u201d said Gonzalo Carri\u00f3n, president of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t rule from above, he ruled from the bottom.\u201dA pact with an opposing party brought electoral law changes that allowed Mr. Ortega to take office again in 2007, after three consecutive losses at the ballot box.Once president for a second time, he made important alliances with his former enemies, letting big business flourish while he tightened his grip on power.\u201cLeadership is necessary, and Daniel\u2019s leadership is necessary,\u201d said Alejandro Mart\u00ednez Cuenca, a Sandinista economist. \u201cIt would be an error to disregard his presence, when we know this is a country that can easily fall into anarchy.\u201dHe credited Mr. Ortega with \u201cbuilding a new model\u201d for Nicaragua that included economic growth and a reduction in poverty. Nicaragua is safer than most Central American countries, and its residents have not fled to the United States border seeking better lives like their neighbors in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have.The couple made institutional changes that allowed them to control the Supreme Court and the National Assembly and were accused of rampant electoral fraud that gave them power over the nation\u2019s city halls, too.\u201cHe made some very serious errors,\u201d said Jaime Wheelock, one of the original nine Sandinista commanders. \u201cOne good thing about Daniel is that if he\u2019s not right, he\u2019ll back down.\u201dMr. Wheelock cited Mr. Ortega\u2019s willingness to dole out land titles and social welfare benefits. But critics say that while the president used money and oil from Venezuela to win over the poor, he also bought up television stations and took others off the air.He gave plum jobs to union officials, effectively silencing voices of dissent. Middle-class groups and opposition parties often held protests, but they were beaten back by pro-government mobs and largely stifled.So it was all the more remarkable last week when Mr. Ortega\u2019s unpopular changes to social security became the detonator for such an enormous movement. Protests exploded.Mr. Ortega\u2019s changes to the broken social security system required workers to pay more and retirees to receive less. University students, who were already angry over a forest fire at a natural reserve that the government failed to extinguish, rallied against the changes. Then they were met by pro-government mobs that attacked them.Students died at the hands of the police, human rights groups say, inciting even more protests. Then Mr. Ortega and Ms. Murillo dismissed the protesters as little groups of right-wing gangs.\u201cThat just made us even more indignant,\u201d said Enma Guti\u00e9rrez, a youth organizer.More and more people joined the protests. And while the opposition movement is huge, it does not have any clear, national leaders, making it even more difficult for Mr. Ortega to tamp down.On Sunday, when Mr. Ortega rescinded the social security measures, he failed to mention the students who died in the protests, focusing instead on how the demonstrations had been infiltrated by gangs that looted stores.The speeches by Mr. Ortega and Ms. Murillo \u201care adding gasoline to the fire,\u201d Mr. Carri\u00f3n said. \u201cIf these people, this couple, were firefighters, they would be lighting the place on fire.\u201dNicaraguans are furious that Mr. Ortega has not vowed to investigate the student deaths, although he released jailed students this week and put a cable news station back on the air. He was meeting some central demands, but the students insisted that it was not enough.At the Polytechnic University in the capital, students had refused to leave and instead gathered in small groups over the weekend making homemade fire bombs. The residents of the Monimb\u00f3 neighborhood of the city of Masaya also dug in their heels.\u201cThey say this town was the cradle of Daniel Ortega and where he took his first steps,\u201d said Mayra Pab\u00f3n, a longtime supporter of the president who protested in Monimb\u00f3. \u201cWell, he died here too in the moment that he ordered the killings of so many young people with such bright futures ahead of them.\u201d\u201cHe cannot step foot in Masaya ever again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now that even applies to his taste in art.This week, workers from the Whitney Museum of American Art went to his office to hang a work by the modern artist Ellsworth Kelly \u2014 a green trapezoid that contrasts sharply with the artwork that hangs elsewhere in City Hall, which tends to be dark 19th century oil paintings of white men in ornate gold frames or more modern portraits of former mayors.It is tradition for new speakers to decorate their space with artwork borrowed from city museums and their choices often reflect personal style and political roots.\u201cI\u2019m not the artsiest guy,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, explaining that he was happy to let the museum do the choosing.Mr. Johnson called \u201cDay\u2019s End\u201d an \u201cexciting, great project for a great New York artist\u201d and said there was no connection between the loan of the artwork and the request for financing. \u201cI didn\u2019t make any connection between the two things.\u201dMr. Soba said the museum often lends artwork for display in elected leaders\u2019 offices and that the installation in Mr. Johnson\u2019s office was \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to the financing request. The museum requested a total of $5 million in capital financing for the project \u2014 $2.25 million each from the Council and the Department of Cultural Affairs and $500,000 from the Manhattan borough president\u2019s office, Mr. Soba said. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of the funding is being privately raised by the Whitney,\u201d he said.Mr. Johnson said he planned to borrow more art for his office from other institutions and would exchange the pieces for new ones each year, adding that he wanted to display items from museums in every borough.\u201cI am deeply honored to be able to show beautiful art from different cultural institutions from across New York City at City Hall,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the Brooklyn Museum and the Queens Museum and the Museum of the City of New York and The Met and smaller museums.\u201d\u201cThey are very personal to me,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who is gay.Kelly\u2019s artwork reflects the artist\u2019s response to the debate over how to create a memorial to victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack on the World Trade Center. The aluminum green trapezoid represents greenspace that could occupy the void where the Trade Center plaza once stood.Mr. Johnson\u2019s predecessor as speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, installed artwork from El Museo del Barrio and the Bronx Museum, according to Ms. Fermino. She also displayed photographs of New York street scenes from the Museum of the City of New York, which Mr. Johnson has kept on the walls in his office waiting area.Christine C. Quinn, who was speaker from 2006 to 2014, installed a large painting by the artist Lee Krasner in her office from the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Ms. Quinn\u2019s office also had works on loan from the Guggenheim, the National Museum of the American Indian and other institutions, Ms. Fermino said.Referring to previous speakers who displayed artwork on loan, Ms. Quinn said: \u201cGifford Miller had donated art. Peter Vallone had donated art. It was a tradition to have donated art.\u201dMs. Quinn said it had no bearing on the Council\u2019s financing decisions.\u201cAll of those institutions had requests for funding before me and it made zero difference,\u201d she said. \u201cWe reformed the entire cultural-funding process in a way that many cultural institutions opposed while I was speaker, while that art hung.\u201d\u201cWhen prominent elected officials display works of art on loan they are elevating the arts, they are making sure and actually sending a message that culture and the arts are important to them,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, a Queens councilman who is chairman of the Committee on Cultural Affairs. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing for those who care about the arts.\u201dMr. Van Bramer also praised the \u201cDay\u2019s End\u201d project. \u201cThere are very few works of public art of this magnitude by an African-American artist in New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the project is worthy of the funding that\u2019s being requested.\u201dMayor Bill de Blasio has no modern art in his City Hall office and no artwork on loan from museums, according to members of his staff.But Gracie Mansion, the mayoral residence, has been home to at least two exhibitions since Mr. de Blasio moved in that included numerous works of art lent by museums, including the Whitney.That gives added punch to the introduction of modern art into the building by Mr. Johnson, who has delighted in contrasting himself with the mayor.Advertisement"}

Kennedy, writing for a plurality of the justices, said such suits should not be allowed without explicit congressional authorization.In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the Supreme Court had created a double standard for corporations.The case decided on Tuesday concerned Arab Bank, which is based in Jordan and has been accused of processing financial transactions through a branch in New York for groups linked to terrorism. The plaintiffs in the case sought to hold the bank liable for attacks in Israel and in the Palestinian territories by Hamas and other groups.The case turned on the meaning of the Alien Tort Statute, a cryptic 1789 law that allows federal district courts to hear \u201cany civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\u201dJustice Kennedy wrote that the evidence about whether suits against foreign corporations were among those norms was mixed. That meant, he wrote, that a clear answer from Congress was required before the suits could be allowed in light of the diplomatic friction they can create.\u201cCourts are not well suited to make the required policy judgments that are implicated by corporate liability in cases like this one,\u201d he wrote.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Clarence Thomas joined all of Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion, and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch much of it.In concurring opinions, Justices Alito and Gorsuch wrote that they would have gone further, expressing doubts about whether the court has interpreted the 1789 law correctly.In dissent, Justice Sotomayor said Justice Kennedy\u2019s analysis was flawed.\u201cNothing about the corporate form in itself justifies categorically foreclosing corporate liability,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEach source of diplomatic friction that respondent Arab Bank and the plurality identify can be addressed with a tool more tailored to the source of the problem than a blanket ban on corporate liability.\u201dJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G.

Qualifications: Must be attractive, know how to charm socially awkward programmers and give relaxing massages.Ms. Shen is a \u201cprogrammer motivator,\u201d as they are known in China. Part psychologist, part cheerleader, the women are hired to chat up and calm stressed-out coders. The jobs are proliferating in a society that largely adheres to gender stereotypes and believes that male programmers are \u201czhai,\u201d or nerds who have no social lives.\u201cThey really need someone to talk to them from time to time and to organize activities for them to ease some of the pressure,\u201d said Ms. Shen, a 25-year-old who has a degree in civil engineering from a university in Beijing.The country\u2019s laws against gender discrimination are not often enforced. Many companies are direct in their job ads. Males preferred. Only good-looking women need apply. With programmer motivators, it\u2019s more explicit, putting women in subservient positions to men.In tech, men dominate the top ranks. Just one woman sits on the 11-member board of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant. At Baidu, a search company, none of its five board members is a woman. At Tencent, a games and social media conglomerate, there are none. By comparison, Twitter has three women on its nine-person board. At Facebook, two of its nine directors are women.Like many other businesses, China\u2019s tech companies are blunt about gender bias in their job ads. Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have repeatedly published recruitment ads boasting that there are \u201cbeautiful girls\u201d working for the companies, according to Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights watchdog.In January, Alibaba said it was seeking a sales manager for Taobao, its e-commerce platform. Women were preferred, ages 28 to 35, \u201cwith a good personal image and class.\u201dIn November, Baidu advertised for a marketing position. Men were preferred \u201cbecause of business travel\u201d and other reasons.Both companies have since removed the references to specific genders in those ads.Alibaba said that the company has clear guidelines on providing equal opportunity regardless of gender and \u201cwill conduct stricter reviews of the recruiting advertisements to ensure compliance with our policy.\u201d It also said that one-third of the 18 founders of Alibaba are women and that female leaders account for one-third of the company\u2019s management positions.Baidu said that 45 percent of the company\u2019s 40,000 employees are female, which is reflected in midlevel and senior positions. \u201cWe value the important work that our female employees do across the organization,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.In a statement, Tencent said it values diverse backgrounds and apologized for the ads.It is unclear how many companies employ programmer motivators. According to Baidu Baipin, a job search website run by Baidu, just seven companies are currently advertising for these jobs, mostly at smaller start-ups. There used to be more. Alibaba advertised for a programmer motivator with \u201crecognizably good looks\u201d in 2015 but deleted the ad after being criticized by Chinese internet users.Ms. Shen started work at Chainfin.com, a consumer finance company, in October. She declined to disclose her salary, but Zhang Jing, a human resources executive who hired Ms. Shen, said it was around $950 a month.Ms. Shen came to Beijing from the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. She has long black hair and pale skin and wears red eye shadow to the office, where she always has a ready smile for her colleagues. They call her by her nickname, Yueyue, which translates to Joy.At Chainfin.com, the bulk of her work is tending the front desk, organizing social events, ordering snacks for tea breaks and chatting with the programmers.

Ms. Shen asked whether his waist was still hurting from the long hours at his desk. He said, yes, he had been working till 10 or 11 for the past few nights.\u201cThe company\u2019s intention is for me to give you a massage, though my technique might not be great,\u201d Ms. Shen told Mr. Guo.Both of them broke out in giggles.Ms. Shen stood over a seated Mr. Guo and started kneading his shoulders.\u201cIt really does feel good,\u201d Mr. Guo said, as Ms. Shen gently whacked his back with a massage clapper device.For some start-ups, having a programmer motivator on staff is one of the many perks to attract male coders, a job that is in high demand in China\u2019s booming tech scene.Feng Zhiyi, 31, who works in research and development at Chainfin.com, said he was envious when photos of female programmer motivators fanning male employees appeared on the internet.\u201cAnd now we have one, too,\u201d Mr. Feng said.Mr. Feng said Ms. Shen had improved the work environment by organizing birthday parties and getting the programmers active with games such as tug of war or sack races.He said he was open to the idea of male programmer motivators but somewhat skeptical. \u201cA man chatting with another man, it\u2019s like going out on a date with a guy,\u201d Mr. Feng said. \u201cA little awkward, isn\u2019t it?\u201dMs. Zhang, the human resources executive who was part of the panel that hired Ms. Shen, stressed that it is important for a programmer motivator to look good.

And that\u2019s enough.\u201dXu Jiaolong, one of Chainfin.com\u2019s few female programmers, who gets massages from Ms. Shen, did not see anything wrong with the job. The way she saw it, it was a mere \u201cdivision of labor.\u201d But, with a smile, she said the company could consider hiring a man to motivate female programmers, too.China\u2019s tech industry is beginning to question such practices. Wang Jie, 40, the chief executive of Shanbay.com, an app that helps people learn English, has been vocal about the \u201cobjectification\u201d of women by other start-ups.He was so disturbed that some tech companies were using \u201cbeautiful women\u201d to draw male programmers to their companies that he wrote a post last October on Zhihu, China\u2019s version of Quora, the question and answer site, saying that Western companies would be sued back home if they posted similar ads.But Mr. Wang has found that attitudes are difficult to change.

{"Headline": "As Scandal-Tarred Abe Meets Trump, \u2018the Situation Is Getting Dangerous\u2019", "Date": "2018-04-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet Mr. Abe may not stay in power long enough to complete the diplomatic trifecta.Junichiro Koizumi, one of Mr. Abe\u2019s best-known predecessors, told a reporter for the magazine Weekly Asahi that \u201cthe situation is getting dangerous\u201d for Mr. Abe and questioned whether the prime minister might resign when the current session of Parliament ends in June.But over the last few weeks, leaks of tampered files and previously missing documents are raising sharper questions about whether Mr. Abe helped friends at two educational institutions gain preferential treatment from the government. Mr. Abe has insisted he was not involved in either case and has suggested that bureaucrats may have acted independently.The drip-drip of revelations has poked holes in Mr. Abe\u2019s credibility as he prepares to meet Mr. Trump, who is himself consumed by his own scandals.\u201cThere has been a lot of new evidence that has come to light that there has been some kind of cover-up,\u201d Kristi Govella, assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said of the inquiry surrounding Mr. Abe. \u201cAs time goes on, the disjuncture between what he\u2019s saying and the facts that are coming to light with the scandals just really increase public distrust and feelings that his leadership is no longer what the country needs.\u201dBut last month, the Finance Ministry said an internal investigation found that bureaucrats had tampered with official documents related to the sale of public land to an ultraconservative education group, known as Moritomo Gakuen, at a steeply discounted price. Mr. Abe\u2019s wife, Akie, served as a onetime honorary principal of a planned elementary school that Moritomo wanted to build on the disputed land.In one of the most damaging findings, the ministry said that officials had scrubbed Mrs. Abe\u2019s name and alleged remarks encouraging the deal from the documents when they were first submitted to Parliament, known in Japan as the Diet. Then this month Mitsuru Ota, a senior official at the Finance Ministry, told Parliament that a bureaucrat had urged a lawyer for Moritomo to lie about how much it would cost to remove garbage from the public land in order to justify the sale at a discounted price.Last week, the newspaper The Asahi Shimbun reported the existence of a memo in a separate scandal showing that Mr. Abe had talked over a meal to a friend seeking to set up a veterinary school in a special economic zone in southwestern Japan. The memo also suggested that a secretary for Mr. Abe had helped the friend set up the veterinary school.None of the leaks have yet proven Mr. Abe\u2019s involvement.\u201cThere\u2019s still nothing to say that Abe ordered the cover-up\u201d or pushed for his friend\u2019s veterinary school deal, said Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy based in New York. \u201cBut between the Finance Ministry falsifying documents submitted to the Diet and the bureaucracy making up documents, those are things that are not just going to be accepted passively by the public.\u201dMr. Abe \u201cis running out of time, and there doesn\u2019t really seem to be a way out of this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.For the five years that Mr. Abe has been in power, he has benefited from a weak opposition and public weariness over the revolving door at the prime minister\u2019s office that preceded his election in 2012. And as Japan has faced increasing threats from China and North Korea, he has been able to persuade voters that he is the best leader to keep Japan secure. The economy has been gradually improving, too.With the scandals gaining traction, however, that formula is weakening. \u201cFor the last five years we have had some consensus that Japan needs a strong leader and we have to sustain that strong leader,\u201d said Ryo Sahashi, a professor of international politics at Kanagawa University. \u201cBut I think that consensus is now eroded.\u201dIf Mr. Abe is able to hold on to power, it may be public fatigue that helps him. Norimasa Araki, 76, a retired trading company employee who was having lunch near Shimbashi Station in central Tokyo on Monday, said that the scandals were \u201cnot worth paying attention to.\u201d\u201cThe problems are trivial,\u201d he added.Still, there is no question that Mr. Abe has been politically weakened even if he secures a third term as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party in September.Mr. Sahashi said it would be much more difficult for Mr. Abe to push through some of his most cherished agendas, including revising the country\u2019s pacifist Constitution.\u201cA big handshake with a U.S. president about trade liberalization is a chance for Prime Minister Abe to reclaim his ground as a reformer to the Japanese public,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors. \u201cIt is a good opportunity for Prime Minister Abe to show the public that he is a strong leader in foreign policy.\u201dEven if he can claim some kind of victory in his meeting with Mr. Trump, it is unclear whether it will help him. \u201cEven now the vultures are starting to circle,\u201d Ms. Govella said. \u201cPeople are trying to figure out what comes next after Abe.\u201dReporting was contributed by Makiko Inoue, Hisako Ueno, Shiho Takezawa and Erica Yokoyama.Advertisement"}

They wore camouflage combat fatigues and serious expressions.I asked a soldier if these were the troops we would be shadowing.\u201cThey\u2019re heading to lunch,\u201d he replied.That moment set the tone for the rest of my embed \u2014 assume nothing.I thought I\u2019d be riding in a military vehicle, but we rode instead in civilian trucks and minivans. I thought we\u2019d spend most of the time in a so-called O.P., or observation post, but instead we spent hours traveling on the road. I thought I would see a lot of political stagecraft, but I saw plenty of unscripted reality.I saw, for example, a hint of the money being spent. Officials have been vague on the precise cost of the deployment, but the resources before me were stunning: pricey Bushnell binoculars, hotel rooms, rental vehicles. Texas has had troops on the border since 2014 as part of a state mobilization, and the cost was roughly $1 million a month. This new, federally financed deployment will run far higher.It all started last Saturday, when Marc Lacey, The Times\u2019s National editor, asked me to request an embed with the troops on the border in Texas. On Monday, the Guard sent me an email back stating that I had been selected, along with the Times photographer Lynsey Addario. We would have five hours, starting at noon Tuesday, the first of several media embeds of Texas ground forces planned during Mr. Trump\u2019s deployment.But first, I had to sign my life away. The Guard gave us a five-page form. By signing it, I acknowledged that I had been advised by the Guard that, \u201cin pursuing the successful accomplishment of its mission,\u201d the state\u2019s military forces could not \u201cguarantee my personal safety or the safety of my equipment.\u201dOn Tuesday at noon, Weslaco was hit with a lightning storm. Part of the armory where we and a few other media outlets gathered had no power. Soldiers were walking around dark halls using the lights from their phones. Our departure at noon was pushed to 1:45 p.m.Before we got on the highway, we were told we could not reveal our locations, other than to say we were in Starr County. And we could not photograph the full faces of the troops \u2014 to protect their identity and safety. Military leaders worried that smugglers would target them for speaking out.On the one hand, there was an element of organizational paranoia at play. But the border \u2014 not the towns and cities where people live, but the physical line on the Rio Grande \u2014 can be a dangerous place. In 2011, drug smugglers trying to protect a raft loaded with marijuana threw rocks and fired up to six gunshots at officers on the border near the places where we traveled (the agents answered those six gunshots with a barrage of about 300).I thought about that incident as I stood next to a soldier overlooking the river.He said nothing to me as he stared through binoculars. He was in his 20s. He wore a wedding ring. He was Latino. I would guess he lived not too far away from where he stood at that moment. This young man was a visual representative of America and vulnerable to those six gunshots in a way that I was not. So much of this debate has been filled with generalities that I appreciated the chance to put a specific human face on the issue. When I think about it now, I picture that silent, focused young man, his M-4 rifle and his silver wedding band.There was a moment at the first observation post when Ms. Addario \u2014 who has risked her life covering war zones around the world and was captured and held in Libya for six days in 2011 \u2014 wanted to stand on a Humvee to get a better shot. She was told not to. It was too risky. At the second observation post, Ms. Addario persisted, and ended up climbing a Humvee. A soldier who served as the media coordinator assured a captain that she had, indeed, signed a waiver, and they let her do it. She came down safely, without a scratch.Mission \u2014 that little one at least \u2014 accomplished.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "YouTube Says Computers Are Catching Problem Videos", "Date": "2018-04-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The vast majority of videos removed from YouTube toward the end of last year for violating the site\u2019s content guidelines had first been detected by machines instead of humans, the Google-owned company said on Monday.YouTube said it took down 8.28 million videos during the fourth quarter of 2017, and about 80 percent of those videos had initially been flagged by artificially intelligent computer systems.The new data highlighted the significant role machines \u2014 not just users, government agencies and other organizations \u2014 are taking in policing the service as it faces increased scrutiny over the spread of conspiracy videos, fake news and violent content from extremist organizations.Those videos are sometimes promoted by YouTube\u2019s recommendation system and unknowingly financed by advertisers, whose ads are placed next to them through an automated system.This was the first time that YouTube had publicly disclosed the number of videos it removed in a quarter, making it hard to judge how aggressive the platform has previously been in removing content, or the extent to which computers played a part in making those decisions.Figuring out how to remove unwanted videos \u2014 and balancing that with free speech \u2014 is a major challenge for the future of YouTube, said Eileen Donahoe, executive director at Stanford University\u2019s Global Digital Policy Incubator.\u201cIt\u2019s basically free expression on one side and the quality of discourse that\u2019s beneficial to society on the other side,\u201d Ms. Donahoe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard problem to solve.\u201dYouTube declined to disclose whether the number of videos it had removed had increased from the previous quarter or what percentage of its total uploads those 8.28 million videos represented. But the company said the takedowns represented \u201ca fraction of a percent\u201d of YouTube\u2019s total views during the quarter.YouTube has contended that the volume of videos uploaded to the site is too big of a challenge to rely only on human monitors.Still, YouTube said three-quarters of all videos flagged by computers had been removed before anyone had a chance to watch them.The company\u2019s machines can detect when a person tries to upload a video that has already been taken down and will prevent that video from reappearing on the site. And in some cases with videos containing nudity or misleading content, YouTube said its computer systems are adept enough to delete the video without requiring a human to review the decision.The company said its machines are also getting better at spotting violent extremist videos, which tend to be harder to identify and have fairly small audiences.At the start of 2017, before YouTube introduced so-called machine-learning technology to help computers identify videos associated with violent extremists, 8 percent of videos flagged and removed for that kind of content had fewer than 10 views. In the first quarter of 2018, the company said, more than half of the videos flagged and removed for violent extremism had fewer than 10 views.Even so, users still play a meaningful role in identifying problematic content. The top three reasons users flagged videos during the quarter involved content they considered sexual, misleading or spam, and hateful or abusive.YouTube said users had raised 30 million flags on roughly 9.3 million videos during the quarter. In total, 1.5 million videos were removed after first being flagged by users.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Can\u2019t Trump Find Legal Help?", "Date": "2018-04-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Campos is a law professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder.In what is becoming one of the most remarkable chapters in American legal history, the president of the United States is in serious need of top-notch legal help, but apparently cannot find top-notch lawyers to represent him.As Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe moves forward, the Trump administration has approached a slew of prominent law firms and attorneys, only to be told that while, in the words of Dan Webb and Tom Buchanan of Winston & Strawn, \u201cthe opportunity to represent the president [is] the highest honor\u201d that can come a lawyer\u2019s way, they must respectfully decline that honor. This left the president relying on a legal team who, with the exception of former Hogan Lovells lawyer Ty Cobb, features no criminal defense lawyers, let alone attorneys with experience in the sort of investigation Mr. Mueller is conducting.The reasons top firms and lawyers are giving for refusing to work for Trump include conflicts of interests with current clients, the possibility of alienating sources of future business, the president\u2019s reluctance to follow legal advice, his tendency to ask lawyers to engage in what Ted Boutrous of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher referred to delicately as \u201cquestionable activities,\u201d and his history of not paying his bills.Although these reasons for not taking on the president as a client are plausible, it seems something more profound is at work. After all, given the nature of white-collar criminal defense work, all these firms have extensive experience dealing with complicated conflicts issues, as well as difficult, controversial and otherwise unsavory clients. (By contrast, Bill Clinton secured the services of Bob Bennett, arguably the nation\u2019s top white-collar criminal defense attorney, to defend him in the context of Ken Starr\u2019s independent counsel investigation.)Is there something else about Mr. Trump that makes elite lawyers especially reluctant to represent him? It is true that he presented himself as an anti-establishment populist and that more highly educated voters in general were less likely to vote for him. Yet campaign contributions to presidential candidates from lawyers at America\u2019s top law firms suggest strongly that the antipathy toward Trump among elite lawyers is especially intense.I examined federal records of presidential campaign contributions in 2012 and 2016 at the nation\u2019s 10 highest-ranked law firms and other elite institutions known for their political and economic influence, such as Goldman Sachs. The results were striking.In 2012, employees at these companies made 3,552 contributions to presidential campaigns. Barack Obama received 58.6 percent of these contributions while 40.6 percent went to Mitt Romney (the remainder going to other candidates in the Republican primary). Mr. Romney\u2019s percentage of contributions was very similar to the percentage of the vote \u2014 42 percent \u2014 he received in the election from voters with any postgraduate education.The same data for the 2016 election provide a stark contrast. Of the 4,812 contributions originating from these companies, Mr. Trump received a total of 40. Meanwhile, contributions to Hillary Clinton outnumbered those to Mr. Trump by a ratio of more than 100 to 1.Mrs. Clinton received nearly twice as many contributions from lawyers in these companies than Mr. Obama received four years earlier. (The latter fact is all the more striking, given that Mrs. Clinton raised 22 percent less money from the electorate as a whole than Mr. Obama raised in 2012.)Meanwhile, compared with the support they gave to Mr. Romney, contributions from lawyers at these elite firms to Mr. Trump declined by a remarkable 98 percent. (Overall, Mr. Trump raised 26 percent less money than Mr. Romney raised in 2012.)Some of the reluctance to contribute to the Trump campaign may be explained by the belief that he was unlikely to win. Yet the shift in support among elite lawyers between the Democratic and Republican nominees in 2012 and 2016 is extraordinary.Data from Kirkland & Ellis, a Top 10 firm with a reputation for leaning Republican, highlight how extreme that shift was. In 2012, Kirkland & Ellis\u2019s lawyers made 20.6 percent more contributions to Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign than they made to Mr. Obama\u2019s. In 2016, the same firm\u2019s lawyers were 34 times more likely to contribute to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign than to Mr. Trump\u2019s.The notable lack of support for Mr. Trump inside top law firms reflects a broader pattern among elite institutions. For example, at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, contributions to the Trump campaign were 99 percent lower than those to Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign four years earlier. Indeed, the total number of Goldman Sachs executives who to date have taken senior positions in the Trump administration (five) is greater than the total number of the firm\u2019s approximately 34,000 employees who contributed to Trump\u2019s campaign (three).The revealed preferences, in the form of 2016 campaign contributions, of these elite professionals suggest that Mr. Trump\u2019s inability to hire top lawyers to help him with his mounting legal troubles is not merely because he has various hallmarks of a troublesome client. Rather, they suggest the depth of the misgivings Mr. Trump has raised among American elites, and which persist today.Of course, those misgivings do not appear to extend to one particularly crucial elite: the leadership of the Republican Party. Whether that changes because of the outcome of the Mueller investigation, and in particular because of whatever role the refusal of so many elite lawyers to represent the president plays in that outcome, remains to be seen.Paul F.

{"Headline": "Looming China Trade Action Divides Industry and Roils Markets", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s promise to take tough action against China\u2019s unfair economic practices was one of his most popular campaign ideas. But as the United States prepares stiff trade measures and China retaliates, stock markets have plummeted and some of America\u2019s biggest companies are pushing back.Industry giants like General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as agricultural companies, have lodged objections with the White House, saying that tariffs on both sides of the Pacific and limitations on investments will cut off American companies from the world\u2019s most lucrative and rapidly growing market.Since then, the White House has announced another trade measure targeted at China that would place tariffs on at least $50 billion worth of products imported to the United States and would restrict investment flows between the two economic giants. This week, the Trump administration is expected to announce a list of Chinese imports subject to tariffs, which could include high-tech products like semiconductors as well as cheap electronics and other goods that many Americans buy.Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocate for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and IBM, said his group had been largely supportive of the administration\u2019s targeting of China\u2019s unfair trade practices. But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d\u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201dThat theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.Companies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.\u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.\u201cAmerican farmers appear to be the first casualties of an escalating trade war,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and a chairman of a group called Farmers for Free Trade. \u201cWith farm incomes already declining, farmers rely on export markets to stay above water. These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201dHowever, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.Speaking Monday on CNBC, the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, defended the administration\u2019s tough actions on China and said investors should not fear a trade war.\u201cEverybody needs to relax,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe economy is as strong as an ox.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were the first team in the American League to reach 10 victories.\u201cIt\u2019s too early to draw conclusions,\u201d said their general manager, Billy Eppler, though he had to concede the obvious. \u201cIt beats some of the other outcomes. But we\u2019re just trying to stay beholden to our process, that\u2019s it.\u201dThe Angels\u2019 process has been the most scrutinized in baseball this season, at least in how it relates to Shohei Ohtani, the rookie from Japan who has starred at the plate and on the mound. The Angels have pitched Ohtani only on Sundays, with his third start scheduled against the Royals at Kauffman Stadium. He has made several starts as the designated hitter, but hasn\u2019t been a hitter in the games before, when, or after he pitches.As a two-way force, Ohtani is trying to do something no player has done in almost a century. That gives the Angels no clear template for how to use him, and they are choosing a cautious approach. Ohtani\u2019s early success \u2014 three home runs in his first three games as a hitter, victories in his first two games as a pitcher \u2014 has not tempted them to use him more often.\u201cThe plan and the processes behind it is all we have,\u201d Eppler said. \u201cThat has to be our lighthouse. You just focus on that lighthouse and drive toward that. The results and everything that happens on the field, that\u2019s all fog. Internally, we\u2019re just making sure the well-being of the player is taken care of, that he feels strong, rested and prepared.\u201dOn Wednesday, through an interpreter, Ohtani told reporters that he hoped to play more often as the season unfolded.\u201cI talk to the medical staff every day, and they see how I\u2019m doing, my strength level, to see if I can play that day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the season, so I think they are being pretty careful with me right now. Once the season gets tougher and the schedule gets tougher throughout the summer, hopefully I can make them want to play me more. I would like to play more. If not, that\u2019s what it is. I have to follow what they have to say.\u201dBut Jaime Barria allowed one hit over five innings to beat Texas in his major league debut on Wednesday, and Garrett Richards and Tyler Skaggs, who have missed most of the last two seasons with injuries, are healthy and pitching well. Ohtani has been overpowering, with 18 strikeouts in 13 innings and just four hits, two walks and three runs allowed.The Angels\u2019 lineup has been relentless, even without Ohtani for most games and with second baseman Ian Kinsler missing two series with groin tightness. The veterans Zack Cozart, who signed as a free agent, and Justin Upton, who re-signed after arriving in a trade last Aug. 31, have helped boost an offense that ranked 22nd in the majors in runs last season despite the presence of the game\u2019s best player, center fielder Mike Trout.\u201cWhen you have a decent number of new players in the clubhouse, one of the things you\u2019re mindful of within the front office is how quickly can your players connect and jell,\u201d Eppler said. \u201cAnd it feels like that has happened quicker than I\u2019ve been accustomed to when you\u2019re bringing in players from outside the organization.\u201dReferring to the lineup, Eppler added: \u201cThat whole theme of passing the baton, it comes to life when you get that connectivity. If they all feel like they\u2019re contributing, that mind-set will work.\u201dOhtani is making the splashiest contributions for the Angels. But as the standings show, he is not alone.As president of the Oakland Athletics, David Kaval connects with fans by holding office hours on Tuesdays. He is open to anything.\u201cThey can tell me who they want to play third base, they can try to sell me insurance, they can ask for a job,\u201d Kaval said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to have your finger on the pulse of the fan base and get ideas.\u201dMost fans are not bold enough to ask Kaval to let them into the Coliseum for free. On Tuesday, though, the A\u2019s are doing just that. To mark the 50th anniversary of the franchise\u2019s first game in Oakland, the A\u2019s will offer free admission to their game against the Chicago White Sox. The teams will wear 1968 uniforms, parking will be free, and even the tarps on \u201cMount Davis\u201d \u2014 the distant seats high above the center-field structure built to lure back Al Davis\u2019s Raiders in the 1990s \u2014 will be gone. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting an amazing atmosphere,\u201d Kaval said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fun showcase of what A\u2019s baseball can be.\u201dLew Krausse, who started for the A\u2019s in their inaugural Oakland game, will throw the ceremonial first pitch. The A\u2019s lost to Baltimore in their first home opener, 4-1, and managed just two hits \u2014 including Tony La Russa\u2019s only hit in the majors between 1963 and 1970. The team\u2019s fortunes improved quickly: 10 home games later, Catfish Hunter threw a perfect game, and the A\u2019s would win three World Series in a row in the 1970s. Another title followed in 1989, with La Russa as manager.While the A\u2019s have reached the playoffs eight times in the 2000s, they have always been hindered by low revenues. Previous ownership was blocked from moving south to San Jose, and now the A\u2019s have submitted a proposal to buy the Coliseum site from the city and county for $137 million. If the offer is accepted, the A\u2019s would have more control over their future ballpark site, though Kaval said the team was also reviewing options for a waterfront location.\u201cThese processes in California take a long time,\u201d said Kaval, a former president of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer, who opened a $100 million, privately financed stadium in 2015. \u201cYou need to keep the process and the energy going every day to make sure you\u2019re making progress.\u201dThe A\u2019s have drawn two million fans in a season just once since 2005, while the San Francisco Giants have drawn at least 2.8 million every year since opening their dazzling ballpark in 2000. But the Oakland fans have a feisty spirit that should be on full display Tuesday.\u201cIt reminds me of an English Premier League soccer club,\u201d Kaval said. \u201cThey\u2019re passionate, they\u2019re knowledgeable, they\u2019re loud. They\u2019re part of the experience.\u201dAs a way to thank those fans \u2014 for one day, anyway \u2014 the team will charge them nothing on their way through the doors.Mike Fiers made his debut for the Detroit Tigers last Sunday, tossing six shutout innings to beat the Chicago White Sox. It was his first game since Sept. 13, when he gave up eight runs in a loss for the Houston Astros.That was the fifth time in eight starts that Fiers, 32, had allowed six runs or more, and the slump cost him his spot on Houston\u2019s postseason roster. Fiers was inactive as the Astros won the World Series, despite leading the team in regular-season innings, with 153\u2153. He finished 8-10 with a 5.22 earned run average.\u201cThey signed and traded for a bunch of guys, so to make the playoff roster was definitely going to be tough,\u201d Fiers said this spring, adding that while he was disappointed, he could not argue. \u201cYou could say they made the right moves because they ended up winning the World Series.\u201dOf course, Fiers will still get a championship ring from the Astros, who designed theirs with 101 diamonds on top to represent their regular-season victories, plus 11 baguette diamonds that represent their postseason wins and form their \u201cH\u201d logo. Fiers said the ring would symbolize more than the World Series he missed.\u201cThat ring, it\u2019s all the work you\u2019ve put in to get to that point and accomplish that,\u201d said Fiers, who dislocated his hip and broke four bones in his back in college when he fell asleep while driving and crashed into a guardrail on Florida\u2019s Turnpike, sending his body through the windshield.\u201cYeah, it was a great year, but I feel like it\u2019s more about overcoming so many obstacles,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting in a car accident, going through college, sitting out years and coming back, finally getting an opportunity to play professional baseball, getting to this level and having success. It\u2019s really everything in one.\u201dAnother pitcher has just changed his name, but not because of an investigator\u2019s revelation. Felipe Rivero, the hard-throwing left-handed closer of the Pittsburgh Pirates, legally changed his name to Felipe Vazquez last month. The Pirates made the change to his uniform on Monday.\u201cMy sister and I have been talking,\u201d Vazquez told Brink. \u201cShe decided it\u2019s time. If she says something, I just get it done. That\u2019s the way it is.\u201dVazquez\u2019s name change recalls a similar switch by David Ortiz while playing in the minor leagues. Ortiz, the former Boston Red Sox slugger, was first known as David Arias. His baseball cards from 1997, when he played for the Minnesota Twins, identify him this way.Ortiz\u2019s full name is David Americo Ortiz Arias, with Arias his maternal family name and the name he used in the minors with the Seattle Mariners. He switched his preference to Ortiz in the majors but honored his mother, Angela Rose Arias, who was killed in a car accident in 2002, by pointing to the sky after his home runs. After retiring in 2016, Ortiz started his own wine company and named it Arias in her memory.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael Cohen to Take Fifth Amendment in Stormy Daniels Lawsuit", "Date": "2018-04-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, will invoke his Fifth Amendment right in a lawsuit filed against the president by Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star better known as Stormy Daniels.Mr. Cohen\u2019s decision, disclosed Wednesday in a court filing in California, where the suit was filed, came a day before a federal judge in Manhattan was set to hold a hearing regarding materials seized from Mr. Cohen during an F.B.I. raid earlier this month.Mr. Cohen cited the Manhattan investigation in his filing on Wednesday, saying that, if called as a witness in Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawsuit, \u201cI will assert my 5th Amendment rights in connection with all proceedings in this case due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the F.B.I. and U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\u201dFor days now, prosecutors from the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan have been sparring with Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers \u2014 and with lawyers for Mr. Trump \u2014 for the right to review the records first, a step that will shape the contours of how the government presses its investigation into whether Mr. Cohen tried to suppress negative news coverage of the president in the run-up to the 2016 election.Lawyers for Mr. Cohen suggested on Wednesday that they were already taking steps to gird themselves for battle. In new court papers, they said that they were setting up \u201cwar rooms\u201d to review the seized materials, testing and vetting \u201csystems\u201d to process them, and marshaling what seems to be a small legal army of \u201coperations and technology personnel, paralegals, discovery experts, associates and senior reviewing partners.\u201dThe martial tone of Mr. Cohen\u2019s filing was in contrast to a similar letter submitted to the court by lawyers for the Trump Organization, who merely noted that they were \u201cfully capable of processing and reviewing the materials.\u201d In a third submission, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers said that they would \u201cconsult closely with Mr. Cohen\u2019s counsel to assist in identifying the seized materials that relate to the president.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Empire of Guns\u2019 Challenges the Role of War in Industrialization", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryGiven that \u201cBritain was involved in major military operations\u201d for most of the years leading up to and during the Industrial Revolution, Professor Satia argues that imagining an alternative universe in which peace prevailed is a fool\u2019s errand. (\u201cIt is impossible to factor the violence out.\u201d) She contends, rather than crowding out infrastructure development, perpetual war actually \u201cproduced the financial structures that could fund it.\u201dProfessor Satia\u2019s detailed retelling of the Industrial Revolution and Britain\u2019s relentless empire expansion notably contradicts simple free market narratives. She demonstrates that the deep partnership between the public and private sectors underpinned economic growth. Professor Satia argues convincingly that the expansion of the armaments industry and the government\u2019s role in it is inseparable from the rise of innumerable associated industries from finance to mining.Government planning played a central role even in the new technologies that are \u201carguably the most iconic developments of the industrial revolution,\u201d like the steam engine and interchangeable parts manufacturing. Government investment \u201cin manufacturing and technological progress\u201d was viewed as \u201ca national obligation in a time of political vulnerability.\u201d Just as the United States government\u2019s establishment of Arpanet, the precursor to today\u2019s internet, laid the foundation of the current digital revolution, the British government\u2019s financing of a wide range of technological and organizational innovations \u2014 many directly or indirectly associated with small arms manufacture \u2014 spawned the original Industrial Revolution.On the subject of guns, \u201cEmpire of Guns\u201d seeks to elucidate not only their industrial history but also their social and moral history. To tell these parts of the story, Professor Satia uses the Quaker church\u2019s decision in 1796 to disown the prominent British gun maker, Samuel Galton Jr.On its face, the decision by the Society of Friends to censure a flagrant arms merchant in its ranks may not seem surprising. Pacifist principles were central to Quaker ideology, as was opposition to slavery. Guns fueled not just war but the slave trade. Yet Mr. Galton\u2019s father, and his father before him \u2014 and indeed many other Quakers who long dominated Birmingham\u2019s arms industry \u2014 had been unapologetic gunmakers for 70 years without attracting rebuke. What had changed in the interim, in ways that are deeply interrelated, were society and the guns themselves.Guns, for long after their introduction, were rather clumsy instruments of death. The unpredictability of guns had previously made them more suitable to terrorize than inflict harm. Despite their availability, guns were rarely fired in homicides, in robberies, in riots or even on the battlefield throughout most of the 18th century. But the British government, through enforced standardization and sponsored experimentation, drove \u201ccountless small innovations\u201d that improved gun performance significantly by the end of the century.Enhancements in gun technology increased both their ubiquity and their use in violent human interaction by the end of the 18th century. This, in turn, corresponds with the shifting social and moral meaning of these inanimate objects, which remain so profoundly associated with the \u201cimpersonal, casual violence they enable.\u201dProfessor Satia examines these changes not only across time but across cultures. Although much of this exploration is fascinating, the detail can be numbing. Tracking the exhaustive catalog of Quaker family intermarriages and gun part transactions that characterized the 18th-century armaments trade, for instance, is quite a slog.The biggest disappointment of \u201cEmpire of Guns,\u201d however, is how little detail there is on the history of gun culture in the United States and its deep hostility to government regulation. The contrast with Britain \u2014 and, indeed, all other developed nations \u2014 is so striking that it begs for some kind of explanation, particularly given that Britain was historically more economically reliant on this sector of its economy.Although Professor Satia does include a discussion of the role of guns from the founding of Jamestown in 1607 through the Revolutionary War, she focuses on the use of guns in the colonists\u2019 interactions with Native Americans and various competing European powers. In the last pages of the book, she does include a critique of the historical myths underpinning the sweeping 2008 Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. The short discussion is provocative but seems disconnected from her writing on colonial life, which didn\u2019t mention early state gun regulation or the Second Amendment at all: \u201cThe Second Amendment was not about protecting Americans from federal government [gun] seizure; it addressed the practical danger that militias might be disarmed by federal inaction, providing reassurance that if the federal government neglected to arm the militias, state governments might do so.\u201dUnder this view of the framers\u2019 intent, the \u201cissue was not self-defense, but national defense.\u201d Even if Professor Satia is correct about the problem originally targeted by the Second Amendment, \u201cEmpire of Guns\u201d provides few clues as to how or why the focus has shifted so drastically in America over the ensuing centuries.Despite mounting a vigorous public defense, Mr. Galton was ultimately unsuccessful in escaping rebuke from the Quakers. Many of the arguments he proffered have parallels to those made by contemporary gun rights advocates. Professor Satia has shown how the revolutionary changes in the very nature of guns and their role in society and the economy require those arguments to be considered in a very different light. To do that effectively at this time of national debate over our political, social and moral relationship to the modern gun, more work must be done to fully understand the source of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d when it comes to our attitudes toward guns.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "China Strikes Back at the U.S. With Plans for Its Own Tariffs", "Date": "2018-04-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China hit back at the United States on Wednesday with proposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of American soybeans, cars, chemicals and other goods, in a move likely to stoke fears that the countries\u2019 escalating confrontation could become an all-out trade war.Moving with unusual speed, Chinese officials outlined plans to make it more costly to import 106 types of American goods into China. They are intended to hit the United States square in the farm belt \u2014 a major section of President Trump\u2019s political support but also a major supplier of what China stocks in its supermarkets.\u201cChina has never succumbed to external pressure,\u201d Zhu Guangyao, vice minister of finance, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. He added, \u201cExternal pressure will only make the Chinese people more focused on economic development.\u201dThe question now is whether the two sides will intensify their efforts to punish each other before they sit down to negotiate. Neither set of tariffs go into effect right away, though the exact timing of the Chinese measures was not clear.Letting the dispute turn into a test of wills would be a mistake, said Jie Zhao, a senior research fellow at Fudan University in Shanghai.\u201cWe should negotiate in a professional way,\u201d Ms. Zhao said, \u201cand make it less ideological and emotional.\u201dBy contrast, because the United States imports significantly more from China, tariffs on the same amount of products make up roughly one-ninth of its Chinese imports. That gives the United States more room to find other Chinese products to target.Even as Chinese officials struck a defiant tone on Wednesday, they still said they wanted to avoid escalating the conflict.\u201cChina\u2019s attitude is clear,\u201d Mr. Zhu, the vice minister of finance, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a trade war because a trade war would hurt the interests of both countries.\u201dMany companies in Europe and the United States say they fear the program will create state-supported competitors, an argument that has won backing in the Trump administration. Some companies say that Beijing finds ways to force them to hand over technology if they want to sell their wares in China, an allegation that Chinese officials dispute.For now, China\u2019s new tariffs could create a more immediate issue for the Trump administration.While they include plenty of goods Americans make, they have a heavy focus on products Americans grow: soybeans, corn, cotton, beef, frozen orange juice, even tobacco and whiskey. Many of those products come largely from Republican-dominated states, where lawmakers might be expected to have some influence with President Trump and could therefore persuade him to back down from his latest trade demands.For manufactured goods, the new Chinese tariffs include cars and car parts, plastics, aerospace products and chemicals. Many of those products are also sold by European companies, giving Chinese buyers alternatives. The new tariffs announced on Wednesday will amount to 25 percent on the American products.Chinese officials \u2014 who blamed President Trump for provoking the clash \u2014 have appealed to the World Trade Organization, which sets trade rules and moderates disputes, to resolve the feud. But both sides risk censure by the W.T.O. \u2014 the Trump administration for its tariffs, and China for swiftly retaliating without a proper review.\u201cA key time has come for the United States and China to form a new consensus that includes intellectual property and the opening up of markets,\u201d said Song Guoyou, the deputy chief of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. \u201cOtherwise, trade may fluctuate a lot.\u201dKeith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, and Steven Lee Myers from Beijing.

{"Headline": "President Trump on Syria Strikes: Full Transcript and Video", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump addressed the nation on Friday night about his decision to order strikes on Syria, following a suspected chemical attack. The following is the complete text of his remarks, as prepared by The New York Times.Read here for the latest on the strikes \u00bb______PRESIDENT TRUMP:My fellow Americans. A short time ago, I ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both.Tonight, I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of the Syrian air force.Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians, this time in the town of Douma near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons used by that very terrible regime.The evil and the despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster instead.Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous, not only because they inflict gruesome suffering, but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation.The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States.The combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power: military, economic and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.I also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping and financing the criminal Assad regime.To Iran and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep.No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants and murderous dictators. In 2013, President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. Assad\u2019s recent attack and today\u2019s response are the direct result of Russia\u2019s failure to keep that promise.Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully, someday we\u2019ll get along with Russia and maybe even Iran, but maybe not.I will say this, the United States has a lot to offer with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world.In Syria, the United States, with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS, is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 percent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated.The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment and all of the anti-ISIS effort.Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and others, can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS. America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria, under no circumstances.As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home \u2014 and great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny.No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It\u2019s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place.The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold.By the end of World War I, more than one million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly specter return. So today, the nations of Britain, France and the United States of America have marshaled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality.Tonight I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions. We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria.We pray that God will guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and of peace. And we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America.Thank you and good night. Thank you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Laments \u2018Hits From Albany\u2019 in New Budget, but Keeps Spending", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe news release about Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s $89 billion executive budget revealed the depths of the city\u2019s anger at what it described as \u201chits from Albany.\u201dIt said the state had saddled the city with $530 million in costs it described as \u201cunsustainable,\u201d including $254 million that will be used to \u201caddress mismanagement of state-run subways,\u201d a $140 million \u201cshortfall\u201d in state school aid, and a $108 million \u201cunfunded mandate\u201d because of the initiative to raise the age of criminal responsibility.\u201cWe had a bad year in Albany,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said Thursday during a budget presentation at City Hall. The $530 million accounts for \u201cabout 25 percent of all the new city spending in this budget,\u201d the mayor added.But the city did not cut spending to accommodate the added costs to the spending plan for the 2019 fiscal year, instead relying on an $800 million one-time increase in personal income tax revenue to cushion the blow.\u201cThe budget is bigger,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, before issuing a caveat: \u201cWhat happened in the past was spending beyond our means and not accounting for it, not having reserves, not having savings plans.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s new plan includes $349 million more for homeless services. That\u2019s in addition to $300 million for homeless services that was added in February\u2019s preliminary budget. The money covers the 2019 fiscal year, along with some costs from the current fiscal year.\u201cShockingly, the mayor\u2019s math is wrong,\u201d Mr. Azzopardi said in a statement. \u201cHe uses political advocacy math instead of numbers.\u201dBut the budget was also notable for what was not included \u2014 mainly, the City Council Fair Fares plan, which would provide reduce priced MetroCards for low-income New Yorkers, a $400 million property tax rebate and an increase in the general reserve fund.Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, and Daniel Dromm, the Council\u2019s finance chairman, said in a statement that they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d that no money for Fair Fares and the other City Council priorities was in the executive budget, though they believed there was enough money from additional revenue and potential savings to fund the proposals.\u201cWe urge the administration to fund the Council\u2019s priorities for the good of our neighbors and our city,\u201d they said in the statement.Mayor de Blasio said his administration planned to go into negotiations with the City Council.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be really concerned about the price tag and the impact on the future of each of those choices,\u201d the mayor said.The mayor also said he was concerned about the possible effect of an executive order from Mr. Cuomo declaring a state of emergency in public housing and appointing a manager to make repairs.Mr. Azzopardi said costs would be limited to certain \u201chealth and safety repairs,\u201d and that the order would be \u201cadjusted\u201d once the city\u2019s liability is determined.The city did not account for those potential costs in its budget, but the mayor repeatedly said the city has the highest reserves in its history.While that is true, said Maria Doulis, vice president of the Citizens Budget Commission, the city\u2019s $1 billion in general reserves has not increased over last year\u2019s budget.\u201cThere are actions resulting from Albany and the state budget that the city will be forced to cover, but there are also choices the mayor made,\u201d Ms. Doulis said. \u201cThe mayor continues to spend, and he\u2019s not doing enough to counterbalance that spending by finding savings at the agency level and growing the reserves.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the difference between the mayor\u2019s executive budget and the preliminary budget. The executive budget was $300 million larger than the preliminary budget, not nearly $4 billion larger. It was nearly $4 billion larger than last year\u2019s budget.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Set to Oust Matthias M\u00fcller as C.E.O. After Diesel Scandal", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen is set to oust its chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, as it grapples with a diesel emissions scandal that has cost it billions of dollars, led to the imprisonment of two executives, and scarred the German carmaker\u2019s reputation.Herbert Diess, who is in charge of the company\u2019s flagship Volkswagen brand, was likely to succeed Mr. M\u00fcller, according to two people with knowledge of the internal discussions. The company said earlier on Tuesday that it was considering a leadership change, and a final decision was expected by the end of the week.While there was no obvious trigger for Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s departure at this moment, his efforts to lead the company beyond the 2015 emissions cheating scandal have stalled.The repercussions have continued to multiply, tainting not only Volkswagen but also its rivals BMW and Daimler just as they grapple with an industrywide shift toward electric and self-driving vehicles. Political leaders are pressing the German carmakers to compensate diesel owners who bought cars that turned out to be dirtier than advertised, which could add to the already astronomical cost of the scandal.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.\u201cThis is a chance for Volkswagen to make a change,\u201d said Christian Strenger, the former chief executive of Deutsche Bank\u2019s wealth management division, who is suing Volkswagen because he said it violated its duty to shareholders by failing to be forthcoming about the emissions scandal. But Mr. Strenger said that Mr. Diess would have to \u201chave the guts to clean things up.\u201dVolkswagen is still the target of a wide-ranging criminal investigation that has included searches of Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s offices. However, there has been no new information that would have prompted Mr. M\u00fcller to leave now, said Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the prosecutors in Braunschweig who are conducting the inquiry.German prosecutors have not charged anyone in the Volkswagen case, but they expect to complete their investigation this year. Two former Volkswagen executives, James Liang and Oliver Schmidt, are serving prison sentences in the United States after pleading guilty to charges including conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act.Mr. M\u00fcller was a high-ranking executive involved in product development at the same time that the company was developing the illegal software and deploying it in vehicles. He also worked closely with some of the people under investigation over possible involvement in the emissions scandal. Mr. M\u00fcller has insisted he was ignorant of any wrongdoing, but he has nonetheless faced the accusation that he was part of a system that allowed it to take place.Mr. Diess has a shorter history at Volkswagen than most other members of the management board, but he would nonetheless satisfy the company\u2019s longtime preference for choosing chief executives from within its own ranks. He joined Volkswagen in July 2015 from BMW, where he had been a member of the management board in charge of product development. He has succeeded in improving the profitability of the division that makes Volkswagen brand cars like the Golf, Jetta and Passat. The division accounts for most of the cars that Volkswagen sells but is far less profitable than the company\u2019s Audi and Porsche luxury brands.Mr. Diess, who managed factories in Britain for BMW, is much more comfortable speaking English than Mr. M\u00fcller and will have an easier time communicating with investors and media outside Germany. Mr. Diess has also not spent his career steeped in Volkswagen culture and may be in a better position to change it.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.But he will most likely face resistance from entrenched interests within the company. He has already clashed with Volkswagen\u2019s powerful workers council, which has de facto veto power over major decisions.And Mr. Diess must answer to Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the chairman of the supervisory board and former chief financial officer of Volkswagen. Mr. P\u00f6tsch is a confidant of the Porsche family, which via a holding company owns more than half of Volkswagen\u2019s shares. The family, descendants of the man who created the Volkswagen Beetle for Adolf Hitler, has been criticized by shareholders for failing to appoint more independent members of the supervisory board and resisting more sweeping change.The challenges that Mr. Diess faces are considerable. Even now, the diesel scandal continues to corrode Volkswagen\u2019s reputation.In January, The New York Times reported that the company had helped to finance experiments in which monkeys were forced to breathe diesel fumes at a lab in Albuquerque. The exposure of the research caused a furor in Germany and beyond. Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the experiments, the German Parliament debated possible consequences, and animal rights activists demonstrated outside Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg.Volkswagen\u2019s cheating has also had an effect on the wider industry. Diesel was once the most popular engine option in Europe because of its fuel economy. But diesel vehicle sales have been dropping since Volkswagen\u2019s deception was uncovered.Volkswagen\u2019s stock price closed the day 3.1 percent higher, at 169 euros, or about $208, on the news of Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s upcoming departure.Amie Tsang contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding a Place (and a Decent Kitchen) to Call Her Own", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntDuring and after graduate school at Pace University, Haoran Yang lived in Chelsea with roommates.Then, three years ago, she found a new roommate situation on Craigslist and moved into a one-bedroom condominium in Midtown East near Sutton Place. For $1,600 a month, she occupied the bedroom. The condominium\u2019s owner, a retired woman who traveled often, took a curtained-off corner of the living room.\u201cWe\u2019ve become like a family,\u201d said Ms. Yang, who came to New York from China to study finance. \u201cI am a twentysomething and she is older than my mom, and she treated me like a daughter.\u201dMs. Yang, now 29, wanted a decent kitchen and a location with an easy commute to her Midtown office.For her monthly budget, $2,000 to $2,200, she assumed she would find a studio in a doorman building, similar to the condo building. But Ms. Park told her that if she wanted more space \u2014 and didn\u2019t mind giving up amenities like an elevator or laundry room \u2014 she could instead get a one-bedroom in a no-frills building on the Upper East Side.\u201cThat\u2019s perfect, because I don\u2019t mind a walk-up,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cI have a lot of stuff, and I feel more comfortable if I have a separate room.\u201dOne evening last fall, Ms. Park took her to see two relatively spacious top-floor one-bedrooms in the East 70s, each for $2,150. One faced Third Avenue.\u201cI could hear the traffic come and go,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cEven at 6 or 7 p.m., the avenue is very busy.\u201dAnd the kitchen was a collection of appliances against a wall. The apartment felt outdated \u2014 but not as outdated as the second unit they saw, which faced away from the avenue.The next day was tightly scheduled. A one-bedroom for $2,000, also in the East 70s, was nicely renovated. But while the pictures made it look spacious, the bedroom was tiny and the hallway narrow.Ms. Yang and Ms. Park moved on to the East 80s, where the saw a building with two one-bedrooms available, on the top floor and the ground floor; the rents were $2,150 and $2,300, respectively.Ms. Yang fell for the sunny top-floor apartment, with its open kitchen. But the listing agent, en route, informed them by text that it had been rented earlier that morning.The ground-floor unit wasn\u2019t ideal. \u201cThe layout was like a train, long and skinny,\u201d Ms. Yang said. Plus, it faced the trash cans.Most of all, it was situated just beyond the building\u2019s entrance, with its double doors.\u201cI\u2019ve never lived in that kind of building,\u201d Ms. Yang said. \u201cThe door slams so hard. I didn\u2019t want to live on the ground floor in an apartment close to the door.\u201d In her previous doorman buildings, the door was always open and attended.But she was encouraged. The apartments she had seen were generally livable. Still, even if a place was otherwise fine, there was often one dealbreaker: a noisy street, a dingy bathroom, a tiny bedroom.Nearby, another top-floor apartment was available for $2,100. Up they climbed.This one was still occupied. It had two windows looking out onto the street, a separate eat-in kitchen and a quiet bedroom facing the back. And Ms. Yang was excited to learn that the outgoing tenant was eager to sell some furniture.\u201cUsually, a $2,100 apartment doesn\u2019t look this finished,\u201d Ms. Park said. \u201cWe took action right away.\u201d Ms. Yang left a deposit on the spot.Two more places were still on the schedule, but one was on busy East 72nd Street and the other, on Second Avenue near her old neighborhood, was dimly lit.\u201cIt was obvious what was the best out of all of them,\u201d Ms. Park said. \u201cThe space was right, the location was right, and the furniture really helped.\u201dMs. Yang paid a broker\u2019s fee of 15 percent of a year\u2019s rent, or almost $3,800, and arrived last winter.For $550, she bought from the departing tenant the sofa \u2014 just a year old and originally from Ikea \u2014 as well as a large wardrobe against a living-room wall.\u201cMost people want a no-fee apartment, but she was willing to see all the options to find the best one for her, because she is planning to live there for a long time,\u201d Ms. Park said.Ms. Yang ordered some additional furniture and \u201ca lot of cooking utilities, because I cook almost every day,\u201d she said.Her only disappointment is the uneven floor, which slopes so much her kitchen table tilts. \u201cWhen you walk, you can feel the floor is not even,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I am eating dinner, I feel my food is falling.\u201dEverything else, however, is to her liking. \u201cI am very happy for this small place,\u201d she said.EMAIL thehunt@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

Trump was elected president, she made a common liberal refrain \u2014 \u201cIf Trump wins, I\u2019m leaving the country\u201d \u2014 reality, deciding not to return home with her daughters, Aubrey and Gabriella. After traveling through Asia and Europe, she is now figuring out how to start a business selling products through Amazon to finance the life of an itinerant-by-choice single mother.\u201cIf the G.O.P. gets out of office, if our education system improves, if we get universal health care, I\u2019ll move back to the States because we\u2019ll get tired of traveling,\u201d Ms. Quain said. But until that utopian day arrives, \u201cWe\u2019re unplugging from the Matrix.\u201dThe Quains are not the only family that has of late dispensed with the trappings of the American dream (house, school, career) and gone nomad. Hopping from one vacation rental to the next or piling into R.V.s, they have sold or rented out their homes and unloaded most of their possessions, financing their travels with savings or work done remotely.Lainie Liberti, an administrator of the group, said it\u2019s not just the tense political climate in the United States motivating people to leave. \u201cPeople are not seeing a future,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are starting to focus on living now and focusing on their children. They are re-evaluating what is important to them.\u201dMs. Quain, who worked as much as 100 hours a week running her own company, worried about the values she was imparting to her daughters. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to grow up to be worker bees,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to grow up to be freethinking entrepreneurs.\u201dLike many of the new expats, she is home-schooling (\u201cworldschooling\u201d is the more popular term). Her daughters are learning Spanish at a Medellin day camp and spend their spare time playing Minecraft and Roblox, video games they sometimes play online with other traveling children. She hopes eventually they\u2019ll start their own YouTube channel, if someone will teach them. \u201cOnce I get my business up and running,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll hire people to teach them how to do things.\u201d\u201cAll you need to do is have a laptop and be an intelligent person,\u201d Mr. Kortman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a specific skill set.\u201dBurdened by high rent, along with car and student loan payments, they did not see a future where they could buy a home in the area and still pay down their debts. \u201cOur family was telling us to settle down,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said from Prague last winter. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t see the value in that.\u201dLast spring, he and his wife sold their car, their furniture and most of their possessions for about $10,000. So far, traveling has been cheaper. In Croatia, for example, their expenses fell by 60 percent, allowing them to pay down their student loans faster. \u201cIf we can make it work, then we\u2019re going to keep going as long as we can,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said.Mr. and Ms. Gillespie travel with High Sierra backpacks. Kailen has her own pack, too: a tiny one shaped like a bumblebee. They pared down their belongings to the bare essentials, although Ms. Gillespie did carry an orange Bebe skirt and Zara top around Italy all summer because she thought it would make for a great photograph in Florence (she got her shot and unloaded the outfit). \u201cIt was totally impractical,\u201d she said.Jessica and William Swenson are financing an 11-month around-the-world trip with their three small children through a mix of savings, inheritance, a severance package and the income from renting out their four-bedroom house with a pool in Livermore, Calif.The family is traveling light, carrying only backpacks \u2014 even the children, Ezra, 8, Theo, 6, and Vesper, 5, have them \u2014 with a few changes of clothes. Mr. Swenson, 36, an accountant, bald with a full beard, wears a kilt. \u201cHe\u2019s Scottish and loves the un-bifurcated life,\u201d Mrs. Swenson said, speaking over FaceTime from an Airbnb in Bali, Indonesia. The family was waiting out a volcanic eruption, hoping their flight to Australia would not be canceled because of ash.The Swensons embarked on the trip as a sort of lemonade-from-lemons move after Mr. Swenson\u2019s job relocated, his mother died and the family\u2019s live-in child care moved out.\u201cWe were like, \u2018That removed all our obstacles,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Swenson said. But even though social media is accessible from around the world, they were also relieved to escape what Mrs. Swenson describes as \u201ca general feeling of anger and bitterness,\u201d that had descended on the progressive Bay Area in the months since Mr. Trump became president. \u201cI\u2019m not really political,\u201d she said. \u201cI try not to engage.\u201dOf course, sometimes people they meet abroad want to talk United States politics. This the Swensons deflect. \u201cWe kind of put the kibosh on it,\u201d Mrs. Swenson said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to be students, and not talk about horrible things.\u201dBut not everyone who takes their life on the road does so to escape an unsatisfying one. Sonja Jernstrom, 37, and Chris Jernstrom, 36, left their home in Seattle in June to take a 14-month trip around the world with their two children, Ben, 7, and Emma, 4.They\u2019re driving through the Americas in a truck with a 70-square-foot camper before they head off to Asia, the Middle East and Europe. \u201cIt was an opportunity to take a midcareer break,\u201d said Mr. Jernstrom, who quit his job in investment management; Ms. Jernstrom is a former environmental scientist. The family is financing their travels with savings and income earned renting out their four-bedroom house out on Airbnb.Seeing Latin America has been eye-opening. When Mr. Trump was elected, \u201cwe both felt like, \u2018Gosh, maybe we want to move to Europe,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jernstrom said from Chile. But \u201cthis trip has made me appreciate so much about how much we have in the U.S. It\u2019s made me feel like I want to go back to the U.S. and make things better at home.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a country the Swenson family visited in December.

Adams, told a few dozen people assembled at a law office at MetroTech Center that he was raising money for a mayoral run.On Monday night, the comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, held a birthday fund-raiser at an Asian-themed restaurant in Chelsea \u2014 although he has yet to say openly that he is running.And the public advocate, Letitia James, who in removing herself from consideration as a candidate for lieutenant governor last week said that \u201cthe only job I want is right here in New York City,\u201d has sent out invitations to a \u201cspring gala\u201d fund-raiser on May 10.All four have been making calls to potential donors, according to a person who reported receiving entreaties from each of them.And while the election is three and a half years away, the city\u2019s electoral calculus has changed with term limits. All three citywide officeholders, the borough presidents and the majority of City Council members, are serving their final terms.\u201cYou have pretty much the entire leadership of the government switching over,\u201d said Suri Kasirer, a political consultant.That also means that a host of politicians are thinking about what to run for next.\u201cThree years goes quickly and everybody in this group is seasoned, so they know to get their name out and be very five-borough, and raise money in different places,\u201d said the Manhattan borough president, Gale A. Brewer, who so far is watching from the sidelines.All four candidates are busy raising money with the hope of making a strong showing when candidates are required to make their first campaign finance report of the 2021 electoral cycle.They are all playing catch-up to Mr. Stringer, who retained $1.4 million from his last comptroller campaign, which he is permitted to transfer to his next run for office. Mr. Diaz had $430,000 remaining in his previous campaign account and Mr. Adams had $300,000. Ms. James had only $31,000 left that she can use for her next race.And while most or all of the candidates have told donors and supporters in private that they are running, in public they are more circumspect.Two people who attended Mr. Adams\u2019s event last week said that he stated unequivocally that he was running for mayor. About 40 people were present at the meeting, at a law firm in MetroTech Center, in Brooklyn, among them the former governor Eliot Spitzer. There were cold cuts and sushi on a table but few people ate.The two people who were present, who asked not to be identified to discuss a private meeting, said that Mr. Adams displayed a bracket, like those used for college basketball tournaments, and said that instead of March Madness \u2014 the slogan used for the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament \u2014 this was going to be Mayoral Madness. The bracket included Mr. Adams, Mr. Stringer, Ms. James and Mr. Diaz, and Mr. Adams said that the contest would come down to a final showdown between him and Mr. Stringer.Mr. Adams then said that Mr. de Blasio had spent so much time in African-American communities when he first ran for mayor in 2013 that he had essentially \u201cout-blacked\u201d the race\u2019s black candidate, William Thompson.Mr. Adams went on to say that in the 2021 race he was going to \u201cout-white\u201d Mr. Stringer, by winning over white constituencies. Mr. Adams and Ms. James are black. Mr. Stringer is white. Mr. Diaz is Hispanic. Mr. Adams explained that his past as a police officer gave him the experience to assure white voters that he would make public safety a priority.In an interview last week, Mr. Adams was asked about his comments.\u201cI was being colorful,\u201d he said, explaining that just as Mr. de Blasio pressed issues like stop and frisk that had an impact in black communities, he planned to take his message of public safety to white neighborhoods. \u201cPeople look at a black candidate and they think he can\u2019t go into the Baysides, Bay Ridges and Marine Parks, and I\u2019m not going to be the candidate that can\u2019t do that.\u201dMr. Adams said that other potential candidates \u201ccontinue to play coy\u201d with the public when it comes to their aspirations. But when asked whether he was running, he would not provide a simple yes or no. \u201cI want to be extremely clear, I am pursuing running for mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s different from a formal announcement.\u201dMr. Diaz, the only candidate who has filed papers with election authorities indicating that he is a candidate for mayor, was also reluctant to say explicitly that he was running.\u201cIt is very early,\u201d Mr. Diaz said. \u201cThere\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m looking at it. I\u2019m exploring it. I\u2019m considering it.\u201d Pressed, he said, \u201cI\u2019m raising money for the sole purpose of running for mayor.\u201d Mr. Diaz has sent out invitations to a Yankees-themed birthday fund-raiser on May 3, encouraging supporters to commit to raising money for him, with those who can raise $25,000 designated as M.V.P.s.Mr. Stringer also refused to say what office he intended to run for next.\u201cI\u2019m building a political foundation for whatever comes next,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cI love public service. I want to continue serving this city. Part of that is building the financial infrastructure to be competitive in 2021.\u201dMs. James said that in the last few days she has held \u201ca number of meetings with individuals\u201d to discuss her possible next run for office. \u201cI am examining my options for the future and so we are exploring the possibility of running for mayor in 2021,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Publisher Broke Campaign Finance Law by Paying to Suppress Another Trump Story, Filing Alleges", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe publisher of The National Enquirer faced new claims on Thursday that it violated campaign finance laws after news outlets reported that the company paid $30,000 to a Trump World Tower doorman peddling a salacious allegation about President Trump.The watchdog group Common Cause filed complaints with the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, saying the 2015 payment, for a tip that never resulted in a published story, was intended to influence the 2016 election.The new complaint was based on reports that the doorman, Dino Sajudin, was peddling an unsubstantiated allegation that Mr. Trump had fathered a child with a Trump Tower employee in the late 1980s. American Media Inc., The Enquirer\u2019s publisher, ordered a halt to reporting soon after it paid $30,000 for Mr. Sajudin\u2019s story, effectively silencing him, according to the reports.Those accounts, in The Associated Press and The New Yorker, followed an article about the deal with Mr. Sajudin on Wednesday in one of American Media\u2019s own outlets, RadarOnline. The article said that Mr. Sajudin passed a lie-detector test affirming that he believed the story about Mr. Trump and the woman \u2014 which was based on secondhand information \u2014 but that his allegations ultimately did not check out.On Thursday, American Media released another statement, saying \u201cA.M.I. categorically denies that Donald Trump or Michael Cohen had anything to do with its decision not to pursue\u201d Mr. Sajudin\u2019s story. \u201cThe suggestion that David Pecker has ever used company funds to \u2018shut down\u2019 this or any investigation is not true,\u201d it added, referring to A.M.I.\u2019s chairman, who is a close friend of Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}

But who wants to step in? Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York.The truth is, the governor wears his new identity like a cheap suit \u2014 stretched and baggy in all the wrong places. The good news is that despite his ambition, Mr. Cuomo probably has little chance of capturing a presidential nomination. But that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t need a strong challenge from the left. If New York\u2019s activists can keep Mr. Cuomo from striding onto the national stage in 2020 under a thin veneer of Bernie-ism, we can send the Democrats a message they need to hear.

She\u2019s campaigning on a platform that includes rent control, putting more money into public schools and ending mass incarceration. The left should support her.It\u2019s an uncomfortable matchup for many of us. Do we really need to get behind a rich celebrity? I feel weird about it, too. But the answer is yes.She\u2019s taking a similar approach to her campaign. Ms. Nixon declared her candidacy in Brownsville, one of Brooklyn\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. She has called for legalizing marijuana, single-payer health care and, citing Mr. Sanders, raising taxes on the rich.Ms. Nixon\u2019s critics say that her appeal will be only in New York City, but there\u2019s good reason to think she will find support elsewhere. In Brownsville, she cited \u201cthe tyranny of landlords.\u201d That\u2019s not just an issue in Brooklyn: Places like Syracuse face severe housing crises, and homelessness statewide has grown around 40 percent under Mr. Cuomo as of 2016.

But anyone wanting to assess where the stellar foreign growth came from \u2013 and whether it can continue \u2014 would have little company data with which to work.Twitter on Monday did not break down international revenues by region. It did say that Japan, its second largest source of revenue, brought in $117 million, a 61 percent increase. Facebook, in contrast, releases revenue and user numbers for four regions. That Twitter offers limited international data is perhaps not that surprising, given that the company does not release a tally for daily active users, a number Facebook provides. (Twitter does release a growth number for daily users but only provides an actual total for monthly active users.)Twitter\u2019s revenue trends may at some point prompt it to divulge more. Foreign advertising revenue accounted for half its sales in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent in the same period a year ago.Ned Segal, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer, on Wednesday said the strength of international revenue could mean that they account for more than half of the total. In the first quarter, foreign ad revenue surged 51 percent, compared with the year-earlier period. In the United States, the increase was just 1 percent.Mr. Segal did mention some first-quarter \u201chighlights\u201d for the international operations. A good ad sales performance and audience growth powered Japan\u2019s results, he said, adding that ads outside of China for Chinese exporters were also a source of strength. Britain, Brazil and the Middle East were also bright spots, Mr. Segal said.Twitter\u2019s stock slid on Wednesday despite the good numbers. With a little more clarity, investors may be willing to give them more weight.- Peter EavisComcast has formally bid nearly $31 billion for the European broadcaster. Sky has withdrawn its recommendation of Fox\u2019s year-and-a-half-old bid for full control.What\u2019s next?Keep these dates in mind\u2022 On May 1, Britain\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, is expected to offer its recommendation on whether Fox\u2019s bid should allowed to go through.\u2022 By June 13 or so, Britain\u2019s culture secretary, Matthew Hancock, is expected to make a final decision on Fox\u2019s offer.In the meantime, Comcast is working to obtain regulatory approvals for its own bid.

Here\u2019s who\u2019s working for Comcast and Sky \u2014 and Fox, which may come back with a higher bid.Comcast\u2022 Robey Warshaw, the small boutique investment bank run by \u201cthe two Simons.\u201d Both Mr. Robey and Mr. Warshaw are on the deal.\u2022 Evercore Partners, led by co-founder Roger Altman and senior deal maker Eduardo Mestre\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch (which is working as corporate brokers, a peculiarly British function that is something like relationship banking and market surveillance), led by Adrian Mee, a global co-head of M.&A., and Tim Waddell, a vice chairman of corporate and investment banking for Europe and a veteran corporate broker.\u2022 Wells Fargo, led by Stephen Locke, a managing director.Sky\u2022 Morgan Stanley (financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Simon Smith, head of investment banking in Europe; Anthony Zammit, a managing director; and Ben Grindley of corporate broking.\u2022 PJT Partners, led by partners Simon Lyons and Scott Matlock.\u2022 Barclays (as financial adviser and corporate broker), led by Mark Astaire, chairman of corporate broking and Richard Taylor, co-head of investment banking.Fox\u2022 Centerview Partners, led by co-founder and longtime Fox adviser Blair Effron and partners David Cohen and James Hartop\u2022 Goldman Sachs, led by investment banking co-head and longtime Fox adviser John Waldron; Mark Sorrell, head of M.&A. for EMEA (and a son of Martin Sorrell); and managing directors Mike Smith and Owain Evans\u2022 JPMorgan Chase, led by Jennifer Nason, global chairwoman of T.M.T.; Hugo Baring, co-head of T.M.T. banking for EMEA; Marco Caggiano, a managing director; and Dwayne Lysaght, head of U.K. M.&A.How the offers stack up:\u2022 Comcast: \u00a312.50 a share, and pledges to maintain Sky News\u2019s independence\u2022 Fox: \u00a310.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t yet own. (Disney, which had already agreed to buy the bulk of Fox in a separate deal, has also offered to buy Sky News to satisfy editorial independence concerns.)Financial companies are on the brink of having one of their top demands granted: an end to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s public database of complaints about their products and services.What\u2019s in the databaseWhy finance institutions want it shut downThey say the database can be misleading because the agency publishes a record of all the complaints that it receives, without vetting them. The companies also argue that they already have channels for resolving customer disputes.Why consumer groups say that could be problematicConsumer groups argue that taking the database offline would neuter one of its core purposes: pushing companies to take complaints more seriously.More than 185,000 complaints to the bureau have been resolved with some form of compensation or relief, often with financial institutions changing their practices or making customers whole.The social media company became the latest firm to easily beat expectations, only to have its shares tumble.If those stock moves sound familiar, that\u2019s because similar moves happened at 3M and Caterpillar on Tuesday. Despite meeting expectations, 3M tumbled after it lowered the high end of its outlook. Caterpillar, meanwhile, raised its guidance for the year, but comments on its conference call that the first quarter would be the \u201chigh-water mark\u201d for earnings per share sent the stock sliding.Why such big moves? It\u2019s worth pointing back to what DealBook\u2019s Peter Eavis wrote Tuesday:\u201cDespite all the bullish talk about earnings and the economy, stocks looked vulnerable going into the first-quarter earnings season. Analysts are expecting earnings for companies in the S.&P. 500 to grow 25 percent this year, an unusually large increase. At the 2018 forecast, the S.&P. 500 looks temperately valued at 17 times earnings. But looking back, stocks appear expensive, at 21 times the S.&P. 500\u2019s earnings for 2017. This large gap between future and historical valuations creates a chasm that stocks can fall into if profits disappoint. If companies, like 3M did on Tuesday, provide underwhelming earnings outlooks, investors will stop believing that stocks are cheap, based on 2018 earnings.\u201dIn the case of Twitter, the stock is up about 30 percent this year and more than 75 percent since late October. A rally like that leaves little room to disappoint.Wall Street executives are eagerly awaiting a relaxation of the supplemental leverage rule, which governs how much their firms can borrow. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency are for it; the F.D.I.C. and Lael Brainard, an Obama administration appointee at the Fed, are opposed.Why relax the rule? It\u2019s making it too hard for banks to do business. \u201cThe best analogy is that it\u2019s like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,\u201d Greg Baer of the Clearing House Association told Peter.Why keep it? The rule provides adequate protection in case there\u2019s another downturn, and banks have been doing fine otherwise. \u201cU.S. bank lending has been healthy over recent years and profits are strong,\u201d Ms. Brainerd said in a speech last week.\u2022 There are more Republican senators and Democratic governors named John than there are women in either group.\u2022 There are almost as many C.E.O.s named John in the Fortune 500 as female C.E.O.s in that group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kushners Saw Redemption in the White House. It Was a Mirage.", "Date": "2018-04-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, with his son newly installed as a top aide to the president, Mr. Kushner even expressed hope, one close family friend said, that he might receive a pardon.Absolution, however, is not what the White House has conferred on the Kushners. For the patriarch and his family, the pinnacle of American political power has turned out to be a wellspring of trouble.Jared Kushner is embroiled in the special counsel inquiry, including questions about whether he discussed the family\u2019s business with foreign officials \u2014 a suggestion he has denied. His younger brother, Josh, has opposed the Trump presidency, driving a wedge between the men in a family that prizes close ties.The elder Mr. Kushner, his company and his family are assailed by criminal and regulatory inquiries largely rooted in their newfound access to presidential power. The family\u2019s East Coast-based real estate empire is under a fiscal and ethical cloud, shunned by some investors who fear being dragged into the spotlight trained on the Kushner nexus with President Trump. Two major Manhattan properties are on creditors\u2019 watch lists, one after foreign investors backed out of a financing deal.Slender, silver-haired and impeccably dressed, Mr. Kushner, 63, was by turns charming, blunt and philosophical, an engaging contrast to Jared Kushner\u2019s more stilted persona. He made little effort to hide his contempt for the investigations of his business and family, saying that the stacks of records he has voluntarily given investigators rebut any suggestion of impropriety.\u201cGo knock yourselves out for the next 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201dState regulators in New York are examining Kushner loans from that bank and two others, including lines of credit to Jared Kushner. Jared Kushner\u2019s White House meetings with lenders and partners of Kushner Companies have raised repeated questions about conflicts between his official and personal interests.Charles Kushner is adamant that his family remains united in the face of their difficulties. But friends say Jared Kushner\u2019s sister is distressed by investigators\u2019 focus on her, and there are tensions between Jared and Josh over Mr. Trump. That Josh Kushner, 32, has made no secret of the fact that he did not vote for Mr. Trump upset his brother, several friends said. Voting records show Josh Kushner did not vote in the 2016 presidential election. Josh\u2019s spokesman, Jesse Derris, said the brothers \u201care just as close as ever.\u201dTales of his distaste for the Trump administration continue to surface, most recently at a January party at Oscar, a health insurance firm that he helped found. According to one attendee, Josh Kushner listed the year\u2019s challenges, concluding with a laugh: \u201cWe survived Donald Trump. Don\u2019t tweet that. Really, don\u2019t tweet that. I\u2019ll get in so much trouble.\u201dCharles Kushner still does not speak to his brother, whom he publicly blamed for instigating the investigation that led to his two-year prison sentence. Asked whether he hoped for presidential absolution, Mr. Kushner said, \u201cI would prefer not to have a pardon\u201d because it would trigger only further publicity.His real estate empire is now under a national microscope, its every deal scrutinized for hints of federal influence. And while Charles Kushner insists his bankers are loyal, investors are eager and deals are plentiful, some business associates say the drumbeat of unflattering headlines is putting tremendous pressure on the family business. Banks must assess the risk of any continuing regulatory or criminal inquiries before making loans; potential investors are worried that they could come under scrutiny or that projects will be delayed or fall apart.Mr. Kushner scoffs at such fears. \u201cWe are actively involved in more than $3 billion of projects and banks are providing $1.5 billion of financing in the first six months of this year,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes that seem like we are lacking in funds?\u201dThat said, the company has been forced to rule out two major sources of financing \u2014 foreign nations\u2019 sovereign wealth funds and a federal program that offers foreign investors a path to citizenship \u2014 after questions about the propriety of tapping them given Jared Kushner\u2019s foreign policy influence. While Mr. Kushner transferred some holdings in Kushner Companies to a trust run by his mother, he retains the vast majority \u2014 holdings estimated to be worth at least $761 million.The finance minister of the tiny, oil-rich Gulf nation of Qatar also met separately early last year with both Josh and Charles Kushner at a time when the Qataris were seeking White House support against their powerful regional rivals. Josh Kushner, who runs the investment firm Thrive Capital, which recently raised a $700 million fund, cleared the meeting with outside counsel beforehand, his spokesman said.\u201cJosh met with the minister for less than 30 minutes,\u201d Mr. Derris said. \u201cThere has been no contact since that time.\u201dThe elder Mr. Kushner said he made clear to the minister that he had no interest in government-sponsored investment, and like his son, has had no further contact with him.The family\u2019s costliest and most ambitious real estate project \u2014 a $7.5 billion plan to raze their 41-story Fifth Avenue office tower and replace it with a new architecturally dazzling one, twice as high \u2014 was an early casualty of the family\u2019s White House connection. A financing pact with a Chinese firm connected to some of the Communist Party\u2019s leading families collapsed in the face of public scrutiny.Now the Kushners are scrambling. They have only 10 months before a $1.2 billion mortgage comes due to find a profitable use for a 61-year-old office tower with dark corridors, low ceilings and too few tenants to cover the interest on the purchase loan.By some estimates, the skyscraper is now worth about one-quarter less than the then-record price of $1.8 billion they paid for it in 2007. Vornado Realty Trust, which also took a 49.5 percent share in the office space, wants out. The shortfall this year between the income it generates and the interest on the loan exceeds $30 million, split evenly with the Kushners. Charles Kushner says that he is willing to buy out his partner, but some business associates say that would only double an already money-losing real estate bet.Company officials have sought to minimize the effect of the tower\u2019s financial troubles, saying it is one property among many and they marked down its value so it is less than 4 percent of Mr. Kushner\u2019s net worth, estimated at $2.5 billion.Debt for the Kushners\u2019 portion of the Times Square property at 229 West 43rd Street is also on a watch list, according to Trepp, a firm that analyzes mortgage-backed securities. But both Mr. Kushner and Laurent Morali, the firm\u2019s president, call that building, the former headquarters of The New York Times, an excellent investment. They insisted that the 2016 loan from Deutsche Bank, which is now under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, was an arm\u2019s-length business transaction.But financing for a third $800 million project, two towers across the Hudson River in suburban New Jersey, has been delayed by yet more questions arising from the family\u2019s White House connections. The company had hoped to attract $150 million from foreign investors via a federal visa program, EB-5, that offers green cards and eligibility for permanent residence to those who invest at least $500,000 in an American business.The Kushners apologized and abandoned the program \u2014 purely to avoid unwanted attention, Mr. Kushner said. \u201cMy daughter, our company, did nothing wrong,\u201d he said.The company said it had outsourced the applications to a third party, and added that it had corrected the errors. But the New York City Buildings Department said it was investigating whether city laws were broken.Ben Protess and Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Fills Trump\u2019s Empty Seat at Latin America Summit", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr.\u00a0Serrano, a native of Chile, has written extensively\u00a0about Latin America.Vice President Mike Pence may be taking President Trump\u2019s place at the Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru, on Friday, but the vacuum left by the United States\u2019 steady retreat from the region was filled, much earlier, by China.China\u2019s soft power is perhaps most visible at the southern edge of Argentina, in Santa Cruz province. This pristine Patagonian terrain, home to glacial lakes and one of Argentina\u2019s last free-flowing rivers, has also become home to bulldozers and cranes made by Shantui, the Chinese construction giant. The machines are excavating the area around the Santa Cruz River to build two hydroelectric dams, financed by $4.7 billion from the China Development Bank and built by China Gezhouba Group with partners from Argentina. When completed, the dams will flood roughly 116,000 acres, generating 5 percent of the country\u2019s energy needs and an estimated 5,000 local jobs.The Santa Cruz project is just one of the $141 billion in loan commitments China made to Latin America from 2005 to 2016. China\u2019s lending now surpasses lending from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.But China, unlike those agencies, isn\u2019t putting short-term conditions on those loans or pushing for austerity measures. Instead, its interest in Latin America is part of a long strategic game, an effort to assert its influence around the world, quench its need for raw materials and control the flow of global trade through Chinese-funded transportation hubs.While the United States has been retreating from its southern neighbors for years, Mr. Trump has added outright hostility to neglect. Five months after taking office, he reversed Barack Obama\u2019s historic overtures to Cuba and stifled United States business ties with the country, a move perceived as potentially devastating for the island\u2019s private sector. Threats to blow up Nafta, cut aid to Honduras and Colombia, and militarize the United States border with Mexico have underscored Mr. Trump\u2019s contempt.The message is not lost on Latin America, and it is much louder than anything Mr. Pence may say in Lima, where he is expected to argue that the United States, not China, is Latin America\u2019s preferred trading partner. He may also announce some progress on a renegotiated Nafta.United States influence in the region lingers, of course. The United States remains Latin America\u2019s largest trading partner. Despite the pivot to China, certain countries have resisted its dominion, wary of China\u2019s thirst for raw materials and its lax environmental standards. President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, breaking from his predecessor, has sought warmer ties with the West. And however strong Mr. Trump\u2019s xenophobic rhetoric may be, Latin America is intimately tied to the United States by immigration. Remittances from the states to the region amounted to $74 billion in 2016, a 7.4 percent increase from the previous year.This is a good moment for a few friendly gestures. Some of China\u2019s splashiest megaprojects, including a transcontinental railway from Brazil to Peru, a high-speed railway in Mexico and an interoceanic canal project in Nicaragua, have run into trouble. Germany has already emerged as a potential investor in the stalled Brazil-Peru railway.Meanwhile, Chinese firms have begun to expand into sectors other than natural resources and transportation, particularly into energy infrastructure projects in Chile, Argentina and Ecuador, as China makes good on Xi Jinping\u2019s pledge to deliver $250 billion in direct investment and $500 billon in bilateral trade by 2025.Mr. Xi has backed that lofty promise by visiting Latin America three times in his first three years in office. The Chinese president doesn\u2019t have a seat at the table for the Summit of the Americas, but he doesn\u2019t really need one.Alfonso Serrano is an independent journalist who writes frequently about Latin America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of America to Stop Financing Makers of Military-Style Guns", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBank of America will stop lending money to gun manufacturers that make military-inspired firearms for civilian use, such as the AR-15-style rifles that have been used in multiple mass shootings, a company executive said Tuesday.The policy is the latest example of Wall Street wading into the divisive gun control debate after Citigroup\u2019s announcement last month that it would require business customers to restrict certain types of firearms sales.The bank works with \u201cjust a handful of manufacturers,\u201d with whom it has had \u201cintense conversations over the last few months,\u201d Ms. Finucane said.

A number of these groups are also entitled to raise money from other sources for political purposes, without filing the disclosures that are required of other individuals and entities. Why? They\u2019ve got God on their side.Last fall, for example, according to forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service, Focus on the Family, a conservative Christian organization that promotes socially conservative views on matters of public and family policy, declared itself a church.Focus on the Family doesn\u2019t have a congregation, doesn\u2019t host weddings or funerals and doesn\u2019t hold services. What it does do, with its nearly $90 million annual budget, is deliver radio and other programming that is often political to an estimated audience of 38 million listeners in the United States and beyond. It has funded ads against state legislators who support bills intended to prevent discrimination against L.G.B.T. people and it leads programs to combat what it calls \u201cgay activism\u201d in public schools.Why would such a group want to call itself a church? Short answer: money. Churches can raise tax-deductible contributions more easily, and with fewer restrictions, than other nonprofits can. They also enjoy additional tax shelters, such as property tax exemptions for clergy members \u2014 or was that conservative radio personalities?Next, churches can also enjoy the benefits of dark money. Unlike other groups, churches are required to disclose essentially nothing about who or what supplies them with their funds. And Focus on the Family, like a number of other groups on the religious right, may worry that its opposition to same-sex relationships will land it on the wrong side of anti-discrimination law. After all, the \u201cmoral behavior standards\u201d in their employee guidelines prohibit \u201chomosexual acts.\u201dThe Family Research Council, a close partner that for a time merged with Focus on the Family, is registered as a nonreligious nonprofit, rather than as a church. But one of the council\u2019s principal aims is to convert America\u2019s churches, or at least conservative ones, into partisan political cells. It seeks to place what it calls \u201cculture impact teams\u201d in churches to \u201cadvance Kingdom values in the public arena.\u201dThe way that Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council see it, the Bible offers specific information about how people ought to vote. Scripture, they say, opposes public assistance on principle (\u201cGod has charged believers to help the poor and widows and orphans,\u201d the council\u2019s culture impact team manual explains). Apparently, the Bible is also against gun control and supports privatization of schools through vouchers. It tells us that same-sex relationships are an abomination.It does not want women to have access to comprehensive reproductive care. Environmentalism, according to the source the manual recommends to church groups, is a \u201clitany of the Green Dragon\u201d and \u201cone of the greatest threats to society and the church today.\u201d Other sources the manual recommends promote the notion that the earth is 6,000 years old.There is no mystery about which political party the Bible supports, at least as these groups see it. In the run-up to the 2016 election, James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family and its former leader, praised Donald Trump and explained that the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency \u201cscares me to death.\u201d Their claim that they are nonpartisan is laughable.If you were worried that the amount of money flowing into politics was bad for our democracy, imagine what will happen when you add a divine exception, allowing partisans to spend freely on behalf of their chosen candidates and causes under the cover of churches. Notwithstanding the Johnson Amendment prohibition on direct electioneering by churches, it\u2019s happening in all but name.In 2016 Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, spoke at the Road to Majority Conference, which brings together politicians and leaders of the religious right. Mr. Reed promised to distribute 35 million \u201cnonpartisan\u201d voter guides through churches and help bring voters to the polls. No one funding his operation, or listening to his speech, could have had any doubt who would benefit from his work. Later that day, after Mr. Reed stepped off the stage, Mr. Trump stepped on to it.The proof of the effectiveness of this political-religious machine can be read from the exit polls of the 2016 election. Four-fifths of white evangelicals supported Mr. Trump.When challenged about their blatantly partisan activism, these groups invariably cry out that their religious liberty is under attack. It isn\u2019t. They are welcome to their opinions and free to expose them to the sunlight of the public square. The real issue here is money and transparency. Tax breaks don\u2019t come free; they\u2019re just ways in which the government allocates your tax money. And if the government is going to allocate money in a certain direction, you should be able to see where it\u2019s going.The process corrupts religion, too. Religion has long thrived in America because most religious leaders respected the separation of church and state, an arrangement that has served our country very well. Under our current law, religious groups are exempt from certain tax and reporting burdens. Political groups are not. Churches need to decide which one they are.Advertisement"}

In an effort to stop the run on foreign exchange, the government has forbidden anyone from holding more than the equivalent of $10,000 in dollars or euros, which account for most of the foreign exchange in Iran.Long on a downward path, the rial plunged this week, losing 35 percent of its value against the dollar and hitting what has been widely described as a record low. The government is seeking to impose an exchange rate of 42,000 to the dollar, but in Tehran\u2019s black-market exchanges this week the going rate was 60,000. When President Hassan Rouhani took office in 2013, the rate was 36,000.In an effort to squelch currency speculation, the government sent riot police into the bazaars on Wednesday, where they arrested several money changers. One senior cleric, Ayatollah Nasser Makarem-Shirazi, said that some money changers ought to be executed to set an example.However, many of those changing money in the bazaars were ordinary people seeking to protect themselves against rising prices and fearful of further declines in the currency.Others, like Mohsen Yekta, a university professor, said they needed the foreign exchange for personal business. \u201cEvery month I send some money to my daughter in Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cI need foreign exchange to help her out. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dOrdinary Iranians agree with most of these explanations, but also blame the government for poor planning and bad management of the economy. They also view the black-market rate as one of the few trustworthy indicators of the country\u2019s economic health.The currency slide is taking its toll on business, with many firms selling foreign products halting all sales, unable to determine prices. The manager of a paint factory said that he had sent his 70 employees on a paid vacation, because he did not know what price to ask for products that were based on foreign ingredients bought with foreign exchange.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s not as easy as it looks. To prove that point in a manner that is conclusive, if not a bit underhanded, we\u2019ve secretly planted a recording device in Will Shortz\u2019s office as a way of listening in on his and the digital puzzles editor Joel Fagliano\u2019s conversations.After editing out the lunch orders and petty arguments, we were left with a very interesting conversation, transcribed below, about how to make a clue in David Steinberg\u2019s crossword both tricky and fair.Before you even get there, however, you might have noticed that Mr. Steinberg does something you don\u2019t see every day in a crossword: He deliberately puts in two entries \u2014 1A\u2019s SEETHING and 1D\u2019s SEE THINGS \u2014 that could be seen as duplicates because they look so similar in the grid, but they\u2019re really not.

Normally, you\u2019d just say \u201ccable TV\u201d or \u201ccable.\u201dSHORTZ: \u201c1970s media innovation\u201d? That kind of gives it an old-timey feel. Think \u201970s is right?FAGLIANO: I don\u2019t know. I was trying to think of some cable channel names that are misleading.FAGLIANO: \u201cBravo,\u201d or whatever. I couldn\u2019t think of any good ones. O.K., let me look yours up. When did you first get cable?FAGLIANO: Well, it\u2019s sort of unclear. Because it says it first became available in 1948, but I don\u2019t think most people had it until much later.SHORTZ: So \u201cinnovation\u201d wouldn\u2019t be the right word. I thought CNN started in \u201979 or \u201981, so that\u2019s why I said 1970s.FAGLIANO: CNN started in 1980.SHORTZ: \u201cSubject of the Springsteen lyric \u2018500 channels and nothing on\u2019.\u201d Do you know what I\u2019m talking about?FAGLIANO: Yeah, somehow I do. What\u2019s that song?SHORTZ: Hmm, I can\u2019t remember. \u201cBroadcaster\u2019s competition\u201d?SHORTZ: Honestly, they call it the History Channel.FAGLIANO: True. \u201cExpensive package\u201d?SHORTZ: \u201cMonthly bill\u201d?FAGLIANO: I wonder if that\u2019s just CABLE as opposed to CABLE TELEVISION. I don\u2019t know.SHORTZ: I think it\u2019s both, although that does sound quaint.FAGLIANO: \u201cDish alternative\u201d?SHORTZ: Aha. But you\u2019re getting the same channels with dish, so is that not really cable, or is it just a different way of getting it?FAGLIANO: It just comes through waves instead of through a wire. Maybe it isn\u2019t an alternative.SHORTZ: \u201cContents of a dish\u201d? \u201cWhat a dish supplies\u201d?FAGLIANO: \u201cHigher-up channels?\u201dFAGLIANO: Yeah, they\u2019re all bad, but we have a lot of them!SHORTZ: \u201cAlternative to an antenna\u201d? But that would be simply for CABLE.SHORTZ: Yeah, I don\u2019t think you were harmed by that. When I started watching too much TV as a kid, my mom limited me to an hour a day. Of course, that felt like a basic loss of freedom.SHORTZ: In retrospect, I think her rule was all right. The one exception \u2014 one show I liked was \u201cThe Virginian,\u201d which went 90 minutes. She made an exception for that.FAGLIANO: Maybe this is too vague, but we could find the stat \u201cWhat 60 percent of U.S. households have.\u201d Sort of makes you think.SHORTZ: Huh! That\u2019s not bad. I would bet 75 percent, 80 percent. I wouldn\u2019t even be shocked by 90 percent.[Both look for the exact number: Will reaching for the 2018 World Almanac, Joel checking for an internet source.] SHORTZ: O.K., I\u2019ve got the figure, the exact figure, and interestingly, it\u2019s going down! It got as high as 90 percent. It peaked at 90.6 percent. Now it\u2019s down to 81 percent, and still falling. Wow, I\u2019d hate to say 80 percent, because next year it might be under 80 percent, and the clue would be out of date. In 2013, the figure was 90 percent, \u201914 it was 89 percent, \u201915 it was 86 percent, \u201916 it was 84 percent and \u201917 it was 81 percent. What\u2019s happening?FAGLIANO: People are cutting the cord. They\u2019re just doing without cable. I mean, I don\u2019t have cable. I just watch stuff over my computer, and then I project that onto my TV. But I also don\u2019t watch that much TV. Anyway, can we save this? Can we put a year? Like, \u201cWhat 80 percent of American households had in 2017.\u201dSHORTZ: That\u2019d still date the puzzle eventually. How about: \u201cWhat 90% of American households had in 2010 \u2014 but fewer have today.\u201d That\u2019s likely to stay true.FAGLIANO: Nice!

And the best work of economic history?In a similar vein, Jared Diamond\u2019s \u201cGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies\u201d reset thinking on what explains economic growth. While not a traditional economics text, the book takes economics back to its roots to show how a country\u2019s material success crucially depends on the resources and factors with which it is endowed.What books do you think best capture your own political principles?I have always been fascinated by this quip famously attributed to Mark Twain: \u201cIt ain\u2019t what you don\u2019t know that gets you into trouble. It\u2019s what you know for sure that just ain\u2019t so.\u201dSo I tend to gravitate to books (and people) that question ideology and challenge sacred cows, which means no one book could capture my political principles.What\u2019s the last book you\u2019ve recommended to somebody in your family?\u201cLiving with a SEAL.\u201d This is Jesse Itzler\u2019s insane story of living with David Goggins, a former Navy SEAL and workout fiend who has completed around 50 ultra-endurance races (including the 135-mile race in Death Valley, and an Ultraman: 6.2-mile ocean swim, 261-mile bike ride and then a 52.4-mile run), and has had Top 5 finishes in at least 20 of them. He also set the Guinness World Record with 4,030 pull-ups completed in 17 hours.Which books do you think capture the current social and political moment in America?With the manifold cultures, religions, races and political beliefs that define America, I do not think such a book has been written, nor do I necessarily think it could be written \u2014 certainly not by a singular author.The other is Philip Roth\u2019s \u201cThe Plot Against America,\u201d which offers an alternative history where Franklin D. Roosevelt loses the 1940 presidential election to Charles Lindbergh. Although both books are somewhat dated (published in 1997 and 2004, respectively) they offer compelling narratives that could explain the social and political shifts that appear to characterize the path the United States is on today.For what it\u2019s worth, I hope both books are wrong.Which historians and biographers do you most admire?As far as contemporary biographers go, I believe Walter Isaacson is in a class by himself. Leonardo da Vinci, Steve Jobs, Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Kissinger, take your pick \u2014 all brilliant.How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? As a long-distance runner, do you ever listen to audiobooks while you run?I am definitely a simultaneous reader \u2014 I choose what to read based on my mood, rather than force myself to keep reading or finish a book if it is not moving me at a particular moment. I read economics, politics and history books in paper (I need to scribble on the page and add dog-ears liberally), and sports and lifestyle books electronically. I have not yet switched my music playlist for audiobooks while I am running, but I am working on it.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?Murder mysteries! I love Agatha Christie\u2019s Belgian character Hercule Poirot (who appears in over 30 of her novels), but I confess my small collection is gathering dust as British television created a wonderful series with David Suchet. I find it particularly hilarious that Christie described Poirot as \u201cinsufferable\u201d and a \u201cdetestable, bombastic, tiresome, egocentric little creep.\u201dWhat kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?I was born and raised on a healthy diet of the African Writers Series. Flora Nwapa\u2019s \u201cEfuru,\u201d Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o\u2019s \u201cThe River Between\u201d and, of course, Chinua Achebe\u2019s \u201cNo Longer at Ease\u201d and \u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d will forever be etched in my mind as shaping my formative years.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?1) Vikram Seth, the economist turned novelist. His \u201cA Suitable Boy\u201d remains one of my all-time favorite books. 2) Ayn Rand, the philosopher and novelist. I am drawn to her irreverence \u2014 a woman ahead of her time. 3) Maya Angelou, the poet who penned \u201cStill I Rise\u201d and \u201cPhenomenal Woman\u201d \u2026 enough said.Of the books you\u2019ve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful?That\u2019s a hard question \u2014 I imagine it is like picking your favorite child. I write the books I want to read so I am genuinely curious and intrigued by all the subjects I write on. But I suppose \u201cDead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa\u201d is the most poignant.For me, finding a sustainable solution to Africa\u2019s woes is a personal quest. Having been raised in one of the poorest countries in the world, I feel a strong desire to help families like my own, who continue to suffer the consequences of economic failure every day of their lives. In \u201cDead Aid,\u201d I offer a way.What do you plan to read next?Douglas W. Hubbard\u2019s \u201cHow to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of \u2018Intangibles\u2019 in Business,\u201d and his book with Richard Seiersen, \u201cHow to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supporters of El Salvador\u2019s Abortion Ban Foil Efforts to Soften It", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 El Salvador\u2019s national legislature adjourned Thursday without voting on proposals to allow exceptions to the country\u2019s total ban on abortion, thwarting the first challenge to one of the world\u2019s toughest laws.The failure of the Legislative Assembly, El Salvador\u2019s legislative branch, to consider two proposals that would have allowed doctors to end pregnancies under limited conditions leaves intact the country\u2019s two-decade-old ban on abortions.What appeared to be momentum a few weeks ago in favor of relaxing the law was defeated by an alliance of social conservatives and religious organizations who succeeded in convincing legislators in the final days that their vote could have a political cost.\u201cThere are clearly people in leadership who defend this issue no matter what,\u201d said Johnny Wright Sol, an independent legislator who introduced one of the proposals to allow exceptions to the ban. Pointing to the powerful business groups that rallied against changing the law, he said, \u201cThere is a lot more tolerance for corruption than there is for discussion on abortion.\u201dSupporters of softening the total ban have been lobbying for months, opening up debate on an issue that has long been taboo in a country where the Roman Catholic Church and evangelical movements exert a muscular influence.They recast the issue in terms of human rights and women\u2019s health, bringing legal and medical experts to testify in the assembly. \u201cThis issue stopped being one for feminists,\u201d Sara Garc\u00eda, who led the organizing for the Citizens\u2019 Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion.Even in defeat, she was hopeful that the conversation had changed. \u201cThis is a point of no return,\u201d she said.The campaign appeared to be on its way to assembling a narrow majority to permit abortion in two cases: when the life and health of the woman is threatened or when a minor becomes pregnant as a result of rape.The deadline for a vote was May 1, when a new Legislative Assembly will be convened. The election was last month, and conservatives will dominate the new assembly.El Salvador\u2019s health minister, Dr. Violeta Menj\u00edvar, who says that the abortion ban has caused deaths that would have been preventable, called on legislators to hold a \u201cserene, responsible debate, removed from electoral interests.\u201d The discussion, she said in a television interview, needs to be \u201cfrom a public health perspective, from the perspective of saving lives.\u201dBut the debate never reached the assembly. Thursday was the last full session of the departing legislature, and the governing Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, a left-wing party that had originally proposed a more expansive list of exceptions, never presented a bill for a vote.Mr. Wright, who proposed the narrower exceptions to the law in an effort to bring more conservative legislators on board, said that the incoming legislature was unlikely to revisit the issue.The challenge now will be \u201ctrying to generate public opinion,\u201d he said. Legislators \u201cneed to feel the pressure from society.\u201dOver the past couple of weeks, El Salvador\u2019s anti-abortion groups and the Catholic Church have mounted their own lobbying effort, and wavering lawmakers privately withdrew their support.In his Sunday homily and at a news conference last week, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Luis Escobar Alas of San Salvador called on lawmakers to reject any change. \u201cThere is no right to take the life of another person,\u201d he told local media.Anti-abortion activists portrayed the proposal to relax the ban as an imposition by foreign groups. Julia Regina de Cardenal, the president of the Yes to Life Foundation, accused those who supported a relaxation of the ban of receiving foreign financing.On Thursday, Ms. Cardenal accompanied a group of about 500 people, many of them high school students, into the assembly\u2019s gallery, where they held up signs behind a glass partition with slogans like \u201cAbortion makes you the mother of a dead baby\u201d and \u201cMommy, I\u2019m not your body, I\u2019m your child.\u201dOne doctors\u2019 group issued a statement opposing any change, and the influential National Association of Private Enterprise, whose president is Ms. Cardenal\u2019s husband, warned that decriminalizing abortion would set a precedent that could open the doors to justify the taking of life at stages after birth.\u201cThe way the law is laid out has created confusion and fear among health workers,\u201d Dr. Guillermo Ortiz Avenda\u00f1o, who led the unit overseeing high-risk pregnancies at the public National Women\u2019s Hospital for 20 years, said in a recent interview.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t allowed women to have access to safe procedures that are accepted for the rest of the world,\u201d Dr. Ortiz said. He is now a medical adviser to Ipas, a reproductive rights organization in North Carolina.The authorities have been especially harsh in a group of cases involving women who have suffered stillbirths or miscarriages late in their pregnancies before they could reach medical attention. Prosecutors initially charged these women with abortion \u2014 sometimes after they were reported by the public hospitals where they were taken \u2014 and then changed the accusation to aggravated homicide.More than two dozen women are serving sentences as long as 30 years for convictions of aggravated and attempted homicide. Women\u2019s groups fighting for their release have won freedom for five of them.The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called on the Salvadoran government to review all the cases. In a letter to legislators earlier this month, the high commissioner, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, asked them to relax the abortion ban \u201caccording to international standards.\u201d\u201cThis would be a crucial step that would improve the protection of human rights for women and children in El Salvador and avoid future unjust suffering,\u201d he wrote.Gene Palumbo contributed reporting from San Salvador.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Slump? Tech, Trade Drag Down Stocks: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Monday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Elon Musk finally responded to last week\u2019s bad news about Tesla.\u2022 Trump continues to go after Amazon.\u2022 China retaliated to President Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.\u2022 Tech leaders have been keeping mum on Facebook.For months, the stock market rally seemed to have the strength to plow through the obstacles that the Trump administration threw in its way.But now, the S.&P. 500 index is down more than 10 percent from its all-time high.Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.\u2014 Peter EavisA little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.- Peter EavisTech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dAmazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.Context\u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.Critic\u2019s cornerDA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201dCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:\u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201dApple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.\u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.____________________________Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.Critic\u2019s corner More on data and privacy The Chinese government said on Monday that it would place tariffs on the imports of 128 American-made products in retaliation for to President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.The Washington flyaroundWhen the Justice Department allowed Live Nation to merge with Ticketmaster, it tried to assuage concerns that the deal would cripple competitors.But critics have reason to be skeptical. Here\u2019s how Beau Buffier, the chief of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Antitrust Bureau, described Live Nation:\u201cIt is now widely seen as the poster child for the problems that arise when enforcers adopt these temporary fixes to limit the anticompetitive effects of deeply problematic vertical mergers.\u201dThe inquiries come as the department is reviewing two more mergers, between AT&T and Time Warner, and Disney and Fox.The department\u2019s new antitrust chief has said that the Live Nation deal and several other deals posed problems because they relied too much on the federal government\u2019s ability to police corporate behavior.\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we often don\u2019t have the skills or the tools to do so effectively,\u201d the antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, said in a speech.More for your playlistThe deals flyaroundAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trade War the U.S. Is Actually Winning, for Now", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMs. Cao is a professor of international economic law.The dollar\u2019s status is inextricably linked to international trade. Because the dollar reigns supreme in the trading system, other countries need to accumulate dollars. Most international trade is conducted using the dollar, even if the United States is not a party to the transaction.The United States wasn\u2019t always so dominant. After the 1971 decision to end the link between the value of the dollar and gold reserves, the dollar became a currency much like any other. But in 1974, the United States and Saudi Arabia struck an agreement in which the Saudis and the other Gulf states supported the dollar as the primary medium of exchange for oil exports. Thus, oil and other commodities are priced in dollars, so any country that buys oil must build up its dollar reserves to pay for it \u2014 mostly by exporting its goods and services so that it can receive dollars as payment.Still, there are enormous benefits to being able to print paper money and have the world treat it as if it were gold. Other countries need American dollars, and they are willing to pay a premium to hold them. Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing, finance minister of France from 1962 to 1966, called this an \u201cexorbitant privilege.\u201d Once they have amassed those all-important dollars, countries use them to buy United States Treasury bonds. (China alone held $1.2 trillion dollars of United States government debt at the end of 2017.) This enormous global demand for American debt means that the United States can borrow at relatively low interest rates, financing its budget deficits away.The \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d extends to ordinary Americans, who have access to a vast supply of credit and can borrow to buy homes and cars at lower interest rates.China and the United States are too closely economically intertwined via the dollar to make that a credible fear. United States treasuries are still the world\u2019s safe haven of choice. And selling off American debt would cause the yuan to appreciate, which would put China\u2019s exports at a disadvantage.Advertisement"}

It came after the nonprofit\u2019s founder reached out to Ripple, a virtual currency company, with an ambitious proposal: What if the company fulfilled every request for teaching equipment, technology and supplies on the website?Well, it never hurts to ask.\u201cIt\u2019s just a subject that we all care very passionately about and we were in a position to make it happen,\u201d said Monica Long, the senior vice president for marketing at Ripple.The projects included a class seeking supplies for the homeless and a teacher asking to stock a library to serve low-income students and refugees.The Hollywood sign, Niagara Falls, Stonehenge. Samuel Barsky has been knitting colorful sweaters depicting popular destinations for nearly 20 years, and then visiting the landmarks \u2014 while wearing the appropriate sweater, of course.But it\u2019s hard for him to name a favorite. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to pick a favorite child,\u201d he said.Matt Parziale tried golfing professionally after college but found himself struggling with money. He quit in 2013 and joined the Brockton Fire Department in Massachusetts, where his dad was a captain.For most of the past five years, he\u2019s been sneaking in amateur golf tournaments between 24-hour firefighting shifts.The exhausting grind (he often showed up to play on little or no sleep) finally paid off in October when he won the U.S. Mid-Amateur Championship, earning him a coveted spot at the Masters this week at Augusta National Golf Club.A famous troop of macaques living in the north of Japan have become a tourist attraction for their long, leisurely winter soaks. But scientists are only recently studying why they developed this habit.It turns out that winter causes stress for the monkeys, and a few hours of relaxing in hot water helps.Maybe we humans should be taking some inspiration from them?It\u2019s rare enough to get offers of admission into all eight Ivy League schools, but 17-year-old Micheal Brown, a senior at Lamar High School in Houston, did that and more.What did it take to accomplish such a feat? A 4.68 grade point average, an SAT score of 1540 out of 1600, an ACT score of 34 out of 36 and activities that included the school debate team, Key Club and internships.This gorgeous animal came close to extinction less than two decades ago. At one point it was the world\u2019s most endangered feline, with a 2002 census showing less than 100 individuals in the wild.Infrared cameras and technology designed to study the stars can now help to track elusive and endangered animals in video footage. The same techniques can be used to spot poachers.The first field test by scientists found five riverine rabbits \u2014 one of the world\u2019s most endangered mammals \u2014 in a relatively small area. Only a thousand of these shy creatures have ever been spotted by people.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the countries where orangutans live in the wild.

{"Headline": "How to Cope When the Market Turns Nasty", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a long stretch of steady gains, the stock market has come under pressure, and bonds have been a source of headaches, too. What\u2019s an investor to do? For insight and perspective, check out our quarterly report on investing. In retrospect, 2017 was an extraordinary time for investors. The American stock market rose steadily, and it never declined sharply, not even once. It was easy to make money in stocks, and to do so with relatively little skill or worry. That\u2019s not what it has been like so far this year. Stocks have been bouncing up and down, and while they haven\u2019t really fallen that much by historical standards, the nine-year-old bull market stumbled in February and hasn\u2019t entirely recovered. Bonds, which are typically a source of stability when stocks fall, lost ground, too, though not as much as stocks.Still, even for people with diversified portfolios and a long-term outlook, 2018 has been a trying time. This may be a good moment to get some perspective.We\u2019ve chosen nine articles with reporting and analysis on where the markets have been and some clues on where they may be heading. As always in these quarterly reports, the selection provides an introduction to investing. And we hope that at least some of these articles will entertain you as well. Stocks remain fragile after fears of protectionism and inflation helped produce the first quarterly loss since 2015, as equity and bond funds both fell. What happens from here may hinge on the Federal Reserve and on the prospects of a rapprochement \u2014 or a trade war \u2014 between the United States and China.It\u2019s possible to invest in emerging markets by focusing only on companies whose environmental, social and governance records adhere to core principles. What\u2019s more, early evidence suggests that these feel-good funds may be able to outkick their conventional kin.International stock funds are enjoying a currency advantage, but the weaker dollar could spell trouble for foreign-based exporters. It may make sense to focus on firms that are domiciled abroad but whose profits are not going to be affected by any further decline in the dollar.The president says trade wars are \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy to win.\u201d Our columnist decided to get in on the fun. But it turns out that winning is not that simple.Three stock mutual funds benefited from the coffee of a doughnut king, the renaissance of a tech stalwart and renewed growth in Brazil.Managers of so-called focus funds, which have only 30 or 40 holdings, say broad diversification isn\u2019t so great. But as a group, neither are those funds, though there are some apparent exceptions.Bonds lost value along with stocks in the first quarter. But holding them still makes sense for many people.Debt needn\u2019t be a big problem for companies with strong cash flow.

This is one of London\u2019s most venerable neighborhoods: Queen Victoria grew up around the corner in Kensington Palace, now home to Prince William and his young family. But inside Assi\u2019s front door, stuffy convention comes abruptly to a stop.Assi\u2019s home is both living space and a gallery, accessed by appointment only. \u201cDesign these days is more of a lifestyle thing \u2014 it\u2019s more integrated,\u201d she explains. \u201cMy life, home and work are intertwined.\u201dBorn in Lebanon and educated in Paris, Assi has a delicate French accent and the understated glamour of a busy mom. A decade ago, she stepped aside from a career in finance to start a family. Immersed in home life, she became \u201cinterested in how objects in a domestic environment can work,\u201d she says. She became an avid student of the design world, searching for insight into how things are made and the concepts behind them. While she appreciates midcentury pieces \u2014 she takes coffee seated in a Pierre Jeanneret Chandigarh chair \u2014 Assi wanted to find out \u201cwhat a new breed of young designers thought and how they viewed objects.\u201dShe discovered that she had a good eye: \u201cYou either have this sense of what you like and don\u2019t like \u2014 or you don\u2019t.\u201d She founded Seeds in 2015, to show, commission and sell the work of designers she admired. The enterprise covers both commercial and noncommercial projects: The \u201cSee\u201d is for \u201cspecial events and exhibitions,\u201d and the \u201cds\u201d signifies \u201cdesign selection\u201d \u2014 the selling arm of the business.The five-story house in Kensington, with its white walls and Dinesen oak flooring, acts as a restrained backdrop for whatever wild constructions Assi\u2019s commissions might bring in. It is also the site of regular Seeds \u201cget-togethers and dinners, formal and informal\u201d \u2014 occasions to show works and share the narratives behind them. Assi is an avid storyteller who gleefully relates the histories of her pieces. As she sips rose-petal-flavored water, she explains how Jochen Holz and Silo Studio formed the Jell-O-colored vessels by blowing glass into fabric bags. The misshapen carafe was the fruit of chance: \u201cin this instance the bag ripped,\u201d she says. Before bringing a new piece home, she says, \u201cI need to like the story and feel a connection with it: Once the connection exists, I try to share it with as many people as I can.\u201dWorking with designers who pursue a conceptual rather than mass-market approach, Assi considers herself a bridge between London\u2019s creative bohemia and the moneyed, collecting classes of West London. She sees Seeds as bringing the East London \u201cvibe\u201d to a neighborhood that is perhaps \u201cdisconnected from the creativity\u201d happening on the other side of town.As No Ordinary Love, too, Gamper and his collaborators made the dining table around which Assi, her family and her friends gather. With revelry, family life and commerce all taking place among such precious objects, how does she guard against damage? Assi is philosophical, suggesting that rather than venerate furnishings, we need to accept that they\u2019re here to live with us. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re not careful with people, with each other,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy would we care more about objects than we care with humans?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Washington Wants to Weaken Bank Rules. Not Every Regulator Agrees.", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBank regulators are on the cusp of weakening a rule put in place to prevent the nation\u2019s biggest banks from causing another financial crisis, marking the first significant attempt by policymakers to fulfill President Trump\u2019s promised regulatory rollback.The effort is causing friction among regulators, who broadly agree that some post-crisis rules need to be revised but disagree about how far Washington should go in changing them. The debate is expected to be the first of many as financial regulators begin changing post-crisis rules through actions that do not require congressional approval.Banks have long complained that the rule is too restrictive and makes it harder for them to do business, including lending, in important markets. They have asserted that the ratio is too blunt of an instrument and often the strictest of the various capital requirements that were put in place after the crisis.James P. Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, summed up this view on a conference call last week, saying, \u201cOur constraint has been the leverage ratio.\u201dRegulators appear ready to agree. The Federal Reserve, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has proposed changing the capital requirement to make it \u201cmore closely tailored to each firm.\u201d That could wind up lowering the amount of capital that big banks must maintain.The change was not supported by another bank regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is currently headed by Martin J. Gruenberg, an Obama administration appointee. It also prompted a \u201cno\u201d vote from one of the Fed\u2019s three sitting governors, Lael Brainard, also an Obama administration appointee, who recently said it was too soon to lower capital requirements for the biggest banks.Under the Fed\u2019s proposed new method, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs\u2019s leverage ratio would most likely drop from 5 percent to 4.25 percent of their assets and certain off-balance sheet holdings, while Wells Fargo\u2019s might fall to 4 percent. Capital required for eight large banks under the proposed leverage ratios is around $86 billion less than the amount demanded at the 5 percent level, according to calculations by The New York Times.The Fed, in explaining the impact of the changes, said capital held by the banks would not fall by much. That\u2019s because a second set of capital requirements, based on assets\u2019 riskiness, would be set higher than the leverage ratio after the changes. The Fed estimated a theoretical reduction of $9 billion across the eight banks. That amount would be even smaller once the Fed\u2019s annual tests of banks\u2019 strength are taken into account.But as regulators adjust capital rules in the coming months, the big banks are expected to enjoy significant relief. Several proposed changes could free up more than $50 billion of capital at large banks, according to recent research by Goldman Sachs, money that could in theory be distributed to shareholders.The changes are part of a push, spearheaded by Randal K. Quarles, who oversees bank supervision at the Fed, to ease some of the regulations that came into effect after the financial crisis of 2008. The leverage ratio proposal builds on ideas that were under discussion at the Fed before Mr. Quarles\u2019s confirmation as a Fed governor last year but go beyond that approach. It is prompting concern from those who view the leverage ratio as an important tool to help protect the financial system by preventing banks from becoming overextended.\u201cThe leverage ratio was a much better predictor of financial health of banks going into the crisis,\u201d said Sheila C. Bair, who was head of the F.D.I.C. during the tumult of 2008, and who does not support the proposed changes.The change most likely won\u2019t lead to an immediate weakening of the financial system. But, over time, if the financial industry keeps pressing for looser regulations, and Washington obliges, there is concern that the absence of a strong leverage ratio could reduce confidence in the financial system, particularly in periods of stress.The leverage ratio\u2019s importance is revealed in how large banks finance themselves. They get most of the money they need for lending and trading from two main sources \u2014 they borrow it in markets or they raise it from depositors. But an overreliance on those two sources can leave a bank vulnerable to runs, because many of the creditors and depositors can demand the bank return their money at short notice. That is why banks must get some of their funding from equity capital, which consists of retained profits and funds from shareholders, who cannot demand immediate repayment of their money.Some capital rules allow banks to hold less capital against an asset that is perceived by regulators to be less risky. The weakness of this approach was revealed in 2008 and during the European debt crisis when supposedly safe assets turned out to be dangerously risky. The leverage ratio, by contrast, requires banks to have a set amount of capital, regardless of the type of assets it holds.Bank representatives say the leverage ratio has been a crude tool that has not made the financial system safer. \u201cThe best analogy is that it\u2019s like having the same speed limit for every road in the country,\u201d said Greg Baer, president of the Clearing House Association, which represents banks.Supporters of the leverage ratio, however, say that it should be at least as important as the malleable capital requirements, to provide reliable protection in a storm. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have strong, vigilant regulators but we shouldn\u2019t put all of our faith in them,\u201d Gregg Gelzinis of the left-leaning Center for American Progress said. \u201cWe should have this capital requirement that is simple, transparent and doesn\u2019t rely on expert determinations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the New Boss. Actually Quite Different From the Old Boss.", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.In the end, the wheelers and dealers faded away, trying to get what they could under cover of darkness. Their loss of stature was abrupt. Only those willing to soldier on as subordinates remained, ceding authority to their leader, President Trump.For four decades, from 1968 to 2008, what was loosely described as the Republican establishment \u2014 the party\u2019s congressional leaders, campaign operatives, donors, lobbyists and special interests \u2014 reigned supreme.Every four years, the party\u2019s presidential nominee secured the establishment\u2019s stamp of approval. Endorsements from governors and senators \u2014 and a gigantic campaign chest fed by major Republican fund-raisers \u2014 were the main markers of that approval.In a party deeply committed to hierarchy, the establishment-favored candidate was always the next in line, often the vice president (George H.W. Bush in 1988) or the candidate who had come in second (or a very close third) in the previous contested nomination battle (Ronald Reagan 1980, Bob Dole 1996, John McCain 2008 and Mitt Romney 2012).[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]\u201cThe Republican Party today is very much an outsiders\u2019 party,\u201d Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary for the last anointed president, George W. Bush, said in an interview. \u201cThe mood of the party is \u2018pound the table\u2019 and say \u2018everybody who has been on the inside is part of the problem\u2019. \u201dThe establishment destroyed itself by blundering into the Iraq war and by not preventing the financial crisis of 2007. Those were the precipitating events that gave rise to the Tea Party which ultimately transformed into the Trump movement.\u201cAt a more granular level,\u201d Feehery continued,the so-called influencers distanced themselves from the actual voters, retreating into a bubble and pontificating from their gated communities. This gave rise to the popularity of the conservative media movement, which became the go-to news source. The news from these sources didn\u2019t have to be fully accurate as long as it seemed right.On the plus side, they write,Fox News, talk radio, and right-wing internet sites allow Republicans to communicate with their party\u2019s popular base and help to mobilize conservative activists and voters against the Democratic opposition.On the negative side,the distinctive popular conservative culture that these media outlets both reinforce and promote is also fertile ground for repeated challenges to the party\u2019s existing leadership by self-styled political outsiders \u2014 including, most notably, Donald Trump.Fox, Breitbart, Townhall, The Daily Caller and other right-wing media outlets now perform multiple functions traditionally associated with political parties: candidate screening, the maintenance of ideological conformity, reviewing policy positions and vetting congressional voting.The right-wing media was purposefully created by the conservative wing of the Republican Party, in part to help resolve a basic contradiction in the movement, according to Grossmann and Hopkins:Conservative candidates have also long grappled with the challenge of attracting electoral support for an ideological movement primarily dedicated to the perennially unpopular objective of limiting or rolling back major government programs and social benefits.Crucial to the continued survival of the Republican Party, however, is the fact that when questions about taxes, spending and the role of government are put in generic, symbolic, abstract terms, without reference to specific policies, the majority of Americans take a conservative stance.To counter potential defections to the Democratic Party, according to Grossmann and Hopkins, the right must focus on \u201cconservatism as a brand name, or as a collection of general principles and values,\u201d which is far more popular \u201cthan conservatism as a package of detailed policy positions.\u201dArthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, argued in an email that Trump and other Republican insurgents have been better at mobilizing their troops than the establishment wing of the party. The dissident wing, Lupia wrote, hasused social media to organize its myriad members more effectively. Some mass media outlets, and significant social media players, produce a steady stream of polarizing content that keeps members of the group hyper-vigilant towards real and imagined threats from globalists, foreigners, and the American left.In practical terms, the creation of a new and massive source of campaign support freed candidates to defy the establishment. This is just what the Tea Party did in 2010 and 2014.There is considerable disagreement over whether deregulated campaign finance and the mobilization of the angriest segment of the Republican electorate will inflict permanent damage on the Republican establishment.Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote me by email. \u201cThe establishment, such as it is, still exists, but its influence has been permanently weakened by changes in the media,\u201d not just by conservative media, but by social media that \u201cenables candidates to reach their respective bases in an inexpensive way. Endorsements and money mean less and less.\u201dIdeological media outlets on both the left and right, Tanner argues \u201ccarry more weight than ever before,\u201d displacing establishment influence over candidate selection, because both sides are now more dependent on mobilizing base voters than in persuading the ever-smaller faction of uncommitted voters.A colleague of Tanner\u2019s, Emily Ekins, director of polling at Cato, argued in an email thatIt\u2019s useful to not think of the G.O.P. establishment as a cohesive bloc but rather as a coalition that has been fracturing long before Trump arrived. We saw this with the rise of the tea party, the push to oust former Speaker John Boehner, the House Freedom Caucus, the inability of House Republicans to agree on health care reform, etc. Without cohesion it\u2019s hard for it to control the process.Ekins points out that Trump\u2019s successful defiance of the establishment in winning the nomination has not resulted in the abandonment of policies favored by the traditional power brokers.\u201cWhen it comes to policymaking, traditional establishment priorities appear to maintain influence over agenda setting,\u201d she wrote:Although reforming the tax system and repealing the ACA (Obamacare) are traditional Republican priorities, these were ranked far lower, below a border wall, among Trump\u2019s core set of supporters. So while the establishment may be hanging back such that they avoid conflicts with Trump, they are still engaged in the policymaking process.It is not without irony that the most recent presidential election produced a result that so violated a great many substantive ideas about democracy. From his campaign promises to jail his opponent to his pre-election lamentations that the general electoral contests were rigged to his vows to strip citizens of their rights for expressing unpopular political views, Donald Trump proved to be one of the most hostile presidential candidates toward basic democratic norms in the modern age.How \u201cdid such democratic parties produce such an anti-democratic result?\u201d Azari and Masket ask. Their answer:The parties\u2019 moves toward internal party democracy, we maintain, helped create an environment in which a candidate like Trump could succeed. We believe that several aspects of party democratization are responsible for the inability of the Republican Party to thwart Trump\u2019s candidacy.Put another way, the demotion of Republican power brokers opened the door to the Trump presidency.Voters do not have to listen to elite signals. Elites do not have to listen to each other\u2019s signals. Parties have been stripped (in part by their own actions) of their ability to coordinate and bargain.Not only have party establishments lost their ability to coordinate and bargain, but Trump has successfully pushed the Republican Party elite into a corner. As Masket wrote in an email,Trump has access to a group of voters that they\u2019ve been courting for decades \u2014 working class whites. They\u2019re eager to claim the support of this demographic and, more importantly, terrified to offend it by turning on Trump.The Trump insurgency, in this context, amounted to an internal realignment or revolution within the Republican Party. What is now the party\u2019s largest bloc of voters \u2014 whites without college degrees \u2014 wrested power from the establishment.Trump\u2019s populism was simply the expression of one crucial but underrepresented element of the original conservative coalition, fighting back to achieve some measure of respect and equality.Sarah Treul, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina, suggested in an email that by failing to take a firm stand against Trump in the early stages of the Republican primaries,the establishment may have lost its ability to be persuasive in future elections. The insurgence of inexperienced candidates will make it increasingly challenging for the establishment of either party to coordinate around one candidate even if it wants to.All this raises a larger question: Can the Republican Party continue to function over time without an elite establishment?As a first step, Castellanos calls for the renunciation of the traditional establishment, a group that converted the Reagan revolution from a movement into a business and then intoa self-preserving racket. In 2016, the American people judged that Washington Republicans had been poisoned by their success and become the very thing they were sent to the Capitol to change.In Castellanos\u2019s view, the contemporary Republican Party must capitalize on Trump\u2019s successes:He has crushed ISIS and increased our paychecks with a tax cut. He has erased regulations that were growing Washington\u2019s economy at the expense of our economy. He has appointed a respected Supreme Court justice and transformed the judiciary to call balls and strikes.But the party must also steer clear of Trump\u2019s failures:He left behind a vicious inflationary spiral. That, alongside devouring the country\u2019s expectations for a president\u2019s personal conduct, may be the greatest cost of his t. rex presidency.Permanently reorganizing the party around Trumpism will not be an easy task. Castellanos believes that Trump is likelyto be assessed as the bipolar leader he has become, both one of the worst and best presidents Americans have ever elected, perhaps the greatest president to be removed from the Oval Office in chains.Reflecting on the tumult, a Republican strategist who has been involved in campaigns at every level for more than 35 years and who is a dues-paying member of the establishment (and thus did not want his name used to avoid alienating his clients), expressed the contradictions of contemporary Republicanism with precision:The post-Trump world is a Humpty Dumpty story. No one is going to be able to put things back together again.An earlier version of this column misspelled the last name of the director of polling at the Cato Institute; she is Emily Ekins, not Elkins.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why China Is Confident It Can Beat Trump in a Trade War", "Date": "2018-04-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s leaders sound supremely confident that they can win a trade war with President Trump.The state news media has depicted him as a reckless bully intent on undermining the global trading system, while presenting the Chinese government as a fair-minded champion of free trade. And China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, has used the standoff to reinforce the Communist Party\u2019s message that the United States is determined to stop China\u2019s rise \u2014 but that it no longer can. China is already too strong, its economy too big.\u201cChina is not afraid of a trade war,\u201d the vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, declared at a news conference to discuss possible countermeasures. More than once, he cited the history of the \u201cnew China\u201d \u2014 which began its extraordinary economic revival four decades ago \u2014 as evidence that it would \u201cnever succumb to external pressure.\u201dMissing in the bluster and the propaganda are the questionable methods that China has adopted to squeeze foreign companies out of key technology markets \u2014 and the fact that in the cold-eyed calculus of economics, China is more vulnerable to a trade war than officials admit.Exports account for a big share of Chinese economic growth. Because the United States buys so much from China, Washington has many more ways to hit Chinese manufacturers. By contrast, the retaliatory tariffs Beijing has proposed already cover more than one-third of what China buys from the United States, leaving it fewer options to strike back.In the political realm, however, Mr. Xi enjoys advantages that may allow him to cope with the economic fallout far better than Mr. Trump can. His authoritarian grip on the news media and the party means there is little room for criticism of his policies, even as Mr. Trump must contend with complaints from American companies and consumers before important midterm elections in November.The Chinese government also has much greater control over the economy, allowing it to shield the public from job cuts or factory closings by ordering banks to support industries suffering from American tariffs. It can spread the pain of a trade war while tolerating years of losses from state-run companies that dominate major sectors of the economy.\u201cMy impression is that there is in Washington an exaggerated sense of how painful these tariffs might be\u201d in China, said Arthur R. Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm in Beijing.At worst, he estimated, the American actions could shave one-tenth of a percentage point off China\u2019s economic growth \u2014 hardly enough to force a drastic reversal of policies, given the enormous benefits that Chinese leaders see in the state-heavy economic model they have relied on in recent decades.At the same time, Chinese officials seem to believe they can take advantage of what they consider vulnerabilities in the American political system.\u201cThe American agricultural sector is quite influential in the Congress,\u201d said Wang Yong, a professor of economics at Peking University, explaining why China has targeted farm products such as soybeans with possible retaliatory tariffs. \u201cChina wants the American domestic political system to do the work.\u201dThe president and his administration have sent drastically different messages this week.But late Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would consider levying an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods in response to its \u201cunfair retaliation.\u201d In a statement, he said, \u201cRather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers.\u201dMr. Zhu, China\u2019s vice minister of finance, this week had thanked American soybean farmers and the association that represents them for declaring their opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s plan.\u201cIf anyone wants to fight, we will be there with him,\u201d Mr. Zhu said, more or less outlining the terms for an American surrender: the removal of unilateral tariffs and a resolution of any grievances through the World Trade Organization. \u201cIf he wants to negotiate, the door is open.\u201dGlobally, China\u2019s strategy has been to isolate the United States, splitting it from allies in Europe and Asia who otherwise share American concerns about heavy-handed Chinese trade policies intended to protect key markets and to acquire technology from foreign firms.Mr. Kroeber said a united front against China would be more effective than American tariffs alone, but so far Mr. Trump has not managed to build one.Instead, Mr. Xi has largely succeeded in occupying the high moral ground on the world stage, projecting China as the sober-minded steward of international agreements on issues \u2014 from global trade to climate change \u2014 that Mr. Trump has been eager to walk away from.\u201cToday, it targets China, and tomorrow may take aim at other countries,\u201d it said.The party has also seized on the trade dispute as new evidence that the United States is intent on undermining China\u2019s rise as a global power, a central narrative used to justify the party\u2019s, and Mr. Xi\u2019s, rule.The document signaled a bipartisan shift in Washington\u2019s posture toward China after decades of economic cooperation and concessions. The party has argued that the United States is only now challenging China because it fears losing its privileged place in the world order.It went on to note that China\u2019s market was now \u201cno smaller or less attractive\u201d than the American one \u2014 a bit of an exaggeration perhaps, but not as big as it would have been a decade ago.

He modernized what we now know as the jewelry center of excellence in Kilkenny.\u201dNow 77, Mr. Heltzel concentrates on design, sketching ideas by hand as he always has done. \u201cEvery piece is thought out and mulled over in an intellectual process,\u201d he said. \u201cArt is a communication with my clients.\u201dSince the arthritis in his fingers became troublesome about five years ago, his son Christopher and Dave Wilson, a former apprentice, have executed the designs at the company\u2019s Kilkenny headquarters, using goldsmith tools that date from the mid-1800s.Mr. Heltzel supervises the work and still makes changes to pieces himself from time to time.And his wife, Eva, models each one to ensure that it is comfortable to wear and does not snag clothing.Each of Mr. Heltzel\u2019s creations is years in the making. Since the start of his career, he has collected unusual stones from the world\u2019s best gem cutters; many sit in his safe for a long time before they are used. \u201cIt could be 20, 30 years before I have enough to make a perfect piece,\u201d he said, describing how the materials inspire a design.Pointing to a large piece of quartz used in his Rock Crystal Treasure Cave collection, he said, \u201cIt seems to contain flowers floating at the bottom of the sea.\u201d The effect was created by metal deposits incorporated into the crystal over the centuries, he added, marveling at the stone cutter\u2019s instinct to preserve the pattern. \u201cInstead of cutting the stone into dozens of crystals, he persists \u2019til he gets that one image by chance, by chance, by chance,\u201d Mr. Heltzel said.Most of Mr. Heltzel\u2019s designs, like those in the Rock Crystal collection, have been abstract.But 10 years ago he designed and made his first naturalistic pendant, the initial piece in the Tourmaline Butterflies collection. It was inspired by a pair of perfectly matched watermelon tourmalines, pink-and-green stones totaling 75.5 carats that, set in gold, became a butterfly\u2019s wings.The stones are rare, and, Mr. Heltzel said, the specialist who cut them has not found their like again. \u201cIt would be impossible to reproduce this piece,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause when the mine is finished, that\u2019s the end of it.\u201dThe butterfly pendants range in price from 15,000 euros to 60,000 euros ($18,650 to $74,600), with stones like diamonds, rubies, sapphires and rainbow moonstones in the larger, more expensive pieces.His newest line, the Druze Collection, is named for the tiny crystals atop a colorful mineral. The pendants feature onyx, carnelian, chalcedony and agate druze.Nora Twomey from the Cartoon Saloon animation studio in Kilkenny wore one of the Druze pendants \u2014 three triangular agate druzes set in gold \u2014 to the 2018 Golden Globes, where the film she directed, \u201cThe Breadwinner,\u201d was nominated for the best animated motion picture prize.And at the Oscars, where it was nominated as best animated feature film, she wore a vintage 18-karat gold pendant set with cabochon-cut tourmalines that Mr. Heltzel had bought 50 years ago.Ms. Twomey said that, as an animator, she felt a special connection with Mr. Heltzel\u2019s work. \u201cFor someone like me, who has drawn all my life, I love to wear something which so much time, effort, skill and thought has gone into,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are pieces of art rather than jewelry.\u201dAs for wearing them on the red carpet, \u201cin a strange way, wearing pieces like this calm you down a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cThey give you the confidence to stand a little straighter, fill more air in your lungs. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dA resident of Kilkenny, Ms. Twomey said she had been \u201cwatching the window of Rudolf\u2019s shop over the years.\u201d Mr. Heltzel made her engagement and wedding rings and her favorite pair of earrings.Most years, Mr. Heltzel will sell three or four of the large sculptural pendants. It is other jewelry, including small pendants, earrings, bracelets and engagement rings, that are the company\u2019s bread and butter.Mr. Heltzel was born in Berlin, the son of a sculptor, and entered the Meisterschule f\u00fcr das Kunsthandwerk, a decorative arts school, when he was 16. It was 1956, and the city was still in ruins. Because of his natural aptitude, the school allowed him to simultaneously study silver and goldsmithing, two very different skills. \u201cSilversmiths make holloware, sculpture; goldsmiths make jewelry,\u201d he said.After graduation, Mr. Heltzel moved to Munich for a two-year apprenticeship making ecclesiastical items with Max Olofs, a metal artisan, and then in 1963 he went to Stockholm to work as a jewelry maker with the Scandinavian designer Sigurd Persson. \u201cHe was very avant-garde and intellectual, not just a \u2018craftsman\u2019,\u201d Mr. Heltzel recalled. \u201cI discovered totally new ways of looking at jewelry, using design as a way of expressing my own thinking.\u201dHis return to Berlin in 1965 was \u201cvery sobering,\u201d he said. The Berlin Wall had been built: \u201cWe were all hemmed in.\u201dIn 1966, reacting to a report criticizing Ireland\u2019s low standards in crafts and design, the Irish Export Board established the Kilkenny Design Workshops. The center was to feature silver and metalwork, weaving, textile printing, ceramics and woodworking; the board recruited design experts from around Europe to help.James King, then the center\u2019s general manager, said, \u201cRudolf was nominated by a number of distinguished European crafts critics at the time; he had impeccable credentials.\u201dMr. Heltzel, still just 25, said he \u201cleapt at the chance.\u201d He spent three years teaching at the workshops, then opened his own studio. \u201cPeople said I was crazy to stay in Ireland; there was no market here,\u201d he recalled.In the beginning, Mr. Heltzel exported most of his work, but, after 25 years in Kilkenny, almost all of his customers were Irish, something that still is true. \u201cIt\u2019s all by word of mouth,\u201d Mr. Heltzel said. \u201cSome clients claim to have over 55 pieces.\u201d And, he added, \u201cWe have grandmothers and granddaughters from the same families buying our pieces.\u201dMr. Heltzel said he believed that the skill of jewelry making was disappearing: \u201cOnce people knew jewelry designers by name. Every city had a modern jewelry gallery. That\u2019s all gone.\u201dMost contemporary jewelry, he said, is designed on a computer and mass-produced. \u201cAnd all for a profit,\u201d he added.Fifteen years ago, Christopher Heltzel left film a career in film financing to run the family business. \u201cI\u2019m happy I came back, but I wish I\u2019d started when I was 14,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more skilled you are, the more you can push design and technical boundaries.\u201dThe one modern twist to the 42-year-old\u2019s workshop is the gold itself. He buys it from a German company that uses what is called urban mining, amassing gold from recycled electrical goods like cellphones and laptops.\u201cThe process is rough, and you get dirty,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you end up with the most delicate sparkling shining piece.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Death in Streets, Nicaragua Cancels Social Security Revamp", "Date": "2018-04-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANAGUA, Nicaragua \u2014 President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua announced on Sunday that he was reversing a social security overhaul that had prompted days of protests in which up to two dozen people died.\u201cWe have to re-establish order,\u201d Mr. Ortega said in televised remarks. \u201cWe cannot allow groups to impose chaos, crime and looting.\u201dHis announcement seemed to acknowledge that the protests, which started on Wednesday as a picket by college students against the social security overhaul, had become a serious challenge to his authority.But it is unlikely to sway protesters who still have other grievances against his government \u2014 including Mr. Ortega\u2019s interference with the National Assembly, the law and the Constitution, like eliminating term limits. He is also widely criticized for having manipulated the Supreme Court, the elections council and mayoral races.The Nicaraguan leader has faced protests before, but at no point since his 2007 re-election have so many sectors united against him in what has become the greatest test of his presidency. Experts say it is the largest popular uprising here since the end of the nation\u2019s civil war nearly 30 years ago.If anything, students at Polytechnic University in Managua, who had been protesting for days, seemed galvanized by Mr. Ortega\u2019s Sunday announcement.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to move,\u201d said Golden Rivas, 36, a nursing major who had been at the Polytechnic University throughout the sit-in.Dara Nicole D\u00edaz, 18, a graphic design major, whipped out her cellphone to read a long list of the students\u2019 demands, which included the release of protesters detained in the past week and the resignation of the police chief.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a struggle just from now,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has been a dictatorship for almost 12 years. The people can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dMr. Ortega\u2019s announcement capped a weekend of intensifying pressure. The rallies had spread to cities around the nation and claimed up to two dozen lives, according to Cenidh, a leading human rights organization.The government posted images of city blocks burning, government buildings in shambles and widespread ransacking of supermarkets with no police officers in sight \u2014 looting that some accused the government of staging in order to justify a crackdown.At lunchtime on Sunday, before Mr. Ortega\u2019s announcement, the streets of central Managua were largely deserted, with businesses looted or shuttered, as tension lingered.The business group also said other sectors would have to join the talks.\u201cWe want to sit at a real table, not a false one,\u201d Fidel Narv\u00e1ez, 29, a lawyer organizing some of the protests in the capital, said before Mr. Ortega\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe want a national recall referendum.\u201dThe social security overhaul would have forced contributors to pay more into social security and retirees to receive 5 percent less.Now in his third consecutive term as president, Mr. Ortega has a strong grip on power, including every branch of government and the military. Many poor people who receive housing and other government benefits support him.\u201cThe objective of the people on the street, and the dead, was for the presidential couple to leave,\u201d said Fidel Moreira, the executive director of the Center for the Studies of Governability and Democracy, which supports the protests. \u201cLooking at logic and how power here is built, that is a little far-off.\u201dOscar Pupiro Zuniga, 62, a local leader of the government\u2019s leftist Sandinista Front party, acknowledged that the government had erred in not negotiating the social security overhaul with business and union leaders first, but he said well-financed right-wing groups had taken advantage of the issue to sow chaos.\u201cWhy do I say those students are being manipulated?\u201d Mr. Pupiro said. \u201cDid you see the trucks filled with water, mortars and everything else the students might need? It\u2019s not a fair protest.\u201dOn Friday, bankers joined the protests, as the nation\u2019s largest business group called both for a dialogue and a nationwide protest on Monday. The Roman Catholic Church provided refuge to students as it became increasingly unclear whether the church, the business community or any other interlocutor could step in and resolve the growing crisis.Saturday\u2019s protests were galvanized by a rambling midday speech by Mr. Ortega, who cited what he called the cynical nature of the protests and said they were organized by right-wing forces.He said his administration had worked hard to foster a positive image that encouraged tourism and investment, only to see that ruined by news coverage that harked back to the nation\u2019s years at war.After leading a 1979 revolution to overthrow a right-wing dictatorship, Mr. Ortega was president of Nicaragua in the 1980s. But a war financed by the United States marked his entire term in office until he was voted out in 1990. After losing several further elections, he took office again in 2007 when legal changes allowed him to win with a plurality.On Saturday, Fanor Avenda\u00f1o Alguera met with a group of other young professionals. They were strategizing their next move in the growing protests, when his phone started buzzing with messages from fellow doctors at a demonstration at the university, saying: \u201cHelp, they have us surrounded\u201d and \u201cThey\u2019re asphyxiating us.\u201dIn a flash, Dr. Avenda\u00f1o and the engineers, lawyers, economists and publicists at the meeting grabbed face masks and bottled water and dashed off to the university, where they were met by dozens of youths carrying slingshots, rocks and bags of paint. They surrounded the university building as volunteers and nearby residents offered them water and first aid, while police officers at another entrance pushed back against student protesters.The sound of mortar fire echoed in the air.An earlier version of this article misidentified Fanor Avenda\u00f1o Alguera. He is a doctor, but is not with the Polytechnic University.An earlier version of this article misstated the legal changes that allowed Daniel Ortega to win a presidential election in 2007. He was allowed to win by a plurality, not a simple majority.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Self-Destruction of Paul Ryan and the G.O.P.", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterSpinoza said that free will is like a stone that doesn\u2019t know why it\u2019s falling but wants to keep going. On Wednesday, Paul Ryan announced that he would not seek re-election. A midterm defeat, should Mr. Ryan have chosen to run, wasn\u2019t exactly inevitable. But when no less an authority than the speaker of the House of Representatives expressed the desire to rejoin his children, with all the freedom of plummeting rock longing to eat dirt, it confirmed what practically everyone suspects: The Republican Party is in free fall, and its House majority is racing toward annihilation.Mr. Ryan may be oblivious to the ultimate cause of his entirely free and unforced decision to spend more time with his kids, but it is, in a nutshell, Paul Ryan. He is truly the author of his own destiny.Politics isn\u2019t physics, but a governing Republican philosophy that sees it as a moral imperative to slash the budgets of social programs that benefit mainly older and working-class white people is bound, sooner or later, to drive a party of mainly older and working-class white people off a cliff. The slow-motion disaster now unfolding in Washington results in no small measure from Mr. Ryan\u2019s puzzling success in persuading Republican elites that they could flourish as the party of free-market, anti-redistributive convictions.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]Mr. Ryan\u2019s ideas have always resonated with the corporate Republican donor class. But they are indifferent, at best, to the challenges faced by the mass of ordinary Republican voters. For decades, American innovation and growth has been largely concentrating in a handful of big liberal cities. When the recovery finally came, it came to the Democratic metropolis. Most of the sparse Republican outlands never bounced back.Jobs were scarce, opioid addiction was rife, and life felt insecure. Indeed, life expectancy for many rural whites fell. A few red states graced with booming metro areas, like Texas, flourished under Republican regimes of low taxes and light regulation. But in more rural Republican states, like Kansas under Mr. Ryan\u2019s mentor and former boss, Gov. Sam Brownback, taxes had been cut to the bone, and the promised boom never materialized to make up for the loss and degradation of public services.Meanwhile, many tens of millions of loyal Republicans in struggling regions came to rely on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, unemployment insurance and disability benefits just to scrape by. By 2016, the last thing grass-roots Republicans wanted was yet another bloodless, ideologically rigid iteration of the stale Reagan formula. But thanks to the intellectual leadership of dogmatically small-government conservatives like Paul Ryan, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, that\u2019s mostly what they got. Except from Donald Trump.Mr. Trump spotted opportunity in the injured dignity of the Republican base and the feckless irrelevance of the establishment\u2019s agenda. He told Republicans shaken by the reality and risk of downward mobility that they were the only Americans who counted, and that they had been cheated and betrayed.He promised never to cut their Social Security or Medicare, and expressed admiration for single-payer health care. He took their side against immigrant rapists, murderous jihadis, plundering trade deals, dangerous city people and disloyal, condescending elites of all parties and persuasions. He promised to use his billionaire superpowers to rig the economy to their advantage. It didn\u2019t matter that he is a transparently corrupt, bigoted, sexually abusive, compulsive liar. He offered the dignity of recognition, promised to fight, and won.Mr. Ryan, who had dreamed of building a more inclusive party, was sincerely horrified by Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive white-identity politics. But there wasn\u2019t anything he and the Republican establishment could do about it. They had nothing with which to fight the towering inferno of resentment they had kindled through their arrogant, ideologically driven indifference to the pressing needs of the people they claim to represent.As soon as Mr. Trump clinched the nomination, Mr. Ryan became as tame as a poodle. Congressional leaders hoped that Mr. Trump\u2019s need for political cover might make him tractable, and that unified government would enable them to finally set America on the path to broad-based prosperity through tax cuts, entitlement reform and the replacement of Obamacare with something no one had bothered to work out.But the Republican majority was crippled from the start by the fundamental conflict between a government-shrinking agenda and the immediate material interests of Republican voters. Thus, the only thing Mr. Ryan has to show for his meekness in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s corruption and bigotry is an enormous tax cut that leaves the level of government spending basically untouched, except for interest payments on the debt, which the Congressional Budget Office now estimates will outstrip annual military spending in five years.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is bulldozing congressional Republicans into a mass grave. Democrats outnumber Republicans, so the latter depend on a sizable turnout advantage to win elections and sustain minority rule. But Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of scapegoating demagogy, which Mr. Ryan as speaker has done nothing but enable, is a turbocharged Democratic turnout machine that converts swing districts into Democratic seats and converts enormous Republican advantages into razor\u2019s edge contests. Barring a miracle, Republicans are going to lose their House majority, and even their Senate majority, once thought untouchable, is no longer safe.So Mr. Ryan has cornered himself, and his party. The Republican base won\u2019t buy what he\u2019s selling, unless it\u2019s awkwardly grafted onto white-identity populism, which is a self-annihilating strategy for mobilizing Democrats to the polls.The forthcoming implosion of Mr. Ryan\u2019s party, and his imminent retreat to Wisconsin, illustrates the danger of hidebound ideological overconfidence. Party elites in the grip of dogma can\u2019t see the point of checking in with the people they represent and are blind to new problems the partisan catechism is not equipped to comprehend. If a decent Republican Party one day rises from the devastation Paul Ryan practically invited Donald Trump to inflict, it will be one that has stopped legislating for an imaginary world of self-financing tax cuts, having rediscovered and realigned with the basic interests of aging and working-class white suburban and rural American voters. It will take their woes seriously, and nurture their welfare, not their grievance.Will Wilkinson is a contributing opinion writer and the vice president for policy at the Niskanen Center.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.E. Earnings Show Some Signs of a Turnaround", "Date": "2018-04-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeneral Electric reported a first-quarter loss on Friday, but there were also signs that the struggling industrial giant is beginning to stabilize its business.G.E.\u2019s big power-generator division continues to drag down the company\u2019s overall performance, and it is still burdened with financial liabilities that linger from the conglomerate\u2019s pared-back finance arm, GE Capital.But G.E.\u2019s other major industrial divisions, led by aviation and health care, delivered solid results in the quarter. That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines.In a conference call, John L. Flannery, the company\u2019s chief executive, called the quarterly results \u201ca good start\u201d to the year that showed \u201csigns of progress\u201d at G.E., with improving trends in industrial earnings, cash flow and profit margins.Especially heartening for investors, General Electric reaffirmed its profit outlook for the year, predicting earnings per share of $1 to $1.07, though likely at the lower end of that range, G.E. said. Analysts had been skeptical that G.E. could do that well. The average analysts\u2019 forecast for the year was 95 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.G.E. also reaffirmed that its free cash flow \u2014 funds available for the day-to-day running of a business \u2014 would be $6 billion to $7 billion for the year.The positive outlook for earnings and cash, despite the troubled power division, points to \u201cthe underlying performance in the core businesses,\u201d Jamie Miller, G.E.\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re really making progress.\u201dThe company\u2019s shares were about 4 percent higher at the close of trading.G.E. reported a net loss of $1.18 billion for the quarter, but it was mainly related to a one-time charge of $1.5 billion for liabilities in a subprime lender, WMC Mortgage, which G.E. once owned and is part of a federal investigation.The company\u2019s decision to set aside the $1.5 billion, analysts said, was an encouraging step to contain the financial fallout from the investigation. \u201cRisk is receding, not rising,\u201d said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair.Without that charge, the company\u2019s operating earnings per share rose 14 percent, to 16 cents a share, or 5 cents above analysts\u2019 estimates.Total revenue in the quarter rose 7 percent to nearly $28.7 billion, ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations, helped by the contribution from the merger of G.E.\u2019s oil-field equipment business with Baker Hughes last July. G.E. owns a majority stake in the combined company.But G.E.\u2019s revenue from industrial operations, excluding acquisitions and currency swings, fell 4 percent, to $23.8 billion. This so-called organic revenue does not include the merger-related lift from the Baker Hughes deal, and the falloff in G.E.\u2019s power-generator business more than offset the gains from aviation and health care.G.E.\u2019s power turbine business remains weak, with revenue down 9 percent and orders 29 percent lower.Since he became chief executive last August, Mr. Flannery has been wrestling with a series of setbacks.Last fall, he surprised investors by telling them the power-generation unit \u2014 long a pillar of strength for the company \u2014 was reeling. The division had badly misjudged the market, producing too many power turbines as global demand for electricity generation softened.At the time, Mr. Flannery warned that it might take a few years to fix the power business, prompting G.E. to cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression.Then, in January, G.E. delivered two more jolts. The company announced it would take a big charge and set aside $15 billion over seven years to pay for obligations held by GE Capital, mainly on long-term care insurance policies. G.E. had been shrinking its once-huge finance arm for years, and its liabilities were thought to be few, and known.The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company\u2019s handling of its insurance obligations and how it accounted for multiyear industrial services contracts.Mr. Flannery\u2019s blueprint for General Electric is not yet complete, but he did elaborate on his management philosophy on Friday. G.E., he said, must become a \u201csimpler, leaner, high-performance company,\u201d with a small headquarters staff and most decisions made by the individual businesses.G.E.\u2019s lighting and rail locomotive divisions are already up for sale, and others may follow.Mr. Flannery is also cutting costs aggressively. G.E. said it would trim expenses by more than $2 billion this year. \u201cFlannery is doing a good job on the things he can control and he\u2019s addressing the worry points,\u201d said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Advertisement"}

Their indictments shed light on the culture of influence peddling and less-than-savory financial transactions that Mr. Trump promised to root out if elected president. (He has done the opposite.)Keep in mind that Watergate, too, was a story about anonymous flows of money to political campaigns. Two chronicles of Richard Nixon\u2019s downfall stand out as particularly insightful right now: Elizabeth Drew\u2019s \u201cWashington Journal,\u201d a diary of the author\u2019s life while covering the scandal, and Leon Neyfakh\u2019s \u201cSlow Burn,\u201d a podcast on Watergate ephemera. These works don\u2019t tell the story of Watergate straight through but, instead, describe the experience of blundering through the scandal in a state of perpetual confusion, not knowing which parts of the story were important or what the overall story was.The United States is in a similar place today. In the midst of the chaos, seeing the Mueller investigation as an uncovering of corruption can elucidate one thread of the current story, even as the special counsel continues his bigger-picture study of obstruction and election interference away from the public eye.Instead, addressing them will require political will. The prosecution of Mr. Manafort may bring some justice, for example, but the loopholes that made possible the graft he is accused still exist for others to potentially exploit. In the absence of stricter, better-enforced regulations, foreign money will continue to be able to flow into United States elections.These are issues to which Mr. Mueller cannot provide a solution, however long the public waits. Mr. Mueller is both a prosecutor and a storyteller. But the response to the story he tells is up to the country to determine through politics.Advertisement"}

The company said it would still use background checks, but would bring in outside experts to review how the checks are used and would evaluate any recommended changes.Jenna Reck, a Target spokeswoman, said the company had made significant changes to its screening process in recent years \u2014 for instance, removing a criminal-history question from job applications. She wrote in an email that when hiring, Target tried \u201cto give everyone access to the same opportunities.\u201dAt issue was the company\u2019s practice of conducting criminal background checks on anyone applying for hourly and entry-level jobs in the United States.African-Americans and Hispanics are arrested and convicted at rates more than double those of whites, according to the suit, which said Target\u2019s hiring process \u201csystematically\u201d eliminated thousands of qualified applicants regardless of their potential to be good employees by requiring the automatic rejection of people convicted of offenses that could include violence, theft, fraud or drugs within the seven years of their applications.The policy, the suit said, \u201cimported acute racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system into the employment process, thereby multiplying the negative impact on African-American and Latino job applicants.\u201dComplaints about background checks in retail-sector hiring are not unique to Target.The Target conflict\u2019s origins date to Ms. Times\u2019s attempt to be hired as an overnight stocker at a Target store in South Windsor, Conn.She said she had told Target interviewers that she had a misdemeanor conviction from 1996, when she was in her mid-20s. After several interviews, she said, she received what Target called a conditional job offer contingent on the results of a criminal-background check.Later, she received a letter from Target with a copy of a background report showing she had two misdemeanor convictions from 1996, and she was eventually told that she would not be hired, according to court papers.The second applicant named in the suit, Erving Smith, said he had applied for a job as a stocker at a Target store in Pittsburgh in 2014. He told interviewers that he had been convicted 10 years earlier of a drug-related felony, but received a conditional job offer.Mr. Smith said a store manager called later to tell him that the offer was being rescinded because of the results of a background check, according to the suit.The jobs in dispute included stocker, cashier and cart-attendant positions, which the suit said could provide \u201cstable employment for many individuals who lack formal education or technical job skills and who are trying to get their lives back on track after some interaction with the criminal justice system.\u201dAs part of the proposed settlement of the suit, Target agreed to institute a priority hiring process so that certain people who had been turned away could get jobs. Others who are retired, already employed or otherwise unable to benefit from a job would be eligible for awards of up to $1,000 apiece from the settlement fund, to which the company agreed to contribute $3.7 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Reasons Deutsche Bank Didn\u2019t Exit Wall Street Earlier: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-04-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Deutsche Bank is finally, and drastically, shrinking itself.\u2022 Facebook can afford to clean up its act.\u2022 Is the problem with I.P.O.s a \u2018middle-market tax\u2019?\u2022 On today\u2019s earnings calendar: Amazon, Microsoft, PepsiCo and Lazard.Since the financial crisis a decade ago, the German institution\u2019s giant investment banking operations have lagged well behind those of its rivals. And Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems had relevance well beyond the trading desks of Wall Street; its difficulties have at times pumped uncertainty into the global financial system. Deutsche Bank\u2019s post-crisis behavior stands in contrast to that of other European investment banks that had also become risky and bloated before the 2008 meltdown. Switzerland\u2019s Credit Suisse and UBS made hard decisions several years ago that helped them adapt to new realities. But Deutsche Bank wavered and delayed. And since this probably won\u2019t be the last time that a too-big-to-fail bank takes too long to fix itself, it\u2019s worth asking why Deutsche Bank dragged its feet. Some reasons follow:- Peter EavisDeutsche Bank\u2019s decision to end its Wall Street ambitions should benefit its American rivals.The German lender said on Thursday that it was scaling back operations such as trading and providing services to hedge funds. According to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Deutsche Bank\u2019s decision to shrink its investment banking business should \u201chelp industry pricing and provide a revenue opportunity\u201d for United States banks.Deutsche Bank\u2019s scale of tradingLast year Deutsche Bank had a 7.7 percent share of the trading in bonds, currencies and commodities, and a 5.1 percent share of stock trading.Deutsche Bank reported \u20ac4.4 billion in revenue from fixed-income trading last year and another \u20ac2.1 billion from equity trading. Of the combined \u20ac6.5 billion in revenue it generated, 40 percent came from the United States, according to a note from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Which banks stand to benefitJPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup should get a lift from Deutsche Bank\u2019s pull back from fixed-income trading. The three banks\u2019 market share of fixed-income trading is nearly 50 percent.For stock trading, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have about 45 percent of the market.Amazon\u2019s profit more than doubled during the first quarter, while Microsoft\u2019s earnings jumped 35 percent. A driver for both companies was their cloud-computing businesses.Amazon\u2019s numbers\u2022 The e-commerce giant reported a profit of $1.6 billion, up from $724 million a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $3.27. Analysts expected $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 Revenue jumped 43 percent to $51 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $49.78 billion.\u2022 Operating income increased 92 percent to $1.9 billion in the first quarter.\u2022 Sales for Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing business, increased 49 percent to $5.4 billion.Critic\u2019s corner\u201cSales have more than doubled in five years, but it\u2019s taking more fixed assets to get there. Amazon now uses property and such with less efficiency than Walmart.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s numbers\u2022 The software giant posted a profit of $7.42 billion, up from $5.49 billion a year ago.\u2022 Earnings per share came in at 95 cents. Analysts expected 85 cents per share.\u2022 Revenue rose 16 percent to $26.82 billion, beating expectations of $25.77 billion.\u2022 Operating income rose 23 percent to $8.3 billion.\u2022 Revenue at Azure, Microsoft\u2019s could-computing business, surged 93 percent.Shares of Amazon climbed 7 percent after hours, while Microsoft\u2019s stock rose 2.1 percent.Critics\u2019 cornerSince hitting an intraday low of $150.80 on March 28, the stock has climbed 15 percent and reclaimed more than $60 billion in market value.Ross Sandler, an analyst at Barclays, writes:\u201cWe don\u2019t think 1Q marks the \u201call clear\u201d for FB shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period (next week\u2019s f8 should also help move the conversation back to innovation to some degree). Stepping back, FB\u2019s valuation is attractive vs. its peers, and while we fully expect more tape-bombs in 2018 we think patient investors will be rewarded at current levels when sentiment eventually improves.\u201dFacebook\u2019s first-quarter earnings featured a 63 percent jump in profit and a 49 percent rise in revenue. And roughly 70 million new monthly active users.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: If Facebook wants to spend more on protecting its community, it can: Its operating earnings are equivalent to 46 percent of its revenue. But its expense numbers haven\u2019t provided clear evidence that the company is going the extra mile yet.The key assessment, from the Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser:\u201cAll the data privacy issues, the congressional hearings, none of that will get as much scrutiny from investors as the bottom line.\u201dThe chipmaker reported results Wednesday that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The conference call that followed provided analysts an opportunity to ask about where Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP stands. The deal is awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, but growing trade tension between China and the United States has increasingly put the deal in doubt.Here is what Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said on the call:\u201cWe continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we expect to ultimately receive approval. And I\u2019ll just remind folks that we have 8 of 9 jurisdictions that have already ruled on it. So although we \u2014 we remain committed to it. And we think it\u2019s going to get done. However, if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the ability to move very rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the January time frame. I\u2019ll just remind everyone that we did a 90-day extension to the merger agreement. And we\u2019re going to work very hard to get that done. And if it doesn\u2019t get done, we\u2019re going to move on to another approach. So hopefully, that answers the question.\u201dA bit later in the call Mr. Mollenkopf added:\u201cWith respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is such that really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher-level discussions between the countries as opposed to any individual issue related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and work through any issues that pop up. But I think the environmental issues between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything else. But obviously, we work closely with the regulator.\u201dIt\u2019s not just regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley that put smaller companies off public listings, argues Rob Jackson, a Democratic S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that they pay on average 7 percent of proceeds raised in their offerings, way more than bigger clients.\u201cWith the deck stacked against them, it\u2019s no wonder that middle-market I.P.O.s have been on a steady decline. And this has had real effects across our economy, which is now dominated by fewer, and larger, public companies than ever before.\u201dHe suggests the S.E.C. should make underwriters disclose more about the costs of going public, including companies\u2019 potential losses from underpricing, and that bankers should do more to explain why they\u2019re worth their fees.What Jeffrey Lurie, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, said, according to the NYT:\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else.\u201dBob Kraft of the New England Patriots, a friend of Mr. Trump, said:\u201cThe problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don\u2019t feel is in the best interests of America.\u201dThere\u2019s no question that it will help make sense of Randall Stephenson\u2019s expansion of AT&T into the pay-TV market and improve AT&T\u2019s positioning and value proposition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018We Are Nicaragua\u2019: Students Revolt, but Now Face a More Daunting Task", "Date": "2018-04-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANAGUA, Nicaragua \u2014 The hundreds of hot dog buns, bananas and containers of instant soup stacked up at the Polytechnic University basketball court suggest that the young people hunkered down here are not planning to capitulate.\u201cThis is not a war; this a struggle we young people are doing,\u201d said Freddy Mart\u00ednez, one of the few people here who revealed his face and name. \u201cWe are not left or right. We are Nicaragua.\u201dThe protests led to the deaths of dozens of people this month, many at the hands of the police, human rights groups say. Outrage over the killings drove thousands more people to the streets and quickly became the biggest challenge to Mr. Ortega, a Cold War foe of the United States, since he returned to the presidency in 2007.Days of rallies forced Mr. Ortega to withdraw his social security cutbacks, release detained protesters and allow a television station back on the air.But now a critical stage in the standoff begins. Can the students, who astonished and awakened this Central American nation of six million people, transform their street activism into actual political change?The protesters at the Polytechnic University, many of whom are not even enrolled here, are convinced they can get a new electoral council chosen, which would lead to early presidential elections. They also insist that top police leaders be replaced, and that the killers of the protesters be brought to justice, among other demands. After days of refusing, the students have agreed to negotiate with the government.In the meantime, the young people have dug trenches around the university here in the capital, Managua. Signs of wear are starting to show on the protesters, as days of sleep deprivation, the constant sound of mortar fire and the fear of a police crackdown strain their frayed nerves. Many students have already abandoned the site.Two people were killed here at the university on Sunday evening, the students say, arguing that one of the protest leaders was actually an infiltrator who revealed logistical information to the police.Many of the students describe a jarring and confusing set of experiences that both propelled their movement and left them wondering how long it will hold together. One student leader, Jeancarlo L\u00f3pez, 21, said he joined the effort after a stranger died in his arms at a demonstration last week. Another student feared that a fellow protester was trying to kill her. Yet another said that she had collected thousands of dollars for the movement, but then someone stole it, so she gave up and went home.One 18-year-old with bloodshot eyes and skinny jeans said he tried firing a homemade mortar-launcher from a rooftop, but it blew up in his hands. His parents came to get him, but he returned to the protest with his arm wrapped in a bandage.\u201cThey were worried,\u201d he said through the layers of fabric masking his face as he clutched a tube of pain reliever cream.Sauting Onsang, one of several volunteer medics who have been at the university for nearly a week, said the students were trying to get organized. They named themselves the 19th of April Student Movement, after the day students began dying at protests. They also formed a working group of 25 representatives, while the others drilled them on their oratory skills.\u201cWe practiced screaming at them; anyone who cried was cut,\u201d Mr. Onsang said. \u201cRight now we need some time to prepare our topics, and to prepare, we need sleep.\u201dThe negotiations with the government are being promoted by the Roman Catholic Church and a leading business organization. \u201cThe young people are asking for a few days to organize,\u201d said Monsignor Silvio B\u00e1ez, acknowledging that he has hardly been impartial. \u201cI am absolutely on the side of the kids. I believe in this. I thank the students for waking up the public.\u201dAlthough analysts here are in shock at what the students have already done, they are not confident about the protesters\u2019 bigger objectives. If the president does not resign or agree to new elections, what is the endgame?Alejandro Aguilar, a former law school dean here who was fired after he criticized the government, said that the lack of a clear leader helped the students because it made the movement harder to quash. But the same leadership void also makes it more difficult for them to choose goals and strategize.\u201cDaniel Ortega is not going to give up power because the students asked him to,\u201d Mr. Aguilar said. \u201cThe students have done enough: They moved the consciences of the people of Nicaragua. There\u2019s quite a bit of admiration for them. Everyone thought all they cared about was Wi-Fi, social networks, pictures and parties.\u201dThe governing party also said it was \u201cworth noting\u201d that the two universities where the protests began were religious universities \u201csubsidized by the state\u201d and that the protests were not a spur-of-the-moment occurrence.\u201cDespite the apparent lack of direction of the protests, it powerfully calls our attention that there was perfect coordination, synchronized actions and of the same type everywhere, as if something had already been prepared, ready to be activated when the conditions were right,\u201d the statement said.Meanwhile, Nicaragua\u2019s colleges and universities are not holding classes.Leonel Morales, one of the union\u2019s leaders, said that most students wanted to leave after the social security change was repealed on Sunday, but that young people from off campus had taken over and would not let him go. So he sneaked out instead, he said.\u201cThey kidnapped the university,\u201d Mr. Morales said at a news conference. \u201cLet all those who are there show their student ID.\u201dJessenia Valeska Valle Duarte, 22, an accounting major at the Central American University in Managua who is serving as a spokeswoman for the students, denied that the protesters were affiliated with any political party, emphasizing that the national student union does not speak for them.\u201cWe ask the people of Nicaragua not to abandon us,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir struggle, I\u2019ll repeat it again, is our struggle. We are going to make demands until they are fulfilled.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Professionals Make Car Buying Easy, but You Have to Shop Around", "Date": "2018-04-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsJeffry Melnick didn\u2019t want the hassle and anxiety of shopping for a car when he set out to buy one last year.\u201cWhen they say to me, \u2018Do you want to look under the hood?\u2019 No,\u201d Mr. Melnick said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201dSo he hired someone to do his haggling for him.Mr. Melnick, a semiretired theatrical agent who lives in Palm Springs, Calif., called Authority Auto, a car-buying service based in Tarzana, and told it what he wanted \u2014 and what he wanted to pay.Mr. Melnick favored a Mercedes-Benz GLE in Polar White with a modest option list that would keep the sport-utility vehicle in his price range. Although a dealer had told him that what he wanted wasn\u2019t available in white, the negotiator got Mr. Melnick the GLE he was after \u2014 in white \u2014 with more options than he thought his budget would allow.\u201cIt\u2019s very tricked out,\u201d Mr. Melnick said. \u201cI don\u2019t like car shopping, but I do like gadgets.\u201dAuthority Auto is owned by Oren Weintraub, one of a small fraternity of negotiators who make a living doing exactly what most car buyers dread. Negotiators claim that their services protect consumers from unscrupulous dealers, save time and most of all save money on cars both new and used, whether bought or leased.Mr. Weintraub has periodically accepted a public challenge to prove his worth. In August, the syndicated TV program \u201cMoney Talks News\u201d pitted him against the financial services company USAA (a partner of the buying service TrueCar) and the show\u2019s host to buy a Mercedes that listed for more than $46,000. Mr. Weintraub\u2019s total discount of more than $7,200 beat the next best deal by more than $2,000.But finding a negotiator can be tricky. There is no standard name for these services \u2014 some call themselves a buying service, others a negotiating service, some a broker, still others a concierge. Each seems to operate in its own way.Mr. Weintraub, a former car salesman, said he worked with buyers from start to finish. He will help them choose a car and negotiate the sales price, finance rate, and aftermarket products like service contacts and wheel and paint protection. He works nationwide and charges $600 to $1,500, depending on the cost of the car. For an additional $300 he will also sell the client\u2019s old car.Mike Rabkin of From Car to Finish in Rockville, Md., does less initial consulting. Clients fill out an online order form for the model, color and options they want. Mr. Rabkin then has dealers bid for their business. Negotiating financing and aftermarket products is left to the client. He charges $250.Greg Macke, who calls himself \u201cYour Car Angel,\u201d helps clients pick a car, arranges a test drive, negotiates the purchase and accompanies the buyer to a dealership. He even inspects used cars. But he accepts only clients who live near Los Angeles for his $750 service.\u201cThe key to inspections is laying eyes on the car,\u201d he said.Paul Maloney is a New York-based former fleet director with an Australian accent and a snappy line of patter. He calls his business the Car Leasing Concierge, although he handles new-car sales as well. He sends clients to a dealership with a free work sheet, then, for a fee, he will assess the deal to see if he can beat it. His is a tiered service that tops out with his assessing your deal and handling your purchase for $297.You might think dealerships tremble at their approach, but the negotiators \u2014 who said they helped with between 125 and 1,000 purchases a year \u2014 say that is not the case.\u201cWe buy so much merchandise from them that we are an asset to them,\u201d said Greg Pence, manager of car-buying services for AAA Carolinas, whose in-house service buys about 1,200 cars a year. He said dealerships liked that the professional negotiators closed deals quickly, \u201cusually within a good 30 minutes or so.\u201dThe negotiators compete with services like TrueCar, which don\u2019t charge the consumer but do charge the dealers \u2014 who may pass the cost on to the consumer.Michael S. Freeman II, the executive manager of Sunset Chevrolet Buick GMC in Sarasota, Fla., said the average profit on a car was 2 percent. On a $30,000 car that would be $600. TrueCar, he said, charges a fee of $300 for each new car sold on a referral.\u201cWhen we get someone from TrueCar, we have to cut a check,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cThat is factored into the price.\u201dTrueCar is the technology behind 500 buying services, like those of publications like Car & Driver and U.S. News and World Report, and companies like USAA and Sam\u2019s Club. The dealers get their referrals from TrueCar, which displays prices from its member dealerships and allows prospective buyers to compare the out-the-door cost for the vehicle they want. That eliminates haggling \u2014 for better or worse.The details of how a dealer reaches the price that TrueCar displays are complex, said Veronica Cardenas, a spokeswoman for TrueCar, but \u201cit\u2019s not a race to the bottom.\u201d She added, \u201cThe idea is you are getting a competitive price.\u201dThere are competitors that charge dealerships a modest monthly fee, such as Costco and CarGurus, which dealers said gave them more room to discount. (Sometimes, getting the very best deal comes from buying at just the right time. Dealers receive bonuses based on sale quotas, meaning they might give bigger discounts if they\u2019re trying to hit a benchmark. On the other hand, that means dealers might not know how profitable a deal is for them until well after a sale agreement is signed.)Several negotiators warned that competitors took money from dealerships and colluded on deals. The negotiation industry isn\u2019t regulated, nor is it represented by a trade group. Customers have to make a best guess using online reviews to determine if a buying service is a good fit, and that information can be ambiguous.Take, for instance, Mr. Rabkin, who has a spotless A-plus rating from the Better Business Bureau. There are two reviews on Angie\u2019s List for 2017, an A and a B grade, and he has a slew of overwhelmingly positive testimonials on LinkedIn and Yelp. But the most recent of those testimonials are dated 2015. Mr. Rabkin pointed out he had no control over when people reviewed his service online.Hiring a pro buyer is likely to save you money, but not more than you can save yourself, said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a trade group of consumer lawyers.\u201cThere is enough information out there today that you don\u2019t have to be the most sophisticated buyer to know what the real cost should be,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a buying service unless you are intimidated by the process, and there are those people.\u201dFor people who are anxious about car buying, or whose time is too valuable to spend it bargaining over a sticker price, a buying service can be worthwhile. But there are also buyers who hire a professional negotiator because they aim to bully every last nickel out of a dealership. Because of the nature of industry incentives, though, they can never really know if they achieved that goal.\u201cThose people,\u201d Mr. Rheingold said, \u201cneed to get a life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finance Isn\u2019t Just for Fat Cats", "Date": "2018-04-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBODA, Central African Republic \u2014 Nina Beina, a widowed mother of 11, couldn\u2019t wait to give me a tour of the land she had just bought. She beamed as she showed me the site where her children will build their homes.The idea is that villagers gather regularly and deposit tiny sums \u2014 often less than a dollar \u2014 into a pool, which is then lent to a member of the group. The loan is paid back over time, and it is often used to help people start small businesses. For Ms. Beina, the new land for her children will give her more space in her already overcrowded home.For vulnerable populations, especially women, \u201cit empowers them to save,\u201d said Laura Dills, who oversees a range of Catholic Relief Services\u2019 programming, including the organization\u2019s microfinance efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re actually building that capacity to go after loans in a very safe setting that\u2019s not going to risk any of their assets.\u201dSome years ago there was a great deal of excitement among philanthropic groups about microlending, but that has worn off a bit. Meanwhile, it seems that microsavings may be the more important part of microfinance. Those savings are then used to make loans as well.Meeting women like Ms. Beina made it apparent that these savings groups can make a substantial difference for people, especially women, in incredibly difficult circumstances. They provide critical opportunities to some of the world\u2019s poorest communities where access to formal financial institutions is nearly impossible.This is particularly true in Boda, a town that was overtaken by fighting in 2012, where, for many, resources such as markets and schools are still difficult to access. Ms. Beina, for example, hasn\u2019t left the small Muslim enclave where she lives for the past five years. A convert from Catholicism, she was caught in the middle of the conflict that broke out along religious lines. Though the fighting has subsided, Ms. Beina still worries about her safety.But because Boda is no longer considered an emergency zone, the number of aid organizations here is dwindling. As aid groups move on from Boda, savings groups present a sustainable solution. Not only are the costs required for training the groups quite low, but also the members often continue the savings groups beyond the nine-month period during which aid workers provide support.Besides the economic benefits they produce, savings groups also have benefits for social cohesion, particularly in post-conflict areas.\u201cIt creates solidarity,\u201d Ms. Dills said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to lend money to people you don\u2019t know.\u201dIn Boda, Catholic Relief Services has initiated the creation of 120 savings groups with roughly 1,660 members. The savings have resulted in a variety of investments. Some, like Ms. Beina, have used the available capital to buy land and build homes, while others have enhanced their agriculture businesses by investing in gardening tools or more profitable seeds. Funds have also been used as capital to launch new businesses selling oil, spices or cassava, or to pay for medical expenses.Catholic Relief Services has replicated this success worldwide: The organization has helped start more than 130,000 groups with over 3 million members. These groups, it says, have accumulated more than $22 million in savings.Ms. Beina is already looking forward to her next loan. Once she finishes paying this one back, she plans to use her next loan to expand her crop production. Her main source of revenue \u2014 selling cassava \u2014 isn\u2019t enough to support her entire family, so she wants to start selling more profitable goods.Tyler Pager graduated from Northwestern University and is studying at Oxford University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Fallout Deals Blow to Mercers\u2019 Political Clout", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast month, a friend of the wealthy conservative donor Rebekah Mercer arrived at Facebook\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters. His task: Find out what \u2014 if anything \u2014 could repair relations between Facebook, the world\u2019s biggest social media company, and Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling firm co-founded by her father and used by the Trump campaign.And last month, after reports on Cambridge in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian, Facebook banned the company from its platform, a major blow to any political or commercial targeting firm. Not a single American candidate or \u201csuper PAC\u201d committee has reported payments to the company since the 2016 campaign, according to federal records.Several Republicans in Ms. Mercer\u2019s orbit or with knowledge of Cambridge\u2019s business said that fallout from the Facebook scandal \u2014 combined with widespread doubts about the accuracy of Cambridge\u2019s psychological profiles of voters \u2014 had effectively crippled the firm\u2019s election work in the United States.\u201cThey\u2019re selling magic in a bottle,\u201d said Matt Braynard, who worked alongside Cambridge on the Trump campaign, for which he served as the director of data and strategy, and now runs Look Ahead America, a group seeking to turn out disaffected rural and blue-collar voters. \u201cAnd they\u2019re becoming toxic.\u201dThe Mercers have made no public statements about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s troubles. Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about her role in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle or the Facebook meeting about Cambridge Analytica.But the effort by Ms. Mercer\u2019s friend to help mend fences with Facebook hints at both Cambridge\u2019s importance to her family\u2019s political ambitions and the perils posed by Facebook\u2019s ban.Although a Cambridge spokesman last month downplayed Ms. Mercer\u2019s role at the company \u2014 saying she had a \u201cbroad business oversight\u201d role and no involvement in its daily operations \u2014 she serves on the company\u2019s board and in the past has worked to drum up campaign business for Cambridge, according to Republicans who have worked with or competed against the firm. Former Cambridge employees said she was close to Alexander Nix, the company\u2019s chief executive, who was suspended last month after reports on Cambridge\u2019s harvesting of Facebook data.Mr. Michelsen acknowledged in an interview on Thursday that he visited the company but he would not discuss the purpose of the trip, citing nondisclosure agreements Facebook required him to sign. Ms. Mercer declined to say whether she and Mr. Michelsen had discussed the purpose of the meeting or whether he had briefed her on it afterward.In recent years, the Mercers have become among the most prominent and highly scrutinized political donors in the United States. In the early years of the Obama administration, they began doling out tens of millions of dollars to an eclectic array of conservative groups \u2014 many of them outside Washington\u2019s mainline Republican establishment. Mr. Mercer invested $10 million in Breitbart News, the nationalist website, bringing on Mr. Bannon as chairman, while Ms. Mercer joined the boards of leading conservative think tanks.The Mercers were critical of the Republican Party\u2019s existing data apparatus, which was controlled by the party officials and consultants they hoped to disempower. Mr. Mercer bankrolled Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and Ms. Mercer encouraged candidates and PACs that took the family\u2019s money to also hire the family\u2019s data firm. Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, the Mercers backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, putting millions of dollars \u2014 and Cambridge Analytica \u2014 behind him.But after Mr. Trump prevailed in the primaries, the Mercers switched candidates. In summer 2016, Ms. Mercer helped orchestrate a shake-up that put Mr. Bannon at the head of the Trump campaign. After Mr. Trump won the presidential election, he attended a costume ball at the Mercer estate on Long Island.But her insistence on using Cambridge to provide the Trump group with voter data, and other clashes over strategy, alienated other donors and Trump allies, according to other Republicans. Ms. Mercer formed her own group, Making America Great, and hired Emily Cornell, a Cambridge executive, to run it.Yet after an initial splash of spending in 2017 to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on environmental deregulation and other issues, Making America Great appears to have gone quiet. Ms. Cornell said she was no longer affiliated with Making America Great and could not comment on the group.The family is likely to retain significant influence in broader conservative circles thanks to its vast fortune, which finances donations that many political organizations and candidates are eager to accept. The family foundation handed out about $20 million to more than two dozen conservative think tanks, charter school groups, watchdog outfits and other nonprofit organizations in 2016, according to its most recent tax return.The family has also donated $4.5 million to Republican candidates and super PACs during the 2018 election cycle, putting the Mercers among the top 20 donors in the country. And the father-daughter duo still inspire fear: Virtually no Republicans were willing to speak on the record about the family\u2019s troubles.\u201cI would not confuse silence with them being out,\u201d said Dan K. Eberhart, a Colorado drilling-services executive who is active in America First Policies, now the lead pro-Trump political advocacy group. \u201cI think they\u2019re very strategic, and I think they\u2019re quiet folks.\u201dThat grant, the Mercer foundation\u2019s first recorded contribution to DonorsTrust, could herald a shift in the family\u2019s philanthropic strategy. DonorsTrust helps wealthy conservatives obtain charitable tax benefits while \u2014 if so desired \u2014 shielding their giving from public view. The donor records a contribution to DonorsTrust and recommends potential recipients, while grantees receive a donation from DonorsTrust charitable vehicles. In 2016, DonorsTrust disbursed more than $66 million worth of such grants.Such mechanisms, which are legal, are used by many donors on the right and the left. Ms. Mercer declined to answer questions about whether she intended to shift more of her family\u2019s future political philanthropy into intermediaries like DonorsTrust. A 2017 tax return for the Mercer foundation is not yet publicly available.\u201cMs. Mercer is a private person,\u201d her spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cAnd she does not intend to discuss with the media either the conversations she has with her close friends or her philanthropic and charitable giving.\u201dLawson Bader, the president of DonorsTrust, referred questions to the Mercers. \u201cI do not discuss DonorsTrust accounts real or imagined,\u201d he said in an email.Exactly what ambitions the Mercers, who joined the Emerdata board last month, have for the company is unclear. Another Emerdata director, Johnson Ko Chun Shun, is a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince \u2014 the brother of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and founder of the private security firm formerly known as Blackwater. Mr. Ko, who declined to comment, is a substantial shareholder and deputy chairman in Mr. Prince\u2019s Africa-focused logistics company, Frontier Services Group.Mr. Ko and Mr. Prince have links to the Chinese government: Another major Frontier investor is Citic, a state-owned Chinese financial conglomerate that for decades has employed the sons and daughters of the Communist Party\u2019s elite families.Emerdata has a second Hong Kong-based director, Peng Cheng. Little public information about Ms. Peng, a British citizen, is available. But a woman with the same name is the chief executive of a publishing and online game company located in the same Hong Kong office tower as Frontier Services. In 2016, Mr. Ko\u2019s brokerage company said it would buy a stake in Ms. Peng\u2019s company, Culturecom.Michael Forsythe, Sheera Frenkel and Austin Ramzy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Your Fixer-Upper Is Your Hometown", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersDarla Moore came from humble roots. She grew up in Lake City, S.C., an agricultural community with a population of 6,675.About 10 years ago, Ms. Moore began spending more time in Lake City, where her grandparents had farmed and her father, a school principal and coach, was a local leader. She attributed her success to her upbringing among a diverse group of people who worked primarily in agriculture.But it seemed that Lake City\u2019s best days in the tobacco and cotton trade were behind it, and Ms. Moore was determined to fix it up. In the last decade, she said, she has given about $100 million to support the town.On her return to her hometown, Ms. Moore found that philanthropy takes finesse. \u201cI didn\u2019t walk in and say, \u2018I\u2019m back, and I\u2019ve brought a bunch of money, so let\u2019s fix ourselves up,\u2019 \u201d she said. Instead, she paid for a study to see if anything could be done. It turned out there was a lot.Her credentials as a philanthropist are well established. She has given $70 million to the University of South Carolina, which named the business school after her, and made a $10 million gift to Clemson University, where her father was a star football and baseball player.But Ms. Moore knew she was going to need the town\u2019s constituents, regardless of age or race, to buy into a vision they all could share. There were more than a few doubters, she said.\u201cI had a lot of credibility in the town because of my father and grandparents, not because of my resources,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t do it without that. I\u2019ve known people who\u2019ve gone into towns with a large amount of money, and it failed. It\u2019s hugely complex.\u201dLike much in philanthropy today, many of these makeover projects require a mix of giving and investments with a social return so they can be sustainable. That combination helped Hamilton, Mo., population 1,809.In 2008, two of Jenny Doan\u2019s seven children gave her a sewing machine designed for quilting. Twelve feet long and seven feet wide, the machine was too big for the family\u2019s home. So they bought a building to house it. Real estate was cheap because the town was struggling and many buildings had been neglected.The company now owns 26 buildings, including 14 quilt shops, three restaurants and a quilting retreat house for women, where up to 40 visitors can stay.\u201cWe bought as many buildings as we could,\u201d Ms. Doan said. But they all required extensive work before the Doans could use them.She said the company had poured all of its profits back into the town for many years. It even put in the sidewalks along Main Street. Missouri Star Quilt now employs 450 people, mostly from the town.\u201cThis was one of the poorest counties in Missouri, and now people have a job,\u201d Ms. Doan said.Rebuilding a civic space can be daunting and take years, if not longer, said Paul S. Grogan, president and chief executive of the Boston Foundation, one of the nation\u2019s oldest and largest community foundations. He said it was important to record small milestones.\u201cThe little victories add up to something significant,\u201d said Mr. Grogan, whose background is in community development. \u201cIt becomes substantial. In a neighborhood accustomed to failure, you generate some success.\u201dBut she has also funded less-glamorous tasks, like running high-speed fiber-optic lines into town.For community leaders who lack resources, Mr. Grogan said, rehabilitating just one house or creating a community garden can have a catalytic effect. \u201cYou think, \u2018How could those things possibly make a difference?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut they do.\u201dEventually, though, these towns need to attract outsiders to keep them viable. Ms. Doan\u2019s quilting stardom \u2014 her YouTube channel has nearly 500,000 subscribers \u2014 drew tourists to Hamilton. That, in turn, brought in other businesses.\u201cIn the beginning, not everyone was happy we were turning our farm community into a quilting community,\u201d Ms. Doan said. \u201cFor those people who weren\u2019t happy, we hired their children, and now they love us.\u201dIn Lake City, Ms. Moore knew she had to create an event to bring in visitors. Plenty of people go to nearby Charleston for its historical charm and opera festival and to Myrtle Beach for its golf and 60-mile stretch of coastline, but Lake City was not on anyone\u2019s must-see list.In a meeting with advisers, some of whom she had known since she was a girl, one talked about an art festival in Grand Rapids, Mich., that is supported by members of the DeVos family, whose wealth comes from Amway, the multilevel marketing company. Ms. Moore thought that doing something similar with art from Southeastern states might work in Lake City.One shop owner, Barbara Miles, met with controversy last year when she selected a provocative tapestry from the festival to hang in her store, the East Main Market. But Ms. Moore said she had decided the artwork should stay. \u201cIt was a real humdinger of an image,\u201d she said.Some philanthropists are drawn to the challenge of renewing neighborhoods in big cities.He said the festival, which draws attendees from the city and beyond, helped 80 businesses in the neighborhood. But Mr. Samuelsson said he was proud that 40 percent of the events were free, up from 20 percent when the festival started.Harlem is a neighborhood with a deep cultural history, but Mr. Samuelsson saw this festival as a way to highlight its businesses. His goal has been to use a week of fun to bring economic benefits to Harlem and Spanish Harlem by connecting event sponsors with local chefs and restaurant owners.\u201cIt\u2019s a great place to live, to open a business, to create jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important that the restaurateurs meet sponsors like Ernst & Young or Citibank. That\u2019s massive because the next time they need a business loan, they might be coached by Ernst & Young and get the loan from Citibank.\u201dThat added benefit of opening up people\u2019s eyes to a community is something all of these endeavors have in common.Advertisement"}

And it delved deeply into Mr. Cohen\u2019s past, including documents about Mr. Cohen\u2019s personal and business finances, including his work as a New York taxi fleet manager.The investigation is being run by Robert S. Khuzami, whose boss, Geoffrey S. Berman, the interim United States attorney in Manhattan, has recused himself. Mr. Khuzami is a veteran federal prosecutor who spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention in support of President George W. Bush and later led the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Obama administration.Though the raids on Mr. Cohen\u2019s office and hotel room were overseen by Mr. Khuzami, people close to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen regard the investigation as a surreptitious attempt by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to pry into Mr. Trump\u2019s personal life by using other prosecutors as his proxy in focusing on a lawyer who has represented him for more than a decade.Asked for comment on Wednesday, Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, referred to his earlier description of the raids as \u201ccompletely inappropriate and unnecessary.\u201d He has described the raids as an overreach by prosecutors into the privileged communications between Mr. Cohen and his client, Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump, furious about the raids, has cooled on the idea of sitting for an interview with Mr. Mueller and is considering a more adversarial approach to the special counsel\u2019s investigation.Since Mr. Mueller was appointed last May, Mr. Trump had taken a largely nonconfrontational approach to the investigation, providing tens of thousands of pages of emails, notes, memos and other documents as part of an effort to show he has nothing to hide and to hasten the end of the investigation.As recently as December, Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Mueller would treat him fairly. And Mr. Trump has repeatedly said in public and in private that he wanted to sit with Mr. Mueller for an interview. After the search warrant, Mr. Trump now is convinced that his initial belief that Mr. Mueller is simply out to destroy his presidency was correct.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, criticized Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation on Wednesday for going beyond its mandate to look into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and into the ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia.But Mr. Cohen has acknowledged paying $130,000 to Ms. Clifford, who said she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump and signed a nondisclosure agreement promising not to discuss the matter. Mr. Cohen has insisted there was no relationship, but that he sought to keep a damaging story from emerging regardless.Mr. Cohen had no formal role on the campaign, and Mr. Trump and his top campaign aides sought to limit his involvement. Still, Mr. Cohen was able to fill certain political voids that no one else seemed able to, such as forming a so-called diversity coalition of African-American, Hispanic and Muslim supporters, and he also raised money for the campaign and later for Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee.Perhaps equally significant for Mr. Trump was Mr. Cohen\u2019s presence on television, particularly after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, when the candidate had few defenders.\u201cI have never heard Mr. Trump say anything even remotely close to the statements that I heard,\u201d Mr. Cohen said about the tape in one appearance on CNN. \u201cWhen I first heard that there was a tape that was going to be coming out, I said it\u2019s got to be fake because \u2014 and I spend thousands of hours with Mr. Trump a year. And I can tell you I have never heard him say anything, anything even close to that.\u201dBenjamin Weiser contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

And like last time, economists say, it\u2019s primarily the government\u2019s fault.Empty A.T.M.s and bank restrictions on withdrawals have been reported in eight states this week, and some bank managers said the cash crunch had been building for months.On Monday, Sampath Kumar Lohati drove his scooter around Warangal, a city in the south Indian state of Telangana, for more than four hours trying to withdraw money.\u201cI tried at least 50 to 60 A.T.M.s,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut I could not find any cash.\u201d Mr. Lohati, an insurance agent, finally got money on Tuesday after an A.T.M. near his home was refilled.Most Indians work at informal jobs that operate almost entirely in cash, from roadside food stands to day laborers. People in such jobs had already seen some work dry up because of the shock 2016 demonetization, as well as the imposition of a cumbersome national tax on goods and services in 2017 that has sought to formalize transactions that had previously been off the books.Depending on how long it lasts, the current cash crunch will further dent the incomes of those workers, who are a critical part of the voter base of Mr. Modi\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party.\u201cIf this kind of shortage is there and the unorganized sector gets hit again, which it will, if the cash shortage persists, then there has got to be fallout from that,\u201d said Arun Kumar, a professor at the Institute of Social Sciences in New Delhi who studies public finance and the illicit economy. \u201cThat will be very damaging to the ruling party.\u201dEconomists say that the cash shortage has no single cause, but rather is the result of a combination of factors.Meanwhile, hoarders and black market operators started stockpiling 2,000-rupee notes, worth about $30 each. Rather than expanding the supply to compensate, the government decided to stop printing the high-value bills, forcing banks to fill A.T.M.s with lower denomination notes, which run out more quickly.Public faith in the safety of India\u2019s banks has also faltered over the past year, prompting people to keep more cash at home.The Modi government, warning of a growing problem with bad bank loans, last fall pledged $32 billion in taxpayer funds to bail out weak lenders. It also proposed legislation that could force depositors with more than $1,500 in an account to take a loss if their bank failed.\u201cMany people got scared,\u201d said Radha Rani, a senior manager at Indian Bank, another state-owned bank, in Warangal. \u201cThey are keeping money in their houses or investing in real estate. They have fear of losing money if deposited in the bank. So many people directly told us that.\u201dG. Ravinder, 55, an architect and consultant in Warangal, said that he had issued paychecks to the laborers working on his projects but that they had been unable to cash them.His bank, the State Bank of India, the country\u2019s largest bank, will not allow him to withdraw enough cash from the branch either. \u201cI went to the bank to withdraw 40,000 rupees, but they said, \u2018Sorry, we can give you only 20,000 rupees,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo how do I do my work?\u201dThe harvest and marriage seasons are looming, increasing demand for cash. If the shortage is not quickly eased, more customers will demand their money, potentially causing a much bigger problem: a bank run.\u201cWe have deposited our own money in the bank with the assumption that whenever we need money, we can get it from the bank. When banks are not giving money, then people are scared that bank deposits are not safe,\u201d Mr. Ravinder said. \u201cThat is why people are withdrawing their money from the banks.\u201dHari Kumar reported from New Delhi, and Vindu Goel from Mumbai.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Regulators are about to hit Wells Fargo with a $1 billion penalty.\u2022 The European Union is prepared to offer some trade concessions.\u2022 Two big drug makers have shown interest in bidding for Shire.\u2022 How the Time Warner C.E.O. did on the stand yesterday.\u2022 Dates to watch in the U.S.-China trade fight.The basics:\u2022 It would be the most stringent action taken against a bank by the Trump administration.\u2022 The action is said to punish Wells Fargo for forcing customers to buy auto insurance they didn\u2019t need, improperly charging mortgage customers and for having inadequate compliance practices.The misdeeds at Wells Fargo showed that the bank\u2019s sales culture had degraded. Bank employees, eager to meet sales goals, had been opening accounts for customers without their consent. Other misdeeds were revealed as well.The scandals were particularly surprising because Wells Fargo, with its focus on traditional lending, was widely viewed as a worthy alternative to the Wall Street-focused institutions at the center of the financial crisis of 2008. Wells Fargo\u2019s steady revenue growth and its habit of invariably beating earnings forecasts lulled investors into a false sense of confidence and led them to pile into Wells Fargo\u2019s stock.\u2014 Peter EavisCritics\u2019 cornerNow would not seem like the ideal to start a venture capital firm that aims to help U.S. start-ups break into the Russian market, given the political tensions between the two countries.The firm said on Thursday that it has opened for business in the U.S. with a $200 million fund, its second, for investing in a variety of industries, from A.I. to fintech. And it has hired a veteran of Silicon Valley, Anurag Chandra, to help in that mission.Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross\u2019s founder and managing partner, said in an interview that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm\u2019s ability to operate. Declining to comment on politics broadly, he said that Russia \u2014 which remains one of the biggest markets for apps worldwide \u2014 will remain a compelling destination for start-ups.\u201cThe nature of start-ups is all about risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a political tension, but not when you\u2019re talking to start-ups.\u201dFort Ross\u2019s team is betting its contacts in Russia and knowledge of the market will help attract U.S. start-ups. Mr. Orlovski was previously the chief digital officer at Sberbank, Russia\u2019s biggest bank, and maintains connections in that region, including through his former employer.For one of Fort Ross\u2019s existing investments, the social trading start-up eToro, the investment firm introduced the portfolio company to a local player in Russia to help it crack that market.Fort Ross began raising its latest fund in the fall, drawing investors from Russia and the Middle East. (Mr. Orlovski said that the investors are primarily family offices and wealthy individuals, though he does eventually want to branch out into traditional money sources like U.S. pension funds.) But the goal, he added, was to make the firm better-known in Silicon Valley, a task he argued would not be hampered by his background or focus.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like we are a second- or third-tier venture firm just because I\u2019m personally from Russia or because we have connections to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cOne year, or a couple of years ahead, we want to be a bigger player in the community of V.C.s here.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedThe European Union, with its $16 trillion economy and its reputation for toughness in trade negotiations, could be the immovable object that stymies President Trump\u2019s combative trade agenda.But that outcome is looking less likely.According to the Journal, the European Union is prepared to reduce tariffs on United States cars and industrial machinery, among other goods. The newspaper also reported that the bloc might offer to join the United States in pressuring China to relax its trade and investment rules. (In return, the European Union is reportedly asking for European companies to be given access to United States government procurement contracts.)The Trump administration apparently proposed the punitive tariffs as a way to secure compromises from trading partners, and bring them into an alliance against China. If the European Union bends to this strategy, rather than rejecting it outright, it would be a notable gain for Mr. Trump.\u2014 Peter EavisTakeda Pharmaceutical disclosed on Thursday that it has bid for more than $60 billion for the Irish drug maker Shire, though the offer was rejected. But it may have competition in the form of Allergan, which said on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire.Still the disclosures, following weeks of speculation, again raises the prospect of consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry. Drug makers have long looked to big takeovers to broaden their product portfolios.For Takeda, which is based in Osaka and whose products include treatments for acid reflux and for cancer, a big takeover would give it both more scale \u2014 the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales \u2014 and a bigger international footprint.But Shire, which is headquartered in Dublin and is best known for producing Adderall, would be its biggest takeover by far. (Its next-biggest acquisition was the $13.7 billion purchase of Nycomed seven years ago.)Takeda\u2019s main competitor may be Allergan, the maker of Botox, is a veteran acquirer, having been built up through numerous mergers over the years.Under the terms of that offer, Shire shareholders would own just over half of the combined company.Takeda and Shire said that they are in discussions, which could lead to yet another revised bid.Yet for both Takeda and Allergan, a deal for Shire could prove financially risky, since each company would need to borrow significant amounts of debt to finance a transaction.Under British takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to decide whether to continue pursuing Shire. Allergan has until May 17 to do the same.Advising Takeda are Evercore Partners, JPMorgan Chase and Nomura. Advising Shire are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Mr. Lohr:The rethinking of GE Digital, with its future still under review by Mr. Flannery, points to the difficulty of producing modern software for industrial businesses as they adopt digital technology.No one disputes the overarching vision of the so-called industrial internet of things \u2014 which includes low-cost sensors and a flood of data and clever software that should deliver insights to cut costs, conserve fuel and design better products, faster. But the company greatly underestimated the challenges of creating all the software needed to achieve that grand vision, said analysts and former G.E. managers.Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday that the statue known as \u201cFearless Girl\u201d will soon be moved from its spot at the southern tip of Broadway to a spot facing the New York Stock Exchange.And if the city has its way, the bull will eventually go with her.\u201cSo after deciding to allow the sculpture \u2014 placed temporarily at the spot \u2014 to remain for a year, city officials came to the conclusion that the number of pedestrians spilling into the streets created a safety hazard.\u201dDuring his court testimony in Washington yesterday, the Time Warner C.E.O. argued that his company\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion sale to AT&T was necessary, given the \u201ctectonic changes\u201d in the media world wrought by Netflix and Amazon.Among the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other valuable customer information the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have emails, contact information, billing information \u2026 any of these things,\u201d he said.Lawyers for the Justice Department, which has sued to block the deal, grilled him about an internal document from last year showing plans to create digital products even without AT&T.Randall Stephenson of AT&T could take the stand today.On May 1, exemptions to the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum expire.On May 22, the public comment period ends for another $50 billion worth of tariffs, and the Trump administration can announce a final list of targets.And Aug. 18 is potentially the deadline for the administration to act on an investigation into Chinese trade practices. But there\u2019s a provision for a 180-day delay after that.Key caveats: President Trump has the power to pursue trade policy almost at whim. And a W.T.O. proceeding against China could take years.The politically minded bank already adopted principles for limiting firearm sales laid out by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. Now it\u2019s using its position as a (small) shareholder in Sturm, Ruger to urge the gun maker to adopt six Everytown principles.Among them: Supporting mandatory background checks for all sales; binding sellers to a code of conduct; and adopting smart-gun tech. If Ruger doesn\u2019t support those principles, Amalgamated would withhold votes for Sandra Froman, a Ruger director who\u2019s also on the N.R.A.\u2019s board.The tech flyaroundAs the firm moves more into consumer businesses \u2014 pushing its Marcus online lending platform, buying Adam Dell\u2019s budget-planning app \u2014 it is looking less like a traditional investment bank and trading house and more like a one-stop shop. Like the universal banks JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raids on Trump\u2019s Lawyer Sought Records of Payments to Women", "Date": "2018-04-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe search warrant carried out by the public corruption unit of the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan sought information about Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims she carried on a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump shortly after the birth of his youngest son in 2006. Ms. McDougal was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc., The Enquirer\u2019s parent company, whose chief executive is a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s.Stephen Ryan, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, said that it was Mr. Mueller who referred evidence to the federal authorities in New York who carried out Monday\u2019s raids. In an email on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan repeated his assertion that the raids were \u201cinappropriate and unnecessary.\u201dMr. Trump has been dogged for months by accusations that women with whom he is said to have had affairs were paid to keep quiet before the election \u2014 charges that the White House has repeatedly said he denies.Ms. McDougal has claimed that she had a 10-month consensual affair with Mr. Trump 12 years ago. American Media, which is owned by David J. Pecker, agreed to pay Ms. McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story in August 2016, but did not publish it in a practice known as catch and kill. Ms. Clifford, who told her story about an affair with Mr. Trump to CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last month, is aggressively challenging the nondisclosure agreement she agreed to in October 2016, receiving $130,000 in return.It is unclear exactly why the New York investigators are examining the payments. But critics of the president have claimed that they amount to illegal campaign contributions because they helped Mr. Trump win the White House by suppressing politically damaging stories.The F.B.I. also searched for records related to Mr. Cohen\u2019s New York taxicab business, apparently a separate line of inquiry unrelated to Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen is a longtime owner of taxi medallions, at one point operating a fleet of more than 200 cabs in Manhattan.Besides enraging Mr. Trump, the early-morning searches, associates said, also led him to privately wonder whether he should fire Rod J. Rosenstein, the veteran prosecutor appointed by Mr. Trump to serve as deputy attorney general. Mr. Rosenstein personally signed off on Monday\u2019s F.B.I. decision to raid the office of Mr. Cohen, several government officials said.Justice Department regulations require prosecutors to consult with senior officials in Washington, but not necessarily the deputy attorney general, before conducting a search of a lawyer\u2019s files, which is among the most delicate steps federal prosecutors can take in an investigation.As Mr. Trump has stewed over the developments, he has cast blame in many directions. Privately, people close to the president said, he has blamed Mr. Cohen for acknowledging the payments to Ms. Clifford.On Monday evening, Mr. Trump called the court-authorized raids an \u201cattack on our country\u201d \u2014 unusually harsh language that he has not used to describe Russia\u2019s attempts to influence an American election through hacking and propaganda \u2014 and the raids are likely to complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiations with Mr. Mueller over the terms of a possible interview.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have warned that such an interview would be incredibly risky, but Mr. Trump had been confident in his ability and was eager to sit for one. People close to the president said the raids could change that thinking.The president\u2019s reaction has deeply unsettled aides, current and former Justice Department officials and lawmakers from both parties, who believe the president may use the raids as a pretext to purge the team leading the Russia investigation.\u201cNow is the time for officials in the executive branch and Congress who care about the rule of law to counsel against any effort to undermine the special counsel\u2019s work,\u201d said David Laufman, a former top Justice Department official who oversaw the Russia investigation before Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment.Adding to the concern among Mr. Trump\u2019s aides about his mood is the release next week of a book by James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, which is expected to be sharply critical of the president.The involvement of Mr. Rosenstein and top prosecutors in New York in the raids of Mr. Cohen\u2019s office and hotel room makes it harder for Mr. Trump to argue that his legal problems are the result of a witch hunt led by Mr. Mueller. In addition to Mr. Rosenstein, all of the top law enforcement officials involved in the raids are Republicans, including Mr. Mueller and Christopher A. Wray, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to succeed Mr. Comey as director of the F.B.I.Geoffrey Berman, the interim United States attorney for Southern District of New York, which oversaw the raids, has been recused from the case, according to one person with knowledge with the matter. The precise reason was not clear, but under Justice Department guidelines, a United States attorney must report any issue that could require recusal \u201cas a result of an actual or apparent conflict of interest.\u201dMr. Berman, who worked as a volunteer lawyer on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, was the choice of Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, to be the United States attorney in New York, according to a person with direct knowledge of the appointment.While Mr. Trump is focused for the moment on Mr. Rosenstein, many of the president\u2019s advisers and allies are fearful that the president also intends to fire Mr. Mueller in an attempt to end the Russia investigation. Asked by reporters on Monday night whether he intends to do so, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201dDespite Tuesday\u2019s assertions by Ms. Sanders, many legal experts believe the president cannot fire Mr. Mueller himself, and would have to direct Mr. Rosenstein to do so. Mr. Rosenstein has told Congress that he would dismiss Mr. Mueller only for cause, and people close to Mr. Rosenstein have indicated that he would resign if he were ordered to fire Mr. Mueller by the president.Bipartisan legislation has been introduced to protect Mr. Mueller, with senators urging Mr. Trump to let the inquiry go forward \u201cwithout impediment.\u201d Republican leadership has dismissed such legislation as unnecessary.The prospect that Mr. Trump might still find a way to fire Mr. Mueller elicited angry responses from Congressional Democrats and some Republicans, who warned that such a move would be disastrous for the White House.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday on Fox Business Network that \u201cit would be suicide for the president to want to talk about firing Mueller.\u201dOn Monday, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, called Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Mr. Mueller and his team a \u201cgrave reminder of his utter contempt for the rule of law.\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, urged the president: \u201cDon\u2019t do it, do not go down this path. For the sake of our country, we plead with you.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the day on which Michael D. Cohen posted a message on Twitter quoting an author.

{"Headline": "How New Yorkers Could Put Albany to Work Again", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.There are nearly twice as many registered Democrats in New York State as Republicans. Word, however, hasn\u2019t reached Albany.In 2011, a small band of elected Democrats broke from their caucus and called themselves \u201cindependent,\u201d giving Republicans de facto control of the State Senate and allowing them to kill all manner of needed reforms through a mix of Albany jiu-jitsu, old-fashioned gerrymandering and, until recently, a dash of help from Gov. Andrew Cuomo.A working Democratic majority in the Senate could show political courage by taking on the state\u2019s campaign finance laws, essentially one giant loophole that helps promote Albany\u2019s dysfunction. They could start by ending New York\u2019s L.L.C. scam: As the rules stand, a donor can brazenly contribute as much as he or she wants to a candidate by creating multiple limited liability companies that separately funnel money to a single campaign. The Democrats should also enact comprehensive public financing of campaigns, a measure Senate Republicans have blocked that would encourage competition in state elections.It\u2019s long past time to eliminate cash bail, which unfairly punishes poor black and Latino New Yorkers, shamefully crowding our jails with people who pose no threat to others and haven\u2019t been convicted of a crime but cannot afford bail. The roots of cash bail in this country wind back to a set of laws created after the Civil War that criminalized black Americans and led to generations of plunder and servitude.New York lawmakers should also be ready to stand by the rights of women, under assault by Washington lawmakers seeking to roll back access not only to abortion but even to contraception.The Republican, Julie Killian, a former Rye City councilwoman, is moderate enough to support \u201ccommon-sense gun laws,\u201d although she is hesitant about bail reform and her fight to lower property taxes is a more local issue than one for the Senate.The Democrat, Assemblywoman Shelley Mayer of Yonkers, has a better grasp of how to use the culture of Albany to deliver fair funding to local schools, address climate change and pollution in the Hudson River, promote criminal justice reform and tackle the corruption and abuses of power that she has seen and resisted firsthand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A High-Paying Job? Go to App Boot Camp.", "Date": "2018-04-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesCollege students who want high-paying, interesting jobs should choose a major in one of the STEM fields \u2014 science, tech, engineering and math. So says the conventional wisdom.\u201cComputer science is one industry where people can march back up to the middle class,\u201d said Ms. Saujani. But women and minorities aren\u2019t taking advantage of the opportunity. The resulting shortage of workers hurts companies, and the economy.\u201cIt takes months to hire a software engineer in New York City,\u201d said Ilia Papas, founder and chief technology officer of Blue Apron, a meal-kit delivery service. And it\u2019s costly. \u201cYou either have to have an in-house recruitment firm, which is expensive,\u201d he said, \u201cor pay a recruiting firm 20 to 30 percent of the first year\u2019s salary.\u201dThe students showed off web apps for saving money, booking art studio time and allowing people alarmed by the news they\u2019re reading to make quick donations to relevant charities, among other things.Tasilym Twinamaani and her four teammates presented an app called Chatterbox.\u201cHow many of you watch \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201d she asked the audience. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you probably had a lot to say about the recent season. And all those fans with passionate expressions of disbelief might want to share that with other people. So we offer free, specific space for fans of television to engage with other fans in real time.\u201dMs. Twinamaani, 29, attended Kean University in New Jersey, majoring in film and literature, but left one semester short of graduation when her money ran out. When her younger sister had a stroke in 2016, she quit her restaurant and post office jobs to take care of her sister\u2019s son \u2014 in addition to her own son, who is now 5. When her sister recovered, Ms. Twinamaani went back to work, first at a drugstore and then on the night shift packing boxes at Blue Apron\u2019s fulfillment center in Linden, N.J.\u201cWhen I was a kid I was always messing around with HTML and CSS for my Myspace page,\u201d she said. \u201cMaking websites has been in the back of my mind.\u201d She decided to look for a coding boot camp \u2014 an intensive course to learn the skills of web or smartphone app development.At the same time, Mr. Papas at Blue Apron was also looking for boot camps. He said that the company employed a thousand workers, the majority black or Latino, in the Linden center. \u201cLots of them are very smart, motivated and driven, but they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to pursue careers in different fields,\u201d Mr. Papas said. Training those with talent to be software engineers could bring needed ability and diversity to the company\u2019s largely white and Asian staff of 132 software developers in Manhattan.\u201cIt was difficult to find a boot camp taking people who didn\u2019t have a college education, or coming from underserved backgrounds, and giving them tools,\u201d Mr. Papas said.Then he found Access Code, a 10-month boot camp run by an organization called C4Q (formerly Coalition for Queens), which was designed to do exactly that. It offers a day or a nights-and-weekends program.\u201cNearly 70 percent of Americans don\u2019t graduate from college,\u201d said Jukay Hsu, C4Q\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cWhat are the meaningful pathways to advance their careers and create the companies of the future?\u201dBy June, the five-year-old program will have 483 graduates, all previously low-income. Half are female, half lack a college degree. Sixty percent are black or Latino, and 40 percent are immigrants.Instead of demanding traditional credentials, the program evaluates applicants as they solve logic puzzles and spend two days learning basic coding. One in 10 is accepted. C4Q says that upon entering, those students are earning an average of $18,000 a year, but when they graduate and find work in software engineering \u2014which almost all do \u2014 they make an average of $85,000.To finance this program, C4Q has experimented with different models. Originally, it charged students a price subsidized by philanthropy. Then it was free. But Mr. Hsu felt that the need for job training was spread among far too many people for donors to cover it all. Today, students pay nothing until they graduate and get a high-paying tech job. Then they pay C4Q 12 percent of their salary for three years.C4Q has also set up a \u201cjob-outcomes bond\u201d to finance the up-front costs. Two investors put up $750,000. They\u2019ll be repaid if enough students are paying tuition \u2014 in other words, if Access Code succeeds.The other is Ms. Twinamaani. She switched to a day job in Blue Apron\u2019s kitchens and commutes to Access Code in Queens at night and on the weekend \u2014 a three-hour, $20 round trip.Alongside tech skills, Access Code teaches students how to work in a corporate culture. They visit tech companies and meet engineers. And they grapple with the ways they might sabotage themselves.In the kitchens, Ms. Twinamaani\u2019s salary was just over $20,000. As a Blue Apron software engineer, she\u2019ll make at least $85,000 and potentially closer to six figures, Mr. Papas said. The first thing she intends to do is move her sister and their children out of their basement apartment in Elizabeth. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream to live in a place where my son can go outside and play on the lawn,\u201d she said.Boot camps are for adults who want to change jobs. But part of the struggle is getting a wider group to see a tech career as an option from the beginning. Several people I interviewed told me, \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\u201dThe giant in that field is Girls Who Code; about 90,000 girls, from every state, have joined its afterschool clubs or taken summer courses, where they develop websites and apps to attack a problem they care about.Girls make up 20 percent of high school computer science classes, and there is likely to be only one black girl, if any. \u201cAt every stage of the pipeline it\u2019s leaky for women and people of color,\u201d said Ms. Saujani of Girls Who Code.Her organization is big enough and successful enough that it is changing the numbers. \u201cWe\u2019re on track to reach gender parity by 2027,\u201d said Ms. Saujani. \u201cWe\u2019re filling the pipeline with talent. Now my major problem is: Are you going to hire them?\u201dThe \u201cbro\u201d culture in many companies perpetuates itself. Ms. Saujani said the head of engineering at a major financial services firm told her he often starts his interviews with a question about baseball. \u201cHow many women are getting their Ph.D at M.I.T. or Stanford and can\u2019t get through the door at top-tier technology companies?\u201d Ms. Saujani said.Mentors can help. Paola Mata, an Access Code graduate who works at BuzzFeed, helped found a New York City group for Latinas in tech, with a few hundred members. They held hack nights and workshops on new skills, job searches and r\u00e9sum\u00e9-writing.More diversity among developers should mean more diversity in products. Affluent bros create apps for affluent bros: Bring me beer and burritos! Clean my apartment! Walk my dog!\u201cIt\u2019s only natural that we create things that reflect on some part of us,\u201d said Ms. Buchanan. Her app at Access Code mapped reports of sexual harassment. \u201cWe want more people working on these problems,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me, those problems don\u2019t include having pizza delivered to my house.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Charles Zwick, Who Balanced Budget Under Johnson, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-04-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles J. Zwick, who as President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s last budget director helped engineer the only federal surplus posted within a span of nearly four decades, died on Friday at his home in Coral Gables, Fla. He was 91.The cause was cancer, his wife, Barbara, said.Mr. Zwick managed to reconcile these competing forces with an income tax surcharge.\u201cWhen you couldn\u2019t support both guns and butter without an increase in taxes, then you were in trouble,\u201d Mr. Zwick said in 1968 in an interview for the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library.Fueled by a booming economy, the surcharge resulted in a $3.2 billion surplus for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, by which time Richard M. Nixon was in the White House. It was the only surplus generated by the federal budget from 1960, the last full year of the Eisenhower administration, to 1998, under President Bill Clinton.Mr. Zwick\u2019s assistant budget director, Peter A. Lewis, also gave credit for the surplus to what he described as Johnson\u2019s uncomplicated formula for bankrolling federal disbursements.\u201cRather than closing this or that loophole,\u201d Mr. Lewis said in a telephone interview, \u201cat the end of your tax form you just added 10 percent.\u201dCharles John Zwick was born on July 17, 1926, in the Plantsville section of Southington, Conn., to the former Mabel Rich and Louis Zwick, a farmer who raised vegetables and flowers.\u201cThen we grew what is known as the last crop of every farm in Connecticut, a housing development,\u201d he said in 2000. \u201cThat was the end of the Zwick farm.\u201dHis mother sent him off to the University of Connecticut, where the only A grade he received as a freshman was in economics.\u201cI said, \u2018Gee, that is pretty good. Maybe that is what I ought to be, an economist,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Zwick recalled.When his father was seriously injured in a tractor accident, he returned home to run the farm for several years.\u201cThat was enough for me to decide I did not want to be a farmer full time,\u201d Mr. Zwick said.He enlisted in the Army and served in Japan after World War II, then completed his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in agricultural economics in 1950 and 1951 at the University of Connecticut. He later earned a doctorate in economics from Harvard.His first wife, the former Joan Cameron, died in 2005. He is survived by their two children, Bob and Janet E. Zwick, and his wife, the former Barbara Collingwood.Mr. Zwick was a researcher at the RAND Corporation from 1956 to 1965, heading its logistics department and studying urban transportation and Air Force efficiency. He came to the attention of the Johnson administration during the Vietnam War as leader of an on-site RAND study of the so-called pacification program to win popular support for the South Vietnamese government.

{"Headline": "Anonymous Owner, L.L.C.: Why It Has Become So Easy to Hide in the Housing Market", "Date": "2018-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA way to protect property owners from personal liability has also turned out to be handy for enabling problematic behavior, like laundering money or being a bad landlord.As much as people may want to keep their financial dealings private, the housing market has long been an unusually transparent place. \u201cWe basically have a property system where you\u2019re supposed to be able to look up who owns what property,\u201d said Dan Immergluck, a professor at Georgia State University. \u201cOur English system of property recording doesn\u2019t really give you that privacy. People can look up what my property taxes are any time they want.\u201dIn his own research, Mr. Immergluck tried to identify the largest buyers of foreclosed properties in the Atlanta area. But because one unidentified buyer could be behind many L.L.C.s, it\u2019s hard to know who is acquiring the most property, or which property owners are behind the most code violations or the most evictions. Because the stakes are so high and the spillovers significant, there has always been a public element to private property, said Susan Pace Hamill, a law professor at the University of Alabama who has written about L.L.C.s since the late 1980s. \u201cShould tenants have a right to know who they\u2019re renting from?\u201d she said. \u201cShould cities have a right to know who owns the property? The answer is a resounding yes.\u201d L.L.C.s today hide what should be public information, she argues.\u201cI am quite disturbed by that,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving participated in the evolution of L.L.C.s from their early days, I feel like they\u2019re being abused.\u201dIn Milwaukee, according to research by a Harvard doctoral student, Adam Travis, L.L.C.s have grown to about a quarter of the rental market in the two decades since they became legal in the state.The original idea was never specifically about real estate, and anonymity wasn\u2019t particularly the appeal. But over time, Ms. Hamill said, state laws have made it easier to conceal who\u2019s behind L.L.C.s. So they have simultaneously grown more common and less transparent. L.L.C.s are required to list a registered agent who can receive legal and government notifications, but they\u2019re often not required to name the people who financially benefit from the investments.For renters, or tenants mired in rent-to-own contracts, these entities mean they often don\u2019t know whom they\u2019re dealing with \u2014 or who\u2019s evicting them.These consequences worry even real estate lawyers who advise their clients to use L.L.C.s.\u201cThe lawyer in me that represents clients says \u2018privacy, secrecy, keep my people out of the papers,\u2019 \u201d said William Callison, a lawyer in Denver who specializes in L.L.C. and affordable housing law. \u201cThe policy guy in me says, \u2018Well, wait a second.\u2019 \u201d Why? \u201cBecause good things happen in the light,\u201d he said, \u201cand bad things happen in the dark.\u201dThere should be a way, he and Ms. Hamill believe, to keep the liability and tax benefits of L.L.C.s without all the secrecy. Unless or until there is, cities like Memphis are left with properties no one wants to buy and frustration from the public.But it is no easy thing to get a faceless company to court.

{"Headline": "When Liberals Become Progressives, Much Is Lost", "Date": "2018-04-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Weiner was a senior aide to Senator Bob Kerrey before becoming a political scientist.In recent decades, the label \u201cprogressive\u201d has been resurrected to replace \u201cliberal,\u201d a once vaunted term so successfully maligned by Republicans that it fell out of use. Both etymologically and ideologically, the switch to \u201cprogressive\u201d carries historical freight that augurs poorly for Democrats and for the nation\u2019s polarized politics.Historical progressivism is an ideology whose American avatars, like Woodrow Wilson, saw progress as the inevitable outcome of human affairs. Of course, liberals and conservatives believe that their policies will result in positive outcomes, too. But it is another thing to say, as American Progressives did, that the contemporary political task was to identify a destination, grip the wheel and depress the accelerator.The basic premise of liberal politics, by contrast, is the capacity of government to do good, especially in ameliorating economic ills. Nothing structurally impedes compromise between conservatives, who hold that the accumulated wisdom of tradition is a better guide than the hypercharged rationality of the present, and liberals, because both philosophies exist on a spectrum.A liberal can believe that government can do more good or less, and one can debate how much to conserve. But progressivism is inherently hostile to moderation because progress is an unmitigated good. There cannot be too much of it. Like conservative fundamentalism, progressivism contributes to the polarization and paralysis of government because it makes compromise, which entails accepting less progress, not merely inadvisable but irrational. Even when progressives choose their targets strategically \u2014 Hillary Clinton, for example, called herself \u201ca progressive who likes to get things done\u201d \u2014 the implication is that progress is the fundamental goal and that its opponents are atavists.Because progress is an unadulterated good, it supersedes the rights of its opponents. This is evident in progressive indifference to the rights of those who oppose progressive policies in areas like sexual liberation.This is one reason progressives have alienated moderate voters who turned to Donald Trump in 2016. The ideology of progress tends to regard the traditions that have customarily bound communities and which mattered to Trump voters alarmed by the rapid transformation of society, as a fatuous rejection of progress. Trump supporters\u2019 denunciation of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d is just as often a reaction to progressive condescension as it is to identity politics.One cannot, of course, make too much of labels. But democracy is conducted with words, and progressivism, by its very definition, makes progress into an ideology. The appropriate label for those who do not believe in the ideology of progress but who do believe in government\u2019s capacity to do good is \u201cliberal.\u201d They would do well, politically as well as philosophically, to revive it.Greg Weiner is a political scientist at Assumption College and the author, most recently, of \u201cAmerican Burke: The Uncommon Liberalism of Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
