{"Headline": "Dr. Gerald Berenson, 96, Dies; Traced Heart Disease to Childhood", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Gerald S. Berenson, a cardiologist who found that detecting and reducing elevated weight, blood pressure and cholesterol in young children could help prevent heart disease when they became adults, died on Nov. 22 in Houston. He was 96.Dr. Berenson, who lived in New Orleans, had been visiting a daughter in Texas when he died of a heart attack in his sleep, his son Dr. Leslie Berenson said.The study resulted in worldwide preventive programs to encourage exercise and lower salt and fat consumption beginning when children are very young. Those measures could ward off or mitigate atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and obesity, the study concluded.Financed by the National Institutes of Health, the survey was one of the first to cover a population from infancy to adulthood in a single, multiracial community, Bogalusa, La. The city, about 70 miles north of New Orleans, is where Dr. Berenson was born.\u201cWhat he learned from Bogalusa school children influenced the well-being of people the world over,\u201d Dr. Larry Hollier, the chancellor of Louisiana State University Health, said in a statement.Warning signs of future heart problems, including high blood pressure and cholesterol levels and excess weight, were detected even in infants; hardening of the arteries were detected in children as young as 3. On the basis of risk factors measured 22 years earlier, disproportionately thick arteries could be predicted in adults 25 to 37 years old.He added, \u201cThe message of this study is that adult heart disease begins in childhood, and lifestyle changes have to begin then, too.\u201dHe urged that schoolchildren be routinely tested for blood pressure, cholesterol and body mass.A prolific author of research papers, Dr. Berenson extrapolated from the study to compile \u201cHealth Ahead/Heart Smart,\u201d a manual published in 1987 for elementary school students. It dealt with exercise, drugs, nutrition, sexually transmitted diseases and violence.One of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Dr. Frank Smart, who is chief of cardiology at Louisiana State University Health, said in a statement, \u201cDr. Berenson\u2019s natural curiosity and unending desire to improve health rather than simply treat disease was the key to the beginning of the Bogalusa Heart Study.\u201dGerald Sanders Berenson was born in Bogalusa, a lumber town near the Mississippi border, on Sept. 19, 1922, to Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father, Meyer, started as a peddler and later opened a clothing store, movie theaters and a golf course. His mother, Eva (Singerman) Berenson, helped run the store.Dr. Berenson earned a bachelor of science degree from Tulane University in 1943 and a medical degree from its School of Medicine. He served as a Navy doctor from 1945 to 1948.Dr. Berenson spent more than six decades researching heart disease, longer than the adult life of his father, who died of cardiac disease when he was 78.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Show Us Your Warhol!", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARHOL\u2019S LEGACYAndy\u2019s portraits of the rich and famous are his biggest body of work. They also largely funded the last two decades of his life. So what was it like facing Warhol\u2019s camera?By the mid-1970s, the era of bohemian debauchery that once defined Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory \u2014 the artist\u2019s downtown Manhattan studio and offices \u2014 was over. It was now time to pay the ballooning bills \u2014 for film and video projects; for his magazine, Interview; for real estate purchases \u2014 even as sales of his own artwork were drying up.But all together they create a predigital Facebook, she added, \u201cmapping subcultures\u201d from socialites to rock stars. \u201cIt\u2019s their desire to be painted by Warhol, to receive his imprimatur, that brings it all together,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite different than having your portrait done by any of the great 19th-century painters.\u201dThe portraits certainly weren\u2019t seen that way at the time of their making. In November 1979, when the Whitney staged a show including 112 commissioned portraits, the media reception was largely brutal. \u201cWarhol\u2019s admirers,\u201d Robert Hughes of Time magazine wrote, \u201care given to claiming that Warhol has \u2018revived\u2019 the social portrait as a form. It would be nearer the truth to say he has zipped its corpse into a Halston, painted its eyelids and propped it in the back of a limo, where it moves but cannot speak.\u201dFirst came a photography session. A Polaroid shot of the subject was then blown up into a 40 x 40 image and silk-screened onto canvas, but only after Warhol had meticulously cut away any less-than-flattering wrinkles and double chins. Upon delivery of the finished portrait, the salesmanship began anew. \u201cIf someone ordered two panels, he would paint four, hoping they would then take them all. Sometimes when people saw how great four looked side by side, they would open their checkbooks a little more,\u201d Mr. Colacello recalled. By the early \u201980s, new commissions had soared. Warhol was painting about 50 a year, grossing nearly $5 million annually when adjusted for inflation.For generations who have come of age long after Warhol\u2019s death in 1987, grids of these portraits are often viewed as his signature work \u2014 their eye-popping colors and scattershot brushwork atop a repeating washed-out image serving as shorthand for not only the artist\u2019s overall style, but the very aura of fame itself. Even the art world establishment has come around: Museums worldwide now embrace them as essential examples of modern-day portraiture.So what was it like facing Warhol\u2019s camera? Here, his subjects discuss that process and living with their portraits in the decades since. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.Singer-songwriterYou were surprised by Andy\u2019s technology?What was your initial reaction to the finished portrait?There were four and it was hard to choose. Seeing them together in those different colors, I wanted all of them.Did you haggle over a bulk price?[Laughing] They didn\u2019t even try and offer me a discount. They knew I didn\u2019t have that kind of money!When you look at the single portrait you bought, what runs through your mind now?Gosh, I was cute! [Laughing]Elementary school student (then); Entertainment lawyer (now)You were just 10 years old when Warhol painted you. Even though he was a close friend of your father, that must have been a bit odd.He used to call every day for my dad: \u201cHey kiddo, is your pops home?\u201d My dad gave me the address of the Factory and some money, and I got in a taxi and went downtown. Thinking back, it\u2019s very strange to let a 10-year-old go downtown from the Upper West Side by herself. But my parents [John and Susan] were very young when they had me, so they were kids, too.How did the session go?I remember being taken into this tiny bathroom by an assistant. She pulled out this big, black makeup case with hundreds of brushes, sparkly eye shadow and blush. This was a dream! I\u2019d never worn makeup before. I felt so glamorous! She caked all of this white base foundation on me and put on this incredibly rich, red lipstick. So here I am thinking, I\u2019m going to look like a gorgeous model. And I look in the mirror and I look like a cartoon character!Did you complain?I was too shy to have said anything. Now I would! I\u2019ve grown into those lips. They\u2019re the same color he used on his Marilyn Monroe and Liz Taylor portraits. We had those prints in our home when I was a kid. To put those lips on me \u2014 those lips which exemplify such power and strength and sophistication \u2014 it was extraordinary. Looking at them made me feel like I was becoming a woman.Business manager for her late husband, the artist ArmanYour husband traded artwork with Warhol. Did you broach the notion of a Warhol portrait?Something you have to know about my wonderful husband: He didn\u2019t ask me my opinion. [Laughing] Arman liked to have me, as I say, hanging around. He had portraits of me by several artists. So one day he just told me I was meeting Andy \u2014 I certainly wasn\u2019t going to say no to that! But you can see in my portrait that I\u2019m a little intimidated.Your first Warhol portrait is one of the few where the subject is topless. Was that your idea?You can\u2019t imagine it was my idea! [Laughing] It was Andy\u2019s idea, he posed me. I was brought up Catholic, my generation was very prudish. My husband helped me to get out of that a little bit. We hung the portrait in our living room right away, and now I\u2019ve come to think of it as a work of art, not just \u2018me.\u2019 But my children\u2019s friends, especially their male friends, would turn their eyes away: [gasping] \u201cOh, Mrs. Arman\u2019s naked!\u201dArtistWho proposed to whom?It started with me asking him to pose. He suggested we do an exhibition of portraits of each other. Of course, his doing a portrait is about five minutes in front of the Big Shot Polaroid camera [laughing], I need about six months. I ended up moving into the Factory for a year or so.So Warhol got to watch you in progress.His big complaint was, \u201cOh, you\u2019re using too much pimple paint!\u201d He got very upset by that.Pimple paint?He put heavy makeup up on every morning. It must\u2019ve taken him two hours to get out of the house after covering up all his pimples and bad skin. He thought I was putting the pimples back in. Which of course I was! Whereas his portrait of me was completely glamorized and airbrushed. There is some legitimacy to that, though. He told me once that his favorite toys as a child were paper dolls. Well, if you look at those portraits of his, they\u2019re all paper dolls with cutout mouths and eyes. That\u2019s the way he saw things.Actress and singerWhat was the experience of being photographed by Warhol like?I was used to posing for photographers. But he said, \u201cSit in the corner and be yourself.\u201d Well, who am I? Tell me first so I do this right. It took like 10 minutes. But it worked!Did you see yourself in the final portrait?At the time, it looked too sophisticated to be me. I was a shy kid from Queens, my mother put me in the American Academy of Arts, next thing I know I\u2019m on Broadway at 8 years old. I looked too serene in the portrait, and I didn\u2019t feel that way at the time. I\u2019ve grown into it. Now I love it!Do you recall discussing with Warhol how many portraits you were going to buy: two, four, six?I never paid the bills back then. But I can tell you how much an exact copy of my portrait costs now: $1,000.Excuse me?I wanted to hang my portrait in Pia\u2019s Place, my cabaret here in Vegas. But the insurance cost is ridiculous! So I had Sotheby\u2019s make me an exact replica. Side by side, I can\u2019t tell the difference.Television producerYour commission was a bit more complex than most.I had a television series called \u201cThe Love Boat\u201d and I thought Andy would be fabulous as a guest star. The deal we finally made was complicated: I gave Andy a list of 20 names of possible guest stars and he had the right to pick 10 of the 20. If I delivered any of those 10 as our 1,000th guest star, he was committed to be on the show. And he would also do a portrait of that 1,000th guest star. And a double portrait of me, and a double portrait of my partner Aaron Spelling. But Candy [Aaron\u2019s wife] decided she wanted a portrait too. So he did that as well.Who was Andy\u2019s No. 1 pick to paint?Did the actual making of Warhol\u2019s \u201cLove Boat\u201d episode in 1985 go any smoother?ArtistYou studied Warhol in college. Was it strange to later find yourself trading your own artwork with him?I remember sitting in art history class back in Santa Barbara, hearing about the Factory. I just felt there\u2019s something like that waiting for me \u2014 I need to get out of California and go be in New York!And just a few years later you, your wife, Tereza, and your infant daughter, Zena, are all being photographed together at the Factory.Andy is taking Polaroids of us, and Jean-Michel [Basquiat] is there too. I\u2019m trying to be my most relaxed and cool. Meanwhile, Jean-Michel didn\u2019t like it if Andy gave me too much attention \u2014 he was very protective and very jealous. I just remember him glaring at me from right behind Andy\u2019s shoulder. Jean-Michel was good at intimidating you with a look.Your portrait has you in one panel with your baby, and your wife in the other panel, also with your baby.Yeah, Andy said he always did married couples in diptychs because they always get divorced. This way they don\u2019t have to fight over who gets the painting with the child in it. He was so matter-of-fact about it. I thought it was funny at the time.Where is the portrait now?The painting hung in our living room until we split up in 2001. We each took a painting with our child. Who got the family portrait was one less thing to fight over. [Chuckling] Andy was so brilliant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Views of Angela Merkel\u2019s Legacy: Stoic Leadership, and Economic Malpractice", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut many economists take a less generous view of the German chancellor\u2019s place in modern European history. Far from a hero who anchored the bloc under profound challenges, she played a leading role in amplifying an economic crisis, allowing it to erupt into an existential threat to the European Union and its shared euro currency. The resulting distress has undermined faith in the European bloc while fueling anti-establishment grievances across the Continent.Like many national leaders, Ms. Merkel, time and again, catered to domestic political interests at the expense of broader European concerns, dismissing calls that Germany\u2019s prodigious savings be put on the line to rescue debt-saturated members of the bloc. She impeded measures aimed at coordinating banking rules and public spending across national boundaries.She adamantly opposed debt forgiveness to Greece, even as it teetered toward insolvency, and even as joblessness exceeded 27 percent \u2014 a special source of outrage given that German banks were primary lenders in Greece\u2019s catastrophic explosion of borrowing.\u201cShe was at the heart of the design of the flawed Greek program, which not only imposed austerity, but most importantly resisted restructuring the debt in order to save the German and French banks,\u201d said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist at Columbia University in New York. \u201cThe rhetoric that she used suggested that the crisis was caused by irresponsible behavior by Greece, rather than irresponsibility on the part of the lender.\u201dIn place of public spending to soften the edges of the crisis, Ms. Merkel used Germany\u2019s power as the largest economy in Europe to force troubled governments to slash support for pensions, health care and education. In the process, the moves helped lengthen and deepen a devastating economic downturn.\u201cThis is what history will remember, a complete mismanagement,\u201d said Amandine Crespy, a political scientist at the Institute for European Studies at the Free University of Brussels. \u201cAusterity very clearly has deepened or even created this great gap, political fragmentation between the north and the south, between the debtors and the creditor countries that is very, very difficult to fix, and has had dramatic political consequences in terms of fueling the populist forces.\u201dSifting through history is a complex exercise open to divergent interpretations. One can never know how events might have transpired absent some variable. Anyone in Ms. Merkel\u2019s position would have found the going difficult. She oversaw Europe\u2019s most powerful country during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, then the European debt crisis, and then the surge of immigrants from some of the poorest, most troubled nations on earth.Some argue that no German chancellor could have held on to the office while behaving much differently in the realm of economic policy. Given a deep cultural proclivity toward thrift, moral revulsion over debt and a fear of rising prices dating to the hyperinflation after World War I, Germans were aghast at any arrangement in which their savings were on the hook for the recklessness of Greeks and Italians.\u201cShe had to sell German voters on the idea that Germany would send resources to bail out European countries that were already engaged in irresponsible policies,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss, a university in Rome. \u201cThat was the problem. Politically, it\u2019s really hard to criticize Merkel.\u201dIn Mr. Borri\u2019s view, Italy and other nations on Europe\u2019s southern periphery did receive a significant infusion of wealth from the north when the euro was created nearly two decades ago. Investors began lending money to Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal at rates that were practically the same as those in Germany, no longer demanding a premium for extra risk. Here was a choice dividend from sharing a currency with Germany and its rock-solid credit.\u201cThese are de facto transfers from rich to poor countries,\u201d Mr. Borri said. \u201cRather than use this money to reform their economies, these countries increased their spending.\u201dBut other economists say Ms. Merkel squandered an opportunity to use the crisis as a teachable moment that could have altered German public opinion. She might have fostered a sense of responsibility in Germany to see the nation as a primary beneficiary of the European Union, with the responsibility to aid those in distress.Europe\u2019s economic troubles have frequently centered on a dearth of faith in the endurance of the euro, the currency shared by 19 members of the bloc. Since the euro\u2019s inception, critics have warned that it is structurally unsound \u2014 a currency union lacking an accompanying political apparatus to coordinate policy and collective aid when trouble emerges.Under the guidance of Ms. Merkel and her famously unsentimental finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany effectively used the crisis as an elaborate demonstration of the euro\u2019s foundational defects. As they bickered with European counterparts over the principles that should apply to the Greek rescue, they delayed help and exposed global markets to the possibility that none might be forthcoming. A currency championed as a source of European solidarity was exposed as an impetus for discord.As the crisis mounted in the early part of this decade, reformists called for collective action. Europe needed rules governing all of its banks along with insurance for depositors to lift confidence in the financial system. The worst-hit countries needed relief from European rules limiting deficit spending.Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble maintained a hard line aimed at protecting German taxpayers from having to pay for the supposed sins of profligate spenders in sunnier climes. In tones of moral admonishment, they prescribed structural adjustment \u2014 rules making it easier to fire workers \u2014 along with more cuts to public budgets.\u201cThere is no crisis of the euro itself,\u201d Ms. Merkel declared in a 2012 speech delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cThere is a debt crisis. We have to ensure that stability and sound public finances are the order of the day. Indebtedness is the biggest danger and the greatest risk to prosperity on this continent.\u201dBut these measures happened with Ms. Merkel\u2019s reluctant assent. The delays and dysfunction that played out publicly along the way instilled no confidence in the sanctity of the euro or the solidarity of Europe\u2019s leaders.\u201cThe euro crisis started getting better the moment Europe decided to go against what Merkel said the policies should be,\u201d said Christian Odendahl, Berlin-based chief economist at the Center for European Reform, a research institution. \u201cThe euro crisis got better not because of but despite Merkel.\u201dUltimately, Ms. Merkel fueled the notion that Europe\u2019s crisis was a morality play in which prudent nations in the north would school their reckless counterparts in the south on the virtues of living within their means.Such depictions seem likely to outlast Ms. Merkel herself, making it difficult to imagine Europe\u2019s summoning the unity to bolster itself against the next crisis.\u201cShe helped shape the mind-set of the Germans,\u201d said Mr. Stiglitz, the Nobel-laureate economist. \u201cShe shifted it in a very ugly way, and that makes it very difficult to change the framework of the eurozone. She could have reframed it. That would have been leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Financial Rules Could Allow China\u2019s Smaller Banks to Fail. That\u2019s a Good Thing.", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsChina\u2019s too-big-to-fail banking rules are heading in the right direction.Chinese regulators published new guidelines on Tuesday for supervising the nation\u2019s financial institutions. Of course, Beijing owns most big lenders, and failures are almost unheard-of. But the very act of indicating which ones should be saved in a disaster means that others may be allowed to fail: That\u2019s a step toward liberalizing a nearly $40 trillion banking industry.The latest framework will label several more Chinese banks, securities firms and insurers as \u201csystemically important,\u201d meaning that they are so vital and connected that the collapse of just one could trigger a crisis. (The Financial Stability Board, an international regulatory body, already deems Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and some others as critical on a global level.) The blueprint unveiled this week will subject organizations in the enlarged group to tougher rules on capital requirements, leverage and so on. During a crisis, they may qualify for a bailout in exchange for meeting those requirements.At first blush, the rules seem to be an odd fit. The point is to identify the most important institutions, toughen scrutiny and so reduce the likelihood of failure, or speed up a wind-down if they do trip up. It was a solution primarily introduced to address the concerns of Western governments after the global financial crisis, when many were forced into expensive and unpopular bailouts of private sector firms.In China, however, there is no similar distinction between government and finance. The state owns the country\u2019s largest lenders, as well as many insurers and securities firms. The last serious bank failure in China happened about 20 years ago. Chinese investors have come to expect that Beijing will step in when troubles mount, suggesting that almost every reasonably sized institution is too big to fail.But there is a more encouraging message here. Those not on the list will, in theory, be minor enough to fail. Beijing will probably rescue even smaller banks for some time to come, regardless of the regulations. But officials are at least beginning to draw limits \u2014 and that\u2019s critical if they are to ever remove a costly implicit state guarantee for the entire sector. As American and European governments learned, it is better to sketch those lines early: It\u2019s much harder to do so during a crisis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Subsidies Could Expand to Health Programs That Violate Obamacare", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration said Thursday that states could bypass major requirements of the Affordable Care Act by using federal funds for a wide range of health insurance programs that do not comply with the law.Federal officials encouraged states to seek waivers from provisions of the law that specify who is eligible for premium subsidies, how much they get and what medical benefits they receive.It was \u201ca mistake to federalize so much of health care policy under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told state officials at a conference in Washington.The new policy outlined by the administration on Thursday upends a premise of the Affordable Care Act: that federal subsidies can be used only for insurance that meets federal standards and is purchased through public marketplaces, also known as insurance exchanges.Under the new policy, states could use federal subsidies to help people pay for employer-sponsored insurance. Consumers could combine federal funds with employer contributions to buy other types of insurance.Under the Affordable Care Act, premium tax credits are available to people with incomes up to four times the poverty level, roughly $83,000 a year for a family of three. With a waiver, states could provide assistance to higher-income families.The Trump administration laid out templates for state programs \u2014 waiver concepts \u2014 that could significantly depart from the model enacted by Congress in 2010.Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said states could use the suggestions to \u201ccreate more choices and greater flexibility in their health insurance markets, helping to bring down costs and expand access to care.\u201dDemocrats assailed the initiative as an audacious effort to undermine the Affordable Care Act. And they said the administration was ignoring the midterm election success of Democrats who had promised to defend health care that they said was threatened by President Trump and Republicans in Congress.\u201cThe American people just delivered an overwhelming verdict against Republicans\u2019 cruel assault on families\u2019 health care,\u201d said the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California. \u201cBut instead of heeding the will of the people or the requirements of the law, the Trump administration is still cynically working to make health insurance more expensive and to leave more Americans without dependable coverage.\u201dSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the administration was creating a fast lane for swift approval of \u201cjunk insurance.\u201dThe Affordable Care Act prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing medical conditions. At campaign rallies this fall, Mr. Trump repeatedly promised: \u201cWe will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. Always.\u201dMs. Verma said Thursday that \u201cthe A.C.A.\u2019s pre-existing condition protections cannot be waived.\u201dBut states could use federal funds to subsidize short-term plans and \u201cassociation health plans,\u201d in which employers band together to provide coverage for employees. Such plans are free to limit or omit coverage of benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, such as mental health care, emergency services and prescription drugs.A provision of the Affordable Care Act allows waivers for innovations in state health policy. The federal law stipulates that state programs must provide coverage that is \u201cat least as comprehensive\u201d as that available under the Affordable Care Act and must cover \u201cat least a comparable number\u201d of people.Two powerful House Democrats said the new guidance issued by the Trump administration was illegal because it did not meet the standards for waivers set forth in the Affordable Care Act.\u201cIt is contrary to the plain language of the statute, and it appears to be part of the administration\u2019s ideologically motivated efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said a letter sent to Mr. Azar by Representatives Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey and Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts.Mr. Pallone is in line to be chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Neal is expected to be chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.In issuing the guidance, they said, Mr. Azar also violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which generally requires agencies to provide an opportunity for public comment before adopting new rules.Republican governors have been pleading with federal officials to give states more authority to regulate health insurance.Paul Edwards, a deputy chief of staff to Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, a Republican, said, \u201cUtah welcomes all efforts that give us maximum flexibility to structure our health care programs to the unique needs of our citizens.\u201d State officials \u201cwill look closely at how these new rules could benefit Utahns,\u201d he said.Brenna Smith, a spokeswoman for Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa, a Republican, said the governor \u201chas a proven track record of expanding health care options for Iowans and is eager to see the new opportunities this proposal might open up.\u201dOne option for states is to take federal funds and put the money into accounts that consumers could use to pay insurance premiums or medical expenses.Likewise, Ms. Verma said: \u201cStates can develop a new state premium subsidy structure and decide how premium subsidies should be targeted.

", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarkets have taken the Trump administration\u2019s move in stride so far. But experts differ on whether a reduction in output could yet prove disruptive.HOUSTON \u2014 The world\u2019s oil producers and their customers entered a new period of uncertainty on Monday as renewed American economic sanctions against Iran took effect. It is a gamble that could eventually cost American consumers at the gasoline pump. But the initial impact has been relatively benign. Oil prices have been declining in recent weeks, even with sanctions on the horizon. The sanctions take aim not only at Iranian oil exports, but also at international shipping companies, banks, insurers and port operators doing business with Iran. United States trade with Iran is already tightly controlled, but the administration is threatening to exclude international companies from the American financial system if they trade, finance or otherwise serve the interest of Iranian oil exports.Companies are effectively given the choice of doing business with Iran or with the United States, which has a much bigger economy and a more lucrative market.The Trump administration has given waivers to eight countries, including such major buyers of Iranian crude as China, India and Japan, permitting them to continue imports. American officials say the waivers are temporary and conditioned on steady reductions of imports.The oil market has been surprisingly resilient, and prices ended a bit lower on Monday. Many energy experts had expected oil prices to soar, as they did when the Obama administration led an international sanctions effort in 2011 and 2012 to force Tehran to the nuclear bargaining table and pushed oil above $100 a barrel. This time, the international price is around $73 a barrel \u2014 West Texas intermediate, the American benchmark, trades about $10 cheaper \u2014 after falling by more than $10 over the last month. All told, the sanctions would then cut roughly 2 percent of global oil supplies.Oil traders have been calmed by the administration\u2019s waivers, signaling a more gradual approach that allows European and Asian customers to find suppliers to replace the Iranian crude. The prospects of a tightening oil market sent prices higher earlier in the year, which encouraged producers to pump more oil. As a result, the lost Iranian barrels have been replaced by oil from the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The United States and Russia have both reached output records of over 11.3 million barrels a day, while members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have increased production to the highest levels in two years despite declines in Venezuela and Iran. As more oil pipelines and export terminals are built in Texas and along the Gulf of Mexico, American exports could increase considerably. At the same time, demand for oil has slackened in China and around the developing world because those economies are slowing. Both developments are restraining prices.So far, drivers have been spared major pain.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Monday was $2.76, according to the AAA auto club, 5 cents less than a week ago and 15 cents lower than a month ago. Still, the average is 24 cents higher than it was a year ago.But some experts think that oil supplies could become tighter over time, especially during the driving season next summer, pushing prices higher.More expensive oil also means higher prices for aviation fuel, which frequently are passed on to the traveling public. They also can mean higher prices for plastics \u2014 and for natural gas, which can affect electricity rates.Much will depend on how Iran responds to the sanctions, and how successful it is in smuggling oil through Kurdistan and Turkey. If Iran threatens to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial passage for Persian Gulf oil, prices would probably jump. Any military moves or cyberattacks against Saudi Arabia or Israel could have a similar effect. An escalation of hostilities in Yemen, where Iran backs a militia force in a proxy war with the Saudis, could threaten other oil-shipping choke points.Some oil experts say world supplies are ample enough to keep the sanctions from driving prices higher. Barclays analysts expect Brent crude, the global benchmark, to sell next year for an average of $72 a barrel, near the current level. But some Western experts foresee a much higher price. \u201cThe market is overestimating the amount of oil that could come on,\u201d said Mr. Badiali of Banyan Hill. \u201cCan the world produce an extra 500,000 barrels a day? I don\u2019t see it.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Zealand Blocks Huawei, in Blow to Chinese Telecom Giant", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 New Zealand has blocked Huawei from supplying technology for a next-generation mobile data network in the country, joining the United States and other developed countries that see the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker as a security threat.\u201cThe U.S. advocates for secure telecoms networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence,\u201d the United States Embassy in Australia said in a statement on Wednesday.It added, \u201cWe routinely urge allies and friends to consider such risks and exercise similar vigilance in ensuring the security of their own telecoms networks and supply chains.\u201dHuawei said it was looking into the matter. \u201cAs the G.C.S.B. has noted, this is an ongoing process,\u201d the company said in a statement, referring to the Government Communications Security Bureau of New Zealand. \u201cWe will actively address any concerns and work together to find a way forward.\u201dHuawei says that it is a private company and is not controlled by Beijing.New Zealand\u2019s rejection further solidifies a wall that is increasingly dividing the world into two. There are places that will accept Chinese technology in sensitive areas like telecommunications, and places that won\u2019t. The United States government has long deemed Huawei and another Chinese hardware maker, ZTE, to be potential menaces to security and privacy. And American lawmakers have voiced concerns about the two companies\u2019 business in other wealthy countries such as South Korea.Elsewhere, especially in the developing world, Huawei\u2019s affordable equipment looks too good to turn down.On Tuesday, Papua New Guinea said that it would uphold an agreement with Huawei to build domestic internet cables, turning down a joint counteroffer from Australia, the United States and Japan.\u201cWe have an existing agreement,\u201d William Duma, the state investment minister for the Pacific island nation, told reporters. Huawei has already completed 60 percent of the $200 million project, which is financed by the Export-Import Bank of China. Mr. Duma said that made the 11th-hour effort from the Western powers \u201ca bit patronizing.\u201dThe competing offer comes as concerns have grown in Australia and allied nations about China\u2019s investments in the resource-rich island countries of the Pacific Ocean. This year, Australia agreed to fund an undersea communications cable linking Sydney with the Solomon Islands, following a similar deal with Papua New Guinea.Australian officials were worried that if the project went to Huawei, as the Solomon Islands had agreed in 2016, the Chinese company might gain access to Australia\u2019s internet infrastructure. In 2012, Huawei was barred out of security concerns from bidding on projects for Australia\u2019s national broadband network. The company has, however, sold equipment to Australian cellular operators.Last year, New Zealand became the first advanced economy to join China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious infrastructure program stretching through much of Asia that is widely seen as an effort to extend Beijing\u2019s political influence.But in a region in desperate need of infrastructure, officials may take funding where they can get it, said Mr. Duma, the Papua New Guinea minister.Security concerns are \u201cfor the big boys to worry about,\u201d he said.The joint offer that Papua New Guinea rejected on Tuesday came too late, said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific islands program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. Still, he said, it was meant to show that the United States and its allies remain a viable alternative to China\u2019s money and influence.\u201cWe\u2019d like to show that we\u2019re still in this game,\u201d Mr. Pryke said, referring to the position of the three allies. \u201cWe wanted to maintain our position as a partner of choice.\u201dOfficials from Pacific island countries have also complained about the West\u2019s paternalistic approach in providing aid packages. Still, the United States and its allies are trying to adapt.This month, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Japan said they would help Papua New Guinea significantly expand its electrical grid. Ms. Cave said in an interview that it was an \u201cambitious and very good example of listening and responding.\u201dRaymond Zhong contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No One Has Ever Crossed Antarctica Unsupported. Two Men Are Trying Right Now.", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor nearly a week, Colin O\u2019Brady, a 33-year-old American adventure athlete, and British Army Captain Louis Rudd, 49, had been waiting in Punta Arenas, Chile, on the Strait of Magellan, near the shattered end of the South American continent.In separate buildings blocks away from one another, they had been immersed in similar tasks: weighing and re-bagging their freeze-dried provisions and sorting through polar-grade gear.Their stashes included sleeping bags good for conditions up to minus 40 Fahrenheit, portable solar panels, cross-country skis, hand-held satellite phones and modems, and a GPS tracker programmed with way points to lead them step by frozen step across the highest, driest and by far the coldest continent on earth.It\u2019s a trek that killed a man two years ago. For much of this year, Rudd had been expecting a one-man battle against nature. Now his struggle has become a race.Rudd announced in April that he would make the attempt. Then, in mid-October, with just weeks to spare, O\u2019Brady, who had also been preparing for months, revealed on Instagram that he planned to do the same.Both men hope to conquer a continent that has become the new Everest for extreme athletes, though they represent two vastly different approaches.\u201cThe way I\u2019ll console myself on this expedition is to remind myself that nobody\u2019s shooting at me,\u201d Rudd deadpanned. \u201cObviously, Antarctica is dangerous in its own way, but I look at it as I\u2019m extremely fortunate. I\u2019ve had friends lose their limbs, eyes, real life-changing stuff.\u201dUnlike the wounds of war, suffering in Antarctica, Rudd said, \u201cis temporary.\u201dO\u2019Brady is more of the age, a seasoned adventure athlete and budding social media star forged from injury and perseverance.He grew up in Portland, Ore., and swam at Yale. While on a trip to Thailand in 2008, two years after graduating from college, he was in a freak accident that changed the course of his life. His legs were burned so severely that doctors told O\u2019Brady he would never walk normally again.Eighteen months later, while living in Chicago and working in finance, he decided to push his limits and signed up for an Olympic distance triathlon. He won the amateur division.O\u2019Brady quit his day job, raced triathlons professionally for six years, and was on track for the Olympic trials. But he left the sport in 2014 to pursue the Explorers Grand Slam.He climbed each of the \u201cSeven Summits\u201d (the highest peak on each continent) and skied the last degree to both poles in just 139 days in 2016, claiming a world record that he still holds. This summer, he climbed the high points in all 50 states in just 21 days, obliterating another record \u2014 to the delight of his social media followers.To prepare for the Antarctic trek, Rudd trained himself, putting in hours of powerlifting. Each night after working a full day at his British Army base, he would drag a giant truck tire along a riverbank for hours.A professional trainer, Mike McCastle, put O\u2019Brady through a similar powerlifting regimen at his gym in Portland. O\u2019Brady gained 15 pounds of muscle for his attempt. In order to withstand the frigid elements, he held long planks with his hands and feet, plunged in buckets of ice water. He then untied knots while his fingers were still stiff and numb.He calls his expedition \u201cThe Impossible First\u2019\u2019 and plans to show much of it on social media (Rudd\u2019s presence there is minimal.)Indian OceanWeddell SeaArgentinaChileAntarcticaRONNE ICESHELFPlanned routeSouth PoleAmundsenSeaROSS ICESHELFRoss SeaIndian OceanWeddell SeaChileRONNE ICESHELFSouth PolePlanned routeAntarcticaAmundsenSeaROSS ICESHELFRoss SeaBy The New York TimesAlthough there was some initial tension between the adventurers, they agreed on a course beginning on the Ronne Ice Shelf, setting off on Nov. 3. From there, they planned to ski onto Messner Glacier in western Antarctica and climb into a crosswind from sea level toward the Thiel Mountains, which rise like dorsal fins above an otherwise unbroken sea of snow and ice.All the while, they will be dragging Nordic sleds, called pulks, to haul all of their food, cooking fuel and camping gear.On Day 1, before using any supplies, their pulks weighed roughly 375 pounds. The men\u2019s skis are covered in synthetic skins for better traction; working like glorified snowshoes, the skis help distribute weight in a way that avoids punching through deadly crevasses.For their crossing to qualify as unsupported, the competitors cannot accept any help from the few humans they might encounter \u2014 not so much as a cup of tea from researchers at the renowned Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station as they pass by.Though a handful of adventurers have used kites to ride the winds across the continent or arranged for caches of food and fuel to be dropped along the way, the accomplished English polar explorer Ben Saunders was the last to attempt a solo, unsupported crossing. He chose a different route and tapped out after covering 805 miles in 2017.After Worsley died, Rudd fielded a six-man team of English soldiers to trace his journey, completing it for him in 2017. They held a memorial service at Worsley\u2019s final campsite.Antarctic firsts don\u2019t come cheap. The cost is steep in cash and toil.Rudd and O\u2019Brady each raised upward of $200,000 from corporate sponsors and private donors to make their attempts.Originally, their itinerary called for a Nov. 1 departure from Punta Arenas, but fair weather must be seized, so at 8:47 a.m. on Oct. 31, the competitors boarded an Ilyushin cargo jet operated by Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions, a charter company that regularly brings explorers to Antarctica. The destination was ALE\u2019s base camp on Union Glacier.On their way to the airport that morning, Rudd was relaxed and chatty yet had some worries.He had left his home in Hereford, England, on Oct. 26, the day after his wife, Lucy, had unexpected surgery. His 21-year old son was away with the army; his two daughters, ages 24 and 21, had tears in their eyes when he hugged them goodbye.When the men first arrived in Punta Arenas, there was a lot of tension and distrust. For months, Rudd had thought he would be competing against the elements and himself, not a stud athlete. Then O\u2019Brady made his surprise announcement.The two met for the first time in the cellar bar of Ernest Shackleton\u2019s preferred hotel in southern Chile and bonded over a shared desire to suffer in the service of a grand adventure.The thaw between them continued, and the day after they landed in Union Glacier, they agreed on a proper head-to-head battle.At around noon on Nov. 3, Rudd and O\u2019Brady boarded a Twin Otter ski plane that took off over Mount Rossman and banked east. After a 90-minute flight, they landed on the Ronne Ice Shelf.O\u2019Brady got out first and collected his gear. \u201cGood luck,\u201d Rudd told him, \u201cI think we\u2019re both going to make it.\u201dThey hugged goodbye, likely their last human contact for at least two months. Then, while O\u2019Brady strapped into his sled, the plane drove about a mile away to Rudd\u2019s parallel starting point. (That means O\u2019Brady technically had about a 10-minute head start, but it will likely prove negligible over such a long distance).The Ronne Ice Shelf is 600-feet thick, floating in the ocean yet fused to shore. They began three miles away from their first way point and the beginning of the Antarctic continent. That\u2019s where O\u2019Brady set up camp, on the lip of the continent, after a three-hour haul.Despite the good weather, O\u2019Brady was content to pace himself and build up to the longer days ahead. \u201cOnce you get in that rhythm or routine, that flow state starts to hit,\u201d O\u2019Brady said from his satellite phone.But the weather will not always be so favorable. Temperatures can drop below minus 50 Fahrenheit (minus 45 Celsius), even in summer, and should a storm delay their progress and force them to remain in their tents for days, the competitors could run out of food.Both men brought five days\u2019 reserve, just in case.Other dangers include hypothermia, frostbite and a chafing condition known as polar thigh. Infected wounds fester because the body heals more slowly in the cold.Winds have been measured at up to nearly 60 miles per hour on the polar plateau, and if a strong gust carries away their tent, the journey will end right then.Even milder winds can create whiteout conditions, when snow swirls and a polar fog can blot out the sky and whip the snow\u2019s surface into sastrugi: wavelike speed bumps that can extend for miles and make hauling a heavy sled slow going. Both men have fallen in crevasses on other expeditions.Then again, perhaps their greatest threat will be one another.With two competitors attempting the crossing at the same time, will they track each other\u2019s progress too closely? Push themselves past the point of exhaustion into mortal danger?On their first day, Rudd went a little harder than O\u2019Brady and skied 4.6 miles to grab an early lead. He maintained that edge for the next few days, but in nearly whiteout conditions Thursday, when both men had to stare at compasses bracketed to their chests to stay on track, O\u2019Brady marched 20 miles in 12 hours to catch Rudd. On Friday, again in whiteout conditions, he pushed past Rudd and grabbed his first lead.Whoever wins, if successful, these two men will be forever linked in polar lore.\u201cPeople have been trying to do this for 100 years, and nobody has successfully done it yet,\u201d O\u2019Brady said. \u201cAnd here are two guys both pushing each other to hopefully conquer an impossible feat.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the distance Henry Worsley was from the finish of his ill-fated expedition across Antarctica before he was picked up. It was 126 miles, not 30 miles. An earlier version also referred incorrectly to Antarctica. While it is the highest, driest and the coldest continent, it is not the largest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two New Audiobooks Inspire Teenagers to Make Real Change", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAudiobooksIt is hard to sit through an entire listening of \u201cWe Are Not Yet Equal\u201d and leave with hope. The problem is that Carol Anderson\u2019s book performs its task so well that the final chapter, in which we are told that the time has come for change, can\u2019t help feeling hollow and obligatory.Anderson, a professor of African-American studies at Emory \u2014 working with a capable assist from the children\u2019s nonfiction writer Tonya Bolden \u2014 elaborates on the premise of her previous book \u201cWhite Rage.\u201d There she argued that while the fires and protests that characterized cities like Ferguson and Baltimore in 2014 and 2015 were seen as an explosion of black rage, quite the opposite was true. The murders of unarmed citizens and the subsequent acquittals of police officers charged in their deaths were just the latest expressions of a white rage that had terrorized the entire country since Reconstruction, making victims of blacks and poor whites alike.Such a simple but profound shift of perspective \u2014 the changing from an ahistoric lens to a historical one \u2014 is where \u201cWe Are Not Yet Equal\u201d excels. By meticulously tracing a path from the fateful deals white abolitionists cut with the Confederacy during Reconstruction right up to the contemporary efforts to roll back voter protections as a response to Obama\u2019s ascendancy, Anderson paints a dire picture of a country that not only combats equal citizenship for black people, but prioritizes that combat over governmental responsibilities including national security, liberty and democracy. Such an idea seems to defy explanation, but in a chapter that outlines the obsession of Southern lawmakers with preventing \u2014 through legislation, arrests and violence \u2014 blacks from escaping the slow-motion genocide of the early-20th-century South, Anderson states it clearly: \u201cThe bottom line,\u201d she writes, \u201cwas that black economic independence was anathema to the power structure that depended on cheap, exploitable, rightless labor and required black subordination.\u201dAnderson\u2019s book is a story of obsession, of a country\u2019s obsession with denying rights to a people. Told in the narrator Robin Miles\u2019s studied, authoritative (though sometimes slow) delivery, the audiobook manages to allow, rather than force, the subject\u2019s devastating emotional undertone. Miles, who has narrated works by Roxane Gay, bell hooks and N. K. Jemisin, excels at a technically perfect Standard American dialect but interjects just enough slightly sarcastic pauses and subtly acerbic inflections to emphasize the true meaning of the text.In the wake of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., true meaning was much harder to come by. But \u201cWe Say #NeverAgain\u201d takes a powerful tack. The book comprises the writings of the school\u2019s journalism and broadcasting classes as well as work by the student reporters and editors of the school newspaper, The Eagle Eye. In the wake of the horrific events of Feb. 14, 2018, these kids were staked to a complex intersection of roles, as traumatized victims, subjects in national news stories, activists and journalists at the center of an event that captivated the country. How they worked their way through this while also being teenagers is the subject of these pieces, which are read by the students and two of their teachers, Melissa Falkowski and Eric Garner.Where \u201cWe Are Not Yet Equal\u201d provides a wide-lens view of legislation and the inner workings of government, \u201cWe Say #NeverAgain\u201d is granular. The students use this platform, built unwillingly out of a horror no child should face, to share on-the-ground perspectives on everything from gun legislation to adolescent depression, the failures of the national media to the individual acts of courage that defined the day of the shooting. Perhaps it is because I am myself a journalist that the parts that had me taking off my headphones and hiding my eyes so that no one would see me tearing up had to do with these kids\u2019 almost quixotic clarity about what journalism is actually for. \u201cWe owed our school a complete record of the year,\u201d Nikhita Nookala states with nearly comic lucidity in her essay \u201cSweating Under the Spotlight: Recognition and Responsibility.\u201d If only it were that simple, one might think. The thrilling stunt pulled off by \u201cWe Say #NeverAgain\u201d is that it is.The pieces here do much more than rehash statements about the press as a defender of democracy. In their direct actions, their certitude and their honesty, the journalism students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas are a case study in what to do when things fall apart. In a particularly potent piece, Nyan Clark reports that the senior Kelly Plaur wrapped her legs around her teacher to help shield her from bullets as they huddled in a corner of the room during the shooting. \u201cI wanted to protect her because I knew she had kids of her own and a husband,\u201d Plaur later recalled. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018What if this was my mom?\u2019\u201d The class she was in was studying the history of the Holocaust.Elsewhere, the student journalist Rebecca Schneid despaired to learn that within days of surviving a school shooting, she was being called a fake and an enemy of the people. Yet this did not stop her. \u201cI have decided,\u201d she concludes, \u201cto focus on the immense amount of love we have received from around the world to energize me and push me to work even harder toward our goal. The hate would only get in my way, and we have too much to accomplish.\u201dSuch pluck is childish to be sure, but here childishness is neither na\u00efve nor wrongheaded. These young journalists are as aware of the stakes and obstacles of the moment nationally as they are personally. \u201cIn many ways speaking out was our form of grieving,\u201d Schneid later reveals. \u201cThe only time I felt composed in any way was during those interviews.\u201d This unambiguity characterizes the book from beginning to end, elevating it above much more studied and complex treatises on this country\u2019s perplexing moment. A collective decision was made, for example, to never mention the shooter\u2019s name, on the undeniable logic that he \u201cdoes not deserve more coverage than his victims.\u201d One wishes that the adult media could just as easily access this uncomplicated level of moral instinct and understanding. Had we been able to, such a book may well have never been necessary in the first place.\u201cWe Are Not Yet Equal\u201d makes clear that this country\u2019s collective history is nothing short of heinous. And yet, the extent to which good has ever stood a chance has been the precise extent to which every single individual who has believed in something better has acted in service of that vision. In her final chapter, Carol Anderson tells us it is time to rethink America.

{"Headline": "Maine\u2019s Bruce Poliquin, Lone Republican in House From New England, Loses Re-election", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJared Golden, a Marine Corps veteran and Democratic state lawmaker in Maine, defeated New England\u2019s lone House Republican, Bruce Poliquin, on Thursday, just two days after Mr. Poliquin filed a lawsuit to stop the counting of votes under the state\u2019s new ranked-choice voting system.Mr. Poliquin\u2019s defeat in Maine\u2019s Second Congressional District added to a swell of bad news for northeastern Republicans, who suffered heavy losses on Election Day, and gave Democrats another Republican seat in their takeover of the House.And it added an intriguing new angle to the nation\u2019s ferment over voting rules and options when Mr. Poliquin, the candidate who was the first choice of more voters, lost the race to Mr. Golden, who won on the basis of being the second or third choice of voters who initially chose two independent candidates who together got 8 percent of the vote.A spokeswoman for the Maine secretary of state\u2019s office said the results remained unofficial pending certification by Nov. 26. But, if certified, the results would make Mr. Golden the winner of a four-candidate race in which Mr. Poliquin received 2,632 more first-choice votes but failed to reach the 50 percent needed to win.Instead, Mr. Golden was declared the winner Thursday with 50.53 percent of the vote \u2014 or by 2,905 votes \u2014 once the second and third choices of voters who originally chose the two lagging candidates were added.The district covers a majority of the state\u2019s land area, much of it rural and densely forested.On Thursday, Mr. Poliquin did not concede and vowed to press on with his case.\u201cIt is now officially clear I won the constitutional \u2018one-person, one-vote\u2019 first-choice election on Election Day that has been used in Maine for more than 100 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will proceed with our constitutional concerns about the rank-vote algorithm.\u201dIn his lawsuit, Mr. Poliquin argued that ranked-choice voting was an \u201cexotic\u201d system that violated the First and 14th Amendments and the Voting Rights Act. The federal judge hearing the case, Lance E. Walker, said in his ruling on Thursday morning that, in twice approving ranked-choice voting in ballot measures, the citizens of Maine \u201chave rejected the policy arguments Plaintiffs advance\u201d against it.The governor-elect, state Attorney General Janet Mills, has said she will push to amend the state Constitution so that ranked-choice voting can be used in all the state\u2019s elections.The Second District was once a Democratic stronghold that Mr. Poliquin, a former state treasurer, turned red in 2014, with a message that his background in finance would make him a job creator. Democrats had been itching to retake the seat ever since.Democrats placed their hopes this year on Mr. Golden, 36, who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and worked for Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, before serving in the Maine House of Representatives as a Democrat.But Maine\u2019s political culture is famously independent minded, and ranked-choice voting complicated the strategy efforts of both parties.Mr. Golden\u2019s campaign focused on kitchen-table issues with a distinctly left-wing approach and enacting stronger labor laws.New England was long welcoming to the Republican Party\u2019s moderate wing, but Mr. Poliquin\u2019s loss leaves the region with just a handful of high-ranking Republican officials, including Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, both moderates increasingly out of step with the national party, and Ms. Collins.Mr. Golden portrayed Mr. Poliquin, who did not endorse Mr. Trump in 2016, as out of touch with the district in large part because of his votes in favor of the Republican tax cut plan and for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Poliquin rejected that characterization and depicted himself as a practical problem-solver, but it was not enough. Instead, he became the first incumbent to lose a race for re-election in the Second District since 1916.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Recall of Moscow Deal Matches Cohen\u2019s, President\u2019s Lawyers Say", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Cohen might have lied to the authorities about aspects of the deal, as the complaint charges, they said, but the president did not.\u201cThe president said there was a proposal, it was discussed with Cohen, there was a nonbinding letter of intent and it didn\u2019t go beyond that,\u201d said Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, who with others negotiated the president\u2019s responses to Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions for nearly a year. He said prosecutors did not raise certain details that Mr. Cohen now says he misled Congress about \u2014 including how long the hotel project stayed alive \u2014 and that the president did not volunteer those details.According to the new documents released by the special counsel, Mr. Cohen lied when he told Congress last year that he had talked to Mr. Trump about the project only three times and that the proposal died in January 2016 \u2014 before the first primary in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. He also concealed his interactions with Russian officials and the fact that he asked Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to promote the deal because, he said, he wanted to support Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical messaging.\u201dMr. Giuliani refused to disclose Mr. Mueller\u2019s precise questions to Mr. Trump about the deal or exactly how the president responded. He said only that Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization, his company, provided the prosecutors \u201cwith every document about this from the beginning,\u201d adding, \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason they know about it.\u201dNotes by the president\u2019s lawyers this year show that prosecutors were trying to scrutinize Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings in Russia during the campaign, including what he knew about the hotel deal that Mr. Cohen was pursuing with Felix Sater, another business associate.If Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.\u201cWhat interaction and communication did you have with Michael Cohen, Felix Sater and others, including foreign nationals, regarding real estate developments in Russia during the period of the campaign?\u201d Mr. Mueller\u2019s team asked in a meeting with Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, according to the notes.Mr. Cohen\u2019s new account of the hotel deal will inevitably be compared not only to the president\u2019s, but also to those of Donald Trump Jr., his eldest son, who testified repeatedly before congressional committees last year about that project and other matters. The complaint states that Mr. Cohen misled Congress about the fact that he had briefed Trump family members about the project. Although the family members were not named, a person familiar with the situation said Mr. Cohen discussed the deal with Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump.Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017, the younger Mr. Trump said that he was only \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of the proposed venture to build a new Moscow hotel bearing the Trump name. Most of what he knew about it, he said, he had learned recently while preparing to testify. He told the committee that Mr. Cohen pursued the project in 2015 and told the House Intelligence Committee that the deal fell dormant as of June 2016 \u2014 an accurate date, according to Thursday\u2019s court documents.Lawyers for Ms. Trump and her brother declined to comment on their interactions with Mr. Cohen about the project. But people close to the Trump family said that while emails indicate that both of them were aware of Mr. Cohen\u2019s efforts to get it off the ground in 2015, their involvement appears to end in January 2016. If Mr. Cohen tried to continue with the project after that, these people added, they did not know.The president\u2019s critics will also inevitably seek to learn whether he knew that Mr. Cohen, then still a trusted aide, falsely testified to Congress last year. As they continue to do, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers then closely monitored what witnesses like Mr. Cohen were telling the authorities through joint defense agreements with their lawyers.But even if the president knew that Mr. Cohen misled Congress, legal experts said, he is not in legal jeopardy as long as he did not ask Mr. Cohen to lie. And there is no allegation that he did so.The latest complaint, on its face, seems less worrisome for the president than the previous one lodged against Mr. Cohen in August, said Chuck Rosenberg, a former United States attorney and senior F.B.I. official. In that case, Mr. Cohen directly implicated Mr. Trump in a crime, saying he instructed him to pay money to two women to cover up a potential sex scandal that he feared could endanger his presidential candidacy. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and a host of other charges for which he has yet to be sentenced.The president lashed out fiercely at Mr. Cohen on Thursday, calling him a \u201cweak\u201d prevaricator who concocted a false tale about the hotel deal in hopes of winning a lesser punishment. That charge conflicts with Mr. Giuliani\u2019s assertion that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump have now given prosecutors much the same account.Asked how he reconciled the seeming contradiction, Mr. Giuliani blamed Mr. Cohen.\u201cHe has so many different versions of the same stories, so by definition he is a liar and we can\u2019t trust him,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cGiven the fact that he\u2019s a liar, I can\u2019t tell you what he\u2019s lying about.\u201dNicholas Fandos and Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dell Offers More Money to Investors to Ease Its Return to the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDell agreed on Thursday to improve a takeover offer for owners of a special class of shares to about $23.9 billion, hoping to quell a shareholder rebellion against a deal meant to return the computer maker to the public markets.Investors would also be able to pick an independent director to sit on Dell\u2019s board from 2020. These VMware shareholders could own between 17 percent and 33 percent of Dell\u2019s shares, though the company expects them to hold a roughly 20 percent stake.The new bid won over shareholders who own more than a combined 20 percent of the tracking stock, including the investment firms Elliott Management, Canyon Partners and BlackRock. Those companies had all opposed the deal for months.\u201cThe new terms offer a constructive compromise that we believe benefits all stockholders,\u201d Jonathan Heller, a partner at Canyon, said in a statement.For Dell and its partner, the investment firm Silver Lake, the deal helps clear the way for the computer maker to become a public company again. A vote on the takeover bid is scheduled for Dec. 11.The tracking stock \u2014 known by its ticker symbol, DVMT \u2014 was born of convoluted financing that helped pay for Dell\u2019s $67 billion takeover of VMware\u2019s parent company, the networking storage company EMC.This time, Dell and Silver Lake briefly threatened to take the company public through an initial public offering, giving no concessions to disaffected shareholders. But that could have been difficult, because potential investors would probably have balked at Dell\u2019s enormous debt load. Eventually, the company decided that the easiest option was to negotiate with DVMT shareholders.One shareholder who did not participate in the crafting of the deal: Mr. Icahn, who sued the company this month over accusations that it withheld information about the takeover bid from investors.But Dell and Silver Lake are betting that they now have enough support from other investors to overcome his opposition in next month\u2019s vote. Mr. Icahn\u2019s share of Dell voting stock is less than 5 percent.Advertisement"}

As a Tesla board member, Ms. Denholm has provided some rare automotive experience to a company that prides itself on being an industry outsider.

{"Headline": "ActBlue, the Democrats\u2019 Not-So-Secret Weapon", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut all have at least one thing in common: ActBlue.The online giving platform emerged as the piggy bank of the Democratic resistance in the 2018 midterms, funneling nearly $1.6 billion in contributions to Democratic candidates and causes. That\u2019s more than an 80 percent increase over what it brought in four years ago.And while ActBlue wasn\u2019t the sole source of small-dollar donors for Democrats, it was certainly a powerful one: The candidates, committees and organizations who used the platform \u2014 more than 14,500 of them \u2014 paid credit card transaction fees and, in turn, got to outsource their financial collections to tested, easy-to-use software. (The group, a nonprofit, funds its staff of about 100 through donations.)Republicans have long benefited from stronger support among wealthy donors and the business community, relying on a network of lavishly funded super PACs. But ActBlue has changed the game for Democrats. Founded in 2004, the nonprofit has developed into a trusted platform, turning the once-cumbersome process of donating to a campaign into something that can be done with just one click of a cellphone.The technology encourages small, recurring donations that go directly to candidates, giving campaigns more control over how the money was spent. The money can also be transferred quickly, wired from ActBlue into campaign coffers by the next morning.\u201cThere used to be these old ways of thinking that there was just a finite pool of people to reach out to when you were doing it all on paper,\u201d said Erin Hill, the executive director of ActBlue. \u201cTechnology can help democratize this process in a way that wasn\u2019t possible 20 years ago.\u201dBut strategists on both sides say the flood of small dollars \u2014 helped along by $110 million from the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2014 changed the race for Democrats in the final weeks of the election season, allowing the party to remain competitive in reach districts, dominate the airwaves and force Republicans to spread out their spending.\u201cTheir money was astronomical,\u201d said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC. \u201cIf you had told me last year this is how much money they would have to spend in these races, I would have laughed at you.\u201d\u201cActBlue wasn\u2019t ActBlue in year one, two or three,\u201d said Mr. Bliss. \u201cSomeone has to develop a brand. It\u2019s doable but takes time.\u201dThey\u2019ll have a lot of catching up to do. In the early handicapping of the 2020 presidential race, some of the strongest potential contenders are those with expansive lists of small donors, a group that includes Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and Beto O\u2019Rourke, who lost his bid for a Texas Senate seat. That\u2019s in part because of the success of Mr. Sanders, perhaps the highest-profile ActBlue user, who powered his 2016 primary campaign through small dollars.\u201cWe don\u2019t go away after a campaign,\u201d said Ms. Hill. \u201cCampaigns, whether they won or lost, they disappeared on Wednesday.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Not Just Trump in House Democrats\u2019 Cross Hairs. His Family Is, Too.", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When two Republican members of Congress began formally questioning last week Ivanka Trump\u2019s use of private email for government business, it was seen by people close to the White House as a sign of things to come for the president\u2019s family.One of the Republicans was Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has conducted little oversight of the Trump White House until now.The other was Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, who previously led a two-year investigation into events surrounding the attack on American diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya, focusing relentlessly on the role of Hillary Clinton. His most prominent investigation as chairman has scrutinized alleged anti-Trump political bias within the F.B.I. during its inquiries related to the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201cThat you now have Republicans investigating members of the first family is an indication of the perils ahead\u201d for the Trumps, said Tom Davis, the former House Republican from Virginia who was the chairman of the Oversight Committee from 2003 through 2006.Mr. Gowdy, who is retiring from Congress in January, will have little to do with any investigation, and his role in endorsing the inquiry was seen as pro forma. In his place as chairman of the committee will be Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, one of the newly empowered House Democrats eager to take on the Trump administration.The Democrats are already laying out lines of inquiry that could quickly lead not just to Mr. Trump and his White House aides, but also to his immediate family. And Republicans returning to Capitol Hill next year may be forced by the changed political climate to take a harder line toward the Trump family.Likely Democratic targets include not only the president\u2019s personal finances and those of the Trump Organization, but also the actions taken by his sons Donald Jr. and Eric and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, during the 2016 campaign and its aftermath.The Oversight and Judiciary Committees are likely to focus on any violations of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which bans payments from foreign governments to federal officeholders, an avenue that will lead to an examination of payments to Trump-held properties and the role of both of his sons and Mr. Kushner. And some investigators may try to question Donald Trump Jr. again about a meeting he held with a Kremlin-linked lawyer promising \u201cdirt\u201d about Mrs. Clinton.While some of the areas primed for inquiry \u2014 most notably, ties between the Trump campaign, the Trump Organization and Russia, and possible campaign finance violations \u2014 are likely to overlap with investigations by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and federal prosecutors in New York, Democrats believe they have a broader mandate to question everything from foreign business dealings by Ms. Trump and the Trump Organization to the administration of security clearances at the White House, including the one given to Mr. Kushner.Mr. Trump has told aides that he believes that Democrats have the potential to appear overly partisan in investigating his family and that voters may be sympathetic to efforts to rebuff them.Thomas M. Reynolds, a former congressman who was the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006, agreed that the incoming House majority would be wise not to meddle excessively in the private affairs of the president\u2019s business and two adult sons.But, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re on a thin line here because the president still owns the company.\u201dCongressional inquiries are treacherous, and can be hard to weather. The president is said to be unprepared for the onslaught he is facing, even as the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, which will be led by a new lead counsel, Pat Cipollone, is hiring a raft of lawyers.Ms. Trump and her husband, Mr. Kushner, have had a veteran Washington lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, working with them for several months. But Mr. Trump is famously frugal about hiring personal lawyers, and it is unclear whether he or his adult sons are prepared for how much assistance they will require.\u201cPolitically speaking, this is the Achilles\u2019 heel of the administration,\u201d said Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a Democrat who sits on two of the key investigative panels, referring to the Trump family\u2019s business dealings. \u201cThey have turned the government of the United States into a moneymaking operation for the president and his family and close friends. That is the exact opposite of our constitutional design.\u201dBoth Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump were advised by White House lawyers of the risks of joining the West Wing as formal advisers two years ago, since it would open them up to official lines of inquiry, among other issues. On the other hand, people close to them noted that they might be shielded by executive privilege in some instances, whereas the president\u2019s adult sons, who do not serve in the administration, are not.Democrats have said they will not reflexively file subpoenas, but they have already gotten signals from the White House that cooperation is likely to be minimal. Even if the Mueller investigation ends in the coming months, as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers believe is possible, the White House is facing a string of congressional subpoenas that could grind the gears of government to a halt, and put a spotlight on areas that the secretive Mr. Trump prefers to keep out of sight.The president\u2019s tax returns, documents he has steadfastly refused to release in defiance of tradition, remain a central target.But if Democrats are successful, the returns could offer them their first comprehensive look into the heart of the Trump Organization and the finances of the first family.The returns could also get wrapped into the Oversight and Judiciary Committees\u2019 looks at potential violations of the emoluments clause.Democrats have already brought a federal lawsuit contending that Mr. Trump\u2019s financial interest in the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington is such a violation. But congressional officials said they were interested more broadly in the possibility that the Trump family is profiting off their time in office, through, among other things, trademarks granted to the Trump Organization and Ms. Trump\u2019s business abroad.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, who will be the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has said that as he weighs how to reopen the committee\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference, he intends to zero in on possible money laundering by Russians through the Trump Organization.That line of inquiry may overlap with the federal investigations, but it would most likely involve an attempt to obtain the president\u2019s bank and other business records.Representative Eric Swalwell of California, who sits on both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, said Democrats would seek to avoid \u201cpalace intrigue and voyeuristic interests\u201d in favor of potential irregularities shaping government policy, like Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign financial dealings.\u201cYeah, it is pretty objectionable that the president\u2019s son-in-law failed a number of times to properly fill out a security clearance form, and it is objectionable he still has one now,\u201d Mr. Swalwell said. \u201cBut is it the most objectionable thing the Trump administration has done? Not by a long shot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mediator Columnist Returns to His Post", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderThe mad alchemists who are brewing our news these days couldn\u2019t have served up a better story for me. I began my career hustling gossip items for Page Six and went on to work at The Times covering media, the White House and money and politics in the post-Citizens United era. The story about Mr. Trump, The Enquirer and alleged hush payments to paramours was essentially a campaign finance story wrapped around a stripper\u2019s pole.And at times, especially during the sloggier weeks when we were hitting the brick walls that are inevitable in investigative reporting, it was painful to be missing all the media action.And I was mighty glad to start back last month. It couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, as the White House was taking its attacks on the press to a new awful place by moving from \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rhetoric to more concrete action, taking away the CNN correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press credential.In nearly 20 years of covering media off and on, I\u2019ve never seen people \u2014 especially Times readers \u2014 take such an interest in the minutiae of government-press relations. If there\u2019s one upside to the presidential attacks it\u2019s that they\u2019ve also caused at least some Americans to find a new appreciation for journalism. (I guess I\u2019m a glass-half-full kind of guy after all.)But I did emerge from the belly of that beast of the hush-money story with a bit more perspective about the way news works as it moves at the speed of social media in such polarized times.I saw that there was a large audience ready to lap unverified allegations up if they fed their own anger at the president.And, in reporting on The Enquirer\u2019s efforts on behalf of the president, I saw that media can work not just as a force for enlightenment and truth but also as a tool for political cover-ups; for the suppression of news.And I saw that in returning to the column, I\u2019m going to have my work cut out for me. Deep breath.Advertisement"}

They were each invited to a large social gathering there by the same mutual friend.At the time, Mr. Groberg, who lived in nearby Bethesda, Md., was receiving treatment for his war injury at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he had undergone more than 30 surgeries over two years. He had not yet been retired by the Army.Ms. Zarin, who was living in Washington, was sitting outside on the patio and dropped her cellphone by accident at precisely the same time as Mr. Groberg walked past her. He picked up the phone and while handing it back thought to himself, \u201cOh man, she\u2019s hot.\u201dMs. Zarin was thinking much the same. \u201cI thought he was very handsome,\u201d she said. \u201cI hoped to meet him when we went inside.\u201dAs it turned out, she never got the chance. When Mr. Groberg walked out the door to run an errand, Ms. Zarin thought he had gone home, and she soon departed, more than a bit disappointed.But the next day, Mr. Groberg called, explaining that he had returned, and when he didn\u2019t see her, asked their mutual friend for her number. Two days later, they went on a first date to a French restaurant in Washington.\u201cI found him to be very smart, very gregarious and at the same time, very warm,\u201d Ms. Zarin said.Mr. Groberg liked what he found as well. \u201cShe was beautiful and super sweet,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was also very funny, and we had some great conversations.\u201dThey became an instant item, and were dating for 14 months when Mr. Groberg received a call from Washington telling him that he had been chosen as a Medal of Honor recipient.\u201cIt was a very emotional ceremony,\u201d said Mr. Groberg, who donated his medal to Fort Carson, where it remains on display.The couple were engaged in December 2016, and in 2017, they embarked on a U.S.O. tour to Afghanistan, Iraq, Abu Dhabi, Spain and Poland.Read more.

Ms. Weiland built a fire and cooked Hebrew National hot dogs on a stick, explaining they were her favorite food.\u201cAnd being a girl from Brooklyn, meeting someone with a fondness for Hebrew National, I knew she was someone special,\u201d Ms. Schumer said.The next morning they parked at the top of the caldera and hiked down to the lake.\u201cIt\u2019s stunning, it\u2019s huge, it\u2019s massive,\u201d Ms. Weiland said. \u201cThe water is so, so blue.

{"Headline": "With Small Steps, Palestinians and Israelis Try to Tackle Gaza\u2019s Ills", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Last year, when the Trump administration was still trying to entice the Palestinians into peace talks with Israel through cooperation rather than coercion, it encouraged the two sides to team up on small-scale infrastructure projects as a way to rebuild trust while improving conditions in the here-and-now.Deep in the Negev Desert, a group of Israeli and Palestinian civilians did just that. They hammered out creative ways to bring solar power, sewage treatment and clean water to the impoverished Gaza Strip, where the lights are out more than they are on, the aquifers are befouled, and raw sewage has been pouring into the Mediterranean \u2014 sometimes overwhelming a nearby Israeli desalination plant with pollution.Their plans were aimed at creating jobs, improving public health and, above all, sustaining hope in a place where that is in short supply. But in the time it took them to see to the nuts and bolts \u2014 business plans, site selection, Israeli military approvals, and the hiring of engineers and workers in Gaza \u2014 the political context changed radically.The Trump administration recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. Angry Palestinians began regularly denouncing the White House, and the administration\u2019s approach to them became no-carrot, all-stick.A series of punitive American diplomatic moves followed, including cuts of hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. Among the casualties: $10 million in start-up grants that the Israeli-Palestinian partnership had been counting on for its package of small-bore Gaza initiatives.Clashes between Israel and Gaza, in months of protests and in repeated rounds of rocket attacks and airstrikes like the ones earlier this week, only added to the obstacles.Now, an on-again, off-again cease-fire is once more being embraced by both Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. And the people behind the small-scale energy and environmental initiatives are trying to find an alternative source of seed capital and hoping that the latest brush with war this week will persuade nations that could supply the money to act quickly.\u201cWe are ready, and our proposals are ready. What is needed is donations,\u201d said Ashraf al-Ajrami, a former Palestinian minister of prisoner affairs who is a key partner in the Gaza projects.In a sense, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse.The violence that began with a botched intelligence operation and gunfight in Khan Younis and wound up with hundreds of rockets raining down on Israeli cities led on Wednesday to the resignation of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, whose aides had indicated their willingness to let the Gaza projects proceed. And early elections in Israel, in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s handling of Gaza is expected to be a central issue, would put any progress on hold.Still, the diplomats, academics and eco-entrepreneurs who met this week at the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, based at the tiny kibbutz Ketura in the Negev desert, said they wanted their projects to be shovel-ready whenever the time is ripe.To be sure, proposals for Gaza infrastructure projects are commonplace: In February, Israel called on international donors to fund a billion-dollar rebuilding plan, including big-ticket items like two desalination plants, a natural gas pipeline and a new electrical transmission line into Gaza from Israel.But major projects can take years to complete, leaving Gaza\u2019s ills to fester.Moreover, Israel and international donors, loath to do business with Hamas, have insisted that the more moderate Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, oversee any projects. But between the Palestinian Authority\u2019s feud with Hamas, and the Trump administration\u2019s feud with the authority, the result has been a Catch-22. And nothing is getting done.What sets the Arava group\u2019s projects apart, officials say, is that they could get underway immediately, with projects up and running in a few months and with most financed in large part by private investment.Another risk of ambitious infrastructure projects is that, once completed, they become tempting targets for Israeli airstrikes in wartime. So the Arava group\u2019s strategy is to stay small and spread out.One of the projects would put 40-kilowatt solar panel arrays on the roofs of 100 Gaza schools and hospitals. That would provide them with much-needed electricity while diverting a fraction of the power to run water-generation kiosks that suck the humidity out of the coastal air and turn it into marketable drinking water. Local franchisees would sell it for a third of the price of bottled water.Another would build a small, solar-powered sewage-treatment plant for about 5,000 homes near the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, selling the treated but unpotable end product to nearby farmers, whose groundwater has become too salty to irrigate their crops.Other projects envision installing solar panels atop the homes of poverty-stricken families or larger solar panel fields to power sewage-treatment plants so they are not dependent on Gaza\u2019s unreliable electrical grid.If successful, these could be replicated widely enough to benefit many of Gaza\u2019s approximately two million residents, backers said. Crucially, the projects rely on municipal-level approvals, not the involvement of Hamas or its ministries, they said.Dennis Ross, the veteran United States negotiator who is advising the Arava partners, said they were benefiting from his own self-critique after repeated failures at peacemaking. His strategy had always been to try to reach a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian agreement on all issues, he said. But energy and water problems, which cross borders, need to be solved more immediately.\u201cOne of the lessons I learned was that we never focused enough on the ground up,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cAny approach to peace that\u2019s trying to create a horizon has no credibility if the day-to-day realities continue to deteriorate. We didn\u2019t do enough from the ground up, and people-to-people, to show there\u2019s a model of success when you work together.\u201dLike Mr. Ross, the Arava partners are all supporters of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which itself looks increasingly like a lost cause.David Lehrer, the institute\u2019s director, said that after decades merely advocating cross-border environmental cooperation in Israel, the West Bank and Jordan \u2014 \u201cNature knows no borders,\u201d he said \u2014 Arava saw little progress. So it decided a few years ago to bring together people who \u201chave to deal with these problems day to day,\u201d he said.One is Tahani Abu Daqqa, another former Palestinian Authority minister who, like Mr. Ajrami, grew up in Gaza and spent years in an Israeli prison. There, she said, she forged cordial relationships with Palestinians on all sides of the conflict.She said they have assured her they would not stand in the way of her plans.\u201cThey trust me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when we show Gaza people that we\u2019re working with Israeli people who want peace like us, it will show that we can live together and be good neighbors. It\u2019s a foothold for peace building.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe hasn\u2019t delivered on all his promises, but he has shown he gets big things done when he\u2019s determined.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.When focused, Gov. Andrew Cuomo can be a nearly unstoppable force for progress.May that be the governor New Yorkers re-elect on Tuesday. New York needs nothing less to meet its biggest challenges: investing in a dangerously out-of-date subway system; supplying housing that more residents can afford; making it easier to vote, and passing ethics and voting reforms to enhance state politics and government. After two terms in office, the governor\u2019s list of accomplishments is substantial. It also includes\u00a0increasing the minimum wage, implementing paid family leave and setting to work rebuilding some of New York City\u2019s most essential infrastructure. But New Yorkers have reasons for disappointment in Mr. Cuomo as well. Faced with a deteriorating subway system, a threat to the region\u2019s work force and economy, the governor has refused to take full ownership of the problem and has instead let endless squabbling with Mr. de Blasio get in the way of substantial progress. While in the State Assembly, from 2007 to 2011, Mr. Molinaro voted against limiting access to firearms for domestic abusers. He voted against sensible rent regulations several times. He voted against a measure that would have stopped the shackling of pregnant prisoners while in labor. He opposed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s signature gun safety law. He says he has evolved on gay marriage, which he voted against while in the State Legislature but now sees as a civil right. He also voted against a proposal to allow unmarried partners to adopt a child. There\u2019s no doubt that Mr. Cuomo seeks to leave a lasting legacy in New York. To do so, he will need to keep his campaign promises. In a time of rising voter suppression nationally, New York also has the opportunity to serve as an example to the nation by making it easier to vote instead. That, however, will require Mr. Cuomo putting his considerable political muscle behind reforms, including early voting and no-excuse absentee ballots. Finally, there is the question of corruption. The governor has long said that he wants change, that he is as outraged by the dirty tricks in Albany as the public is. He needs, then, to do something about it. Creating an independent anticorruption body, providing for public financing of campaigns and closing the loophole that allows businesses called limited liability companies to bypass limits on corporate donations are all good places to start. To help ensure that the governor delivers on these important promises, it would behoove voters to also cast ballots to elect a Democratic State Senate. That\u2019s the best way to keep New York moving forward, and push all the politicians in Albany to lead with no more excuses.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s an unusual phenomenon that has a lot to do with Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican incumbent facing Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso Democrat.Mr. Cruz\u2019s far-right attack-dog persona, failed bid for president and his embrace of President Trump, a former rival who has insulted him and his family, has made the senator unappealing to a subset of moderate Republicans. Gov. Greg Abbott, meanwhile, remains one of the most popular Republicans in the state.Mr. Cruz and his supporters have been confident he will win re-election and dismiss Beto-Abbott voters as fictional creatures. \u201cI think that\u2019s a purple flying unicorn,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in early October. \u201cA media creation.\u201dWe\u2019d like to introduce Mr. Cruz to a bona fide purple flying unicorn: Charles N. Starnes, an economics professor at Wayland Baptist University in the West Texas city of Plainview. Professor Starnes, 70, has been a Republican since the 1960s and voted for Nixon, Reagan and Romney, among others. He already cast his ballot for Mr. Abbott and Mr. O\u2019Rourke during the early voting period that ended Friday.One moment was instrumental for Professor Starnes. He met Mr. O\u2019Rourke months ago, when the congressman held a town hall in the nearby town of Floydada. In red West Texas, Democratic politicians don\u2019t hold many town halls.\u201cHe responded well to the questions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were all balanced responses and thoughtful responses rather than political dogma.\u201dProfessor Starnes hasn\u2019t been bashful about his vote.

Not only are this year\u2019s House and Senate elections expected to set a spending record, they\u2019re also expected to surpass previous records by nearly $1 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.The money is coming from both ends of the financial spectrum.About 100 extremely wealthy donors (think former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg) are spending $1 million or more \u2014 and, in at least one case, more than $100 million \u2014 to push their preferred candidates.Then, there are more than six million regular people who are giving tiny amounts \u2014 $5 here, $10 there \u2014 or an average of about $40 each.Michael Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute in Washington, said the big story is how small donors are sending money across state lines.\u201cIf you\u2019re in the middle of safe district but you care about control of Congress, it\u2019s relatively easy now,\u201d he said.The top beneficiary appears to be Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texas Democrat who is hoping to unseat Senator Ted Cruz. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign has raised more than $69 million. The average donation in the last quarter was less than $50.That Senate race alone is expected to cost more than $100 million, also a record.\u2014 Stephanie Saul and Rachel ShoreyHUDSON, Wis. \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence was running about an hour late for his rally with Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, one of the country\u2019s most endangered Republicans.And that delay on Saturday afternoon gave Jacquie Niccum, who was waiting patiently in her red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap, a lot of time to ponder what Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections meant to her. Not that she needed it.\u201cRight now, it\u2019s very important to me that we get a handle on this immigration,\u201d said Ms. Niccum.Like many people interviewed across the Midwest over the last two weeks \u2014 from Iowa to Missouri to Minnesota and here in Wisconsin \u2014 many Republican-leaning voters took mere seconds to before mentioning immigration as a top-of-mind concern.The reasons they cite for why they see it as such a threat have several common threads. Even though the southern border \u2014 and the caravan of Latin American migrants that so many of them cite \u2014 is distant in a physical sense, it is very close in their minds. Immigration troubles them because, they say, it adds too much debt. It is a security issue because they say the government can\u2019t possibly know everything about everyone who comes in.And many of them, as Ms. Niccum put it, \u201cdon\u2019t want the United States to be changing, transformed.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe need to keep our values, our principles that make this country great.\u201d\u2014 Jeremy PetersBecause of an editing error, a headline on an earlier version of this story misspelled Jimmy Buffett\u2019s last name.Alan Blinder reported from Atlanta.

{"Headline": "Steve Stockman, Ex-Congressman, Gets 10 Years in Prison for Stealing Charitable Donations", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA former United States representative from Texas was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay about $1 million in restitution after being convicted of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars meant for charity and using it to pay for personal expenses and his political campaigns.In April, a federal jury found the former congressman, Steve Stockman, 61, guilty on 23 counts \u2014 including money laundering, conspiracy and making false statements \u2014 after prosecutors alleged that he had orchestrated a yearslong scheme to defraud charitable donors.Two of Mr. Stockman\u2019s former aides also pleaded guilty last year to multiple counts connected to the case.\u201cAt trial, the government proved to the jury that former Congressman Stockman ran his campaign and fraudulent charities to simply enrich himself and defrauded well-meaning donors,\u201d Ryan K. Patrick, United States attorney for the Southern District of Texas, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThis type of corruption by public officials gives our entire democratic system a black eye.\u201dMarlo P. Cadeddu, a lawyer for Mr. Stockman, said in an interview on Wednesday that the government had asked for a 210-month sentence, \u201cso this is better than it could have been\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re gratified by that.\u201dShe added that in the coming weeks, her team plans to appeal Mr. Stockman\u2019s conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.Mr. Stockman, a Republican, served one term in the mid-1990s and another from 2013 to 2015. He also ran unsuccessfully for United States Senate in 2014. Throughout his latter days in politics, Mr. Stockman stood out for being intensely anti-Obama. In 2014, Mr. Stockman walked out of Mr. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in protest. He also sold Obama \u201cbarf bags\u201d as a campaign fund-raiser.Specifically, prosecutors alleged that in 2010, Mr. Stockman and one of his aides solicited an elderly donor for $285,000, which the pair said would be used for legitimate charitable and educational purposes. Instead, they used a sham charity to funnel the money such that it could be used for a variety of personal expenses.In the years that followed, prosecutors said Mr. Stockman and the aide received an additional $165,000 in charitable donations from the donor, much of which Mr. Stockman used illegally to finance his 2012 congressional campaign.Such behavior continued after Mr. Stockman took office in 2013, according the Justice Department. He and the aide used the name of another sham nonprofit entity \u2014 \u201cLife Without Limits\u201d \u2014 to solicit a $350,000 charitable donation, which he said would be used to create an educational center called the Freedom House. Instead the money went to a variety of personal and campaign expenses, prosecutors said.Prosecutors also showed at trial that Mr. Stockman did not pay taxes on the fraudulently acquired donations. At one point, Mr. Stockman even directed one of his aides to flee to Cairo so that the aide could not be questioned by law enforcement agencies, the Justice Department said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Singles Day Sales Top $30 Billion. The Party May Not Last.", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 After 24 hours of frenzied buying and selling, and weeks of advertising and promotions before it, the Alibaba Group announced that its sales hit another titanic high on Singles Day, the Nov. 11 shopping festival that the Chinese e-commerce behemoth cooked up a decade ago.This time, as China\u2019s vast economy slows, the party was held with icebergs in sight from the deck.But all around China, gloom and uncertainty are the word.Meanwhile, some young Chinese shoppers seem less enthused this year about celebrating manic consumerism.Yang Sun, a 26-year-old from the northern city of Xi\u2019an, said that the Singles Day discounts were no longer good enough to persuade her to wait all year to buy the things she wanted. Wang Xin, 24, an engineer in Shanghai, said he had rediscovered the joys of shopping offline.\u201cSingles Day just doesn\u2019t hold that much appeal for me,\u201d Mr. Wang said.Asked about the current mood among Chinese consumers, Joseph C. Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, told reporters on Sunday that Alibaba should be understood in the context of the epochal rise of China\u2019s middle class.\u201cThat trend is not going to stop, trade war or no trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cAny kind of short-term economic effects, we believe, will be cyclical.\u201dAlibaba is not like Amazon in that it is not a retailer. It merely provides the digital shelves and aisles for other merchants to sell their goods. But in its relentless ambition, Alibaba may be Amazon\u2019s only global equal. Both companies want to fulfill their customers\u2019 every desire and need.The business case for all this empire-building, Alibaba says, is that the company\u2019s lakes of commercial data give it a leg up in anything that requires understanding customers or merchants.But Wall Street is still waiting for results, and has grown skeptical in the meantime of the costs of expanding into new areas. Alibaba\u2019s shares have lost nearly one-third of their value since June.Singles Day 2018 showed that Alibaba remains, if nothing else, China\u2019s king of hype. During the broadcast event, the M.C.s periodically encouraged people watching at home to open up their phones and check out the great deals. As acrobats with Cirque du Soleil twirled in midair, the logo of Kukahome, a Chinese furniture maker, shone brightly behind them.At one point, the performer Liu Wei rapped out the specs of a new model of Skoda sport utility vehicle.Anna Lin, a 25-year-old who works in finance in Shanghai, said she was feeling more lukewarm about the whole thing than in years past. Singles Day is now just one of many big shopping festivals each year, she said.Plus, Ms. Lin said, the Singles Day promotions have become increasingly baroque. This year, there were coupons for specific items and brands, coupons that were available only at certain times of day, and coupons that appeared randomly and could be grabbed only by playing a game. Gathering friends into a team could help you collect even more coupons.\u201cThat\u2019s too much work,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cIt also isn\u2019t worth it when you realize that after you\u2019ve done all that, all you\u2019ve got is 10 to 15 percent off, or even less.\u201d\u201cMy time is more valuable than that,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cI honestly think all the math is a way to hide the fact that there isn\u2019t much of a discount.\u201dAlibaba does not lack for other methods of subtle persuasion on Singles Day. If you had opened your Taobao shopping app on Sunday, you would have seen how your spending that day ranked against that of other people in your area.The company\u2019s methods for ginning up excitement have come under scrutiny before. Two years ago, Alibaba said that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating it for the way it reports Singles Day sales. The company\u2019s preferred metric, gross merchandise value, is supposed to represent the amount of money that changes hands on its platforms. But there is no standardized way of calculating it.The company has since de-emphasized the number. But the episode illustrated the way that Alibaba sees itself \u2014 as a company that breaks the mold.Ever since Alibaba listed its shares in New York four years ago, the company has used a sense of manifest destiny to beguile investors, stock analysts and an eager news media. China was on the long road to middle-class prosperity, the company said, and Alibaba had the biggest tollbooth. A bet on Alibaba was a bet on China itself.Now, though, it is clear that Alibaba\u2019s privileged place in China\u2019s rise is not guaranteed.In takeout delivery, for instance, Alibaba is facing off against several wealthy rivals. It has made big bets that have struggled, including on the troubled bike-rental company Ofo.No one expects Alibaba to generate whopper Singles Day sales growth numbers every year for eternity. At some point, when growth starts decelerating quickly, the event could change, to focus on one week\u2019s sales instead of one day\u2019s, or on something else entirely.Alibaba\u2019s track record suggests that when the time comes, it will have no trouble pulling off another act of conjuring.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about Alibaba at all,\u201d said Steven Zhu, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm Pacific Epoch. \u201cThese guys are really good at creating things from nothing.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Mayors, Feeling the Pinch, Lead a Quiet Rebellion and Quit", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAINT-SEINE-SUR-VINGEANNE, France \u2014 As mayor of this postage-stamp village deep in Burgundy, France, Louis Gentilhomme presided over a small but seemingly idyllic patch. The loudest noise on a recent day was the autumn breeze whistling in the trees. There were a few streets of stone houses, a 13th-century church, one baker and not much else.So it may come as a surprise that late last year, Mr. Gentilhomme wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron telling him that the stress was too much and that he was quitting. He could not stand watching his village of 400 wither anymore.\u201cAfter 30 years, I\u2019ve had enough,\u201d wrote Mr. Gentilhomme, a vigorous 77-year-old former French Navy SEAL diver. \u201cThe compromises, the unkept promises and the state\u2019s withdrawal have used me up, morally and physically.\u2019\u2019His letter speaks to a broader anxiety in France\u2019s heartland. This year, like him, more than 150 of the country\u2019s mayors, mostly rural, have quit. The number of mayors quitting their posts may be at an all-time high, up anywhere from 32 percent to 50 percent over the previous electoral cycle, according to the French news media.The resignations provide an echo of the larger clash taking place in France today between Mr. Macron\u2019s drive to shake up the country\u2019s sometimes archaic institutions, untouched for centuries, and a way of life that may no longer be sustainable.It is in villages where the president\u2019s ambition to pare back the government most squarely runs up against French traditions and expectations \u2014 one of which is that the state provides services and should make its authority felt in even the quietest corners.That has long been the role of the village mayor, as much a French specialty as the 17th-century castle that graces Mr. Gentilhomme\u2019s tiny territory, and almost as anachronistic.Mayors have been a mainstay of French life since the revolutionaries of 1789 decreed that wherever a church steeple arises \u2014 even if only a few houses are clustered around it \u2014 there should be a mayor.It has remained this way ever since. No country on the Continent surpasses France\u2019s 35,502 mayors, who make up 40 percent of all the mayors in the European Union. Twenty thousand of these towns have fewer than 500 inhabitants.But even before Mr. Macron came to office in May 2017, France was confronting the question of whether it could still afford so many little fiefs, which were already straining under cost cutting and administrative \u201cregroupings.\u201dUnder a 2015 law, small towns were ordered to combine into administrative units of at least 15,000 people, where 5,000 had been the previous benchmark. Real power \u2014 to handle economic development, to manage water, even to raise taxes \u2014 passed to the new clusters.Now the young president has accelerated that drive toward even more administrative efficiency.\u201cIn the era of the internet, fast transport and cuts in local funding, it makes sense for these towns to group themselves together to confront these new challenges,\u201d said Jean-Ren\u00e9 Cazeneuve, a Macron deputy in the French Parliament who is studying why so many mayors are resigning.\u201cIt\u2019s Emmanuel Macron who wants to speed things up, who wants to reform,\u201d Mr. Cazeneuve said. \u201cAnd that could make local officials feel uneasy about their future.\u201dNo doubt it has. More mayors are shedding the sash that denotes their authority, as the appeal of presiding over the tricolor flag that flutters outside every mairie, or town hall, is not what it used to be.The departures \u2014 a small fraction of the total, to be sure \u2014 reflect the struggle of villages in rural France to remain alive while trapped in a spiral of shrinking revenues and declining populations.But the cure, the mayors say, has steadily left them with less money and less authority, but with no fewer burdens. \u201cWe do everything,\u201d said Jean-Claude Bellini, who recently quit as mayor of nearby Chaux. \u201cIt\u2019s always, \u2018call the mayor, call the mayor.\u2019\u201dIndeed, experts say, even with the regroupings and the cuts, there is a logic \u2014 a very French logic \u2014 in keeping the mayor in city hall. \u201cTheir reason for being is proximity,\u201d said Matthieu Leprince, an economics professor and expert on local finance at the University of Western Brittany in Brest. \u201cThey know the turf.\u201dThat has made the quiet revolt among France\u2019s mayors \u2014 whose ears are closest to the citizen\u2019s mouth \u2014 an important measure of grass-roots resistance to Mr. Macron\u2019s reform drive.But money has its own logic, too, and funds from Paris have dropped sharply over the last two years, Mr. Gentilhomme said. Overall, the state\u2019s contribution to France\u2019s towns has dropped to 30 billion euros, or about $34 billion, in 2017, when Mr. Macron was elected, from 42 billion euros in 2014.At the same time, Mr. Macron has vowed to cut a main source of local revenue, the lodging tax, which brings in a total of 22 billion euros annually, or about $25 billion, and makes up 10 percent of the average village\u2019s budget.The tax is paid by anyone who owns, rents or lives in a home or apartment \u2014 just about everyone in France \u2014 and Mr. Macron\u2019s pledge to get rid of it was one of his most popular campaign promises.While that promises to lighten the tax load on local residents, it has made the mayors \u2014 who booed Mr. Macron at their meeting last year \u2014 particularly furious.The mayors, he said, had long felt disrespected by the authorities in Paris, but they had hoped for a change with Mr. Macron.\u201cWe thought that with him, finally, there would be dialogue between Paris and the territories,\u201d Mr. Rochette said. \u201cBut cutting out the lodging tax was the last straw. And we\u2019ve all cut and cut, and now we\u2019re down to the bone.\u201dAware of the frustration, Mr. Macron last month beefed up his local affairs ministry, vowing more attentiveness. But that was too late for mayors like Mr. Gentilhomme.\u201cMy struggle for the survival of our countryside was misunderstood, and barely supported,\u201d Mr. Gentilhomme wrote the president.The short letter back from Mr. Macron was signed, but that was the only human touch. It spoke dryly of \u201cinstitutional stability\u201d and promised to simplify the administrative regroupings.But that consolidation was exactly what Mr. Gentilhomme had fought against, as he was pushed from a regrouping of 11 villages into one of 26.Mr. Cazeneuve, the parliamentary deputy, thinks the consolidations could be a prime reason behind the resignation wave \u2014 an end to the distinctive French dream of being king of one\u2019s own small domain.\u201cIt\u2019s better to be first in the village than second in Rome,\u201d he said.But second, even in the village, is another thing entirely.\u201cI walked to the mairie every day,\u201d Mr. Gentilhomme said. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t hesitate to call out to me, or even to come to the house. They think the mayor can do everything.\u201d\u201c\u2018There\u2019s no water, there\u2019s no electricity, so, it\u2019s got be the mayor,\u2019\u201d he said, mimicking the complaints that came piling down.\u201cOn your own turf, people think you are the good Lord,\u201d Mr. Gentilhomme said. \u201cBut in reality, you can\u2019t do much of anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Cuomo \u2014 in the way.The mayor, a second-term Democrat, was quick to announce the measures that he would like the Legislature, with both houses now in the hands of his party, to take up promptly in the new year.His list included rent law reforms and other steps to protect or promote affordable housing; new sources of financing for the city\u2019s subways and buses; education financing and extended mayoral control of schools; and changes to election laws that would make voting easier and remake the Board of Elections.\u201cThe fact that we not only have a Democratic majority in the State Senate, but a resounding Democratic majority, is going to allow for a host of progress for the state and going to allow some really important initiatives to finally be acted on,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at his weekly news conference.Still, even an all-Democratic Albany could present challenges to Mr. de Blasio, who has shown in the past that he is capable of overconfidence that leaves him vulnerable to overreaching and stumbling.Central to the mayor\u2019s success will be his relationship with Mr. Cuomo, who was re-elected to a third term on Tuesday and remains the most powerful force in the state capital. The governor\u2019s relationship with the mayor during their respective tenures has ranged from mildly unpleasant to downright nauseating.On Wednesday, the mayor pooh-poohed any animus between the men, again insisting that the new Democratic power dynamic would help ease the tension, mentioning Carl E. Heastie, the speaker of the State Assembly, and Andrea Stewart-Cousins, due to lead the State Senate.\u201cThe difference now is you\u2019ve got, in the two leaders of the Legislature, two people who are devoted to making real change and who work well together,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cFrom my point of view, we\u2019re going to be able to have a kind of dialogue we never had before.\u201dThen, perhaps wisely, he added a note of caution, saying, \u201cOf course, these are still complex issues and everything will take time.\u201dThere were bound to be conflicts. Mr. de Blasio has repeatedly called for a new tax on high earners to fund various programs, and called for it again on Wednesday; Mr. Cuomo, more fiscally conservative, has opposed it, as did other legislators after it became apparent that the new federal tax code would hurt some of the state\u2019s richest residents.In campaigning, too, Mr. Cuomo had some Democratic candidates sign onto a nine-point plan that included making the \u201cdemand\u201d that New York City \u201cpay its fair share for\u201d public transit programs.Then, too, there is the lingering issue of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, who is friends with Mr. de Blasio. The mayor didn\u2019t officially take sides in the primary, but the legislative session could be the first test of whether Mr. Cuomo exercises his gold-medal skills in holding a grudge.In a radio interview on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo described his relationship with Mr. de Blasio as complicated but functional. \u201cI have my idea of what an effective Democratic progressive is; he has his idea of what it means to be a Democratic progressive,\u201d the governor said on WVOX. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not friends. It doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t work on things together.\u201dCompromise, of course, is usually easier when members are of similar political persuasions, and if you peer closely, you could discern signs on Wednesday of a d\u00e9tente on a congestion pricing proposal for the city, an idea that Mr. Cuomo supports. Mr. de Blasio has been softening his public statements on congestion pricing in recent weeks, and on Wednesday he again said that it could be part of a mixture of financing sources for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Mr. de Blasio also said that the new dynamic in Albany could improve relations with Mr. Cuomo. \u201cWe\u2019ve both said publicly and privately we want to try, in his new term, to do better at finding common ground, and I\u2019m going to work on that consistently.\u201dThe State Assembly has always been the friendliest terrain for Mr. de Blasio, with dozens of city-based Democrats, and will likely remain that way. Mr. Heastie has usually been viewed as his closest ally.On Wednesday, however, it was Senate Republicans who were hurting, looking at a vastly diminished caucus and the possibility of a long time in the wilderness. Senator Patrick Gallivan, one of only 23 Republicans who won on Tuesday, worried that the new Democratic Albany would look like the last version, in 2009-10, when taxes went up.Mr. Gallivan, who represents the Buffalo area, said he also worried that Mr. de Blasio and his fellow downstaters \u2014 including and most notably Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Heastie and Ms. Stewart-Cousins \u2014 would forget about upstate.\u201cI don\u2019t think one-party rule anywhere is good for the state,\u201d he said.Shane Goldmacher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Witness at El Chapo Trial Gives Master Class on Sinaloa Cartel", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA former operations chief for the Sinaloa drug cartel took the witness stand Wednesday and offered a master class on the inner workings of the trafficking operation, identifying Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, known to the world as El Chapo, as one of its chief leaders.In three hours of insider testimony, the witness, Jesus Zambada Garc\u00eda, provided details of the cartel\u2019s logistics, financing and central personalities \u2014 among them, his own brother, Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda, who once served as Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s deputy and partner.At the high point of the afternoon, Mr. Zambada \u2014 balding, wearing a pair of tinted glasses and dressed in a blue prison jumpsuit \u2014 rose to his feet and pointed at Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, naming him one of Mexico\u2019s \u201cmost powerful drug traffickers.\u201d With arms crossed, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n showed little reaction aside from coolly meeting his former underling\u2019s gaze.Until the Guzm\u00e1n trial, American prosecutors have never had the chance to publicly lay out what they know about a major Mexican cartel, as they have done with other criminal organizations like Al Qaeda and the Mafia. But Mr. Zambada, who said he worked for the cartel from 1987 until his arrest in 2008, acted as a tour guide of sorts, telling the jury how its operatives would waterproof packages of cocaine in multiple layers of rubber, and once used deep-sea divers to retrieve a shipment that had sunk in a container vessel off the coast of Puerto Vallarta.Having risen through the ranks, from an accountant to becoming the cartel\u2019s main person in Mexico City, Mr. Zambada seemed to know almost every aspect of the organization\u2019s operations: from who ran its \u201cplaza\u201d in Guerrero to the various names \u2014 Sapphire, Pacman and Coca-Cola \u2014 it used to brand its product.In general, Mr. Zambada said, in a nonchalant manner, the cartel\u2019s cocaine originated in Colombia and was shipped by fast boats to Cancun, where it was brought ashore by a human chain of haulers. From there, he said, it was typically trucked to warehouses in Mexico City \u2014 often in gas tankers \u2014 and then moved north to border towns, like Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and Agua Prieta, to be smuggled into the United States.The profits were apparently enormous. Mr. Zambada, who has an accounting degree, testified that a $9 million investment in a 15-ton shipment of cocaine could earn its backers \u2014 after transportation costs \u2014 $39 million if sold in Los Angeles. If the same shipment were sold in Chicago, where prices were higher, he explained, the profits would be $48 million. In New York, he said, an investor could see a return of $78 million.The prosecution, infuriated by the claims, filed an unusual motion late Tuesday to strike the entire presentation, saying it was based on hearsay and violated an evidentiary ruling issued before the trial by Judge Brian M. Cogan. On Wednesday morning, Judge Cogan denied the motion, but told the jury to ignore any references to official corruption and focus on the charges Mr. Guzm\u00e1n is facing.Mr. Zambada will take the witness stand again on Thursday morning, when he is likely to face a cross-examination focused on the numerous murders he is said to have committed for the cartel.On Wednesday, one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, rattled off the names of several other cooperating witnesses who are expected to appear at the trial. They included the former drug dealer Miguel Angel Mart\u00ednez, who Mr. Lichtman said had a four-gram-a-day cocaine habit; and another trafficker, Alex Cifuentes, who once worked for Pablo Escobar, the boss of Colombia\u2019s Medellin cartel.He referred to the government\u2019s witnesses as \u201cdegenerates\u201d and \u201cpeople who will make your skin crawl.\u201dMr. Lichtman also claimed that the government planned to call Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s onetime right-hand man, Cesar Castelum, who is said to have once plotted to assassinate a president of Honduras. Mr. Castelum is expected to testify that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was not a millionaire and was often broke and always asking for money, Mr. Lichtman said.\u201cThis case,\u201d he added, \u201cis built on a foundation of lies.\u201dEmily Palmer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Obama and Baker, a Lament for a Lost Consensus", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoHOUSTON \u2014 If there ever really was a so-called Washington consensus, it was sitting on stage \u2014 a former Democratic president and a former Republican secretary of state sharing laments about the days when the political system seemed to work better.Barack Obama and James A. Baker III on Tuesday night embodied what has become of that consensus, the decades-long accord between the two parties in favor of free trade, democratic values and an internationalist foreign policy built on alliances with like-minded countries.Where once the likes of Mr. Obama and Mr. Baker ran Washington and the world, now they are left to gather along with other \u201cformers\u201d at conferences and dinners and in the conversation held here at Rice University to discuss where it all went off track. In the age of President Trump, the great disrupter of the way things have always worked, the architects and preservers of the old approach are still struggling to come to terms with how it has frayed.\u201cA legitimate critique of that consensus, which I consider myself to be part of and still believe in, is that we did not adapt quickly enough to the fact that there were people being left behind and that frustrations were going to flare up and all these changes that were happening were happening really quick,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cThe Washington consensus, whatever you want to call it, got a little too comfortable,\u201d Mr. Obama added. \u201cParticularly after the Cold War, you had this period of great smugness on the part of America and American elites thinking we got this all figured out.\u201dNeither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Baker directly addressed Mr. Trump \u2014 indeed, the incumbent president was declared by the moderator, the historian Jon Meacham, to be the Voldemort of the evening: He who must not be named. But their very presence together was a message of its own.Mr. Baker, who worked for three Republican presidents, ran five presidential campaigns and served as secretary of state at the end of the Cold War, made a point of inviting Mr. Obama, the last Democrat to live in the White House, as the featured guest at the gala 25th anniversary of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice.The hundreds gathered in a cathedral tent set up at Rice for the event represented the sort of bipartisan crowd rarely seen in Washington these days. Some cheered any mention of Ronald Reagan; others applauded Mr. Obama\u2019s defense of his Affordable Care Act. All of them, it seemed, expressed approval for the notion that the two parties should work together more.\u201cThe fact is that members of Congress are primarily motivated around keeping their seat,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cAnd it\u2019s getting worse and worse,\u201d Mr. Baker agreed.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times during my presidency I would have former colleagues of mine in the Senate, who are good people and sensible people, say, \u2018Mr. President, I\u2019d love to help you but I\u2019d get killed,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cI totally agree with that, Mr. President,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cI think another way to put it is the responsible center in American politics has disappeared.\u201dThe two offered several reasons familiar to these sorts of discussions, including the gerrymandering of congressional districts that make incumbents more afraid of losing to more extreme members of their own parties in primaries than to an opponent from across the aisle.They also pointed to the fragmentation of the media, which rewards the loudest voices and increasingly takes sides. \u201cDivisiveness sells. Comity doesn\u2019t sell,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cIf you can get somebody to say something outrageous, that person can get on TV, right?\u201dHe said Fox News is perceived as the \u201chouse organ of the Republican Party\u201d and MSNBC the \u201chouse organ of the Democratic Party,\u201d adding that \u201cour media today are no longer objective reporters of the facts the way they were when I was there.\u201dBecause of that, Mr. Obama complained, Americans do not even start with the same understanding of the facts before debating what the facts mean.\u201cThe biggest challenge we\u2019re going to have over the next 10, 15, 20 years is to return to a civic conversation in which if I say this is a chair we agree this is a chair,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cNow we can disagree on whether it\u2019s a nice chair, whether to replace the chair, whether you want to move it over there. But you can\u2019t say it\u2019s an elephant.\u201d\u201cI thought we were supposed to be against Obama-chair,\u201d Mr. Meacham quipped, drawing peals of laughter.Mr. Baker recalled that Mr. Reagan and Speaker Thomas P. \u201cTip\u201d O\u2019Neill, a Democrat from Massachusetts, disagreed on nearly everything but still managed to collaborate. \u201cThey\u2019d fight like hell during the day and at night they would retire somewhere at 5 o\u2019clock, start telling Irish jokes and drinking bourbon,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they found ways to cooperate and ways to get the nation\u2019s business done.\u201dHe noted that Mr. Reagan worked with Democrats to overhaul the tax code while paying for it \u2014 unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut financed by deficits. \u201cIt was a true tax reform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t jack up the budget deficit.\u201dAnd he defended the value of NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other organizations that Mr. Trump has denigrated. \u201cThese institutions make America better and we ought not to be running them down,\u201d Mr. Baker said.Mr. Obama used the opportunity to defend his presidency, noting that energy production and stock markets increased on his watch.\u201cThat whole suddenly America\u2019s the biggest oil producer \u2014 that was me, people,\u201d he said. As for Wall Street tycoons who complain that he was anti-business, Mr. Obama said, \u201cHave you checked where your stocks were when I came to office\u201d and where they were when he left? \u201cWhat are you complaining about? Just say thank you, please.\u201dMr. Baker repeated one of his favorite laugh lines when asked his most important accomplishment: \u201cLeaving Washington unindicted.\u201dMr. Obama played off that. \u201cNot only did I not get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was the only administration in modern history that can be said about.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carlos Ghosn Can Remain in Tokyo Jail for 10 More Days", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A Tokyo court approved a 10-day extension of jail time for Carlos Ghosn, the head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, on Friday as prosecutors assess allegations of financial misconduct. An ocean away, the corporate titan\u2019s problems were on show at the Group of 20 summit meeting: President Emmanuel Macron of France, where Renault is based, met with Japan\u2019s prime minister to discuss the alliance.Mr. Ghosn, a charismatic leader in the auto industry, is being investigated after a whistle-blower within Nissan, the Japanese automaker, alleged he vastly understated his compensation on securities filings. He has been in detention since Nov. 19, when he was arrested on his private jet soon after landing at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda Airport.Greg Kelly, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s former chief of staff and a Nissan board member, who was arrested at the same time, will also be detained for 10 more days. A former head of human resources and an American, Mr. Kelly has been described by the company as a \u201cmastermind\u201d of the alleged financial wrongdoing. Both men were in Tokyo for a board meeting.Under Japanese law, prosecutors can detain suspects for up to 22 days without filing charges, and can legally question them without a lawyer present.The extended detentions give the Japanese authorities more time to interrogate the men, search Nissan\u2019s offices for evidence and determine whether to press charges. Prosecutors have said they suspect Mr. Ghosn earned around 10 billion yen, or about $88 million, at Nissan from 2011 to 2015 but reported only half of it. The other half was to be parceled out as deferred compensation after Mr. Ghosn, 64, retired.Mr. Kelly is also alleged to have overseen the surreptitious purchase of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of housing for his boss through a Dutch company, Zi-A Capital, whose financial reports are opaque. Mr. Ghosn kept homes in Paris, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro and Beirut, Lebanon.Mr. Ghosn has denied the allegations, the Japanese public broadcaster NHK said this week. Mr. Kelly has also denied wrongdoing, according to his attorney, Yoichi Kitamura.Mr. Kitamura told The New York Times that Mr. Kelly maintained that Mr. Ghosn had the right to set his own pay, and that the executive had decided to pay himself \u00a51 billion a year as chief executive. Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly are accused of underreporting his compensation in required securities filings. Mr. Kelly said the securities report did not understate the pay, Mr. Kitamura said.Mr. Kitamura said Mr. Kelly maintained that he had consulted with an outside lawyer about a plan to defer Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation. According to Japanese media, Mr. Kelly has said he asked that lawyer to get approval from Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency to ensure the plan was correct and that it did not need to be reported as current compensation.Mr. Kitamura said Mr. Kelly believed that the plan was legal under Japanese law after consulting with an outside lawyer.Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, has stated several times that France has \u201cno evidence\u201d of wrongdoing by Mr. Ghosn, and called on Nissan to turn over its dossier. Last week, he asked his Japanese counterpart to come to Paris to make a joint public statement on the matter.At the G-20 meeting in Buenos Aires on Friday, Mr. Macron told Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan that he wanted to maintain the alliance between Renault and Nissan after Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest. Mr. Macron \u201creiterated his commitment to preserving the alliance as well as the stability of the group,\u201d the president\u2019s office said in a statement.In the talks, Mr. Abe said that a stable Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance was important but that its future should be decided by stakeholders in the private sector rather than either government, according to a Japanese official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Since Mr. Ghosn pulled Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy over a decade ago, it has become the alliance\u2019s more profitable partner. In recent years, executives inside the company had raised the issue of rebalancing the relationship.Renault holds a 43 percent stake in Nissan, and the Japanese company holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, the same share as the French government. There have been tensions within the alliance \u2014 which accounted for 10.6 million car sales last year \u2014 as Renault has been the dominant partner.On Thursday, officials from Renault and Nissan consulted in Amsterdam, where the alliance has its headquarters, and issued a statement that the board of directors of all three companies \u201cindividually and collectively emphatically reiterated their strong commitment to the alliance.\u201d The Japanese officials dialed in by teleconference.The move, which Mr. Ghosn opposed in a bitter fight with Mr. Macron, rattled Nissan. Nissan has no voting rights in Renault, despite its 15 percent stake. Nissan threatened to leave the alliance\u2019s master agreement.Some French newspapers have questioned why and how Mr. Ghosn was being held for weeks without charges. On Thursday, the deputy head of the Tokyo prosecutor\u2019s office, Shin Kukimoto, rebuffed the criticism as na\u00efve.\u201cWe do not unnecessarily keep people in custody for a long time,\u201d Mr. Kukimoto said. \u201cI do not criticize other countries\u2019 systems just because they are different.\u201dLiz Alderman reported from Paris, and Motoko Rich from Tokyo.

{"Headline": "Lasting Rancor Over Voting Issues Puts a Spotlight on a Georgia Runoff", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDECATUR, Ga. \u2014 Election Day was three weeks in the past, and Kenneth Royal, a 37-year-old salesman who supported Stacey Abrams for governor, could have spent the chilly Wednesday evening at home, putting politics out of his mind.Instead, Mr. Royal, stung by Ms. Abrams\u2019s narrow defeat, was manning a phone bank, trying to persuade fellow Democrats that the runoff election next week for Georgia secretary of state was not some obscure postscript, but a crucial battle over minority voting rights.The issue of whether the state\u2019s elections are managed fairly grabbed hold of Georgia in the midterms, and has not let go. Brian Kemp, the Republican who ran for governor while still serving as secretary of state, oversaw voting roll purges, registration suspensions, and an Election Day rife with problems \u2014 all of which, critics said, were meant to suppress minority voting.Like many Democrats around the country, Mr. Royal believes that those tactics worked, and essentially cheated Ms. Abrams out of victory in an excruciatingly close race. And he sees the coming race for secretary of state as a way to set some things right.\u201cWas it stolen? I think it was,\u201d Mr. Royal said of the election. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thankful for is that we\u2019ve been able to shed light on what\u2019s been going on for a long time.\u201dMr. Kemp and other Republicans brush aside such views as the complaints of sore losers, and say their policies protect the integrity of elections. Mr. Kemp will be sworn into office in January.Democrats preparing for the runoff, meanwhile, may find it difficult to rekindle the passion that animated Georgian voters for the general election on Nov. 6, when some 3.9 million ballots were cast.Even so, the party hopes to add Georgia to a string of victories in secretary of state contests this year, including three states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado and Michigan \u2014 where Democrats flipped control of the office, with promises to expand the franchise and protect voter rights.Democrats regard those gains as crucial to their broader effort to reverse what they see as an erosion of voting rights across the country at the hands of Republicans.In Congress, where Democrats will take control of the House in January after sweeping victories in the midterms, party leaders have vowed to give electoral overhaul measures a top priority. Bills are planned to make voter registration automatic across the country and to revive provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013.Democrats also thwarted a bid for governor by Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state known for pushing restrictive voting policies that were often struck down in court.But it was the Georgia governor\u2019s race this year that most angered, and galvanized, the American left, which has portrayed Mr. Kemp, a businessman and ally of President Trump from Athens, Ga., as a vote-suppressing villain.Mr. Kemp, 55, points to the introduction of an online voter registration system and the substantial growth in the number of registered voters on his watch as evidence that he has made it easier, not harder, for the state\u2019s citizens to register and vote.Ms. Abrams, who emerged from the election as a liberal star, has also begun putting that star power to work for Mr. Barrow, though they come from opposite points of the party compass: She is 44, black, and unabashedly liberal; he is 63, white, and studiously centrist.In TV ads, Mr. Barrow leans on a fence in front of a bucolic Georgia landscape and declares, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a Democrat, but I won\u2019t bite you.\u201dHis Republican opponent, Brad Raffensperger, a State House member and a civil engineer, also lacks a certain bite: Even allies describe him as long on intelligence and short on charisma.After Election Day, the Abrams camp declined to declare an end to the campaign for 10 days, hoping to find enough votes among provisional and absentee ballots to force a runoff in the governor\u2019s race. When Ms. Abrams finally acknowledged that Mr. Kemp had won, she said Georgia had suffered an \u201cerosion of democracy\u201d under Mr. Kemp.Since then, she has raised money for Mr. Barrow and recorded a radio ad for him. \u201cI won\u2019t stop until we guarantee a fair fight for future elections,\u201d she says in the ad. \u201cThe other side thinks we\u2019ve given up \u2014 that because I didn\u2019t win, we won\u2019t come back out. Let\u2019s prove them wrong.\u201dMr. Kemp has also weighed in, with an email to supporters on Wednesday asking them to help finance ads supporting Mr. Raffensperger. Mr. Kemp said that Mr. Barrow would \u201cimplement radical left-wing policies that undermine Georgia elections\u201d and help Democrats \u201cturn Georgia into the next California.\u201dMr. Barrow probably enjoys greater name recognition than Mr. Raffensperger, and that is partly the fault of Republicans, who repeatedly redrew the boundaries of Mr. Barrow\u2019s district during his 10-year stint in Congress, which only served to widen his exposure.Both candidates say Georgia\u2019s obsolescent voting machines need to be replaced. But Mr. Barrow, in an interview, attacked his opponent for wanting to stick with other aspects of the status quo from Mr. Kemp\u2019s tenure.\u201cHe\u2019s defending the system that purges voters in ways that are highly inaccurate,\u201d Mr. Barrow said. \u201cHis way of updating the voting rolls will actually degrade the voting rolls. I want to do it with information that\u2019s accurate.\u201dMr. Barrow criticized the state\u2019s \u201cexact-match\u201d system, which left tens of thousands of new voters in a kind of administrative limbo before the Nov. 6 election. He said it was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for the state to place voter applications in \u201cpending\u201d status just because of \u201ctrivial inaccuracies\u201d that cause mismatches with other official databases.He was also critical of the state\u2019s \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d provision, which drops people from the voting rolls if they have not voted in several consecutive elections.But Mr. Barrow differs with Ms. Abrams\u2019s supporters over some of the measures they are seeking in a federal lawsuit filed this week, calling for sweeping changes to the state\u2019s election system.Notably, the lawsuit calls for the reimposition of federal oversight over any changes to Georgia\u2019s election procedures, which used to be required under the Voting Rights Act. Mr. Barrow said that such oversight would best be handled by the state.Dr. Swint, the political scientist, noted that there were limits to the power that secretaries of state can wield in Georgia. \u201cThey apply election law, they don\u2019t make election law,\u201d he said. Even so, he noted, the post can serve as a springboard to the governor\u2019s mansion, as it was for Mr. Kemp.If Mr. Barrow wins on Tuesday and Ms. Abrams decides to run for governor again, the state\u2019s 2022 primary could see a showdown between two Democrats with very different ideas about how to win. And Ms. Abrams may learn then exactly how much bite Mr. Barrow has.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s Polarizing Visions", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "FeatureThe Greek director has drawn acclaim \u2014 but also intense backlash \u2014 for his primal depiction of contemporary life.Supported by\u201cIt made me wonder if I might want to have a place of my own like that someday,\u201d he told me over breakfast the morning after his latest film, the English-language period drama \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d opened this year\u2019s New York Film Festival. \u201cSomeplace to create and be alone. An island where writers could come to work on scripts and my editor could come to finish our projects.\u201d If you had a place like that, I pointed out, people might want to visit it someday too. They might want to touch the director\u2019s belongings, take photographs of the director\u2019s notes, go on a Lanthimos Safari. The thought made him visibly uncomfortable. \u201cProbably safer not to have anyplace, actually,\u201d he said with a slight shrug.A boatload of cinephile tourists, a remote and isolated location and the looming presence of an unseen authority \u2014 the combination is odd and unsettling enough to form the premise for one of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s own films. Famously cryptic and publicity-shy, Lanthimos is known for creating darkly surreal and uneasily hilarious cinematic worlds that reflect our own back to us in a distorted light. \u201cDogtooth\u201d (2009), made in Greece on a shoestring budget and subsequently nominated for a best foreign-language film Oscar, depicts life on an isolated family estate, where three adult children live under the cultlike control of their parents, who teach them that the airplanes passing overhead are actually tiny plastic toys and that no child is old enough to leave home until their upper incisor (or \u201cdogtooth\u201d) falls out on its own. Desperate to escape, the eldest daughter knocks her own tooth out with a dumbbell in their brightly lit bourgeois bathroom. In his first English-language film, \u201cThe Lobster\u201d (2015), a man whose marriage has recently ended is sent to a countryside hotel, where he must find a new partner within 45 days or be transformed into the animal of his choosing. When the man breaks free to join a ragtag resistance movement in the forest surrounding the hotel, he discovers that this new community\u2019s rules are different but no less draconian: He can live among them for as long as he likes, but any romantic or sexual activity is subject to grisly punishment. In \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d his new film, two women vie for the affections of an impressionable, mercurial Queen Anne, well aware that losing her favor would put an end to their ambitions of power, status, even survival. Each of his films foreground the claustrophobia of the civilized and an almost primordial struggle to survive within its confines.Ingmar Bergman might well have recognized the deep curiosity that drives these films: Like Bergman, Lanthimos is fascinated by the drive for control \u2014 in both its mundanities and extremes \u2014 and by the inscrutability of human behavior. But if Bergman\u2019s work elevates these struggles to the realm of the metaphysical, Lanthimos\u2019s approach is less lofty, ballasted by blood and grit. An ordinary toaster becomes a device for punishment; a woman is ferried to an ophthalmologist\u2019s office in order to be blinded for her transgressions against the community. \u201cAll our stories begin with observations, situations that already \u2014 according to us \u2014 exist,\u201d Efthimis Filippou, a Greek playwright and co-writer on four Lanthimos films, told me by email. \u201cWe take these situations and we exaggerate them, we make them bigger in order to describe more easily the core of our initial thought. The funny thing is that no matter how much we try to exaggerate things, real life is always far more excessive.\u201d From this contradiction emerges the compelling argument that something stranger, wilder and older than we know animates the norms we take for granted.This argument isn\u2019t always persuasive for viewers, who can find the purposeful alienation and oddness of his films off-putting. On Amazon, audience ratings for his titles average around two and a half stars, an uneasy compromise between heaps of one-star and five-star ratings. Some complain about the difficulty of connecting with his characters, the bleakness of his material and the lack of clear resolutions to his plots and emotions. One review of \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\u201d begins: \u201cThese people could not have seemed more foreign, more abnormal \u2014 nor more repellent \u2014 to me had they had three heads with entrails for hair.\u201d His films often fare better with professional critics, who regularly apply words like \u201cingenious\u201d and \u201cmasterpiece\u201d to his work and praise his deadpan wit. But Lanthimos detests the word \u201cdeadpan,\u201d which appears in almost every review of his work. \u201cWhat does it even mean?\u201d he asked me. \u201cAnytime people see an emotion that is not extremely emotional, they call it \u2018deadpan.\u2019\u2009\u201d He sounded a bit affronted as he said this. \u201cMost acting is very melodramatic,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you see in people.\u201dUntil 2011, Lanthimos had lived in Athens his entire life, raised by his mother, who died when he was 17, thrusting him into a new world to fend for himself. Though he already had a thirst for cinema and knew that he wanted to make films, he studied marketing and finance before dropping out of the university to go to film school. It was there that he found his way to others who were \u201ccrazy enough to be convinced to make a film in Greece.\u201d There was no real infrastructure for making films, he explained, only a bit of funding from the Greek Film Center that went to established directors. There were few models to look up to and few to hold a young filmmaker back.He made good money filming television commercials in the years before the financial crisis and put his time toward creative work \u2014 directing dance and theater performances and making films of his own, calling on friends to borrow their cars, their houses, their clothes. Creative partnerships formed by chance: He met his longtime collaborator Filippou in the halls of an advertising agency and it was during rehearsals for the director Athina Tsangari\u2019s second feature, \u201cAttenberg\u201d \u2014 a film that he co-produced and acted in \u2014 that he met Ariane, whom he would go on to marry and direct in two of his movies. \u201cThere are things to love about filmmaking in Greece,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople are generous: If you get along well with others, the people around you will give more than they might otherwise be willing to give, more than they\u2019re supposed to.\u201dMoving to England on the back of the success of \u201cDogtooth\u201d gave Lanthimos access to bigger budgets and internationally known stars like Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz \u2014 but in many ways, he has shaped his English-language productions to suit the spontaneous practices he developed in Greece, rather than remodeling himself to Hollywood\u2019s specifications. He likes to shoot with natural light, inviting the contingency of unplanned weather to enter his scenes, and he rarely makes use of the expensive cinematic lighting that productions order by default. \u201cI do walk outside and see the lighting people, the equipment just sitting around,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste of their time, of the film\u2019s money.\u201d He steers clear of movie makeup, preferring to let the \u201creal face\u201d of his actors show through, unadulterated, the hair unfussy and requiring little touch-up work. One consequence of these decisions is that his sets are unusually quiet and intimate, and without setting up lights or pausing to reapply makeup, he explains, they are able to get much more of the actual work done. \u201cWe can do the scene over and over again, immediately, nobody has to stand around waiting. And the actors love it.\u201dThe atmosphere he creates has more in common with an experimental theater troupe than a typical multimillion-dollar movie set. Lanthimos works to bring an actor\u2019s instincts to the surface \u2014 and he shrugs off questions about a character\u2019s psychological motivation, back story and context as effortlessly as he does questions about himself. \u201cIf you want to [expletive] annoy him, ask him character back-story questions,\u201d Colin Farrell told me, laughing, of his first experience working with Lanthimos on the set of \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d where Lanthimos refused to tell him what happened in the scene before the one they were filming. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really feel the need, you know. For him a story is born and dies between the first and last page.\u201d Lanthimos is \u201ctrying to give space to mystery,\u201d Ariane Labed, his wife, told me. \u201cYorgos does not explain things, even to the actors really, and they\u2019re not used to that. But then they go through this experience, and they discover that having gaps in their characters\u2019 journeys, they actually have more room for their own imaginations, [their] own mistakes, [their] own doubts, and I think that\u2019s why actors are amazing in Yorgos\u2019s films. They\u2019re on the line.\u201dFor \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d Lanthimos gathered the central cast together for three weeks of rehearsal, where they delivered their lines while trying to tie themselves in knots, jumping from carpet tile to carpet tile, or writhing around on the floor. \u201cHe had us do all sorts of things that keep you from thinking about what your lines mean,\u201d Olivia Colman, who plays Queen Anne, told me. \u201cIt was completely unique.\u201d These gamelike exercises were also ways of forcing an actor\u2019s reflexes to the surface, submerging that part of the mind that analyzes and questions, or turns away from the moment and toward a script or director for answers. \u201cThe best way to describe it is, it becomes completely unconscious ... completely instinctual,\u201d explains Rachel Weisz, who first worked with Lanthimos in \u201cThe Lobster\u201d and appears in \u201cThe Favourite\u201d as Sarah Churchill, the queen\u2019s confidante and lover. \u201cIf you asked me afterward what had just happened, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you. And in fact, the experience of watching the two films, the ones I\u2019ve been in, are unlike other films in that I\u2019m completely surprised by what I did. Usually when you film you have a sense of what you\u2019ve done, but with Yorgos you have no sense. If that makes sense.\u201dLike the stories themselves, which thrust characters, existentially underprepared, into disorienting situations, Lanthimos\u2019s direction forces actors to inhabit their roles with convincing immediacy, giving them an authentic vulnerability. It reflects the broader connection between his films and theater, a temporary structure assembled by bodies that are clumsily, complicatedly occupying space. In a scene from last year\u2019s \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer,\u201d Lanthimos\u2019s take on a horror film, the wife (played by Nicole Kidman) feigns unconsciousness in their bedroom at her surgeon husband\u2019s request; she rolls over, limp and lifeless, her head hanging off the edge of the bed as he caresses her. As he pulls her body ungracefully toward him, her hair dragging across the comforter, her foot catches on a pillow and it falls over, a piece of reality quietly disheveling the fantasy. Auteurs like Luca Guadagnino or Paolo Sorrentino, with their swooping, reeling shots and kinetic dance sequences, may get more credit for capturing bodily experience on film, but Lanthimos arguably shows greater fidelity to our actual bodies, stubborn and awkwardly choreographed by fate, etiquette and overarching structures of power \u2014 not glamorous bodies but bodies of ungainly yearning.\u201cThe Favourite\u201d is a first for Lanthimos \u2014 as a foray into period drama, as the director of a script that he did not originate himself \u2014 and it marks a true shift in his emotional palette. Rather than keep the viewer at arm\u2019s length, this new film works to draw you into the palace intrigue. You root for Abigail, the newcomer and underdog, as she tries to secure her livelihood, and then you root for Sarah just as strongly as she struggles to maintain her position by banishing her competition from the court. But as the hierarchy churns, the effort to get on top and stay there starts feeling less like rowdy fun and more like a form of imprisonment, implicating the viewer as well in its casual cruelty: Why do we as observers choose favorites, when this partiality so clearly limits our ability to see the whole? The ending, when it arrives, is inevitable yet unexpected. It is quietly, inscrutably heartbreaking \u2014 one of the only moments in a Lanthimos film that is not funny, not at all.\u2029\u201cThey\u2019re not so helpless in this film as in my others,\u201d Lanthimos told me breezily as we left the restaurant. \u201cBut they\u2019re still trapped.\u201dHe was heading back home after our lunch, to work out issues with the version of \u201cThe Favourite\u201d that will be shown on airplanes \u2014 they wanted to censor every other thing, even blurring the naked bodies of the cherubs in the palace art. But whether he felt that he owed me more time in lieu of self-explanation, or because he was in the mood to talk, he went out of his way to walk with me to my next appointment. He led us away from the high streets and down narrower residential rows where the hedges are a thick, towering green, trimmed into forcefully geometric shapes. He pointed out the bramble taking back the edge of an ad hoc park and the local town hall where he and Ariane were married. In these quiet slivers of street, London no longer feels modern: It\u2019s a pileup of the old and the new and the very old, the ground beneath our feet named by Saxon villagers. I could tell that I was being led though a terrain that was deeply personal, emotional, meaningful, but without an explanation of what I was seeing, I had to reconstruct the links myself. It\u2019s a kind of closeness at a distance, the same feeling I experience when I watch one of his films. When I mentioned that he seemed at home here, in his element among the mixture of old and new, the council flats facing meticulously preserved historical buildings, he seemed pleased, as if I\u2019d noticed something so important to him that he didn\u2019t mind allowing a stranger a glimpse. He thought for a moment, and then he replied with a slight smile: \u201cAt home, yes. But not so at home that it\u2019s become boring.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Lanthimos\u2019s relationship with the ad agency where he met Efthimis Filippou, a playwright and co-writer on four of Lanthimos\u2019s films. Lanthimos did not work for the agency.Alexandra Kleeman is a writer based on Staten Island, a professor at the New School and the author of the novel \u201cYou Too Can Have a Body Like Mine,\u201d as well as the story collection \u201cIntimations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They moved to Calcutta in 1878, where word spread of Rama\u2019s mastery of the Hindu holy books. Sanskrit scholars at the University of Calcutta gave her the titles Pandita (scholar) and Saraswati (for the goddess of learning), and she became involved in social reform and education circles in Bengal. Bai was added to her first name as a term of respect.After her brother\u2019s death in 1880, she married Bipin Behari Medhavi, a lawyer who was of a lower caste.Rama was only 23 when Medhavi died of an illness, leaving her alone with their 1-year-old daughter, Manorama. She moved to Poona (now Pune), in western India, and formed the Arya Women\u2019s Association to promote education and empowerment.She left for England with her daughter in 1883 to study medicine but was told she could not become a doctor because of her increasing deafness. Instead she enrolled in a teaching program at the Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 College and taught Marathi and Sanskrit.\u201cThe chief means of happiness is complete independence,\u201d Ramabai urged in her writings, and the means for that is education, which she called \u201cindestructible wealth.\u201dShe identified with Native Americans and African Americans. In a letter to her daughter, she described meeting the escaped slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman and urged Manorama to be \u201cas helpful to her own dear countrywomen as Harriet was and is to her own people.\u201dManorama worked as Ramabai\u2019s partner, helping run the schools and mission. But her health was poor, possibly from overwork, and she died at the age of 40. Ramabai died soon after, on April 5, 1922. She was 63.Ramabai\u2019s critique of the Hindu patriarchy and embrace of Christianity extracted a heavy price, according to her biographers: It led to her marginalization in India and her ultimate omission from mainstream history books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fugitive Financier\u2019s Charm Offensive Has P.R. Firms Proceeding With Caution", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA flamboyant Malaysian financier who once hosted Hollywood parties and lavished gifts on models is on a new kind of charm offensive.The owner of one public relations firm hired by Mr. Low\u2019s legal team, James Haggerty, said in one filing that he believed all of his work fell within the litigation exemption to FARA. But Mr. Haggerty, who is also a lawyer, wrote that he registered anyway, \u201cgiven the ambiguity in the law and differing interpretations.\u201dIn court filings over the past two years, federal authorities have portrayed Mr. Low as the mastermind of a scheme to loot the fund, which was meant to finance business ventures and other projects to benefit the country\u2019s 32 million people.Instead, federal authorities have said, the missing money financed the lavish lifestyles of people close to the prime minister of Malaysia at the time. Investigators said the money was used to buy luxury apartments in Manhattan, help finance the movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and buy a pink diamond necklace for the ousted Malaysian leader\u2019s wife.Mr. Low\u2019s location is unknown, but he has maintained he is innocent \u2014 including on the website established on his behalf last month. The site describes him as a \u201cglobal philanthropist, investor and entrepreneur\u201d who \u201cbelieves he will be vindicated once all the relevant evidence has been presented in a fair and legitimate court of law.\u201dPutting up a website to declare one\u2019s innocence and hiring public relations firms have become a common strategy by criminal defendants in recent years. But it is unusual for a legal team to disclose details of related payments.The payments, made to three public relations firms and a digital search firm, were disclosed in FARA filings by the two law firms involved in Mr. Low\u2019s defense, Kobre & Kim and Schillings International. The lawyers said the money did not come directly from Mr. Low, though they did not provide specifics about its source.FARA requires most consultants who lobby or assist with public relations in the United States for foreign individuals, companies, governments and political parties to reveal detailed information about their work and payments for it. It is intended to prevent foreigners from surreptitiously influencing American politics and public policy, and has been employed as part of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he examines Russian efforts to interfere in American politics, and ties between President Trump\u2019s team and Russia.Kobre & Kim has also paid two other public relations companies, the PHA Group in London, and in New York, Marathon Strategies, which was founded by the longtime Democratic campaign operative Phil Singer after he helped run the communications team for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential primary campaign.A digital search and analytics firm called Five Blocks, based in New York, has so far been paid $210,000 to provide \u201cdigital reputation management\u201d for Mr. Low, one filing said. On its site, Five Blocks describes itself as serving \u201chigh-profile individuals who want to build, promote and defend their reputations.\u201dNeither law firm disclosed how much it has earned from providing traditional legal services to Mr. Low since the investigation began roughly three years ago. The act does not require the disclosure of payments for legal fees. But the FARA filings by Mr. Low\u2019s team reveal the multiple hats that big law firms sometimes wear when they are representing prominent clients.\u201cLawyers can and should do what they can on behalf of their clients including managing public relations,\u201d said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School and a former prosecutor who specializes in legal ethics. \u201cBut lawyers do have certain ethical obligations that may not be the same as lobbyists,\u201d such as honesty about the identities and intentions of their clients.Mr. Haggerty, who is serving as the main spokesman for the legal team, said there was nothing wrong with a person under investigation taking aggressive steps to clear his name.\u201cI reject the notion that only large, multinational banks and sovereign wealth funds are allowed a defense, either in court or in the public arena,\u201d Mr. Haggerty said in an emailed statement.Messages seeking comment from the law firms or the other companies they have hired were not returned.Mr. Low was charged along with a former Goldman Sachs banker, Roger Ng, whom federal authorities are trying to extradite from Malaysia. Prosecutors also unsealed a guilty plea from another former Goldman banker, Tim Leissner, who was Mr. Ng\u2019s supervisor and had forged a close relationship with Mr. Low over the past decade. The authorities said another top banker at Goldman was an uncharged co-conspirator in the scheme.In pleading guilty, Mr. Leissner told a federal judge that his decision to hide his dealings with Mr. Low and the bribery scheme from Goldman\u2019s compliance and legal department was \u201cvery much in line\u201d with the culture at the firm.Goldman helped 1MDB sell more than $6 billion in bonds, generating over $600 million in fees for the bank during a time it was still recovering from the financial crisis. The bank has said it was cooperating with the investigation and acknowledged this month that it could pay \u201csignificant fines\u201d in any settlement related to the fund. Malaysia\u2019s finance minister said on Monday that the country was seeking a full refund of what it paid the bank \u2014 a statement that helped send Goldman shares down 7.5 percent on Monday.A lawyer for Mr. Leissner declined to comment. A lawyer in Malaysia for Mr. Ng did not respond to a request for comment.The FARA filings list Mr. Low as living in Malaysia. But he has not been seen in that country for many months and is believed to be living in China, according to three people with knowledge of the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly. Earlier this year, Malaysian authorities charged him with multiple counts of money laundering.The most recent statement posted on Mr. Low\u2019s site, dated Nov. 1, says, \u201cMr. Low simply asks that the public keep an open mind regarding this case until all of the evidence comes to light, which he believes will vindicate him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tale of Two Washingtons Awaits Wall Street Banks", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Big banks are about to experience a tale of two Washingtons.On Friday, a top Federal Reserve official said regulators were preparing to soften some rules imposed on the biggest banks after the financial crisis, including making it easier for them to pass annual tests that gauge their ability to withstand a severe economic downturn.Randal Quarles, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman for supervision, said the Fed wants to make rules more efficient and less burdensome for banks and said he wants to end the \u201cpublic shaming\u201d of banks that had developed around the Fed\u2019s annual stress tests.\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is recalibrating in light of experience,\u201d he said during a speech at the Brookings Institution.Yet House Democrats are preparing to step up scrutiny of big banks when they assume power next year, in hopes of slowing the turn toward deregulation initiated during President Trump\u2019s first two years in office.\u201cWe have oversight of the big banks,\u201d Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, who is expected to become the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview. She said she wanted to make sure \u201cour banks are providing the services we are expecting them to provide.\u201dThe Trump administration has argued regulation is impeding lending, but the new Fed report said overall loan growth \u201cremains robust,\u201d up by about 30 percent since 2013 despite the continued weakness of residential real estate lending.Ms. Waters said she was more concerned about the laxity of regulation in some areas than bank lending. A vocal critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, Ms. Waters will soon be armed with subpoena power and oversight authority of financial institutions and federal regulators.\u201cWe are concerned about Wells Fargo,\u201d said Ms. Waters, who is planning to meet with the bank\u2019s executives and could call them to testify at a hearing.\u201cWe\u2019ll work on trying to find out more about the relationship with Deutsche Bank, with him and his family and money laundering,\u201d Ms. Waters said, referring to Mr. Trump.She insisted that, in exercising oversight authority, she is not engaging in retaliation for being disparaged as \u201clow I.Q.\u201d by the president.\u201cIt has nothing to do with what he said about me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s meaningless.\u201dMs. Waters said she hopes to find common ground with Republicans, including on an overhaul of federal flood insurance. But her priorities, for the most part, stand in stark contrast to those of her predecessor, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, who spent the past two years pushing to water down the new rules created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law and to neuter the consumer finance watchdog set up by the Obama administration.Under Ms. Waters, the committee \u2014 which has oversight of the Fed as well as the banking industry \u2014 is likely to scrutinize the Fed\u2019s plans to soften regulations.But the Fed has considerable latitude to move ahead with those plans under existing law, and there is little prospect that House Democrats could pass legislation to strengthen regulation because the Senate and White House remain under Republican control.Mr. Quarles emphasized that the Fed is committed to the overall model of postcrisis financial regulation.\u201cI really don\u2019t view the regulatory proposals that we have put forward, those that we are thinking about, those that I talked about today, as relaxation,\u201d he said.Instead, he emphasized that the Fed has an obligation to make regulation as efficient as possible.He also proposed changes to the Fed\u2019s annual \u201cstress tests,\u201d which assess the ability of the largest banks to survive a simulated financial crisis.Mr. Quarles said the Fed wants to help banks meet its requirements, for example, by publishing information about the tests and inviting public comment on the risks that should be included.H. Rodgin Cohen, a prominent Wall Street lawyer, said the Fed\u2019s willingness to work with the industry would ultimately be beneficial for overall financial stability. \u201cI don\u2019t think regulatory dialogue translates into capture,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, a senior chairman at Sullivan & Cromwell. \u201cIt really does mean \u2018listen.\u2019\u201dOthers, however, worry the changes amount to less regulation.Mr. Quarles, asked about that critique on Friday, offered his own metaphor. He said the Fed was proposing to give banks a textbook, not the test itself. He has previously compared the Fed\u2019s plans to speed-limit signs.While playing down the possibility that banks could cheat, Mr. Quarles said he was worried that increased transparency would focus banks on the Fed\u2019s view of potential risks, rather than developing their own assessments based on the risks they are undertaking.\u201cThere\u2019s an almost irresistible incentive that that\u2019s what banks will do,\u201d he said, \u201cand their own thinking about their internal risks will erode to some extent.\u201dMr. Quarles also called for an end to the Fed\u2019s current practice of publicly identifying banks that struggle to pass the so-called stress tests, describing it as \u201cpublic shaming,\u201d and saying he would prefer to let regulators address such shortcomings privately.\u201cQuarles is for transparency when it serves financial institutions and not when it serves the public,\u201d said Gregg Gelzinis, a research assistant at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.The Fed is also moving to simplify, and in some respects to weaken, the capital requirements limiting the reliance of banks on borrowed money.The rules require banks to obtain a minimum portion of their funding from equity investors, in the form of capital. That funding provides a buffer against potential losses because it does not need to be repaid.In April, the Fed proposed a set of changes in the calculation of capital requirements that it said would replace 24 rules with 14.Mr. Quarles said Friday that the Fed was delaying those changes until 2020, as it seeks to address technical issues raised by banks.Peter Eavis contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Journalist\u2019s Expulsion Casts Shadow on Hong Kong\u2019s Future", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Hong Kong decided in late July to invite an obscure political activist to speak at the elegant 19th-century building that is its home, there was a vague sense among its board that the move might upset some people.\u201cI would say it is the biggest mistake the Hong Kong government has ever made,\u201d said Fu Hualing, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, of the decision to expel Victor Mallet, the Asia news editor of The Financial Times. \u201cIt has a huge impact. I don\u2019t know whether it was intended or not, but it has been felt everywhere.\u201dThe controversy has also focused global attention on the cause of Hong Kong independence, which the authorities badly want to suppress, and on the divided allegiances of Hong Kong\u2019s leaders, who are supposed to serve the city and defend its special status but owe their jobs to the Communist government in Beijing.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, has dismissed as \u201cpure speculation\u201d what almost everyone in Hong Kong has concluded \u2014 that Mr. Mallet\u2019s forced departure was an act of retaliation signaling a new limit on political speech. Yet, she has offered no other explanation.\u201cI am responsible to the Hong Kong S.A.R. and the people,\u201d she said, referring to the city\u2019s status as a special administrative region. \u201cI am also accountable to the central people\u2019s government.\u201dMost people in Hong Kong had never heard of Mr. Chan or his Hong Kong National Party when the government proposed outlawing the group. \u201cThe only reason we initially thought of inviting this 28-year-old interior designer was actually that he was in the news,\u201d Florence de Changy, the French journalist who is the president of the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club, wrote in its magazine.With its restaurants, bar and meeting rooms, the club has been a fixture amid Hong Kong\u2019s skyscrapers since the colonial era. Though most members are now lawyers, bankers and other professionals, journalists run the organization and host events featuring speakers from a variety of backgrounds.Days after Mr. Chan\u2019s talk was announced, two officials from the Chinese Foreign Ministry visited the club and met with Mr. Mallet, who was acting as president because Ms. de Changy was out of town. They objected to the event and told him they wanted it canceled.In more than a dozen posts in the following days, he criticized the club\u2019s leaders and urged scrutiny of what he called a \u201cspecial deal\u201d that allowed the club to rent its building from the government at discounted rates.Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and former cabinet minister, said that was unlikely. But she acknowledged Mr. Leung \u201cmight feel he should have served on, and his career was truncated.\u201d Under such circumstances, she said, \u201cit\u2019s hard for him to refrain from commenting.\u201dMs. Ip added that most establishment politicians in Hong Kong shared Mr. Leung\u2019s view of the club\u2019s invitation. \u201cTaken together, that could have an impact on our government\u2019s decision,\u201d she said.But Ms. Lam publicly contradicted her predecessor by saying the club paid market rent. And while she criticized the decision to host Mr. Chan as \u201ccompletely unsuitable,\u201d she declined to endorse Mr. Leung\u2019s demand that the speech be canceled.On Aug. 14, with protesters outside the club, the event went ahead. \u201cThe nature of China is oppression,\u201d Mr. Chan declared.Then, in the first week of October, the government rejected a routine request to renew Mr. Mallet\u2019s work visa. The decision stirred fears because Hong Kong had never expelled a journalist before \u2014 and because the move came straight from Beijing\u2019s playbook.In recent years, local media outlets have come under some pressure to censor themselves, but foreign news organizations using Hong Kong as a regional hub \u2014 including The Financial Times, The New York Times and CNN \u2014 have largely been immune. Mr. Mallet\u2019s expulsion, however, could change that.\u201cThey have moved the goal posts,\u201d said Zoher Abdoolcarim, the former Asia editor for Time International.The decision has also cast a shadow over Hong Kong\u2019s future as a capital of international finance and commerce, with some in the business community saying privately that it could tip the balance for companies already being wooed to relocate to Singapore.None of the big banks and law firms in Hong Kong have spoken out about the expulsion. The silence can be attributed in part to hope that new pressure on foreign journalists will not affect foreign companies. But there is also reluctance to say anything that may put business in China at risk.\u201cWithout a free press, capital markets cannot properly function, and business and trade cannot be reliably conducted,\u201d she said.The Financial Times is appealing the visa decision. That could compel the government to provide an explanation, said Robert Tibbo, an immigration and human rights lawyer.He noted that President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines recently visited Hong Kong despite accusations that he has led a campaign of extrajudicial killings. \u201cAre they using the same considerations for Mr. Mallet?\u201d Mr. Tibbo asked.Xi Jinping, China\u2019s top leader, made his concerns about Hong Kong independence clear during a visit to the city last year, when he warned that challenging the authority of the central government was \u201cabsolutely impermissible.\u201dManagement of Hong Kong affairs is usually handled by another member of the Politburo, but Mr. Xi seems to have taken the lead in setting policy, as he has on most major issues in China.Tian Feilong, executive director of a research institute on Hong Kong policy in Beijing, said the territory must be more humble and accept that it is like other local governments in China.\u201cIn the \u2018new era\u2019 of China,\u201d he said, referring to one of Mr. Xi\u2019s slogans, \u201cHong Kong must follow the main strategy of China.\u201d He added, \u201cThis requires Hong Kong to change its original proud attitude.\u201dSupport for Hong Kong independence was largely unheard of a few years ago. Newspapers that backed or were controlled by Beijing were the first to use the phrase frequently, deploying it as an epithet to attack the pro-democracy opposition, said Ying-ho Kwong, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Hong Kong studying local politics.Students have been posting signs backing independence on university campuses, where polls show support is much higher.Last month, after Hong Kong Polytechnic University covered up a few pro-independence posters and stickers, three students staged a hunger strike and more than 2,000 others signed a statement of protest. Two days later, the university allowed students to regain control of the space where the posters were hung, known as the Democracy Wall.\u201cFreedom of expression is one of the things that has always separated Hong Kong from China,\u201d said Lam Wing-hang, 21, president of the student union and one of the hunger strikers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see Hong Kong become just another mainland city.\u201dJavier C.

{"Headline": "Grace Period for Student Loans Is Ending, and Bills Are Coming Due", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserNew college graduates may not have been counting the months that have passed since those heady commencement ceremonies. But if they borrowed to finance their education, a bill is coming due.Many student loans have a six-month grace period to give new graduates time to get a job and organize their lives before they must start repaying their loans. So for spring graduates, monthly billing statements typically begin arriving in November. (The grace period for one type of federal student loan, known as Perkins loans, is nine months, so those borrowers have a bit more time.)Now is a good time for borrowers to take stock of their loans, if they haven\u2019t already. \u201cThey need to make sure they know what they owe, and who their servicer is,\u201d said Abby Shafroth, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center.The federal website doesn\u2019t list private student loans, made by banks and lenders other than the federal government. If you don\u2019t have the original documents for private loans, call your college financial aid office for help, said Diane Cheng, research director at the Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group.Make sure, Ms. Cheng said, that your student loan servicers have your current address and contact information so you don\u2019t miss any bills. Students sometimes use their college emails on loan applications, she said, but those can expire after graduation.Federal borrowers can also use the Education Department\u2019s student loan estimator, which will help calculate their total monthly payments.If they don\u2019t choose another option, borrowers are automatically enrolled in the standard 10-year repayment plan.If this is too onerous for borrowers, they can request a temporary postponement of payments, or apply for longer-term help via alternative plans with lower monthly payments. Known as \u201cincome-driven\u201d repayment plans, in government lingo, the alternative plans factor in borrowers\u2019 income and expenses when setting monthly payments.The repayment plans have slightly different criteria, but all can significantly lower the borrower\u2019s monthly payments \u2014 in some cases to zero.\u201cThere should be no federal loan borrowers in default,\u201d said Natalia Abrams, executive director of Student Debt Crisis, a group that advocates for borrowers. The repayment options can be confusing, however, so borrowers may need to take some time for research.If you\u2019re having trouble making payments, Ms. Cheng said, don\u2019t ignore communications from your loan servicer. Even though it may feel awkward to talk about your situation, she said, it\u2019s better to discuss alternatives than risk a default.Here are some questions and answers about student loans:Should I refinance my federal loans with private loans with lower interest rates?Advocates for student borrowers urge caution about refinancing federal loans, which carry guaranteed consumer protections, like the right to postpone payments because of financial hardship and options for getting back on track if you default. Some private loans may offer initially lower interest rates, but they are often variable-rate loans, so payments can increase significantly when rates rise.What should I do about interest that has accumulated during the grace period?Consider paying it off in a lump sum if you can afford it, Mr. Sealy said. With many student loans, you don\u2019t have to make payments during the grace period, but interest still accrues. If you don\u2019t pay it off before formally entering repayment, that interest is added to your loan balance, meaning you\u2019ll end up paying interest on the interest, adding to your total debt.Can I reduce my interest rate with automatic loan payments?Yes. Signing up for automatic deduction of your loan payments can help you avoid late fees and can qualify you for a small reduction \u2014 0.25 percentage points \u2014 in your interest rate, saving a bit of money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voters Widely Support Public Schools. So Why Is It So Hard to Pay for Them?", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf it were going to happen any year, it should have been this one. After a wave of teacher walkouts fired up people on both sides of the party line, the time seemed ripe for big investments in public schools.In reality, the results for school funding after the midterm elections last week were mixed, and illustrate a paradox in how Americans view education.And in some states where education funding is among the lowest nationwide, voters approved ballot measures that will make it even harder to direct money to schools in the future.\u201cTaxes are just a very difficult conversation,\u201d said Amie Baca-Oehlert, president of the Colorado Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union. Coloradans, after seeing teachers walk out in April over school funding, rejected a ballot initiative last week to pay for schools by raising corporate taxes and personal income taxes on those earning over $150,000 a year.Those voters also elected a Democratic governor, Jared Polis, who supports sending more money to schools, and flipped control of the State Senate from red to blue. But legislators\u2019 hands will be tied when it comes to raising revenue: Colorado requires all tax increases be approved directly by voters.A perennial challenge for public school advocates, Ms. Baca-Oehlert said, was getting the political messaging right.\u201cThere is complexity to it. It\u2019s hard to talk about school funding in a 30-second political ad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was about a person-to-person conversation, talking to your friends and neighbors. And we have to continue to do that.\u201dMs. Baca-Oehlert added that with the failure of the tax measure, her union would push policymakers to support educators in other ways, perhaps through affordable housing or student loan forgiveness for teachers.In Arizona, another state where teachers walked out, voters rejected the expansion of a program that would allow tax dollars to pay for private school tuition, a win for traditional public schools. But they overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative that prohibits new state or local taxes on personal services, such as real estate sales and beauty treatments.The initiative torpedoed a potential source of school funding in a state with some of the lowest corporate and income taxes in the nation. Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, and his Democratic challenger, David Garcia, both opposed the measure.Crystal Markowsky is a parent of three public school students in Chandler, Ariz., outside Phoenix. A political independent, she protested alongside her children\u2019s teachers last spring, and ended up voting largely for Democrats this year, because, she said, she was concerned about education and women\u2019s issues.Ms. Markowsky said that she had opposed the tax ban, but only reluctantly, and that she generally supported lower taxes on services.Ultimately, the approval of the tax ban, she said, as well as the re-election of Mr. Ducey, who bested a candidate running as a progressive champion of teachers, demonstrated that Arizona remains fundamentally conservative, despite talk of a diversifying, more liberal electorate there.\u201cIt\u2019s a red state where we just want low taxes at the cost of anything,\u201d Ms. Markowsky said.Even voters in swing states like North Carolina and Florida balked at the prospect of raising taxes. North Carolina, another walkout state, approved a ballot measure to lower the income tax cap allowed by the State Constitution. Voters in Florida passed a measure to require a two-thirds majority of the State Legislature to pass new taxes and fees or raise existing ones. Similar laws in other states have made it difficult to direct money to schools.The teachers\u2019 movement was not without its wins last week. Voters did open their pocketbooks for local classrooms, if not for those statewide. In Miami; Toledo, Ohio; Charleston, W.Va.; and other cities, they raised or renewed municipal taxes to finance their own districts, demonstrating that the most popular school spending, unsurprisingly, happens closest to home.Leaders of teachers\u2019 unions also pointed to the success of Democratic candidates for governor in Wisconsin, Michigan, Kansas and New Mexico, all of whom emphasized investing in schools.But they acknowledged that a message of taxing the rich to pay for education had not yet hit home in states with conservative or libertarian leanings.\u201cThere was a sense that after the teacher strikes, we would have a wave of electoral victories in every single place in the nation,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of two national unions. Those expectations, she added, were never realistic given deep and persistent national divides.Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the National Education Association, the other national union, celebrated the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike ran campaigns unreservedly in favor of public education. It wasn\u2019t long ago when members of both parties were more likely to criticize public schools and teachers as ineffective.\u201cNow what we have is a whole bunch of folks who made promises\u201d to support schools, she said. \u201cSome of them were real promises, and some were big fat liars. What we\u2019re going to do is keep score.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russians Meddling in the Midterms? Here\u2019s the Data", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey haven\u2019t stopped trying to influence our elections. Indeed, they may be busier than ever.Mr. Morgan and Mr. Fox run a cybersecurity company.Since the 2016 United States presidential election, which Russian operatives influenced through a coordinated campaign of disinformation on social media, platforms like Twitter and Facebook have taken steps to address the problem. Thousands of \u201csock puppet\u201d personas with hundreds of thousands of followers have been taken down on Facebook, for example, and cannot easily be rebuilt. Twitter has reduced the risk that propaganda is spread through automated accounts, or bots.Such efforts may be helping. The consensus among researchers monitoring the 2018 midterm elections is that there has been less of the specific sort of interference the Russians engaged in two years ago, when they attempted to aggravate social tensions in the United States and foster distrust of our democratic institutions.But an analysis by Kris Shaffer, a senior analyst for our cybersecurity company, suggests that while these measures may have rendered some of the Russian tactics of 2016 less effective, they haven\u2019t fully stopped Russian influence operations. In many instances, they seem to have merely caused Russia to shift or develop new tactics.Indeed, our company is currently detecting more overall activity in real time from continuing Russian online influence operations targeting the midterm elections than has been disclosed by social media platforms or detected by researchers during the same period before the election in 2016.In the past month, our researchers have collected more than 26 million social media posts concerning the 2018 midterms. This data set includes a large portion of all relevant content on Twitter as well as a smaller targeted sample of all relevant content on Facebook.We have also identified more than 400 websites that our analysis indicates are likely to be Russian propaganda outlets aimed at American audiences. More than 100 of these websites we have confirmed as under the direction of the Russian government or we believe to be Russian with a very high degree of confidence.In the month of October alone, we tracked 110,000 social media posts that referenced a United States midterm candidate, topic or hashtag and contained a link to one of these websites. More than 10,000 of these posts contained a link to one of the websites we have either confirmed as Russian-directed or believe to be Russian with a very high degree of confidence.The top three websites linked to these social media posts are the site of RT, Russia\u2019s state-financed international cable network (5,275 links); The Duran, a right-wing news and opinion site (1,328 links); and Sputnik, a news and commentary site run by the Russian government (1,148 links).We have also identified 1,451 social media posts aimed specifically at midterm voters from social media accounts assessed with high confidence as belonging directly to Russian influence operations. These posts are largely focused on the geopolitics of the Middle East, the Saudi-assassinated journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh.Last month, the most-shared article of known Russian origin for the month on Twitter was an article from The Duran purporting to show how groups financed by the billionaire Democratic fund-raiser George Soros \u201cplotted with Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to eliminate conservative \u2018right wing propaganda.\u2019\u201dThe Russia-linked social media accounts were active during the Kavanaugh hearings, drawing attention to sexual and domestic abuse allegations against various 2018 Democratic candidates and potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. They have been amplifying anti-immigrant sentiment, including conspiracy theories about the caravan of migrants in Central America, and have promoted the idea that the mail-bomb campaign of the Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc Jr. was a Democratic plot.Because of the numerous changes since 2016 in social media platforms and propaganda-detection practices, a straight \u201capple to apples\u201d comparison of 2016 and the current election cycle is not possible. And no analysis of the social media landscape is ever complete because no one has access to all the data.But any significant detectable quantity of Americans who are unwittingly sharing Russian propaganda on their social networks is cause for concern. And based on activity that our analysis attributes to Russian government efforts, we estimate that at least hundreds of thousands, and perhaps even millions, of United States citizens have engaged with the content of Russian propaganda online. The consensus among academic researchers and Russia experts in the intelligence community is that Russia does not take a timeout from information battles. It considers itself to be in a constant state of information warfare. Its online influence operations are inexpensive and effective, and afford Russia an asymmetric advantage given the freedoms of expression afforded to Western democracies.We are heartened by the seriousness with which many social media platforms and government agencies are treating this situation. But while progress has been made since 2016, we must remain vigilant in the face of confirmed Russian efforts to undermine our democracy.Jonathon Morgan is the chief executive and Ryan Fox is the chief operating officer of New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company that monitors disinformation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rare Look at the Letters Between Two Art World Giants", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe artists Alexander Calder and Ellsworth Kelly maintained an intimate, lively correspondence that reveals affinities both personal and aesthetic.Among the many artworks on display, including Calder\u2019s \u201cRed Maze III\u201d (1954) and Kelly\u2019s \u201cRed White\u201d (1962), are notes that the two artists sent to one another and their families.

And now, they want to direct the nation\u2019s talent and tech acumen toward an even loftier end: building an innovation-driven economy, one that produces world-leading companies.Not long ago, Chinese tech firms were best known for copying Silicon Valley.GoogleBaiduYouTubeYoukuInstagramDouyinUberDidiBut the flow of inspiration now runs both ways. American social media executives look to Tencent and ByteDance for the latest tricks for keeping users glued to their phones.Tencent\u2019s WeChat app, an all-in-one hub for socializing, playing games, paying bills, booking train tickets and more, paved the way for the increasingly feature-stuffed chat apps made by Facebook and Apple. Facebook recently took a page from TikTok, a Chinese service that is a sensation among Western tweens, by releasing its own highly similar app for creating goofy short videos.If people in the West didn\u2019t see this coming, it was because they mistook China\u2019s authoritarianism for hostility toward technology.But in some ways Chinese tech firms are less fettered than American ones. Witness the backlash against Big Data in the United States, the calls to break up giants like Facebook and the anxiety about digital addiction. None of those are big problems for Chinese companies.In China, there is pretty much only one rule, and it is simple: Don\u2019t undermine the state.So titans like Weibo and Baidu heed censorship orders. Unwanted beliefs and ideologies are kept out.Beyond that, everything is fair game. Start-ups can achieve mammoth scale with astonishing speed; they can also crash brutally.

That has allowed internet champions like Alibaba and Tencent to sew themselves into these businesses with ease.With their mobile payment platforms, the two giants have built sprawling ecosystems in which vast amounts of commercial activity now take place. Little remains of daily life that has not been transformed. Shopping. Getting a loan. Renting a bike. Even going to the doctor.This level of clout hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by China\u2019s leaders. Never in the Communist era have private entities wielded such influence over people\u2019s lives.To keep tech in its place, the government is demanding stakes in companies and influence over management. Regulators have reprimanded online platforms for hosting content they deem distasteful \u2014 too raunchy, too flirty, too creepy or just too weird.That\u2019s why the best way for tech companies to thrive in China is to make themselves useful to the state. Nearly everyone in China uses WeChat, making the social network a great way for the authorities to police what people say and do. SenseTime, whose facial recognition technology powers those fun filters in video apps, also sells software to law enforcement.The risk for these companies is that the government demands more, sucking away resources that could be better spent chasing innovations or breaking into new markets.In China, says Lance Noble of the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, the government\u2019s support \u201ccan be a blessing and a curse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alan Greenspan\u2019s Ode to Creative Destruction", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.At age 92, Alan Greenspan remains a towering figure in American finance. He was the second-longest serving chairman of the Federal Reserve (after William McChesney Martin). Dubbed a \u201crock star\u201d by The Economist, Greenspan achieved an unprecedented level of celebrity for a Fed chairman as stocks soared to record levels in the 1990s, and then notoriety, as his legacy was undermined by the Great Recession that began in 2008, less than two years after he left office.Greenspan was appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1987 and reappointed by three successive presidents from both parties. That a lifelong champion of free markets and an early acolyte of the objectivist author and philosopher Ayn Rand could so successfully straddle the political spectrum for so long is a testament to the bipartisan free-market ideology that followed the end of the Cold War. At the time it all seemed like the ultimate triumph of democratic capitalism.Now, 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers provoked a global financial panic and led to what Greenspan refers to as \u201cthe great stagnation,\u201d the self-congratulation seems to have been premature. Both parties have largely repudiated Greenspan\u2019s precepts, with Republicans lurching toward protectionism and a nativist hostility for globalization and Democrats lurching toward something he would surely find equally repugnant: income redistribution, ever-expanding government entitlements and identity politics.Less a conventional history than an extended polemic, \u201cCapitalism in America: A History,\u201d by Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, a columnist and editor for The Economist, explores and ultimately celebrates the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s concept of \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d which the authors describe as a \u201cperennial gale\u201d that \u201cuproots businesses \u2014 and lives \u2014 but that, in the process, creates a more productive economy.\u201d While this approach risks oversimplifying centuries of American economic history, it provides a useful lens for analyzing America\u2019s current polarization and for understanding the centrifugal forces that have given rise to a President Trump, on the right, or a Bernie Sanders on the left.Other than a few paragraphs arguing the case that the Fed\u2019s easy money policy had little to no impact on the housing bubble that led to the Great Recession, \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d has almost nothing to say about Greenspan\u2019s own role in recent economic history, and he offers no defense of his tenure as Fed chairman.But that isn\u2019t his purpose here. \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d is Greenspan and Wooldridge\u2019s plea to re-embrace America\u2019s long-held capitalist traditions and entrepreneurial culture in order to rescue the country from its current \u201cfading dynamism.\u201dWhile \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d begins with the colonial era, when Americans were already enjoying \u201cthe world\u2019s fastest growth rate,\u201d Greenspan and Wooldridge hit their narrative stride and ideological sweet spot when they reach the late-19th-century \u201cAge of Giants,\u201d a name they prefer to the prevailing \u201cRobber Barons,\u201d who may have been rich but, as self-made men, were neither robbers nor hereditary barons.In the authors\u2019 approving view, men like the banker John Pierpont Morgan, the oil baron John D. Rockefeller and the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, all born within a few years of one another in the 1830s, were \u201cgiants of energy and ambition\u201d who \u201cexercised more power than anybody other than kings or generals had exercised before.\u201d These men (and they were all men) are \u201cheroes of creative destruction\u201d because they \u201chelped to produce a massive improvement in living standards for all.\u201dThat they also produced social and economic upheaval for many is a small price to pay, the authors contend. The rise of their great corporations, not to mention the industries they helped build and finance, from railroads to autos to retail chains like Sears, Roebuck, displaced millions of workers and small-business owners who were rendered obsolete. Cyrus McCormack\u2019s threshing machine displaced a quarter of the world\u2019s agricultural workers. \u201cPeople seldom achieve great things without being willing to ride roughshod over the opposition,\u201d the authors note.Not surprisingly, these \u201cgiants\u201d attracted popular hostility and resentment \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt called them \u201cmalefactors of great wealth.\u201d Their success and attendant wealth unleashed a populist backlash. Williams Jennings Bryan campaigned against Wall Street and its \u201ccross of gold.\u201d Congress passed the first antitrust laws. The first federal income tax paved the way to income redistribution.History\u2019s harsh judgment of the era (which culminated in the 1929 stock market crash and ensuing Great Depression) suggests why creative destruction has had trouble gaining much of a following. Like the Robber Barons, today\u2019s drivers of creative destruction, technology and internet entrepreneurs, \u201care seldom the easiest of heroes, nor the nicest,\u201d the authors note. \u201cThey will sacrifice anything, from their own peace of mind to the lives of those around them, to build a business empire and then protect that business empire from destruction.\u201d Such people are prone \u201cto what the Norwegians call Stormannsgalskap, or the \u2018madness of great men.\u2019\u201d Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, who merits several approving mentions, comes to mind. The disruptive forces they unleash generate \u201cunease: the fiercer the gale the greater the unease.\u201dAnd not all destruction, it should be said, is creative. In a nod to the exotic derivatives and mortgage-backed securities that led to the Great Recession (and went largely undetected by Greenspan\u2019s Fed), Greenspan and Wooldridge acknowledge that \u201ccreative destruction can sometimes be all destruction and no creation.\u201dThe popular reaction is typically a well-intentioned but misguided effort to preserve the status quo. \u201cPeople link arms to protect threatened jobs and save dying industries. They denounce capitalists for their ruthless greed. The result is stagnation: In trying to tame the creative destruction, for example by preserving jobs or keeping factories open, they end up killing it,\u201d the authors contend.In their view, America today is already well along that path to stagnation. \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d barely mentions Trump beyond condemning his \u201cdangerous\u201d trade policies and warning about the fiscal recklessness of his tax cuts. But the entire book is an indictment of Trump\u2019s stands on immigration and protectionism and his attempts to resurrect fading mining and industrial concerns \u2014 attempts that, as \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d shows repeatedly, are almost surely doomed.At the same time, Greenspan\u2019s admiration for the rugged individualists who populate the novels of Ayn Rand (who merits a nod in this history) and the frontier spirit that animated America\u2019s early development shows no sign of weakening as Greenspan has aged. He and Wooldridge lament that Americans are \u201closing the rugged pioneering spirit\u201d that once defined them and mock the \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d and \u201csafe spaces\u201d that now obsess academia.The authors quote Winston Churchill: \u201cWe have not journeyed across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.\u201d But now, they conclude, \u201csugar candy people are everywhere.\u201dTheir prescription for American renewal \u2014 reining in entitlements, instituting fiscal responsibility and limited government, deregulating, focusing on education and opportunity, and above all fostering a fierceness in the face of creative destruction \u2014 was Republican orthodoxy not so long ago. Before the Great Recession it was embraced by most Democrats as well, and more recently by President Bill Clinton, the recipient of glowing praise in these pages.No longer. \u201cCapitalism in America,\u201d in both its interpretation of economic history and its recipe for revival, is likely to offend the dominant Trump wing of the Republican Party and the resurgent left among Democrats. It\u2019s not clear who, if anyone, will pick up the Greenspan torch.America is now \u201ctrapped in an iron cage of its own making,\u201d the authors contend. But \u201cwe have shown that America has all the keys that it needs to open the cage. The great question is whether it has the political will to turn them.\u201dJames B.

{"Headline": "Succession at CBS Will Be Tougher Than It Looks", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe board faces a difficult task in finding a new chief executive. Richard Parsons, the former interim chairman, had discussed the job with HBO\u2019s Richard Plepler, according to two people. Mr. Plepler wasn\u2019t interested. At CBS, succession won\u2019t be swift.The industry backdrop is daunting, too. CBS, the most-watched network for the past decade, is still the king of prime time, but it presides over a dwindling empire. Audiences across television have eroded as tech platforms like YouTube, Instagram and Netflix attract more of their time. Mr. Plepler was not interested, and no formal offers were made, the people said. But the casual approach befits the style of Mr. Parsons, who is known for talking through an idea with a small group before broaching it more widely.His discussions with CBS became moot when Mr. Parsons left the board, but they reveal the early thinking on who could lead CBS \u2014 as well as the challenge of persuading a top-flight executive to take the job. In his departing statement, Mr. Parsons said, \u201cI trust CBS\u2019s distinguished board, now led by Strauss Zelnick, as well as CBS\u2019s strong management team led by Joe Ianniello, will continue to successfully guide this company into its very bright future.\u201dFive weeks into the new season, CBS is still the most-watched channel, with an average audience of 8.8 million in prime time. But total viewers fell 12 percent from last year, reflecting the broader downturn at all TV networks.(CBS reported Thursday that its third-quarter revenue rose 3 percent to $3.2 billion, helped by a 14 percent jump in advertising and a 15 percent rise in licensing fees.)Candidates will be evaluated in the context of the board\u2019s larger strategic plan for CBS, which could involve a deal with another company, the people said.Ms. Redstone, who controls CBS through her family business, National Amusements, has been agitating for a merger with Viacom, the cable company behind MTV and Nickelodeon, which she also controls.The thesis: A tie-up would protect both companies from the onslaught of tech since a larger entity would have more negotiating leverage when bargaining for licensing fees with cable and satellite providers, thus ensuring healthier profits.Leslie Moonves, who was ousted as chief executive in September, was wary of the deal, which led to one of the bitterest boardroom battles in recent memory.In May, CBS sued Ms. Redstone to sap her power through the issuance of a special stock dividend. The suit was eventually dissolved after accusations of sexual abuse against Mr. Moonves \u2014 revealed in two New Yorker articles \u2014 ended his celebrated run at CBS.But the legal battle did offer a window into Ms. Redstone\u2019s thinking, which was made clear in a May complaint against CBS brought via National Amusements, or N.A.I.:Ms. Redstone discussed N.A.I.\u2019s long-term plans for CBS, focusing on a two-step process starting with a merger with Viacom that would strengthen both entities, and continuing thereafter with a sale or merger of the stronger combined entity, with N.A.I. open to the possibility of relinquishing its voting control as part of that second transaction.The exit settlement with Mr. Moonves prevents Ms. Redstone from pursuing that merger for two years. But the CBS board can examine any possible transaction, including a deal with Viacom, independently of Ms. Redstone.If the board considers a merger, that will affect how it chooses a chief executive since the person could end up running both CBS and Viacom. Another strategy might include selling CBS to a bigger company, which would also be a factor in how the board considers candidates.The 61-year-old Mr. Zelnick \u2014 his new book, a health memoir, is titled \u201cBecoming Ageless\u201d \u2014 is sure to play an influential role in the discussion. The same might now be said about CBS. And his appointment of Mr. Nevins as head of programming solved a practical issue created by the absence of Mr. Moonves, who oversaw much of the network\u2019s programming himself.Mr. Moonves had delighted in working with many of the network\u2019s producers. He often had a direct hand in casting decisions, for example. As a result, over 30 people reported directly to Mr. Moonves, an unusually high number for the head of a publicly traded company with nearly 13,000 employees. That\u2019s a notable shift. Mr. Ianniello had figured widely in the legal battle CBS had waged against Ms. Redstone this year. The lawsuit revealed several private messages between him and Mr. Moonves in which Mr. Ianniello enthusiastically showed support for the now-ousted executive.But his rapprochement with Ms. Redstone began almost two months ago when CBS announced Mr. Ianniello\u2019s new role. She offered this simple statement at the time: \u201cWe are confident in Joe\u2019s ability to serve as acting C.E.O.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bribery Charges Urged Against Four Close to Netanyahu in Submarine Case", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Netanyahu was not a suspect in the naval-acquisition scandal, which has been called Case 3000, and in fact he was cleared months ago, though he was questioned. The police have recommended criminal bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges against Mr. Netanyahu in two other corruption investigations.The police said they had sufficient evidence to charge David Shimron, a second cousin of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s as well as his personal lawyer, with bribery and money laundering.Mr. Shimron, they said, had exploited his \u201cstatus and closeness to the prime minister\u201d to promote the submarine purchase on behalf of Michael Ganor, an Israeli agent working for ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, the shipyard that build the vessels. In exchange, Mr. Shimron was paid a \u201creward for success\u201d of nearly $75,000 for \u201copening doors\u201d and influencing officials in favor of the deal, the police said. Mr. Ganor turned state\u2019s witness in 2017.Also accused is David Sharan, who was chief of staff to Mr. Netanyahu from late 2014 to 2016. The police said Mr. Sharan received about $35,000 from Mr. Ganor from 2013, when Mr. Sharan was an aide to the minister of finance, until 2016, though the money was paid through other businessmen to conceal the connection.The police recommended indicting two others from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s inner circle: Avriel Bar-Yosef, a reserve brigadier general and former deputy head of the National Security Council, who was Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s nominee to be his national security adviser until the scandal broke; and Eliezer (Modi) Zandberg, who was Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s appointee as chairman of Keren Hayesod, an organization that leads fund-raising efforts for Israel in dozens of countries.Mr. Bar-Yosef is accused of helping Mr. Ganor get hired to represent ThyssenKrupp and then taking a cut of his fees. Mr. Zandberg is accused of using his influence to help Mr. Ganor with access to officials and inside information in exchange for payoffs of about $27,000.With elections expected early next year, it is unclear how the police recommendations in the submarine case will affect Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s standing. The growing list of people close to the Israeli leader who face possible criminal charges could be used against him by his challengers. But Mr. Netanyahu could point to the end of the police inquiry as proof that he personally had nothing to do with improprieties in the submarine acquisition, as he has maintained all along.\u201cIf he knew, he belongs in prison. If he didn\u2019t, he is not qualified to run a state,\u201d Mr. Barak wrote, adding: \u201cTreasonous, disgraceful and contemptible.\u201dThe police did recommend charges against Shay Brosh, a reserve brigadier general and former head of the elite naval commando unit Shayetet 13, and Maj. Gen. Eliezer Merom, the former commander of Israel\u2019s navy, who the police said had received about $160,000 in bribes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Needs Amazon as Much as Amazon Needs Us", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street has dominated New York\u2019s economy for too long. Amazon\u2019s HQ2 is a huge opportunity to diversify.Mr. Chakrabarti is an architect, author and professor at Columbia University.For decades, experts have called for the diversification of the New York City economy. In the wake of postwar deindustrialization, our reliance on Wall Street and the financial industry in general had by the 1990s left our city disproportionately vulnerable to swings in the financial markets. We have experienced significant downturns that today feel like distant memories but could certainly return. I know this from my own experience as director of planning for Manhattan after Sept. 11. In those heady dark days, few spoke about gentrification or the supposedly ominous specter of new companies entering New York City. To the contrary, many worried that no one would build so much as a Quonset hut in this city again. Darker still were the memories of my older colleagues in city government, who helped rescue us from the nose-dive of the late 1970s, when New York City lost hundreds of thousands of jobs and crime ravaged our most vulnerable neighborhoods.It is for these reasons that we should welcome Amazon, but with a few caveats: To become true New Yorkers, the people at Amazon must abide by our implicit social compact, which is that New York City strives to be a place of opportunity for all. Amazon, the city and the state must build an \u201cinfrastructure of opportunity\u201d that creates both physical and social mobility for all New Yorkers, and they must do so with fiscal responsibility. While opinions differ regarding the incentive package offered Amazon, a few things are clear: Amazon obtained incentives available to any forward-looking large company seeking to relocate here. Second, government officials involved are confident that the deal will yield between $12 billion and $27 billion of direct economic benefit, which is many multiples of the incentives offered; and third, the incentives are part of the city and state\u2019s established budget to lure companies here \u2014 not money that would otherwise go to subways and schools. Beyond these incentives, government investments should be focused on significant improvements to the physical mobility of western Queens, including a reimagined subway, streetcar, bus, bike, scooter and ferry network. The agreement does establish an Infrastructure Fund using targeted tax revenue, but the details, time frame and scope for the improvements are murky and should be clarified. Amazon must participate as well \u2014 let\u2019s press those logistics experts less about a helipad and more about how they hope to transport thousands of workers to one of the most congested parts of our city. First steps have been made, along with commitments to make Amazon\u2019s new waterfront home accessible to the public in accordance with the Long Island City waterfront design guidelines. More significant is the potential to create a new paradigm for social mobility. We lost this along with our manufacturing base and never regained it by relying on Wall Street. Unsung treasures like LaGuardia Community College, Queensbridge Houses and the public schools and cultural institutions of Queens shouldn\u2019t be thrown the crumbs of this project. Amazon is proposing to locate in the most ethnically diverse county in the United States and near the nation\u2019s largest public housing project \u2014 the company\u2019s work force and campus must reflect the diversity around them. The current agreement with Amazon, which calls for $15 million to fund work force development and three years of direct engagement with Queensbridge Houses, is a good first step. More should be done, including a longer-term goal of 50 percent of all employees drawn from the borough. This is an enormous opportunity for Amazon to differentiate itself from its competitors by proving that it can help bridge what has become a gaping American class divide. Amazon will continue to be criticized about the way it held this competition, even though New Yorkers have long advocated more business growth outside of Manhattan. (Queens has a population similar to Chicago\u2019s but nowhere near the economic output.) Amazon will be criticized for its impacts on small retailers, although it arguably hurts big-box stores far more than mom-and-pops, which sell through Amazon. It will be criticized for being one of the world\u2019s richest companies, by both the left and the right. This isn\u2019t about one company. It is about fulfilling our collective dream of New York as a city of opportunity for millions of strivers of all colors, genders and creeds. Our new socioeconomic ladder appears to be digital, and we should embrace it, if \u2014 and only if \u2014 its creators have the tenacity and temerity to embrace us.Vishaan Chakrabarti is an architect, author and professor at Columbia University.Advertisement"}

But only for Democrats.The number of Republican women in Congress next year will actually drop, even as the ranks of Democratic women swell to record heights. With a few races still undecided, the new Congress will have at least 105 Democratic women and 19 Republican women.But that is not all: From Congress to governor to state legislatures, many more Democratic women ran in this cycle than Republican women. And that means fewer Republican women on the bench, gathering experience and credentials to move up to the next level.As the incoming freshman class of the 116th Congress gathers in Washington this week for orientation, the only Republican woman attending was Carol Miller of West Virginia (she could be joined by a few others whose races are still too close to call).\u201cI know that we need to up our game on the Republican end,\u201d said Kelly Ayotte, the former Republican senator from New Hampshire who is on the board of Winning for Women, which was founded last year to encourage and finance Republican women to run for office.Ms. Ayotte cautioned that one election cycle \u2014 particularly a midterm election when the party out of power typically makes gains and many Republican women were reluctant to run in what looked like a Democratic year \u2014 should not be seen as a trend. But political scientists who track women in public office note a longstanding disparity between the number of Democratic and Republican women at the federal and statewide levels.\u201cThere\u2019s been a Republican woman problem for a while \u2014 it didn\u2019t start this year,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at the Center for American Women and Politics. \u201cBut it is illuminated by the fact that when you drop by one, two, three or four, you\u2019re getting down to such a small level of representation for women because you had no padding.\u201dThe percentage of seats held by womenin 2016 vs. 2018DEMOCRATS20%19%20%17%12%106%9%REPUBLICANS 3%6%StatelegislaturesHouseSenateGovernor0\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918The percentage of seats held by women in 2016 vs. 201820%19%20%17%12%106%9%REPUBLICANS3%6%StatelegislaturesHouseSenateGovernor0\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918The percentage of seats held by women in 2016 vs. 2018DEMOCRATS20%19%20%17%12%106%9%REPUBLICANS6%StatelegislaturesHouseSenateGovernor0\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918\u201916\u201918Sources: Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University; National Conference of State Legislatures | Notes: Data are for election results as of Nov. 14, compared with data after the 2016 elections. A governor\u2019s race and seven House races with female candidates have not yet been called. A Senate race with a female candidate has advanced to a runoff, but it has yet to be held. | By The New York TimesThat gap increased in preliminary results from this year\u2019s elections, to about 68 percent Democratic and 32 percent Republican, according to Katie Fischer Ziegler of the National Conference of State Legislatures.That discrepancy is striking because Republicans dominate the majority of statehouses. But that may have reduced opportunities for women to run, she said, because so many Republican incumbents are male and would have to be challenged in primaries.Elaine Bowers, a Kansas state senator who is president of the legislative conference\u2019s women\u2019s network, said she was first tapped to run by a retired male state senator in 2006, and then moved from the Kansas House to the Senate, where she is now the majority whip.\u201cWomen running for office isn\u2019t always their idea,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a shame. I said, \u2018Am I qualified to do this?\u2019 \u2014 and I was more than qualified to do it. How do we change that perception?\u201dWith fewer women as candidates and officeholders, Republicans risk further widening a gender gap already at historic levels, since many more women vote Democratic than Republican, said Mirya R. Holman, a political scientist at Tulane University.\u201cWe are approaching a Democratic Party that looks like the people that make up the party base,\u201d Professor Holman said. \u201cThe Republican voting base is increasingly white, older and male. And the Republican candidates who won this time are those things.\u201dThere is wide agreement on the causes, at all levels of government. Anger and shock at President Trump\u2019s election drove a record number of women on the left to run for office this cycle. Compared with years past, when women had to be actively recruited to run, many volunteered, including many without traditional political credentials. As Ms. Ayotte put it, dryly, \u201cWe now know that having prior political experience is not a prerequisite for getting elected to the highest political office in the land.\u201dNot only did new groups focused on reclaiming Congress for the midterms, such as Swing Left and Indivisible, spring up after 2016, women running for office could rely on a powerful network of established organizations, like Emily\u2019s List and Emerge America, dedicated to recruiting, training and funding Democratic candidates. Republicans have no comparably longstanding and well-endowed groups.\u201cOn the left, groups have recognized that women often have more hurdles to overcome on the road to political office,\u201d Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Republican pollster, said. \u201cDemocrats have, for decades, built infrastructure to support women candidates in overcoming those hurdles. Republicans have let the chips fall where they may.\u201dValue in Electing Women and other organizations dedicated to recruiting, training or funding Republican women to run for office, such as Maggie\u2019s List, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who led the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s efforts to recruit women for the House, declined a request for an interview.Whitney Smith, who ran for state and county office as a Republican in Ohio and owns a consulting firm that specializes in female candidates, said she has worked on more than 300 campaigns. \u201cI never, as a candidate or consultant, encountered a pipeline from the Republican Party to recruit women,\u201d she said.Ms. Ayotte and Ms. Anderson agree that Republicans need to match Democratic success in cultivating both major donors and grass-roots small donors. That is one reason Winning for Women is determined to build donor networks and has already signed up about 270,000 members in this cycle, said its executive director, Rebecca Schuller. Ms. Ayotte also wants to recruit women from a wider variety of backgrounds, including business, medicine and academics.Ms. Ayotte said that she has no doubt the Republican Party welcomes more women, and was always encouraging of her candidacy, but that it needs to be more aggressive. \u201cWe should look to be representative of our country,\u201d she said.Ms. Anderson argued that, in the end, fielding more women is a shrewd electoral strategy. \u201cRepublicans who do care about the issue are going to have to show that it matters for winning elections,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they will need to make the case that helping talented, highly qualified women get through primaries and into the general election is especially important for winning over more female swing voters.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Could Leave Wedding Bouquets Stuck at the Border", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom greenhouses in Kenya to auction houses in the Netherlands to florists in London, the shipment of flowers highlights Brexit\u2019s potential disruption to trade.Far removed from the political posturing and brinkmanship that capture most of the attention in Britain\u2019s long and tedious departure from the European Union, Yme Pasma is deeply enmeshed in the mother of all logistical problems.Inside hulking warehouses near Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol airport in the town of Aalsmeer, Royal FloraHolland operates a flower auction and a distribution center. A fleet of computer-guided forklifts whisks buckets of roses, boxes of amaryllis and other foliage \u2014 some grown in Holland, some flown in from Africa, Asia and Latin America \u2014 toward loading docks, to be placed on trucks and shipped to customers worldwide. The scent of flowers is pervasive, a weirdly anomalous whiff of perfume amid the clatter of machinery.Unless the two bickering parties in this messy divorce reach an agreement bringing about some less disruptive arrangement, goods traveling across the channel are likely to confront customs checks and sanitary inspections. Flowers now shipped duty-free may encounter tariffs.\u201cAt both sides, the governments are very willing to prepare, but still you need hundreds of people, and you need to train them, and you need warehouses to do the checks, and you have to build the computer systems,\u201d Mr. Pasma says. \u201cThere are going to be major traffic jams in the Netherlands. If it happens tomorrow, it\u2019s going to be a huge problem.\u201dWomen \u2014 overwhelmingly women \u2014 work in greenhouses near Lake Naivasha, northwest of Nairobi. They cut roses and place them into buckets that are trucked to the Nairobi airport, where jets ship them out to destinations across Europe and the Middle East. An increasing flow of these roses travels directly to Britain, bypassing the traditional hub in the Netherlands. Even then, Brexit still presents a significant variable. The European Union has a trade agreement with Kenya that enables imports of flowers free of tariffs. After Brexit, Britain will have to negotiate its own arrangement with Kenya and other exporters. Until a deal is struck, flowers sent from Kenya to Britain would stand to incur tariffs of nearly 7 percent, a potential shock for an industry that has become a major source of jobs in the East African nation.But most of the roses grown in Kenya and destined for Britain still travel toward customers on the traditional route that has dominated the flower industry for decades \u2014 through the Netherlands.Inside a glassed-in room above the warehouse floor, traders stare at banks of computers as they place bids on this rolling riot of flowers at the auction. Before making their orders, some of the traders walk down to the floor to inspect the goods, like gamblers eyeing the racehorses before the bugle. Behind the main auction floor, 13 so-called clocks \u2014 electronic displays of trading activity \u2014 track the offers and bids in online exchanges, the participants as far away as China, Russia and the United States.Mr. Pasma is exploring the possibility of separating the flow of flowers into different streams: those that land at Amsterdam and are destined for buyers within Europe, requiring no change to the current system; others that are bound for post-Brexit Britain, and might need to be set aside for new, as-yet-unspecified administrative procedures. He is hoping he can persuade European and British authorities to institute whatever checks would be required right here, preventing delays.\u201cYou have to get the product across the channel quickly,\u201d he says.It\u2019s a precision operation. Many flowers have been plucked from cargo jets that have landed within the hour. European customs agents clear the goods on the premises. Ditto, health authorities.Here is where Brexit provokes the most concern.The Dutch Flower Group imports some 350 million euros a year (about $400 million) into the United Kingdom, roughly half from the Netherlands. In recent months, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Harry Brockhoff, has met with British and European officials to urge them to maintain the status quo. If Britain hangs on to European rules, he argues, then flowers crossing the channel should require no additional checks. If it doesn\u2019t, the British government will need to rebuild the capacity it had before it entered what is now known as the European Union in 1973, resuming its own customs and so-called phytosanitary checks of the flowers. Both the British and European governments have signaled designs to streamline health and safety checks to head off post-Brexit problems.\u201cThere is no certainty, so we have to prepare for the worst,\u201d says Mr. Brockhoff. \u201cBut I am hopeful that everybody wants to come to a decent solution.\u201dWell before dawn, florists across southern England arrive to select their stock. So do designers who create floral arrangements for hotels and offices. So do wedding planners and funeral homes.These days, merchants at the market view the approach of the official Brexit date with a growing sense of concern.\u201cI\u2019m dreading that a little bit, that we will have aggravation getting our stuff in,\u201d says Dennis Edwards, owner of one wholesale outlet.He excuses himself to take a call from a florist \u2014 Prince Charles\u2019s florist, he notes \u2014 who is on the prowl for a special variety of gerbera known as pasta, because it is shaped something like fusilli. In pursuit, Mr. Edwards has been on the phone with his agent in the Netherlands, who is monitoring the auctions.At 69, Mr. Edwards is accustomed to this sort of clientele. He procured flowers for Princess Diana\u2019s funeral, and for the memorial ceremony inside St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral after the terrorists attacks of Sept. 11.From where he stands \u2014 in the midst of roses of every conceivable tint \u2014 Brexit amounts to a historical step backward.\u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember how it was before,\u201d he says, meaning when British customs would inspect shipments arriving at the English port of Dover from the Dutch shipping hub at Rotterdam.\u201cWe\u2019d be waiting for a consignment of orchids from Singapore and they\u2019d find one insect and condemn the whole lot,\u201d he says. He would find himself uttering expensive words to his customers: \u201cSorry we\u2019ve let you down.\u201dHe frets that Brexit could make these words commonplace again. \u201cIf someone\u2019s doing a hotel at 5 in the morning and the flowers don\u2019t get there until 8, it just messes everything up,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Dutch still want to serve us, and we still want to buy their product. But nobody knows what will happen. We\u2019re all just in the dark.\u201dThis is the fear of Mary Woolcot, who owns a flower shop in the London neighborhood of Kennington.She designs arrangements for weddings and corporate events. She makes early-morning trips to the New Covent Garden Market, where she buys flowers from Mr. Edwards, among other suppliers.The Brexit vote in June 2016 sent the British pound plummeting against the euro, making goods more expensive.

{"Headline": "How Michael Bloomberg Used His Money to Aid Democratic Victories in the House", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA week before the Nov. 6 election, Kendra Horn, a Democratic House candidate in Oklahoma, received unexpected good news from her television consultant: Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s political action committee, a leading supporter of Democratic candidates, had purchased more than $400,000 in advertising on Oklahoma City television.Still, Ms. Horn\u2019s campaign did not realize just how big a boost it was receiving. The ad was not just a general get-out-the-vote message supporting Democrats, as they had assumed. Instead it attacked her Republican opponent, the incumbent Steve Russell, on his education record.With just days to go before the election, and Ms. Horn fighting an uphill battle in a deeply conservative state, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s group had effectively doubled the television spending on her behalf, catching Mr. Russell flat-footed and unable to respond.Ms. Horn, who had trailed in both a local poll and in Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s internal polling, won by 3,338 votes.Big donors \u2014 like the Adelsons, the Uihleins and the Koch brothers on the Republican side, and Tom Steyer and George Soros on the Democratic side \u2014 have become integral and influential players in every election cycle. But in this year\u2019s midterm elections, Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, emerged as a powerful and effective force, as well as the biggest outside spender promoting Democratic House candidates, according to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission.Records filed so far show that organizations controlled and funded by Mr. Bloomberg spent more than $41 million on 24 House races, much of it on eye-catching ads rolled out on social media and broadcast on television in the crucial final days of the campaign.And while it\u2019s impossible to conclude that any one factor tipped the balance in a race, Mr. Bloomberg appears to have reaped the benefits of his millions in giving. Democrats won 21 of the 24 races he sought to influence. Of those, 12 had been considered either tossups or in Republican districts.\u201cThe mission was to flip the House. Success or failure would be defined by that,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg.Assessing the election outcome, Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, cited Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s spending as a significant factor. \u201cMichael Bloomberg\u2019s money went a long way. He defeated a lot of people by writing those $5 million checks,\u201d Mr. McCarthy told CNBC.Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, credited Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s operation for picking smart races.\u201cI don\u2019t think you could say they were the difference between the Democrats winning and losing the majority,\u201d Mr. Kondik said, \u201chowever I think you could say that Mr. Bloomberg and his late money may have made a difference in a few of the surprising results that helped pad the size of the Democratic majority.\u201d He pointed to Ms. Horn\u2019s campaign as an example.Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s organization in many ways mirrors the Senate and House majority PACs that raise and spend money to support individual candidates, focusing on close and winnable races. But his operation has advantages over most other political groups, including these big party-affiliated committees, that make it easier to more effectively deploy its money.Because his PACs are funded by his personal wealth, they don\u2019t rely solely on outside donors, they don\u2019t have to spend time raising money and they know exactly how much cash will be on hand at a given time, meaning they can time their spending \u2014 specifically ad purchases.When the final reports are filed next month, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s organization says they will show that the former mayor and his organizations spent $44 million on television ads and another $12 million on digital advertising in support of House candidates. Overall spending by Mr. Bloomberg and his organizations in the 2018 elections topped $112 million, an amount that also includes donations to help Senate candidates and progressive organizations.That puts him on the same level as Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, longtime Republican megadonors who had given $112 million to Republican \u201cSuper PACs\u201d as of Oct. 17.His political giving often aligns with issues like gun control and climate change that are the focus of his two PACs \u2014 Everytown for Gun Safety and Independence USA.In a recent interview at the New York headquarters of Bloomberg Philanthropies, Mr. Wolfson and other staff members described their House election strategy, which involved spending on digital advertising beginning in September and spending \u201cbig\u201d and \u201clate\u201d on television advertising. Records show that more than $30 million of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s spending on House races came after Oct. 22.\u201cI had a budget,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Wolfson said. \u201cIt was a big budget. I didn\u2019t have to raise it. I knew it was coming and that gave us real advantages in terms of spending late in these expensive markets. We were able to really come in and overwhelm at the last minute in some of these places.\u201dThe group identified target districts based on a theory that highly educated voters were more likely to vote Democratic, even if they had previously voted Republican. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s operation hired two companies that analyzed educational achievement in Republican congressional districts, Mr. Wolfson said.They identified districts previously ignored by national Democrats where there were opportunities to stretch the Democratic map.One of those was Oklahoma\u2019s 5th Congressional District, where an increasingly young and well-educated electorate had been lured by jobs and the urban conveniences of Oklahoma City, and where Ms. Horn was running.Ten days before the election, polling commissioned by Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s organization showed Ms. Horn trailing by five points. There had been little outside spending in the campaign. Advertising in the Oklahoma City market is relatively inexpensive.\u201cThe conditions seemed to suggest opportunity,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said.The ad released just days before the election called Mr. Russell \u201cpart of the mess\u201d that led to the low ranking of Oklahoma\u2019s schools \u2014 49th in the nation.Local media emphasized that the ad aired during halftime of the closely-watched University of Oklahoma football game. In fact, the Bloomberg team had blanketed local television. \u201cWe bought so many ads in such a short period of time, it was running at halftime, quarter time, three-quarter time and postgame,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said.Another avenue for Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s groups is digital advertising, which Mr. Wolfson compares to doing previews off Broadway. Digital ads are cheaper and carry metrics showing how many people clicked, how long they watched and how many people shared. Using those metrics, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s operation was able to identify successful digital ads that they could move to television.It was one of three California races in which Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s organization spent more than $10 million combined. The Democrats supported by Mr. Bloomberg won all three seats.Health care and taxes were major themes of the Bloomberg ads. In Illinois\u2019s 14th Congressional District, a suburban Chicago area, one Bloomberg-funded ad emphasized the Democratic challenger Lauren Underwood\u2019s record as a registered nurse who would fight for health care.A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll a month before the election showed Ms. Underwood trailing Mr. Hultgren; she won by 10,442 votes.In Houston, a media market saturated with political advertising, one ad stood out for its quirkiness. It featured a cartoonlike depiction of the Republican incumbent, Representative John Culberson, riding a spaceship.Mr. Culberson had pushed millions of dollars in funding for a NASA mission to find signs of life on Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa.The message dovetailed with criticism leveled by Mr. Culberson\u2019s Democratic opponent, Lizzie Fletcher, that he had failed to secure proper funding for Houston flood control, showing misplaced priorities.\u201cIt was definitely the most-talked-about ad in the Houston area,\u201d said Tony Essalih, a former aide to Mr. Culberson and now a principal with Cornerstone Government Affairs, a lobbying firm. \u201cIn terms of driving up his negatives, I think it had an impact.\u201dMs. Fletcher, who had trailed before the election in both the Bloomberg internal polling and the Times Upshot/Siena College poll, won by about 12,000 votes.Alex Burns contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

We all feel it. I feel it too. At Google, we set a very high bar, and we clearly didn\u2019t live up to our expectations.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cmoments like this show we didn\u2019t always do it right.\u201d He promised that \u201cthere are concrete steps coming up,\u201d but he hesitated to say that Google has a toxic culture.\u201cSexual harassment is a societal problem and Google is a large company,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are definitely doing our best.\u201dMr. Pichai\u2019s tenure atop Google has been marked with internal clashes and external finger-pointing.\u201cWe are a company that\u2019s about freedom of expression and information,\u201d Mr. Pichai said, adding that \u201cwe allow people to speak up\u201d but \u201calso have a code of conduct.\u201dMr. Pichai said on Thursday that Google, which is based in Northern California, has \u201clocal left-leaning employees and local right-leaning employees\u201d but stressed that the company has a global mindset. Besides, he said, personal political leanings are \u201cdifferent than how we build our products, and we are committed to doing it in a nonpartisan way.\u201d\u2014 Tiffany HsuHow many times does some tweet or policy action or statement by President Trump leave Peter Thiel, one of his most vocal supporters, in disbelief?Actually, he said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201dOn Thursday, he acknowledged that the current political environment is \u201cnot healthy\u201d but said that the country has been \u201cpolarised since the late 60s\u201d and that President Trump is \u201cnot the main cause.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated thing to get right,\u201d he said.\u201cI tend to think that the inaccuracies President Trump tells are basically exaggerations of the truth,\u201d Mr. Thiel said.\u2014 Tiffany HsuA month after relinquishing the role of chief executive officer at Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein was still defending the firm he now chairs.\u201cI would say that we\u2019re pretty compliant,\u201d he said late Thursday afternoon at the DealBook conference in Manhattan. He was responding to a question about federal criminal charges filed hours earlier against two former Goldman investment bankers over their role in helping to finance a Malaysian government fund from which about $4 billion went missing. \u201cBut here in this case, at the very least, and this part I know, one of our people lied to us and evaded our systems and our controls.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d he added.On Oct. 1, the longtime investment-banking chief David M. Solomon succeeded Mr. Blankfein as C.E.O. Mr. Blankfein, 64, has stayed on as senior chairman of the board through the end of this year. Beyond joking about the idea of unfettered tweeting, he has said little so far about his future plans.On Thursday afternoon, looking relaxed in a navy suit and blue tie, he reminisced about his more than twelve years running Goldman and addressed some of the c-suite mysteries that had enveloped his tenure. As to whether longtime firm president Gary D. Cohn could have ever succeeded him as C.E.O., he was equivocal.\u201cI think his leaving coincided with a new administration,\u201d said Mr. Blankfein, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t done him the favor of telling him when I was leaving at that point.\u201dAs to whether he would have done anything differently to help Goldman weather the financial crisis, he said more proactive public relations would have helped burnish the firm\u2019s image.\u201cOur mantra was our clients should have the exposure, not us. We\u2019re in the background,\u201d he said of the firm\u2019s approach to publicity in the pre-crisis years. \u201cThat hurt us a lot.\u201d\u2014 Kate KellyMaking a rare public appearanceThursday at the DealBook conference, the 47-year-old executive discussed the family\u2019s latest round of deal making and what it could mean for the family\u2019s other assets. In particular, he spoke about the newspaper business under News Corp, a roster that includes The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, as well as The Times and The Sun in Britain.The sale of Fox\u2019s film and TV studios to Disney prompted a question about whether his father would ever sell The Wall Street Journal, which Mr. Murdoch acquired in 2007 for over $5 billion.\u201cI never thought we\u2019d sell the TV studio, the film studio, so who knows?\u201d Lachlan responded. In the next breath, he said of his father, \u201cHe loves journalism. He loves The Wall Street Journal and what it represents.\u201dThe businesses that will remain under the control of the Murdochs after the close of the Disney deal early next year will center on news and sports. That means Lachlan will run Fox News, the Fox Broadcasting network and the FS1 cable sports network.Fox News, in particular, has come under heavy criticism for its close ties to the Trump administration. That has led to charges from critics that Fox News, and the larger Murdoch TV business, is actually a red state media organization.Lachlan disagreed. \u201cI think about it as an all-state media organization,\u201d he said, later adding that, \u201cwe program to everyone. It\u2019s to the coasts. But also everywhere in-between.\u201dHe cited figures that showed more Fox viewers are tuned to its sober news segments than the fiery opinion hours. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d he said.\u2014 Edmund LeePadma Lakshmi believes in redemption for men brought down amid the #MeToo movement.But that redemption should come from genuine remorse and understanding of the impact of one\u2019s actions, as Ms. Lakshmi said Thursday, and shouldn\u2019t be driven by a man\u2019s being good at a certain job.It was one of the lessons that Ms. Lakshmi and her fellow panelist, Lisa Borders, sought to impress on their audience. The women discussed how the #MeToo movement continued to revolutionize gender dynamics across the workplace, culture, in social circles and in sports and education. Both have become vocal leaders.The op-ed was published as two women came forward to detail accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and President Trump questioned why one of the women, Christine Blasey Ford, didn\u2019t report the incident when it happened more than 30 years ago.The conversation was wide-ranging as Ms. Borders and Ms. Lakshmi described the need for a cultural shift, not just in the workplace, but particularly in how men are socialized and boys are raised.\u201cWe need to stop equating aggression and masculinity because I think that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d Ms. Lakshmi said.Ms. Borders said there needed to be more transparency, particularly on the issue of salaries, so women would know if they were being underpaid. She said that companies should understand that policies and practices that empower women also help organizations as a whole.\u201cWe add value,\u201d Ms. Borders said.Both women said the ability to share stories through social media had helped strengthen the #MeToo movement and create a time of real social change. Ms. Borders said there was a recognition among what she called survivors of sexual abuse that their stories were not \u201cour burden to bear but society\u2019s burden to bear.\u201d\u201cAnd it lit fire,\u201d she said.Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, the maker of the disappearing-message app Snapchat, said broadcasting regulations offer a framework for how to think about the dangers of social media.\u201cIf you look historically at America, a place that\u2019s always celebrated things like free speech, we\u2019ve actually always thought about broadcasting really differently than how we thought about communication,\u201d he said.While Americans have long accepted most forms of speech, even the distasteful kind, they have been less tolerant when that speech is widely distributed, he said, noting that broadcasters are subject to regulations on what they can and can\u2019t say or show.\u201cI think we\u2019re in this weird moment in time where this behavior\u2019s been enabled technically and the regulatory framework actually hasn\u2019t caught up to that reality,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.When asked if he was suggesting that social media should be regulated, Mr. Spiegel said only that there was much to learn from how Americans have thought about the responsibility of broadcasters in the past. The challenge, though, is identifying what, exactly, broadcasting is, he said.\u201cWe understand what one-on-one communication is, but let\u2019s say your Uncle Joe, for example, has some very extreme, maybe not so accurate, views on the world and he wants to reach 500 people. Is that OK? If he wants to reach 50,000 people, is that OK? If he wants to reach 100,000, is that OK? Where do we draw the line in terms of where broadcasting is versus communication with friends?\u201dSome have argued that social media has enabled social change, but Mr. Spiegel said that view is overly simplistic.\u201cOne of the more dangerous things that I\u2019ve seen is this idea that just using your voice is going to make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of it, that\u2019s half of it, but the other half is really taking action to implement that change.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiTo address corporate America\u2019s diversity problem, Ken Frazier sees a lesson in his own past.The chief executive of Merck is one of only three black chief executives in the Fortune 500. But growing up as the son of a janitor in inner-city Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier faced an opportunity gap. Fortunately for him, a desegregation policy and a 90-minute daily bus ride that gave him time to read helped to overcome it.\u201cI look back at my own life and I realize that I was treated in an extraordinary way in this country,\u201d he said.As the nation increasingly self-segregates, Mr. Frazier said, the workplace is one of the few remaining places that offers that same opportunity for people of different backgrounds to interact \u2014 and business leaders, he says, have a responsibility to uphold that basic American value.That conviction led Mr. Frazier to step down last year from President Trump\u2019s manufacturing advisory council, the first of many executives to do so after the president equivocated in his response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\u201cFor me, it was a very clear personal decision as a matter of conscience,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cI happen to believe that political discourse, political speech, has consequences.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiMary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said that the company plans to roll out a ride-sharing service that would rely on autonomous vehicles in 2019, a development that would advance the already-heated race to bring self-driving cars to market.\u201cWe\u2019re on track, with our rate of learning, to be able to do that next year,\u201d Ms. Barra said, adding that the company had a strategy to show how its vehicles are safer than human drivers. The vehicles can currently run safely at speeds of up to about 30 miles per hour, and the service will be limited to a small geographical area, Ms. Barra said.She did not say where the service would operate, but noted that the company has been testing in San Francisco.Autonomous vehicles rely on what Ms. Barra described as \u201ca suite of sensors,\u201d including radar, cameras and a technology known as lidar. G.M. is focused on advancements to lidar, which will drive down costs and enable the vehicles to travel at higher speeds, she said.\u201cWe do believe in an all-electric future,\u201d she said.\u2014 Niraj ChokshiNancy Dubuc, the newly installed chief executive of Vice Media, announced at the conference today that the company will be profitable by \u201cthe next fiscal year.\u201d That would be an important milestone for a business that was most recently valued at $5.7 billion.\u201cIt actually was profitable a couple years ago, and then with all the expansion and investment, we made it not profitable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut very, very quickly it\u2019ll be profitable again.\u201dCost cutting will help. But Ms. Dubuc characterized the forthcoming changes as a way to become more efficient. \u201cWhen you have expansion everywhere, you\u2019re obviously going to have duplication everywhere too,\u201d she said.Vice started as a free punk magazine in Montreal in 1994 and has traded on its irreverent, brash tone to become a global media company with about 3,000 employees. Backed by media giants like the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, Vice now includes an advertising agency, a TV network, a film-production business and programs on HBO.Vice founder Shane Smith responded to the article by pledging a series of changes, including pay equity and reaching gender parity within the work force. In a statement, he said, \u201cfrom the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.\u201dMs. Dubuc praised Mr. Smith for his response.\u201cShane did a powerful thing and that was to take seriously the changes that needed to happen at Vice,\u201d she said, later adding that her being named aschief executive was an important signal for the company to send.\u201cI could have a pretty dramatic impact,\u201d she said.\u2014 Edmund LeeFor someone who speaks often and loudly about taking a stand and doing good, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock spends a lot of time thinking about gray areas.\u201cThese things are not black or white,\u201d he said on Thursday at the DealBook conference in New York.BlackRock has $6.5 trillion under management, giving it great influence over many of the world\u2019s top public companies. In a conversation that ranged from tariffs to bitcoin, Mr. Fink returned repeatedly to ideas about corporate accountability.\u201cI\u2019m not a nanny either,\u201d Mr. Fink said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not telling companies what their purpose should be. But I do believe it\u2019s up to the company to identify what their purpose is.\u201dOther executives \u2014 including Mr. Dimon, Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone and Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber \u2014 also dropped out of the event. Despite his refusal to attend what he called a \u201cvery public showcase\u201d of the kingdom\u2019s strengths, Mr. Fink said that BlackRock would continue to conduct business in Saudi Arabia, adding that he \u201cnever believed that decision would cost us all the business.\u201dBut he stressed that his attention to social responsibility is not a passing fad.\u201cI certainly never did this to be in vogue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re being asked.\u201d\u2014 Tiffany HsuSteve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, concluded his presentation on Thursday with the results of a poll he recently helped run: 61 percent of the people surveyed cared about using researched facts to help form their opinions on policy, beating the 54 percent who said their values shaped their opinions.For Mr. Ballmer, that is central to a project he has been working on since he retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014 and has poured millions of dollars into: USAFacts, a nonpartisan database of federal, state and local government revenue and spending.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the better part of four years trying to understand where government gets its revenue, where it spends its revenue,\u201d Mr. Ballmer told the audience on Thursday.In a wide-ranging presentation, Mr. Ballmer ran through some highlights of the types of data his website provides, hitting on hot-button issues in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.Mr. Ballmer has called USAFacts \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual financial filings that companies make. In charts, Mr. Ballmer showed how he believes USAFacts can help Americans filter the increasingly convoluted noise.On immigration, for example, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States rose from about 10.5 million to 12.1 million in recent years, according to USAFacts\u2019 analysis of government data. The number of border agents has risen sharply from about 4,000 to 19,000 over the same period, while border apprehensions have decreased from roughly 1.7 million to 300,000, Mr. Ballmer said.The numbers raise natural questions, Mr. Ballmer said. Why are there more border agents today, fewer apprehensions, but more undocumented immigrants?\u2014 Mihir ZaveriDavid Gelles, Corner Office columnist at The New York Times, presented the findings of a DealBook conference task force on diversity in the workplace, characterizing it as a \u201creally lively discussion\u201d that could have gone on for hours. Nonetheless, \u201cwe made a remarkable amount of progress in an hour,\u201d he said.Among the conclusions of the report:\u2022 Aspirational goals are in general a good thing, but they\u2019re not enough, said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. Companies also need to be transparent in how they\u2019re achieving those goals. In addition, there can\u2019t be separate business and diversity scorecards \u2013 diversity needs to be part of the business.\u2022 Legislation and federal policies need to play a role. John Hope Bryant, founder and chief executive of Operation HOPE spoke about the need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships, and when the effort is especially aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get a double credit for that double reach,\u201d he said.\u2022 Companies have to realize diversity is a long-term goal, and it has to be baked into its culture. \u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it,\u201d it won\u2019t work, said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JP Morgan Chase. And everyone has to join the conversation, she said.\u2014Alina TugendRebecca Blumenstein, the deputy managing editor of New York Times, described the conversations of a DealBook conference task force, intended to establish guidelines on how to ethically implement A.I., as one of the \u201chighest level discussions she has ever seen\u201d about the technology.Among the conclusions of the panel:\u2022 Companies should take care to scrutinize their machine learning initiatives (and algorithms in general) for biases that may be passed on from their creators, said Dipayan Ghosh, a Pozen Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. These technologies should be developed with greater consideration for the public interest.\u2022 In New York City, when considering artificial intelligence in transportation, companies should be transparent with the data they use in order to ensure the technologies are a benefit to society, said Cordell Schachter, the chief technology officer of the New York City Department of Transportation.\u2014 Mihir ZaveriA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified the people shown.

{"Headline": "Rocket Lab\u2019s Modest Launch Is Giant Leap for Small Rocket Business", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company\u2019s Electron rocket carried a batch of small commercial satellites from a launchpad in New Zealand, a harbinger of a major transformation to the space business.A small rocket from a little-known company lifted off Sunday from the east coast of New Zealand, carrying a clutch of tiny satellites. That modest event \u2014 the first commercial launch by a U.S.-New Zealand company known as Rocket Lab \u2014 could mark the beginning of a new era in the space business, where countless small rockets pop off from spaceports around the world. This miniaturization of rockets and spacecraft places outer space within reach of a broader swath of the economy.The rocket, called the Electron, is a mere sliver compared to the giant rockets that Elon Musk, of SpaceX, and Jeffrey P. Bezos, of Blue Origin, envisage using to send people into the solar system. It is just 56 feet tall and can carry only 500 pounds into space.But Rocket Lab is aiming for markets closer to home.\u201cWe\u2019re FedEx,\u201d said Peter Beck, the New Zealand-born founder and chief executive of Rocket Lab. \u201cWe\u2019re a little man that delivers a parcel to your door.\u201dBehind Rocket Lab, a host of start-up companies are also jockeying to provide transportation to space for a growing number of small satellites. The payloads include constellations of telecommunications satellites that would provide the world with ubiquitous internet access.The payload of this mission, which Rocket Lab whimsically named \u201cIt\u2019s Business Time,\u201d offered a glimpse of this future: two ship-tracking satellites for Spire Global; a small climate- and environment-monitoring satellite for GeoOptics; a small probe built by high school students in Irvine, Calif., and a demonstration version of a drag sail that would pull defunct satellites out of orbit.Space Angels, a space-business investment firm, is tracking 150 small launch companies. Chad Anderson, Space Angel\u2019s chief executive, said that although the vast majority of these companies will fail, a small group possess the financing and engineering wherewithal to get off the ground.Each company on Mr. Anderson\u2019s list proffers its own twist in business plan or capability: Vector Launch Inc. aims for mass production; Virgin Orbit, a piece of Richard Branson\u2019s business empire, will drop its rockets from the bottom of a 747 at 35,000 feet up; Relativity Space plans to 3-D print almost all pieces of its rockets; Firefly Aerospace will offer a slightly larger rocket in a bet that the small satellites will grow a bit in size and weight; Gilmour Space Technologies is a rare Australian aerospace company; And Astra Space Inc., which is operating in stealth mode like a Silicon Valley start-up, saying nothing about what is doing. Rockets are shrinking, because satellites are shrinking.In the past, hulking telecommunications satellites hovered 22,000 miles above the Equator in what is known as a geosynchronous orbit, where a satellite continuously remains over the same spot on Earth. Because sending a satellite, there was so expensive, it made sense to pack as much as possible into each one.Advances in technology and computer chips have enabled smaller satellites to perform the same tasks as their predecessors. And constellations of hundreds or thousands of small satellites, orbiting at lower altitudes that are easier to reach, can mimic the capabilities once possible only from a fixed geosynchronous position.\u201cIt\u2019s really a shift in the market,\u201d Mr. Beck said. \u201cWhat once took the size of a car is now the size of a microwave oven, and with exactly the same kind of capabilities.\u201dSome companies already have launched swarms of satellites to make observations of Earth. Next up are the promised space-based internet systems such as OneWeb and SpaceX\u2019s Starlink.Until now, such small spacecraft typically hitched a rocket ride alongside a larger satellite. That trip is cheaper but inconvenient, because the schedule is set by the main customer. If the big satellite is delayed, the smaller ones stay on the ground, too. \u201cYou just can\u2019t go to business like that,\u201d Mr. Beck said.A Falcon Heavy can lift a payload 300 times heavier than a Rocket Lab Electron, but it costs $90 million compared to the Electron\u2019s $5 million. Whereas SpaceX\u2019s standard Falcon 9 rocket has no shortage of customers, the Heavy has only announced a half-dozen customers for the years to come.The United States military \u2014 a primary customer for large launch vehicles \u2014 is also rethinking its spy satellites. The system would be more resilient, some analysts think, if its capabilities were spread among many, smaller satellites. Smaller satellites would be easier and quicker to replace, and an enemy would have a harder time destroying all of them.SpaceX could have cornered this market a decade ago.Jim Cantrell, one of the first employees of SpaceX, did not understand that decision and left the company. In 2015, he started Vector Launch, Inc., with headquarters in Tucson. Its goal is to make the Model T of rockets \u2014 small, cheap, mass-produced.Vector claims that it can send its rockets into orbit from almost any place it can set up its mobile launch platform, which is basically a heavily modified trailer. That trailer was inspired by Mr. Cantrell\u2019s hobby, auto racing, and many of the companies\u2019 employees come from the racing world, too.The company is still aiming to meet its goal of getting the first of its Vector-R rockets to orbit this year, but Mr. Cantrell admitted that the schedule might slip again, into early 2019. The flight termination system \u2014 the piece of hardware that disables the rocket if anything goes wrong \u2014 is late in arriving.\u201cThere are a lot of little things,\u201d Mr. Cantrell said. \u201cIt drives you crazy.\u201dA prototype was planned for suborbital launch from Mojave, Calif., in September, but it encountered a glitch and the test was called off. The crew put the rocket in a racecar trailer and drove it to Vector\u2019s testing site at Pinal Airpark, a small airport a half-hour outside of Tucson that is surrounded 350 acres of shrubby desert.Vector built test stands for firings of individual engines as well as completed rocket stages. During a recent visit to the site, engineers were troubleshooting the launch problems of both the prototype rocket and a developmental version of its upper-stage engine.Soon the team will head to the Pacific Spaceport Complex, on Alaska\u2019s Kodiak Island, for its first orbital launch. Next year, Mr. Cantrell said, the company hopes to put a dozen rockets into space.Tom Markusic, another veteran of SpaceX\u2019s early days, also sees an opportunity to help smaller satellites get to space.\u201cI didn\u2019t feel there was a properly sized launch company to address that market,\u201d he said.Mr. Markusic said that the need for stronger antennas and cameras would ultimately prompt the construction of slightly bigger small satellites, and that it would be beneficial to be able to launch several at a time.He started Firefly in 2014, aiming to build Alpha, a rocket that would lift a 900-pound payload to orbit.The company grew to 150 employees and won a NASA contract. But in the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, a European investor backed out. An American investor also became skittish, Mr. Markusic said, after a SpaceX rocket exploded on the launchpad in 2016. Firefly shut down, and the employees lost their jobs.At an auction, a Ukraine-born entrepreneur, Max Polyakov, one of Firefly\u2019s investors, resurrected the company. Mr. Markusic took the opportunity to rethink the Alpha rocket, which is now able to launch more than 2,000 pounds.\u201cAlpha is basically Falcon 1 with some better technology,\u201d he said.Mr. Markusic said his competition was not the smaller rockets of Rocket Lab, Vector or Virgin Orbit but foreign competitors such as a government-subsidized rocket from India and commercial endeavors in China. But he complimented Rocket Lab.\u201cThey\u2019re ahead of everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they deserve a lot of credit.\u201dFirefly plans to launch its first Alpha rocket in December of 2019.Not everyone is convinced that the market for small satellites will be as robust as predicted.\u201cThat equation has weaknesses at every step,\u201d said Carissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm.Three-quarters of venture capital-financed companies fail, she said, and the same will likely happen to the companies aiming to put up the small satellites. She also is skeptical that space-based internet will win against ground-based alternatives.\u201cPublicly, there\u2019s no compelling business plans,\u201d she said.That means that the market for small rockets could implode for lack of business. She said a key to survival would be to tap into the needs of the United States government, especially the military. Virgin Orbit, Vector and Rocket Lab were the current front-runners, she said.The small rocket companies also have to compete with Spaceflight Industries, a Seattle company that resells empty space on larger rockets that is not taken up by the main payload. In addition, Spaceflight is looking to purchasing entire rockets launched by other companies, including Rocket Lab, and selling the payload space to a range of companies heading to a similar orbit.The first such flight, using a SpaceX Falcon 9, is to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base this month carrying 70 satellites, in what the company compares to a bus ride into orbit.Curt Blake, president of Spaceflight, said that both approaches can work. Buses are cheaper but less convenient, and sometimes the timely lift from a taxi is worth the added cost.Mr. Anderson of Space Angels was also optimistic. \u201cThe difference today is how robust the sector is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sector today can handle failures.\u201dWhile the sector is getting off the ground, Rocket Lab doesn\u2019t intend to waste any more time: it is hoping to quickly follow \u201cIt\u2019s Business Time\u201d with a second commercial launch next month, and then a third the month after that.\u201cWe\u2019re very focused on the next 100 rockets, not the next one rocket.\u201d Mr. Beck said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to go to orbit. It\u2019s a whole another thing to go to orbit on a regular basis.\u201d_____Michael Roston contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi and Pence Stake Out Trade Positions in Dueling Speeches at Pacific Rim Forum", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 President Xi Jinping of China and Vice President Mike Pence pushed back against criticism of each of their countries\u2019 trade practices in speeches on Saturday at an Asia-Pacific trade summit meeting in Papua New Guinea, while seeking to assure allies of their commitment to the region.Mr. Xi and Mr. Pence spoke ahead of what is likely to be a tense meeting between President Trump and the Chinese leader at the Group of 20 conference in Argentina later this month, where they will attempt to defuse a trade war.Mr. Xi may also be looking to shore up ties with an important trading partner, North Korea. He told President Moon Jae-in of South Korea on the sidelines of the trade forum that he was considering visiting the North after its leader, Kim Jong-un, extended an invitation, according to a spokesman for Mr. Moon.The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trade practices, including restricting market access, pushing American companies to hand over valuable technology and engaging in cyberespionage and intellectual property theft. It has put tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods; China has retaliated with tariffs of its own.Mr. Pence, echoing warnings from Mr. Trump, said the United States could \u201cmore than double\u201d the tariffs it had placed on $250 billion in Chinese goods.\u201cThe United States, though, will not change course until China changes its ways,\u201d Mr. Pence said.He urged Asian nations to avoid investment offers from China and to choose instead a \u201cbetter option\u201d \u2014 working with the United States \u2014 which, he said, would not saddle them with debt, a quandary some countries are facing as a result of their partnerships with Beijing.\u201cLet me say to all the nations across this wider region, and the world: Do not accept foreign debt that could compromise your sovereignty,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\u201cWe don\u2019t drown our partners in a sea of debt,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t coerce or compromise your independence. We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road. When you partner with us, we partner with you, and we all prosper.\u201dMr. Xi, perhaps anticipating the criticism, spoke before Mr. Pence and disputed the notion that accepting Chinese investment as part of the initiative called \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d would compromise a nation\u2019s sovereignty.The initiative \u201cis not for geopolitical purposes; it will exclude no one; it will not close a door and create a small circle,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cIt is not the so-called trap, as some people say. It is the sunshine avenue where China shares opportunities with the world to seek common development.\u201dMr. Xi sought to paint China as continually opening its markets to the world.\u201cChina will continue to significantly relax market access, strengthen intellectual property protection and actively expand imports,\u201d he said. Since the beginning of this year, Mr. Xi said, China has \u201csignificantly\u201d reduced import tariffs on 1,449 consumer goods, 1,585 industrial products and vehicles and components.He described the trade dispute as a choice between \u201cwin-win progress or a zero sum game.\u201d\u201cMankind has once again reached a crossroads,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cWhich direction should we choose? Cooperation or confrontation? Openness or closing doors?\u201dMr. Pence and Mr. Xi may have been sending mixed messages with their speeches, said Brendan Taylor, an associate professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University.\u201cThe extent to which Mr. Xi tried to reassure the region that he didn\u2019t have any geopolitical ambitions \u2014 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly convincing,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.He described Mr. Pence\u2019s speech as having a \u201cvery strong \u2018America First\u2019 tone,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s quite a big gap between his rhetoric and what\u2019s actually happening in the region.\u201dOther nations in the region were hedging their bets, he said. \u201cThe moves those countries are making relate to their uncertainties about the U.S. and the Trump strategy or lack thereof,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.The two leaders discussed economic cooperation and the possibility of the Japanese military participating in training exercises in Darwin, where about 2,000 American Marines rotate through each year.In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Pence lauded the economic and military cooperation between the United States and its Asia-Pacific allies, and he warned China that American ships and jets would sail and fly anywhere allowed by international law.Chinese military forces have confronted American and other foreign navies and aircraft that have entered waters in the South China Sea that China claims as its own.\u201cThe United States of America will continue to uphold the freedom of the seas and the skies, which are so essential to our prosperity,\u201d Mr. Pence said.He said the United States would support efforts \u201cto adopt a meaningful and binding code of conduct that respects the rights of all nations, including the freedom of navigation, in the South China Sea.\u201dHe also announced that the United States would participate in an Australian-Papua New Guinea initiative to develop a naval base on Manus Island in the Bismarck Sea, in northern Papua New Guinea.The spokesman for Mr. Moon, Kim Eui-kyeom, said Mr. Xi was considering making his first state visit to Pyongyang next year.China is North Korea\u2019s largest trading partner, accounting for more than 90 percent of the North\u2019s external trade. But Mr. Xi has never visited North Korea as Chinese leader, and a trip to Pyongyang would be an important nod to Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership from North Korea\u2019s most important ally.Ties between the two countries had frayed recently as North Korea pressed ahead of with its nuclear weapons and missile tests, and Beijing joined American-led efforts to impose sanctions on the North. This year, however, Mr. Kim has sought to mend the relationship, meeting with Mr. Xi three times. For each of those meetings, Mr. Kim traveled to China.Mr. Kim, the South Korean spokesman, said Mr. Xi and Mr. Moon had agreed at the APEC forum that if the North\u2019s leader and Mr. Trump held a second summit meeting, as they have agreed to, it would be a \u201cwatershed\u201d moment in international efforts to end Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula.Jamie Tarabay reported from Sydney, Australia, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

{"Headline": "Saudis Close to Crown Prince Discussed Killing Other Enemies a Year Before Khashoggi\u2019s Death", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Top Saudi intelligence officials close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked a small group of businessmen last year about using private companies to assassinate Iranian enemies of the kingdom, according to three people familiar with the discussions.Saudi officials have portrayed Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death as a rogue killing ordered by an official who has since been fired. But that official, Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, was present for a meeting in March 2017 in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, where the businessmen pitched a $2 billion plan to use private intelligence operatives to try to sabotage the Iranian economy.During the discussion, part of a series of meetings where the men tried to win Saudi funding for their plan, General Assiri\u2019s top aides inquired about killing Qassim Suleimani, the leader of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps and a man considered a determined enemy of Saudi Arabia.The interest in assassinations, covert operations and military campaigns like the war in Yemen \u2014 overseen by Prince Mohammed \u2014 is a change for the kingdom, which historically has avoided an adventurous foreign policy that could create instability and imperil Saudi Arabia\u2019s comfortable position as one of the world\u2019s largest oil suppliers.As for the businessmen, who had intelligence backgrounds, they saw their Iran plan both as a lucrative source of income and as a way to cripple a country that they and the Saudis considered a profound threat. George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman, arranged the meeting. He had met previously with Prince Mohammed, and had pitched the Iran plan to Trump White House officials. Another participant in the meetings was Joel Zamel, an Israeli with deep ties to his country\u2019s intelligence and security agencies.A spokesman for the Saudi government declined to comment, as did lawyers for both Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel.During the March 2017 meeting about the plan to sabotage Iran\u2019s economy, according to the three people familiar with the discussions, the Saudis asked the businessmen whether they also \u201cconducted kinetics\u201d \u2014 lethal operations \u2014 saying they were interested in killing senior Iranian officials. The businessmen hesitated, saying they would need to consult their lawyer.The lawyer flatly rejected the plan, and the businessmen told the Saudis they would not take part in any assassinations. Mr. Nader told the Saudis about a London-based company run by former British special operations troops that might take on the contract. It is unclear which company he suggested.Before he was ousted last month, General Assiri was considered one of Prince Mohammed\u2019s closest advisers, a man whose sharp ascent tracked the rise of the young crown prince. In 2016, he became the public face of Saudi Arabia\u2019s campaign in Yemen, giving briefings about the state of the war. He traveled frequently to Washington, where Saudi-paid lobbyists brought him to think tanks to give optimistic assessments about the campaign\u2019s progress and he extolled the Saudi concern for the welfare of civilians.By 2017, however, the Saudi campaign that General Assiri oversaw in Yemen had ground into a military stalemate and, despite his assurances, a humanitarian catastrophe. But his patron, Prince Mohammed, also consolidated his power over all of the kingdom\u2019s security apparatuses, and he promoted General Assiri to the deputy head of the kingdom\u2019s spy agency, the General Intelligence Directorate.Western analysts believe that Prince Mohammed moved General Assiri there in part to keep an eye on the spy chief, Khalid bin Ali bin Abdullah al-Humaidan, known as Abu Ali, who was close to Western intelligence agencies and suspected of harboring loyalties to one of the crown prince\u2019s royal rivals.Mr. Nader\u2019s and Mr. Zamel\u2019s plan dates to the beginning of 2016, when they started discussing an ambitious campaign of economic warfare against Iran similar to one waged by Israel and the United States during the past decade aimed at coercing Iran to end its nuclear program. They sketched out operations like revealing hidden global assets of the Quds Force; creating fake social media accounts in Farsi to foment unrest in Iran; financing Iranian opposition groups; and publicizing accusations, real or fictitious, against senior Iranian officials to turn them against one another.Mr. Nader is an adviser to the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, a country that, along with Saudi Arabia and Israel, has identified Iran as the primary threat to stability in the Middle East.Both he and Mr. Zamel believed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s anticipated victory in the 2016 election meant a continuation of the Iran nuclear deal signed by President Barack Obama \u2014 and little appetite in Washington for a concerted campaign to cripple the Iranian economy. So, they decided to pitch the plan to Saudi and Emirati officials, even submitting a proposal to General Assiri during a meeting in Belgium.The election of Donald J. Trump changed their calculus, and shortly after, Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel traveled to New York to sell both Trump transition officials and Saudi generals on their Iran plan.Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel enlisted Erik Prince, the former head of Blackwater and an adviser to the Trump transition team. They had already discussed elements of their plan with Mr. Prince, in a meeting when they learned of his own paramilitary proposals that he planned to try to sell to the Saudis. A spokesman for Mr. Prince, Marc Cohen, declined to give specifics about the meeting but said that Mr. Prince had no discussions with Saudis about assassinations.In a suite on one of the top floors of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in New York, Mr. Zamel and Mr. Nader spoke to General Assiri and his aides about their Iran plan. The Saudis were interested in the idea but said it was so provocative and potentially destabilizing that they wanted to get the approval of the incoming Trump administration before Saudi Arabia paid for the campaign.After Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, Mr. Nader met frequently with White House officials to discuss the economic sabotage plan.General Assiri\u2019s interest in assassinations was unsurprising but unrepresentative of official policy, said one Saudi familiar with the inquiry into the Khashoggi killing. The investigation has shown the general to be a grandiose and ambitious novice to intelligence who sought to impress the crown prince with unauthorized schemes for black operations, the person said.But General Assiri\u2019s well-known closeness to the crown prince \u2014 the general often joined Prince Mohammed for meetings in Riyadh with visiting American officials \u2014 might make it difficult for the prince\u2019s supporters to distance him from the proposals, just as the same connections have helped convince Western intelligence agencies that the prince must have known about the plot against Mr. Khashoggi.\u201cHad a truly magnificent meeting with M.B.S.,\u201d Mr. Nader wrote in early 2017, discussing possible Saudi contracts. The crown prince, he said, had advised him to \u201creview it and discuss it with General Ahmed.\u201dMark Mazzetti reported from Washington, Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv and David D. Kirkpatrick from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thanksgiving Turkey and Raita in Texas", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe dinners at my parents\u2019 house in Dallas told a story of the nation\u2019s contemporary history. Ms. Rao is a writer.We did all the American scenes big, but especially Thanksgiving. There can\u2019t be many families of any race or creed as invested in the holiday as mine. Our house in Dallas became the center of the world come November. Cousins, aunts, uncles without the holiday off made space in the calendar to fly in from India. A turkey joined our normally vegetarian household, with no debate about Hindu notions of cleanliness.The spread reflected aspirations. On the dining table, dishes married Hallmark and Karnataka: green bean palya, sweet potato raita. A friend of my parents dreamed up cranberry chutney, an instant hit. My mother\u2019s best friend brought a touch of cosmopolitan sophistication: yams and marshmallows without any Indian spice.The coffee table stayed frozen in time, homage to Mom\u2019s take on America, and after her death, to Mom herself. Appetizers spoke to the quick-food era: cream cheese tortilla rollups served with salsa; a loaf of King\u2019s Hawaiian carved to hold spinach dip thick in water chestnuts, recipes pulled from magazines she leafed through in her early years in the country.The parties told a story of the nation\u2019s contemporary history. As a young business school professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, my father had students from India. My parents thought to provide a home.The moods of the brown folks who walked through our doors reflected shifts in American policy and the global order. In the 1980s, a mania for finance degrees and with relative ease of entry meant a flood of Indian M.B.A. students. In the 1990s, Indian migration to Dallas soared, and friendship became less an act of desperation than of choice. In time most attendees spoke Kannada, the language of my parents. In the early 2000s, as the Indian economy grew, there were excited conversations about annual return trips, from which some families never returned.Cousins from India became part of the household, and the country: Mukund, who would get his M.B.A. at the University of Texas in Dallas; his wife, Asha, for whom the allure of America had faded after the outsourcing boom brought bars and jobs aplenty to their home city of Bangalore. Raghav locked himself upstairs on his first Thanksgiving to watch the American version of \u201cThe Office\u201d as required reading of a sort for an undergraduate with a Mumbai accent in Chicago.My mom\u2019s last year alive, 2007, we sang around the table that she and my father bought their first year in Texas. A stroke wiped her of speech except in song. She managed broken refrains to tunes she remembered from India, devotional songs and Bollywood hits. After she died the parties turned rare and sparse, in rhythm with the outside. Our local scene aged, the young scattered, recession reordered the world.I had moved to Brooklyn. Thanksgivings had become an ad hoc affair. In 2016, under a new administration, we staged a reunion tour as my father turned 70. I emailed family early and asked them to buy plane tickets to Dallas. The presidential election unsettled me.We held a roast outside the house: Uncles and aunties from Dallas sat in the audience as the family put on a show. Jokes centered on decay. Dad\u2019s house broke days before the holiday: The stove didn\u2019t work, the power went out, his car wouldn\u2019t start. We boiled water on a camping stove donated by an uncle whose wife sat at home with tumors to fight. An Iranian student of Dad\u2019s, who was supposed to join us, was already having trouble with his visa and was stuck in Canada. Dad fretted he might lose a job offer to teach in America, that he might never be let back in. A cousin roasted the audience, making fun of their belief in America. He took special aim at those who voted for a man under whom they might never have made it in, were their timing different.My cousins now have children who didn\u2019t know of a past to mourn. They turned the power failure in my father\u2019s house into a game, calling the long weekend \u201cthe Pitch-Dark Party.\u201d Hadn\u2019t my parents tried to meet a similar need of students, family, friends \u2014 to participate in an illusion? Turkey and family and football. An American scene, peopled by us, despite our differences from the stars of Norman Rockwell canvases and holiday commercials. I realized my wish for a Dallas Thanksgiving came out of a wish for illusion, too, a discomfort with reality.Mallika Rao is a writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Battle in Gaza Neither Side Wanted Ends Quickly", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byASHKELON, Israel \u2014 The woman emerged dazed from the rubble, suffering from multiple injuries and barely able to speak. Her new husband, Mahmoud Abu Asaba, 48, had been pulled from beneath her amid the ruins of their fourth-story bedroom in an Ashkelon apartment building early Tuesday.Improbably, Mr. Abu Asaba was the only person killed in Israel in more than 24 hours of rocket and mortar fire from the Gaza Strip, a staggering bombardment of at least 460 projectiles, many of which made it past Israel\u2019s vaunted air defenses.Just as improbably, he was not an Israeli but a Palestinian, from Halhoul, near the West Bank city of Hebron.The night-and-daylong attack by Hamas, which rules Gaza, and other militant factions terrorized residents in the bustling cities of Ashkelon and Sderot and in smaller communities across southern Israel. Israel responded with waves of airstrikes that pounded military targets and leveled several tall buildings used by Hamas, leaving a number of Palestinians homeless.But for all its intensity, the casualty toll could have been much higher. In Gaza, seven people were killed and 26 wounded. In Israel, Mr. Abu Asaba was killed and 18 people were wounded.Late Tuesday afternoon, Hamas leaders announced a cease-fire and Israel eventually followed suit. The abrupt and inconclusive outcome sparked celebrations in Gaza. It left Israel\u2019s government, the most right-wing in the country\u2019s history, contending with accusations of being soft on Hamas.That the battle began at all was unexpected. Neither Israel nor Hamas wanted a fight. Both had been taking steps, with Egypt\u2019s mediation and Qatar\u2019s financing, to cool tensions along their border and ease Gaza\u2019s growing economic desperation.Israel had allowed fuel to reach Gaza\u2019s underpowered electrical plant and cash to reach Hamas\u2019s underpaid civil servants. Hamas had promised to curtail border protests and the use of incendiary balloons that had torched vast stretches of Israeli farmland. There was cautious optimism that further progress could be made.Then, Sunday night, came the kind of military mishap that Israel boasts almost never happens. An elite undercover squad on an intelligence mission in Khan Younis had its cover blown. It was the sort of foray undertaken frequently, albeit with great planning and precaution, to plant surveillance equipment or rendezvous with a Palestinian source.Fighting their way to safety with the help of heavy airstrikes, the Israelis lost a lieutenant colonel and killed seven Palestinian fighters.For Hamas, already reeling from domestic criticism that it had sold out the Palestinian cause for a pile of cash, the battle in Khan Younis was a public-relations bonanza. Its fighters were praised for valiantly defending their territory and heroically running off the Israeli invaders.But Hamas also accused Israel of deliberately sabotaging the nascent cease-fire. And it had seven dead fighters to avenge.Hamas, along with Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other armed Gaza factions, took its time in responding. At 4:30 p.m. Monday, the groups unleashed a well-coordinated rocket barrage on a scale not seen before, the Israeli military said.Shimrit Meir, an Israeli analyst of Palestinian politics, said the Gaza factions sensed that Israel\u2019s eagerness to contain the fighting and avoid a full-blown ground conflict gave them unusually capacious room to maneuver.\u201cThey controlled the timing of it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey controlled the level of escalation. They controlled the flames.\u201dFor example, the Palestinians fired an antitank missile at a civilian bus that had just dropped off about 50 Israeli soldiers. One soldier was seriously wounded and the bus was destroyed. But Hamas released a video showing that it had waited patiently for the bus to empty out before shooting.\u201cIf they had hit that bus while it was full, guaranteed, we\u2019d be in a war right now,\u201d said Nathan Thrall, an analyst at the International Crisis Group.Israel ratcheted up its response, in a calibrated way, Mr. Thrall said. In the last Gaza war, in 2014, Israel waited until the conflict\u2019s final days to destroy tall buildings, and it deduced that doing so had a powerful effect on Hamas.So on Monday night, with rockets hitting Israeli neighborhoods, the army did not wait: It began leveling Gaza towers housing Hamas\u2019s television and radio stations, military intelligence and other operations.To avoid civilian casualties, the army first warned the occupants to evacuate. And by Tuesday, Israeli social media was rife with mockery of the army\u2019s \u201cempty building\u201d strategy, Ms. Meir said.\u201cYou have to admit, it looks ridiculous. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make Hamas change its behavior.\u201dMeantime, Israel allowed its southern cities to be blasted from the sky and ordered its citizens to spend many hours in bomb shelters before venturing out tentatively on Tuesday.Tuesday night, as the cease-fire was backhandedly confirmed by the Israeli government \u2014 when a right-wing member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition publicly denied that he had supported it \u2014 fed-up residents of Sderot erupted. Shouting \u201cDisgrace!\u201d and \u201cBibi go home!\u201d they set tires on fire, blocked off streets and railed against Mr. Netanyahu for allowing the conflict to end without a more decisive blow to the Palestinians. Opposition leaders accused Mr. Netanyahu of having no strategy for Gaza.The government does have a strategy, said Celine Touboul, a Gaza expert at Israel\u2019s Economic Cooperation Foundation. But it is so replete with contradictions that it may be unworkable.Above all, the Israeli government wants quiet on the Gaza border, she said, but it is refusing to adopt measures that could achieve quiet, like allowing thousands of Gaza laborers to work in Israel.The government says it supports Egyptian efforts to broker a reconciliation between Hamas in Gaza and the more moderate Palestinian Authority, which administers the West Bank. But it has done little to encourage the Palestinian Authority to reconcile and return to control over Gaza.And while Israel refuses to consider a political deal with Hamas, Ms. Touboul said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t want to undermine their position to the extent that they can\u2019t enforce a cease-fire.\u201dIn a way, then, Israel got at least part of what it wanted: Hamas\u2019s position in Gaza has been strengthened enough for it to resume talks on a cooling-off at the border. Which brings the two sides more or less back where they were on Sunday morning.Except for the dead and wounded, and the dozens of civilians in Gaza and Israel whose homes were heavily damaged or destroyed.In Gaza City, Abu Hurayra al-Yazji, 34, said he was awakened from a sound sleep early Tuesday morning by banging on his apartment door. An Israeli soldier had telephoned his brother with a warning to roust his neighbors: The building was about to be bombed.Before he could get his wife and two children outside, Mr. Yazji said, the first missile struck one wing of the five-story building. From the street, they saw more missile strikes turn the rest of it to rubble.\u201cMy kids were crying from horror,\u201d he said.Across the border in Ashkelon, apartment buildings were struck by missiles fitted with oversized explosive charges, Palestinian militants said.Mr. Abu Asada, the Palestinian who was killed in Israel, had trained to be a sea captain but had been working as a contractor in Israel for 15 years, according to an uncle, Emad Khalil Abu Asaba. About six months ago, he married his second wife \u2014 his first wife and five children remained in Halhoul \u2014 and moved with her into a dilapidated rental building. Their fellow tenants, including working-class Ethiopian, Russian and Moroccan Jews and Arabs, barely know each other by sight.All were left homeless. Tamasgen Melke, 28, a factory worker who lived on the first floor, said he saw a ball of fire and thought the apartment house would collapse.\u201cBefore I even got out of bed the window blew out,\u201d he said.Mr. Abu Asada\u2019s body and his wife were not discovered until about 90 minutes after emergency workers had completed its search of the building.An urban renewal worker, Shlomi Lankri, who had driven across town to inspect the wreckage, climbed three flights out of sheer curiosity.He heard a faint sound, like scratching in the sand. Then, peering into the rubble by the light of his cellphone, long after rescue workers had moved on to another blast site, he saw something move. It was the hand of Mr. Abu Asada\u2019s wife, whose name has not been released.Mr. Abu Asada\u2019s family was to receive survivor benefits from the Jewish Agency, which has a fund for victims of terrorist attacks in Israel. Isaac Herzog, the agency\u2019s chairman, said it will be the first such award to a non-Israeli citizen.Isabel Kershner reported from Ashkelon, and David M. Halbfinger from Jerusalem.

{"Headline": "John Delaney Is Already Running for President", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "You probably don\u2019t know his name. But Iowans have been hearing it for more than a year.Supported byDES MOINES \u2014 Partway through his stump speech at the Iowa State Fair in August, Representative John Delaney spotted a familiar face walking by.John Boehner, the former House speaker, wearing a blue-and-white gingham shirt almost identical to Mr. Delaney\u2019s \u2014 and looking distinctly as though he wished he had taken a different route from the pork chop stand to the parking lot \u2014 was instantly surrounded by reporters.\u201cI worked on a lot of stuff with him. He\u2019s a good member,\u201d was about all Mr. Boehner, a Republican, would say of Mr. Delaney, a Maryland Democrat running for president. \u201cOh God. I\u2019m just walking by. If it weren\u2019t Delaney there \u2014 I\u2019m walking by, I got a pork chop, I was walking by, I saw Delaney. I said, \u2018Aw, I\u2019ll stop.\u2019 I should have known better. I should have kept walking.\u201dThat night, he would cheerfully recall the Boehner encounter in a speech at the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding. And two days later, he would hit the last of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties, completing a classic campaign feat before any better-known opponent started. He isn\u2019t running for re-election to the House, the better to go \u201call in\u201d on running for president.\u201cHe\u2019s just coming out and saying, \u2018Here\u2019s who I am and here\u2019s what I believe in,\u2019\u201d Ms. Waller said approvingly. \u201cI like him right now. But there\u2019s not a lot of others.\u201dMr. Delaney\u2019s central message is simple: Globalization has been an \u201cextraordinarily positive\u201d force, he says, but not for everyone, and politicians should have acted \u2014 through tax incentives, infrastructure investments, better public education, universal health care \u2014 to make it positive for more people. Instead, they were \u201ctoo busy fighting.\u201dBut on the trail, he emphasizes his working-class roots. Neither of his parents went to college. His father, an electrician, belonged to a union that covered half of Mr. Delaney\u2019s tuition at Columbia, \u201cwhich has always been a great reminder for me that none of us do it alone in life,\u201d he said to a crowd in Adel. \u201cI would have nothing that I have today but for a bunch of electricians reaching into their pockets.\u201dMr. Delaney\u2019s strategy is classic small-town retail politics. Over five days in August \u2014 his 14th trip to Iowa \u2014 he covered more than 700 miles and held more than two dozen events, many of them featuring fewer than 20 people in cities with populations of barely more than 1,000. In Grundy Center (population 2,700), he canvassed with Dennis Evans, a candidate for the Iowa House. In Atlantic (population 6,700), he visited the farm of another Iowa House candidate, Denise O\u2019Brien, and asked her about agriculture policy. Less than five hours later, he added one of Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s policy suggestions \u2014 making the national farm bill last longer than five years \u2014 to his stump speech. At the Greenfield event in particular, Mr. Delaney received a warm welcome. Afterward, Marcia Fulton, 77, of Creston, declared herself \u201cextremely impressed.\u201d But she also said she was \u201canxious to see who else comes into\u201d the race.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Machine That Drives the Auction World", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe multimillion-dollar churn of top-end art auctions sometimes seems as predictable as a washing machine: Each load has its differences, but they can be difficult to discern when the cycle remains the same.For these marquee New York sales, $2 billion seems to have become the figure that reassures a wider world that top end of the art market is humming, if not actually booming.Last week, that feel-good figure was achieved with the help of material not normally seen in Impressionist, modern and contemporary sales. Prices were also propped up, wherever possible, with hundreds of millions of dollars in financial guarantees.\u201cIt\u2019s all about writing the biggest check. The auction houses are desperate to keep the machine going,\u201d said Wendy Goldsmith, an art adviser who attended the New York sales. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the market could absorb that much volume.\u201dChristie\u2019s captured the biggest market share, mounting nine separate sales, including an unusual Sunday-night auction of Impressionist and modern art and a stand-alone sale of Alberto and Diego Giacometti furniture. Over all, it offered 1,007 lots \u2014 an increase of more than 9 percent from the previous November \u2014 and raised $1.1 billion.The owners, the New York collectors Ed and Deborah Shein, were able to negotiate a guarantee check of about $30 million from Sotheby\u2019s. The auction house was left owning the painting after bidding failed to reach $25 million.\u201cThe estimate was maybe slightly aggressive,\u201d Michael Altman, a New York dealer who specializes in American art, said, adding that other works by Hartley had recently sold privately for more than $20 million.Cutthroat competition among auction houses for trophy consignments is allowing savvy owners to negotiate highly advantageous terms.The painting sold to a telephone bidder for $90.3 million with fees, shattering the auction record for a living artist.\u201cThe strategy was genius,\u201d said Offer Waterman, a dealer based in London who regularly sells works by Mr. Hockney. \u201cThe big buyers were encouraged to pay what they wanted to pay.\u201dMr. Waterman added that by offering the painting without reserve, Mr. Lewis had shown he was confident that there would be demand \u2014 and that he would not be sharing any profit with a third party. Christie\u2019s would have gained market share, but little if any profit from the transaction, according to Mr. Waterman.Guarantees nonetheless remain the norm at top-end auctions of contemporary art.Evan Beard, a national art services executive at U.S. Trust, a wealth management unit of Bank of America, said that it had become routine for his clients to guarantee several lots in a season. Guarantors can be rewarded when they buy \u2014 $4 million in the case of the Hopper at Christie\u2019s \u2014 or enjoy a percentage of the \u201coverage\u201d above the guarantee if they are outbid.\u201cThey\u2019re going to be a more common tool \u2014 it\u2019s the market becoming more efficient,\u201d he said. If you were going to buy a picture, he added, why not get a discount, or some of the overage?New York\u2019s auction machine is certainly functioning efficiently, particularly for contemporary art, which generated more than half the week\u2019s $2.1 billion total.At Phillips on Thursday, the day sale \u2014 the lower-priced sector where the auction houses make their most consistent profits \u2014 raised $25.5 million, with 82 percent of its 284 lots successful. Prices for monochrome paintings by the Japanese artist Tomoo Gokita reached new level when the 2015 canvas \u201cClub Mature,\u201d showing a quartet of models with blanked-out faces, sold for $807,000.Underappreciated names, particularly nonwhite and female artists, are driving growth in the market. The Wednesday-evening contemporary sale at Sotheby\u2019s was judiciously on trend, including works such as Jack Whitten\u2019s 1985 abstract \u201cAncient Mentor I,\u201d which sold for $2.2 million, double the low estimate and a new high for the artist.Some established market darlings \u2014 the sort of artists who tend to attract third-party guarantees \u2014 were proving a harder sell. Two large-scale monochrome abstracts by Christopher Wool, works which have previously been steady sellers at auctions and fairs, were unsold at Christie\u2019s and Phillips. Both had been estimated at about $4 million.\u201cThe market is very picky,\u201d Todd Levin, an art adviser based in New York, said, adding that more individuals from the finance world seemed to be looking to profit from third-party guarantees.\u201cThey think that art is a business easy to game,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cIt\u2019s become the last stop in Vegas before getting on a plane. But the odds are still with the house.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Stigma of Khashoggi Killing, Crown Prince Is Seen as Retaining Power", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A month after the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, the growing international consensus that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was behind it has done almost nothing to weaken his grip on power over the kingdom.The crown prince owes his apparent impunity partly to the nature of power in Saudi Arabia\u2019s absolute monarchy and to his own proven ruthlessness. But he also owes it to the Trump administration. It has decided to stand by him, according to three people familiar with the White House deliberations.Barring a surprise intervention by his aging father, King Salman, there is every expectation that Prince Mohammed, 33, will succeed him and dominate Saudi Arabia for a half-century to come.White House officials knew from an Oct. 9 phone call with Prince Mohammed that he considered Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist, a dangerous Islamist, two people familiar with the call said, so the officials knew he had a potential motive for the killing.But having invested deeply in Prince Mohammed as the main driver of the administration\u2019s agenda for the region, and under pressure from allies who support him \u2014 notably the leaders of Israel and Egypt \u2014 the Trump administration has concluded that it cannot feasibly limit his power, the people familiar with its deliberations said.Instead, the White House has joined governments around the region in weighing what effect the stigma of the Khashoggi killing may have on the crown prince\u2019s ability to rule \u2014 and what benefit can be extracted from his potential weakness.\u201cEverybody is milking this,\u201d said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. With the crown prince now in need of external assistance to rehabilitate himself, she said, \u201ceverybody is trying to turn this to their advantage and try to get what they can out of it.\u201dFor the Trump administration, the people familiar with its thinking said, that means pressuring the crown prince for steps to resolve the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar and the Saudi-led bombing of Yemen. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have both issued calls for a cease-fire in Yemen as part of that plan.Officials in the Trump administration had discussed proposals like urging King Salman, the 82-year-old father of the crown prince, to appoint a strong prime minister or other senior official to help oversee day-to-day governance or foreign policy, according to the people familiar with the deliberations.But such ideas were quickly discarded, partly because no one would risk taking such a job, or dare appear to counter Prince Mohammed while he controls the Saudi intelligence and security services and has the king\u2019s ear.Scholars and diplomats say it is almost inconceivable for him to relinquish his authority in the way that an official in a Western government might accept a reduced role or shared responsibilities. Power in Saudi Arabia\u2019s absolute monarchy, they say, adheres to the individual, not the office.\u201cAll power flows from the king,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, a scholar at Princeton University who studies the kingdom and has met with Prince Mohammed. \u201cThe king delegates power to a person, and it belongs to that person until the king takes it away.\u201dIf anything, the killing of Mr. Khashoggi has only strengthened the crown prince\u2019s capacity to intimidate others inside the kingdom, even in his own family, royals and other Saudis said.Many royals already had lost money and influence because of Prince Mohammed\u2019s swift rise over the past three years. The damage to their reputations since the Khashoggi killing has compounded their alarm.Some whispered with intrigue at the return to Riyadh this week of an uncle, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, who had opposed Prince Mohammed\u2019s designation as heir to the throne and then appeared to criticize his rule.But Prince Ahmed, who had been in London, may only have returned home in a gesture of family solidarity. So far the clan sees no alternative to the dominance of Prince Mohammed, said one member of a branch of the family diminished by his rise.\u201cThey hate him, but what can they do?\u201d this family member asked. \u201cIf you speak, they\u2019ll put you in jail, while other countries want to sell arms and buy oil. I would find it really sad if he gets out of this one.\u201dPrince Mohammed, often known by the initials MBS, had already humiliated or imprisoned seemingly any potential rival among his royal cousins. At an investor conference he sponsored in Riyadh last week he appeared to smile through the Western backlash, and several Western officials with experience in the kingdom said it was na\u00efve to think that a new arrangement of advisers could contain him.\u201cIf MBS is constrained, he will try to break out,\u201d said a Western diplomat who knows him. \u201cAnd he will become a threat to those he thinks did it to him.\u201dPrince Mohammed\u2019s effectiveness in regional politics, however, is a more open question, partly because the Khashoggi killing has caused many in the West to re-evaluate other episodes in his recent past.His three-and-a-half-year-long bombing campaign over Yemen has produced only a military stalemate and a humanitarian catastrophe. His decision a year ago to order the arbitrary detention of about 200 of the kingdom\u2019s richest businessmen on vague allegations of corruption has driven away many investors.Perhaps strangest, the crown prince briefly kidnapped the prime minister of Lebanon a year ago in a botched gambit to push back against Iran\u2019s Lebanese allies. At last week\u2019s investor conference, the crown prince himself made a joke of that misstep, laughingly assuring the Lebanese prime minister he could leave Riyadh freely.A growing number of current and former Western officials are now asserting publicly that in light of the Khashoggi killing, those earlier episodes portray the young prince as dangerously aggressive, impulsive and destabilizing.If he were damaged, it would be \u201cbecause institutions and governments abroad no longer want to deal with him,\u201d said David H. Rundell, a former chief of mission at the American Embassy in Riyadh who served 15 years in Saudi Arabia.But the United States and other Western governments have such extensive ties to Saudi Arabia that they are unlikely to walk away, Mr. Rundell said, predicting \u201ca newfound caution and willingness to compromise\u201d from the crown prince.\u201cI think this makes it much more difficult for him to sustain his singular focus on Iran because the actions he is condemning there, he himself is perpetrating,\u201d Mr. Miller said.One person familiar with the White House deliberations said the administration expected that bipartisan pressure from Congress will force the imposition of some sanctions.But the White House intends to keep the sanctions limited enough to avoid a rupture with Prince Mohammed. For one thing, he remains central to the plans of the president\u2019s son-in-law and Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, including hopes to build an Arab-Israeli alliance against Iran and to pressure the Palestinians into a peace agreement.Two people close to the Saudi royal court said Mr. Kushner and Prince Mohammed communicate often, including by text message, and multiple times since Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. A White House spokesman declined to comment about those communications.Two people familiar with the call said the crown prince had described Mr. Khashoggi as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 a reference that the White House officials knew meant that the prince saw him as a dangerous radical. Saudi Arabia had long tolerated the Brotherhood, an 80-year-old Islamist movement, but the kingdom branded it a terrorist organization and outlawed it when the group advocated calls for elections after the Arab Spring revolts.Mr. Khashoggi was not a formal member of the Muslim Brotherhood. But he had joined for a time in his youth, maintained friendships with several members, and wrote columns arguing that banning the Brotherhood was incompatible with democracy in the region.To assuage Western fears raised by the Khashoggi killing, Prince Mohammed intends to formalize some of his decision-making, and show the West he is taking steps to avoid similar episodes, according to two people familiar with the plans.But instead of involving elder statesmen, Prince Mohammed is moving those procedures under the authority of his younger brother, Khaled bin Salman, 30. He has been the ambassador to Washington since last year, and is now expected to become a sort of national security adviser.The crown prince\u2019s stature in Washington may be stabilizing, with at least a handful of American voices extolling the importance of the Saudi-American alliance.\u201cThere is no change in any military relationship we have with Saudi Arabia,\u201d Gen. Joseph Votel, the top United States commander in the Middle East, told the military publication Defense One.Major figures in finance signaled that they, too, intended to look past the killing. \u201cI understand the emotion around the story,\u201d John Flint, the chief executive of HSBC, told Reuters, \u201cbut it is very difficult to think about disengaging from Saudi Arabia given its importance to global energy markets.\u201dJamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said that he had accomplished \u201cnothing\u201d by dropping out of the prince\u2019s investment conference and that his bank expected to continue to pursue business with the kingdom. \u201cBeing engaged is not a bad thing; it does not mean you condone everything,\u201d Mr. Dimon said at a conference organized by the publication Axios.Ms. Yahya, of the Carnegie Middle East Center, said such responses send an instructive message to other Arab strongmen.\u201cYou can be even more brutal than you already are,\u201d she said. \u201cJust be smarter about it next time. Don\u2019t kill a well-known journalist inside a consulate.\u201dDavid D. Kirkpatrick reported from London, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon.Advertisement"}

And the big banks became even more entrenched.Now another wave of alternative banks are at it again, and they say they\u2019ve learned from the mistakes of the upstart banks that tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 before them.Chime, the biggest new name to pop up, has opened two million fee-free online checking accounts and is adding more customers each month than Wells Fargo or Citibank.That has inspired a crop of newer start-ups, like Empower, which started its first fee-free online checking accounts, with lots of digital bells and whistles, in October.Venture capitalists are pouring money into American start-ups that are offering basic banking services \u2014 known as neo-banks or challenger banks. In 2018 so far, American neo-banks have gotten four times as much funding as they did last year, and 10 times as much funding as they did in 2015, according to data from CB Insights.Big players from outside the consumer banking industry, like Square and Goldman Sachs, are also moving in.\u201cIn consumer banking, you have what is one of the largest industries in the United States, in terms of profits, and at the same time one of the least disrupted industries, and the most unpopular with consumers,\u201d said Andrei Cherny, the founder of Aspiration, a neo-bank that has attracted nearly a million customers. \u201cThose three things create a perfect storm for disruption.\u201dThe persistent unpopularity of big banks has been a boon to the newcomers. And they are helped by a new attitude among financial regulators who have grown more comfortable with online banking and young customers who have no hesitation about cashing a check or sending money on a phone.\u201cEveryone is looking at cards and bank accounts as the next battleground,\u201d said Lindsay Davis, an analyst covering financial technology companies for CB Insights.The new financial outfits are trying to replace the old, branch-based way of banking with a mobile phone-friendly account that does away with the fees that have made banking giants so unpopular.Andrea Johnson, a dispatcher for a utility company in Michigan, switched to Chime after her old bank, PNC, charged her an overdraft fee as a result of another fee from the bank that had emptied her account.\u201cThat blew my mind: one fee leading to another fee,\u201d Ms. Johnson, 35, said. \u201cThey are going to find a way to nickel-and-dime you to death.\u201dSince she switched to Chime, Ms. Johnson said, she hasn\u2019t missed PNC\u2019s physical branches and has appreciated some of the start-up\u2019s perks, like getting money from her paycheck two days early.Chime, which has 100 employees in downtown San Francisco, makes money by collecting a fee from Visa every time its customers use Chime\u2019s debit card to make a payment. The company has received $105 million in investments from venture capital firms.\u201cIf you look ahead five years, there\u2019s no way there will be a financial services industry that is charging consumers $30 billion a year in overdraft fees,\u201d said Chris Britt, the chief executive of Chime. \u201cWe aim to shake that up, and I think a lot of other consumer companies will be doing the same thing.\u201dThe deposits going to start-ups like Chime and Aspiration are still a drop in the bucket compared with the trillions of dollars in accounts at places like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. New companies in the United States are also lagging those in places like China and Britain, where a much greater proportion of consumers have already fled to upstarts.These charters will allow start-ups like Varo to operate without relying on an established bank to hold their money, which adds significant costs.Most of the new companies have kept their money and run transactions through partner banks, generally smaller regional banks that don\u2019t have the money or the expertise to build out their own digital services.Traditional banks are recognizing the threat. Wells Fargo is testing an app-based banking product, Greenhouse, that does away with overdraft fees and service fees.JPMorgan Chase already offers a similar app, Finn, aimed at younger customers and announced last month that it was building a new fintech campus in Silicon Valley.The big banks have also held on to the interest payments they get rather than passing them along to depositors. That has created an opening for online companies. Empower is paying its customers 2 percent for deposits, compared with the 0.01 percent that Wells Fargo is offering.\u201cWe are reaching an audience that is underserved and even to the point of unbanked, which wasn\u2019t a stated goal, but it\u2019s something we love and want to lean into more,\u201d Square\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said at a conference in May.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Gains for Women in STEM Fields Will Take More Effort", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 If the world of STEM is looking for more women role models, V\u00e9na Arielle Ahouansou and Alejandra Estanislao are candidates.Both are young and have degrees in a field involving science, technology, engineering or mathematics \u2014 the disciplines where women are significantly underrepresented.Ms. Estanislao, 31, originally from Venezuela, also wanted to be a doctor but got a degree in mathematics and finance at a top French engineering school, and she is now a software engineer at Google in Paris.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad at the engineering faculty, where we were about 25 percent,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said. \u201cIt was later, at work. When you find yourself one woman in a room of 30 people, that is when you feel lonely.\u201dDr. Ahouansou, whose company employs 15 people, said men still have a blind spot \u2014 not about women in management, but about women in technology. \u201cThey need to change their mind-set that science is just for them,\u201d she said.No one disputes these days that STEM remains mostly a man\u2019s world. Much has been written about the male geek culture that dominates Silicon Valley and other technology hubs. But numerous speakers at the conference agreed that needs to change soon if women are to adjust to fast-changing job markets that increasingly require technological skills, or scientific proficiency.The study found that in the developed world, women account for just 25 percent of graduates in information and communications technology, and 24 percent in engineering \u2014 even though women outnumber men in graduate schools over all.As jobs change around the world, technology \u2014 and the flexibility it promises \u2014 could offer women a chance to choose how, when and where they work. But these opportunities are lost without the skills to access them, which is why many said at the global women\u2019s forum, in which The New York Times is a partner, that giving women the skills to master technology is a social, moral and economic necessity.\u201cFixing that is the right thing to do,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said.\u201cWhat the study found is that girls want more role models,\u201d Ms. McKinley said. \u201cWhere are the women STEM teachers? Girls are more interested in hands-on experience; they want to see the life applications of what they are learning. We need to focus on this.\u201dAngel Gurria, Secretary General of the O.E.C.D., speaking at an opening event at the organization\u2019s headquarters, said a recent effort in his native Mexico \u2014 \u201cmacho Mexico\u201d as he put it \u2014 to expose girls in high schools to celebrated women in science and technology has had a positive affect. But, he acknowledged, fighting stereotypes is an uphill battle.\u201cThey happen naturally, starting in families,\u201d he said. \u201cParents often don\u2019t have enough information. We are fighting centuries and centuries of tradition and culture.\u201d One answer, some experts say, is to encourage paternity leave after the birth of a child, which allows their wives to keep working, and the men to become more involved in family life and to offer their daughters in particular another role model at home.Paternity leave has been catching on in some countries, particularly those facing a declining birthrate and an aging population, as a way to encourage women to stay in the work force.In Iceland and elsewhere, fathers\u2019 share of paid leave dipped during the financial crisis, as men stayed at work to boost the family income.But in many countries, cultural biases can trump even the most progressive legislation. Generous paternal leave policies in Japan and Korea are rarely used for both economic and cultural reasons, Mr. Adema said.In Russia, legislation that allows fathers to take up to three years off after the birth of a child is widely shunned, according to Svetlana Lukash, a member of Russia\u2019s presidential staff. \u201cIt is still badly perceived by society,\u201d she said.According to O.E.C.D. statistics, women are still eight times more likely to care for children than men, even though 86 percent of men agree they should do more to share the burden at home. As several speakers admitted, attitudes toward shared responsibilities at home have changed, but behavior has not.\u201cWe need to make the women\u2019s agenda a family agenda,\u201d said Gabriela Ramos, chief of staff at the O.E.C.D.Attracting girls and women to STEM studies is just one issue. Another, perhaps more significant, is encouraging them to stay the course. \u201cIt is all about retention,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said. \u201cIt is useless to bring in women if you can\u2019t keep them.\u201dAccording to Ms. Nefesh-Clarke, more than 50 percent of women in information and communications technology, or ICT, leave, mainly because of a hostile environment. That helps explain why women hold only 3 percent of the top management jobs in ICT, she said.\u201cWe can\u2019t just address the external pipeline,\u201d she said later. \u201cWe have to address the internal pipeline, and why it is leaking. What is it about the culture of ICT that makes women not want to stay?\u201dA new danger is that the low level of women\u2019s participation in STEM may become self replicating. A number of speakers at the three-day forum noted that women are woefully underrepresented in the high-tech start-up world. Only 9 percent of apps are created by women; 10 percent of innovative start-ups were founded by women; and women-only teams account for just 6 percent of popular open source programming language for data analysis.In other words, all-male teams are writing algorithms that reflect their attitudes and biases, which inadvertently or not can exclude women.\u201cAlgorithms are built by humans,\u201d said Emanuela Aureli, of Spencer Stuart, a consulting firm. \u201cIf women don\u2019t participate in their creation, they won\u2019t have a voice.\u201d Pronouns flagging the sex of applicants have been found inserted in job search programs, she said.\u201cThe message is we should not reproduce the biases and stereotypes of the analog world,\u201d said Ms. Ramos, the chief of staff of the O.E.C.D.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of women in information and communications technology who leave, mainly because of a hostile environment. It is 50 percent of women, not 50 women.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carlos Ghosn Felt Stars Deserved Big Pay. His Accusers Say He Took That Too Far.", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShortly after Carlos Ghosn took over in 1999 as chief operating officer of an ailing Nissan Motor, he overhauled the way the company paid senior employees.Abandoning Japanese traditions that rewarded seniority and shunned incentive awards, Mr. Ghosn enforced a performance-based system and gave bonuses to midlevel managers.He earned a reputation as one of his generation\u2019s most successful C.E.O.s, but now the way Mr. Ghosn managed his own rewards may prove to be his downfall.On Monday, Mr. Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo after a company investigation alleged that he had deceived Japanese financial authorities about his pay package.According to Tokyo prosecutors, Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a onetime Nissan human resources manager and current board member, underreported Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation between 2011 and 2015 by more than 5 billion yen ($44.5 million). The prosecutors say they declared pay of just under \u00a55 billion ($44.3 million), which was half the nearly \u00a510 billion ($88.8 million) he actually earned.Neither man has been charged. Prosecutors have 72 hours to assess the accusations, and they can request an additional 20 days, depending on court approval, to investigate.Nissan\u2019s board will meet Thursday to consider their removal.He was named one of the most powerful people in business by Fortune magazine in 2003. He became a fixture on the conference circuit and a regular at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.By the time prosecutors boarded his corporate jet on Monday at Haneda Airport in Tokyo to take him off for questioning, Mr. Ghosn had been embroiled in several fights over executive pay, something of a recurring subplot in his career. He has made many millions of dollars serving as chief executive and chairman of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors. At times, his pay drew the ire of investors and politicians, including Emmanuel Macron, now the French president, when he was finance minister in 2016.\u201cHe was always arguing about whether he was adequately compensated,\u201d said Robin Ferracone, founder of Farient Advisors, an executive compensation advisory firm. \u201cThe question was whether he should be compared to Japanese standards, or international standards or American standards.\u201dIn Japan, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s pay far outstripped those of his counterparts. As chairman of Nissan last year, he reported income of \u00a5735 million, more than four times the pay of Toyota\u2019s chairman.\u201cThere was always a disconnect between Western management salaries and Japanese management salaries,\u201d said Christopher Richter, deputy head of Japan research at CLSA, an investment and brokerage group. Even though \u201ccompared to executives in other countries, some people would regard him as underpaid,\u201d Mr. Richter added, \u201cI guess you could say there was something of a culture clash in that.\u201dMr. Ghosn was born in Brazil to Lebanese immigrants and moved to Beirut when he was a toddler.He went on to study engineering at an elite university in Paris, then worked at Michelin, the tire maker, for 18 years.He started on the factory floor, preparing rubber for the manufacturing process. Soon he was a plant manager. Before long he was deployed to his native Brazil as chief operating officer of Michelin\u2019s local subsidiary, where he expanded the business despite soaring inflation. In 1990 he was made chief executive for Michelin\u2019s troubled North American division, and he revived it.But Michelin was a family company, and Mr. Ghosn said he knew he was unlikely to become C.E.O. When Renault, the French carmaker, recruited him in 1996, he joined as the executive vice president overseeing manufacturing, purchasing, and research and development.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s inviting gestures went only so far. Six months into his tenure, on the eve of the Tokyo Motor Show, he presented a plan for Nissan\u2019s revival. Billed the Nissan Revival Plan, it called for the elimination of some 21,000 jobs, or 14 percent of the work force, including several top managers.A series of manga comics, published in 2002, depicted the moment when Mr. Ghosn unveiled the restructuring plan to Nissan\u2019s executive team. The illustrations showed colleagues sweating about the news to close factories.\u201cRight now Nissan is just like a boat that is on fire and we need to extinguish this fire as soon as possible,\u201d the cartoon Mr. Ghosn says.In a country where layoffs are rare, Mr. Ghosn was pilloried in the press and labeled a \u201cgaijin,\u201d or foreigner. In a measure of his own confidence, Mr. Ghosn pledged to step down if his plan failed.The aggressive cost-cutting worked. Within a year, Nissan\u2019s finances had stabilized. Soon after, its debt load was slashed and its profits had improved. Mr. Ghosn was named chief executive in 2001.The recession of 2008 forced Mr. Ghosn to institute wide-ranging belt-tightening across the company, including new parts orders and factory overtime, and even the activities of the corporate-sponsored baseball team. Managers took a 5 percent pay cut.One investment that Mr. Ghosn continued to pursue was the development of battery-powered cars. Profitability might still be elusive, but the alliance saw the models \u2014 Renault, with its subcompact Zoe, and Nissan, with its compact Leaf \u2014 as necessary innovations.On Monday, Mitsubishi, like Nissan, said it would recommend that Mr. Ghosn be removed as chairman. In France, where Renault employs 47,000 workers, there was a more cautious response. The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Tuesday that Mr. Ghosn was \u201cno longer in a position capable of leading Renault\u201d because of the inquiry, but France has seen no evidence of the crimes alleged in Japan.Mr. Ghosn had planned to spend Tuesday night far differently. According to Jun Miyaji, a manager at Kushiwaka, a restaurant serving skewered chicken, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s secretary called to cancel his 7:30 reservation for dinner.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the director of the movie \u201cMarie Antoinette.\u201d She is Sofia Coppola, not Sophia.Jack Ewing, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He was 81.His aspirations were realized in October 1999, when the league awarded him the franchise that would become the Texans \u2014 a move that would return professional football to Houston in 2002, six years after the Oilers had skipped out for Tennessee to become the Titans.As the team\u2019s owner, Mr. McNair was instrumental in bringing two Super Bowls to Houston, in 2004 and in 2017.Robert C. McNair was born in Tampa, Fla., on Jan. 1, 1937, to Ruth and Ruse McNair. He grew up in Rutherford County, N.C., and graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1958. He and his wife, Janice Suber McNair, moved to Houston two years later.But it was with his $700 million bid to create the new Houston franchise that he would enter the exclusive club of N.F.L. owners and raise his public profile.Mr. McNair was among the owners most actively involved in N.F.L. matters, serving as chairman of the finance committee while also sitting on two other committees.Under his ownership, the Texans won their first A.F.C. South title in 2011 and repeated as conference champions the next year. The team went on to win four division titles in seven seasons.But in recent years, the league has found itself embroiled in the political issues of the day \u2014 and team owners like Mr. McNair have stoked discord with their comments.In October 2017, he was reported to have groused about \u201cinmates running the prison\u201d if N.F.L. owners allowed players to continue to sit or kneel during the national anthem. He made the comment among a handful of owners and team executives not long after a meeting with about a dozen players, many of them African-Americans, and many of whom had demonstrated during the anthem throughout the season to highlight a lack of attention to racial injustice.Then, in April, the acrimony surrounding the anthem protests grew, drawing barbs on Twitter from President Trump and forcing the league to hold a confidential meeting among its players, owners and executives.He is survived by his wife, Janice; two sons, Cal and Cary; two daughters, Ruth and Melissa; 15 grandchildren; and two great-grandsons. His son Cal is believed to be the heir to the football franchise.Ken Belson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The subways (and mass transit in general) are the veins and arteries of New York. If they\u2019re clogged, we\u2019re in trouble.Information: How we get news, the shrinking of local journalism, and the vast expansion of Google, Facebook and Twitter are changing how we relate to those around us.I\u2019m hoping that New York Today can help you to navigate this landscape.Culture/Identity: How we talk about race, class, gender and other forms of identity in New York is changing. We\u2019re going to pick up and discuss some of those stories, from myriad perspectives.Let\u2019s begin.A special election to fill her public advocate position will take place in February.

The insurgent Democrats who were at the forefront of the party\u2019s successful effort to take over the State Senate have repeatedly expressed hostility to the movement....it seems highly likely that a New York Legislature entirely under Democratic control will restrict the number of new charter schools that can open, and tighten regulations on existing ones.\u201dGovernor Cuomo also recently softened his support for charter schools as he eyes a potential White House bid.Xavier\u2019s mother, Janet Guillen, of Inwood, said she has been out of work because of the demands of caring for Xavier.She had been working at a grocery store when she found out she was pregnant.\u201cI never thought I was going to have a kid,\u201d she said. \u201cAt 38 \u2014 what?

{"Headline": "Where \u2018Yes! To Affordable Groceries\u2019 Really Means No to a Soda Tax", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Standing in a supermarket produce aisle, her face shadowed with dread, the middle-aged woman speaks directly to the camera and makes a plea for common decency.Now the nation\u2019s soda giants have turned to a new tactic to fight them: pushing sweeping ballot measures and statewide legislation that would permanently deny municipalities the ability to impose taxes on a broad range of goods and services. The initiatives are packaged and sold as citizen revolts against tax-happy politicians. None of them explicitly mention soda taxes.Opponents of the measures say they are fundamentally misleading because neither Washington nor Oregon has a plan to tax groceries. \u201cNo one is even talking about taxing food,\u201d said Jim Krieger, a professor of medicine and health services at the University of Washington. \u201cThis is simply the soda industry trying to protect its profits at the expense of public health and local democracy.\u201dThe industry has momentum \u2014 and money \u2014 on its side. Here in Washington, the industry has spent over $20 million to promote Initiative 1634, according to state finance filings. Those fighting the ballot measure have raised $100,000.\u201cThese pre-emptive measures undermine democracy and completely take away a local government\u2019s ability to do what\u2019s best for their communities,\u201d said Jennifer L. Pomeranz, a professor of public health at New York University. \u201cIt\u2019s a true corporate takeover of America.\u201dBut critics say such taxes hurt small businesses and have an outsize impact on the poor.\u201cThousands of good wage jobs are tied to the food and beverage industry, and the taxes are regressive because they take money out of the pockets of folks least able to afford them,\u201d said Peter Lamb, a senior official for Teamsters Local 174 in Tukwila, Wash., which is championing the ballot measure.Although nearly all of Washington\u2019s major newspapers have come out against the grocery tax ballot measure, neither side has a decisive lead, according to polling. But interviews with voters suggest the soda industry\u2019s efforts to conceal its involvement are working. At a Safeway supermarket in Burien, a Seattle suburb, most shoppers expressed enthusiasm for the initiative.\u201cFor those of us who are struggling to get by, the last thing we need is a tax on food,\u201d Mallory Brumfield, 31, a preschool aide, said as she shopped for groceries at a Safeway supermarket with her two children in tow.Like many shoppers, Ms. Brumfield was surprised to learn that Coca-Cola, Pepsi and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group have provided the lion share of money to promote the measure. \u201cKnowing that kind of gives me pause about whether I should support it,\u201d she said.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t bury the truth, because let\u2019s be honest: No one on the planet believes that soda is groceries.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Start-Up Offering Credit to Other Start-Ups", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Felix Steinmeyer launched his Fintech start-up Mason Finance in October 2017, he soon faced an annoying \u2014 and puzzling \u2014 dilemma.Although the 31-year old had raised several million dollars in financing from venture capital powerhouses like Kleiner Perkins and DCM, and his business was tapping a potentially lucrative piece of the billion-dollar life insurance market, he couldn\u2019t get a corporate credit card to handle day-to-day working capital needs.Credit card companies didn\u2019t want to risk extending a card to a new business that had no revenue or cash flow, and whose founder had no history as an entrepreneur.\u201cI tried at least four credit card companies and had zero success,\u201d said Mr. Steinmeyer, Mason Finance\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThis niche is super underserved,\u201d Mr. Dubugras said.Brex looks at the investors and venture capitalists supporting the start-up and the amount of money raised when assessing risk. \u201cIf investors are willing to give at least $100,000 to the start-up, we\u2019re willing to give them a card,\u201d Mr. Dubugras said.But, there are conditions: Brex insists the card be paid in full every 30 days, and it monitors the company\u2019s bank account balance daily to ensure the start-up is not recklessly burning through cash. \u201cIf they\u2019re spending $50,000 a month and have $60,000 left in their bank account, I know they\u2019re going under in the next month so I\u2019m going to stop giving them credit,\u201d he said.The automated online application process is fast. \u201cWe can issue a card in five minutes,\u201d Mr. Dubugras said. He added that he hadn\u2019t seen a single default.Silicon Valley Bank, which has been offering corporate cards to start-ups since 2008, goes one step further than Brex, offering charge cards, whose balances are due monthly, and regular corporate cards with revolving lines of credit.\u201cWe do not use the personal credit history of the founders or FICO scores\u201d to assess risk, said Eduardo Vergara, head of Global Treasury Services at Silicon Valley Bank. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at how much capital they\u2019ve raised, who the investors are, who the founders are, and what\u2019s their track record as entrepreneurs.\u201dSVB also relies on instinct, having extended financing to start-ups for the past 34 years. \u201cWe can really see and assess which ones are more likely to be successful \u2014 which ones we should be offering credit, which ones to lean in on,\u201d Mr. Vergara said.Some disrupters require the entrepreneur to personally guarantee the corporate card, said Mr. Dubugras, which means, if the business fails, the entity could go after the founder\u2019s home, car and assets to cover the credit card losses.Chase, for example, looks at a founder\u2019s personal credit history to assess risk, and it makes the entrepreneur personally liable for the corporate card, although Mary Jane Rogers, a Chase spokeswoman, said \u201cwe would not pursue the liquidation of personal assets to repay debts.\u201dDemand for corporate credit cards for start-ups is booming. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the fastest growing areas of SVB,\u201d Mr. Vergara said.Entrepreneurs find corporate cards make it faster and easier to cover and track everything from monthly server and software costs to business dinners.\u201cAs a start-up entrepreneur, time and money are like oxygen. Without it, you\u2019re dead,\u201d said Wole Coaxum, founder and chief executive of MoCaFi, a company that helps people build their credit profiles.\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re exploring,\u201d said Darrell Esch, vice president and commercial officer for Global Credit at PayPal. However, he said he would not favor offering corporate cards to start-ups without taking the entrepreneur\u2019s personal credit history into account. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high risk category,\u201d he said.Indeed, about 21 percent of businesses fail the first year, more than 50 percent by the fifth year, and 67 percent are gone by the 10th year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Some experts urge caution, noting that none of these entities have seen how the cards perform during a recession.\u201cThe verdict is still out,\u201d said Michael Noble, founder and chief executive of Apruve, which manages B2B credit programs. \u201cSilicon Valley can turn quickly and if that bubble bursts and the market pops, it will be an interesting exercise for Brex.\u201dMany big banks and entities are sitting on the sidelines watching and waiting.\u201cThe big guys don\u2019t necessarily want to do this until someone else has already kicked the tires,\u201d said David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a publication that covers the global payment industry. \u201cIf the technology works and the idea pans out, they\u2019ll likely buy the company or license the technology from Brex.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Electing Cindy Hyde-Smith, Mississippi Stays True to Its Conservative Roots", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJACKSON, Miss. \u2014 Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, a Mississippi Republican who had to apologize for a cavalier reference to a public hanging, won a special runoff election on Tuesday, defeating the Democratic candidate, Mike Espy, who was trying to become the state\u2019s first black senator since Reconstruction.Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s victory, reported by The Associated Press, came in the final Senate race of the midterm elections and will set the Republican majority in the chamber at 53 to 47 once the new Congress is sworn in, a net pickup of two seats.The matchup between Mr. Espy and Ms. Hyde-Smith drew national scrutiny as a test of Mississippi\u2019s past and present attitudes on race and its standing as a conservative bulwark, especially after the senator\u2019s gaffe that she would be willing to attend a \u201cpublic hanging.\u2019\u2019Mr. Espy referred to the state\u2019s history and its racial fault lines as he addressed supporters at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum less than three hours after the polls closed. \u201cShe has my prayers as she goes to Washington to unite a very divided Mississippi,\u201d he said.Ms. Hyde-Smith received a last-minute boost from President Trump, who appeared at two rallies with her on Monday and cautioned Mississippians that a victory for Mr. Espy would also be one for Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.The Republican win came as a deep relief to the party and Mr. Trump in a state where they rarely struggle, especially in Senate contests. Mr. Trump boasted repeatedly this year about his influence in helping his preferred candidates win elections, but the party had to go to unusual lengths \u2014 with the two rallies, multiple tweets by the president, a vast financial investment and dozens of Republican election workers dispatched to the state \u2014 to help Ms. Hyde-Smith over the finish line.Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, praised Ms. Hyde-Smith on Wednesday for becoming the first woman from Mississippi to win election to Congress.Her victory is clearly good news for Senate Republicans, who will now have an expanded, conservative majority to help advance Mr. Trump\u2019s judicial nominees and negotiate with a Democratic-led House.On Wednesday morning, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Ms. Hyde-Smith had 54 percent of the votes, to 46 percent for Mr. Espy.\u201cThe reason we won is because Mississippians know me and they know my heart,\u201d she said on Tuesday night. \u201cThis win tonight, this victory, it\u2019s about our conservative values, it\u2019s about the things that mean the most to all of us Mississippians: our faith, our family.\u201dMr. Espy was the third prominent black Democrat to go down to defeat in a statewide race in the South this year, following losses by two gubernatorial candidates, Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida.Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s election reinforced Republicans\u2019 grip on power in Mississippi, a state they have come to dominate since the early 2000s, and showed that the political realignments taking shape in parts of the South are still in a nascent stage in Mississippi.Still, the fact that Ms. Hyde-Smith faced a challenging runoff election, after no candidate received a majority of the vote on Nov. 6, suggested that Democrats could make select races competitive once again. And the frantic efforts to salvage her seat signaled that rhetoric seemingly steeped in Mississippi\u2019s racist past risks a modern political price.Although Ms. Hyde-Smith was never on a glide path to power \u2014 she faced a Republican rival and Mr. Espy in the first round of voting, all but guaranteeing Tuesday\u2019s runoff vote \u2014 her campaign became more seriously imperiled through her own statements, including one in which she said that if a supporter invited her to \u201ca public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201dWithout that comment, and a handful of other controversial remarks, Democrats and Republicans alike said, Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s victory on Tuesday would have been a near-lock.Instead, Mr. Espy, 64, and his allies were able to seize on Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s rhetoric and argue that it was an anachronistic representation of Mississippi, a state that has struggled mightily to repair its image more than a half-century after some of the gravest abuses of the civil rights era.During a debate last week, Ms. Hyde-Smith, 59, who was the state agriculture commissioner until this year, said her \u201cpublic hanging\u201d remark reflected \u201cno ill will,\u201d and she asserted that she was being unfairly vilified.Mr. Espy, a former agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration who was Mississippi\u2019s first black member of Congress since Reconstruction, replied: \u201cIt came out of your mouth. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.\u201dIn region after region on Tuesday, Ms. Hyde-Smith was at her strongest in Mississippi\u2019s rural and predominantly white counties, outpacing past Republican luminaries like Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2012. But in areas with greater numbers of college-educated white voters, such as the Memphis suburbs, she did less well, allowing Mr. Espy to draw closer than Democrats ordinarily do.Ms. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to the seat in April when Thad Cochran retired for health reasons, will now fill the remaining two years of his term. The seat will again be on ballot in 2020, when a six-year term will be at stake.Mississippi is hardly accustomed to bruising Senate races between Democrats and Republicans. Senator Roger Wicker, who was also on the ballot on Nov. 6, won his bid for re-election this month with about 59 percent of the vote. (In 2014, Mr. Cochran survived a primary challenge and then trounced his Democratic rival in the general election.)Although Mr. Espy announced his campaign months ago, it was not until the election\u2019s closing weeks that he began to draw substantial national attention. But in Mississippi, speculation about Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s strength as a candidate had swirled since March, when Gov. Phil Bryant named her as Mr. Cochran\u2019s replacement, rejecting recommendations that he appoint himself.Another Republican, Chris McDaniel, joined the contest, running only four years after he nearly defeated Mr. Cochran. Some Republican officials and strategists, including a few of the Legislature\u2019s most influential members, publicly and privately questioned whether Ms. Hyde-Smith would be able to endure a well-financed campaign against her. Even the White House did not initially embrace Ms. Hyde-Smith, who they worried would falter in the race against Mr. McDaniel.But Mr. Trump, betting on his enormous personal popularity in Mississippi, ultimately endorsed Ms. Hyde-Smith, who toured the state in a bus emblazoned with a picture of her and the president.Speaking to reporters in Southern Mississippi on Monday, Mr. Trump tried to play down the \u201cpublic hanging\u2019\u2019 remark that created so much of the firestorm that engulfed Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign.\u201cReally it was something that was sad and it was a little flip,\u201d the president said after a round table on criminal justice legislation in Gulfport. \u201cShe called me, she said, \u2018I said something that I meant exactly very different,\u2019 and I heard an apology loud and clear.\u201dDemocratic and Republican officials believed that Mr. Trump\u2019s visit would stir up supporters of both candidates, after a first round of voting in which Mr. Espy won 40.6 percent, and Ms. Hyde-Smith took 41.5 percent.At a glance, the memory and mathematics of Mississippi politics appeared to favor Ms. Hyde-Smith in a runoff: Republicans had been winning Senate races uninterrupted since the 1980s, and the party has won the last four campaigns for the Greek Revival governor\u2019s mansion on East Capitol Street in Jackson.And in Mississippi, which has the nation\u2019s highest proportion of black residents but where about 60 percent of the voting-age population is white, political lines are often drawn in parallel to racial ones.Mr. Espy needed a substantial turnout among black Mississippians, who made up more than a third of the voting-age population and historically sided with Democratic candidates. But Democrats also recognized that Mr. Espy needed to win about a quarter of the white vote; to that end, some of his advertisements evoked Mississippi\u2019s long-running frustration with how it is regarded across the country.But few people believed that Mississippi had many undecided voters in the campaign\u2019s final days. The closing pitches from the candidates showcased the dueling approaches to the race.At a church in Jackson on Monday night, Mr. Espy mixed outreach to black voters with a message he hoped would appeal to disaffected centrists, eschewing sharp partisan oratory while urging supporters to spend Tuesday \u201cmarching to the polls like it\u2019s a holiday.\u201dAnd in Tupelo, with Mr. Trump at her side, Ms. Hyde-Smith eagerly wagered once more that an appeal to the right was the surest path toward political survival in Mississippi.\u201cI will stand for your conservative values,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s what\u2019s on the ballot.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting from Washington, D.C.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Watch Industry, the Hour Has Come to Teach", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 There is a growing belief among watch industry insiders that time is running short for the entire business: Unless it does more to inform a new generation of potential buyers about the value of a luxury watch \u2014 and to recruit new watchmakers \u2014 its future will be bleak.\u201cIf the industry doesn\u2019t invest in education now, \u2018real\u2019 watchmaking risks falling into the shadows,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Speake-Marin said. \u201cIn a generation from today, watchmaking might be viewed as a curiosity from a bygone era.\u2019\u2019The website highlights what Mr. Speake-Marin calls \u201cdecons,\u201d or deconstructions: articles, along with photographs and videos, that explain how a watch is made, assembled and finished. The site also features interviews with watch industry figures, in which he asks them the same 12 questions, like, \u201cAs a child, did you have any ambition?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the worst job you had to do?\u201dAt the moment, he is financing the site mostly by himself. Later, he said, he intends to work more with brands as traffic grows, in hopes that they will help supply funds.\u201cThe goal of The Naked Watchmaker is to develop a reference section,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as consumer advice. I see it as education, so that people can get inside the product and see what it is. It\u2019s important people are informed.\u201dNicholas Manousos, a watchmaker and president of the Horological Society of New York, shares this view. \u201cWithout education today, future growth cannot be guaranteed,\u201d he said. \u201cBrands should invest in education to make sure that their customers really understand what they\u2019re selling. Some brands do take this path, but others invest in flashy ad campaigns that sell a name rather than a product.\u201dMarco Schommer, director of the influential Watchmakers of Switzerland Training and Educational Program, best known as Wostep, isn\u2019t so sure. He previously was a customer service director for Bulgari, where, he said, one of the biggest challenges was educating new markets about mechanical watchmaking.\u201cNew Chinese clients who want to buy a very expensive product don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re buying, or the quality behind it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to show the client what is behind a watch so they feel they are getting value for money.\u201dBut the need for education is not limited to new customers. The industry relies heavily on human labor: successive generations of watchmakers trained to assemble and repair timepieces. Yet, in recent years, as older watchmakers have retired, newer ones have not been available to replace them.\u201cEducation in horology has been neglected for years,\u201d said Alan Burtoft, the British Horological Institute\u2019s education officer and a former instructor at the British School of Watchmaking. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the watch houses don\u2019t support training more than they do. They don\u2019t want to train anyone outside of their own product and they are struggling now to find skilled people.\u201dHe said that LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Swatch Group, Richemont and Rolex were among the brands supporting the British school. But the program is \u201cvery small,\u201d he said, noting that it produces only eight graduates a year.But some say these figures disguise the challenges that the shortage of watchmakers will pose. \u201cEventually, the public will say they won\u2019t buy mechanical watches if, in 10 years, there\u2019s no one to service them,\u201d Mr. Burtoft said.Opinions are split about who should take responsibility. Mr. Schommer said that he believed that it lay with the brands and the big groups and that it was \u201cnot enough for them to rely on their history or their ambassadors to sell watches.\u201d Mr. Burtoft, however, suggested that \u201cretail staff need educating in the first instance.\u201dMr. Manousos took a wider view: \u201cEducation is the responsibility of the entire industry.\u201dThere are signs that the business is realizing its predicament. Wostep oversees about 90 watchmaking schools worldwide, a small number of which are run in partnership with large companies, including Swatch Group and Richemont. The New York watch society offers monthly lectures and educational watchmaking classes twice a week at its Midtown Manhattan headquarters. Bremont runs its own watchmaking apprenticeship program and says it has taken on 27 apprentices in the last two years. And the British institute recently began trying one-day taster courses that introduce watchmaking.But it intends to hold the Dubai event again in 2019. \u201cThe event eliminates the barriers between the end consumer and the brands,\u201d Ms. Yazdjerdi said. \u201cFor brands, the more education and information they can offer about a timepiece, the better their chances are to connect to prospective clients.\u201dBut before the industry can collaborate effectively on an education strategy, attitudes will need to change, Mr. Schommer said.\u201cThere is some openness to discussing the future of education, but the watch brands are so secretive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk becomes that the question of education won\u2019t be addressed until it\u2019s too late.\u201d After all, in a connected age, consumers increasingly expect brand transparency.\u201cRegardless of marketing and advertising,\u201d Mr. Speake-Marin said, \u201cpeople seek value found through understanding, which only comes through the sharing of objective knowledge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boxing Federation Controversy Puts Sport at Risk in the Next Olympics", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The International Olympic Committee is moving toward expelling boxing\u2019s international federation, a step that could imperil one of the tent-pole events of the Summer Olympics at the 2020 Games in Tokyo.Controversy has for years plagued the boxing federation, which is known by the acronym A.I.B.A. Then last month, a man the United States Treasury Department has described as \u201cone of Uzbekistan\u2019s leading criminals\u201d won the A.I.B.A. presidency and took control of the world governing body.To his supporters, Rakhimov is seen as the federation\u2019s savior because of deals he cut with A.I.B.A. creditors. To the I.O.C., his appointment is the latest misstep by an organization that has lurched from crisis to crisis, including questions about the fairness of boxing judges and A.I.B.A.\u2019s antidoping measures.The I.O.C. will decide at a meeting on Dec. 1 whether to cast out A.I.B.A. If it does, the I.O.C. will have to scramble to organize an Olympic boxing competition for the Tokyo Games that the boxing federation has not sanctioned.The I.O.C. ordered the federation earlier this year to produce a report outlining plans to resolve some longstanding issues. People familiar with the I.O.C.\u2019s thinking say the A.I.B.A. has little hope for a reprieve. The I.O.C. is already planning ways to preserve boxing\u2019s place in Tokyo.It would take \u201csomething earth shattering\u201d for A.I.B.A. not to be thrown out, said a person with knowledge of the discussions who declined to be identified because those talks are continuing. For its part, boxing federation has accused the I.O.C. of double standards, pointing out that the organization has not dealt with a number of its members facing accusations of wrongdoing and is meddling in the internal workings of a sports federation.In a statement emailed through a media adviser, Rakhimov said: \u201c I have never been involved in any transnational criminal organizations or any other criminal activities. I have never been convicted or charged with any crime.\u201d\u201cThe I.O.C. has made it clear from the outset that there are issues of grave concern with A.I.B.A. regarding judging, finance and the antidoping program, and with governance \u2014 which includes but is not limited to the election of the A.I.B.A. president,\u201d the I.O.C. spokesman Mark Adams said in a statement.\u201cWhatever the results of the deliberations of the I.O.C. executive board, we will continue to make all efforts to protect the athletes and to have a boxing tournament at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020,\u201d Adams continued. The I.O.C. has frozen all contact with A.I.B.A., except those necessary to carry out I.O.C. decisions.In his emailed comments, Rakhimov repeated an offer to temporarily step down, but only \u201cif the I.O.C. and A.I.B.A. are communicating at the decision-making level.\u201d\u201cIn fact,\u201d he added via email, \u201cI believe we will be able to re-establish a good relationship with the I.O.C., which will include Tokyo 2020 and any future Olympic Games.\u201dA Chinese company, F.C.I.T., has effectively written off a $19 million investment in A.I.B.A. It has committed an additional $1 million a year for the rights to market and promote A.I.B.A. events for the next 20 years. Wu Di, an executive with F.C.I.T., was recently added to A.I.B.A.\u2019s decision-making executive committee. Two other spots are available for officials from companies who would be willing to commit a minimum $10 million each, according to A.I.B.A.\u2019s regulations.Virgets, who had been a senior associate athletic director at the United States Naval Academy, acknowledged that Rakhimov\u2019s notoriety presented problems.\u201cIs this the best person to run A.I.B.A.? Obviously not because they have some level of controversy,\u201d Virgets said. \u201cIt would be much better if he wasn\u2019t on that list, and it would be much better if we had someone with his skill-set who could manage this crisis for A.I.B.A. But quite frankly, I haven\u2019t seen that individual who could manage this crisis.\u201dThe Treasury Department\u2019s designation accuses Rakhimov of collaborating with the Thieves-in-Law organization on business, arranging meetings and warning it of law enforcement issues. \u201cRakhimov has been described as having moved from extortion and car theft to becoming one of Uzbekistan\u2019s leading criminals and an important person involved in the heroin trade,\u201d the department said in a statement.That makes him toxic for businesses and individuals with links to the United States, including those dealing with A.I.B.A. Switzerland\u2019s Vaud Cantonal Bank said it could no longer work with the boxing federation. A.I.B.A. then took its banking operations to Serbia. The I.O.C. did not let Rakhimov, who is based in Dubai, attend the Youth Olympics last month. The British authorities blocked him from attending the 2012 Olympics in London, and he was also denied a visa for the 2008 Games in Beijing.Rakhimov\u2019s Moscow-based lawyer, Yuri Kuznetsov, has spent years trying to clear his client\u2019s name. He has tried to persuade the authorities in Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and even Interpol to show the I.O.C. that Rakhimov is no longer a fugitive.Kuznetsov, during an interview in London last month, conceded that Rakhimov had to deal with unsavory characters after the fall of the Soviet Union, when he made his fortune importing foodstuffs.\u201cOf course he was not planning to rob a bank, he was not planning to make a crime, he had to meet with these people because they were controlling business,\u201d he said.Pat Fiacco, a Canadian appointed to A.I.B.A.\u2019s executive committee by Rakhimov, said the I.O.C.\u2019s treatment of Rakhimov was starting to feel like a violation of his human rights. He said even as the I.O.C. had been critical of Rakhimov, it had failed to police its own members who face accusations of wrongdoing.Those include the vice chairman of the I.O.C. commission overseeing the 2020 Olympics, who is accused of sexual harassment in Israel, and a Kuwaiti sheikh identified as an unindicted co-conspirator by the United States Justice Department in a sports-corruption case last year.Wu, who resigned as A.I.B.A. president last year amid accusations \u2014 that he denies \u2014 of financial mismanagement, remains an I.O.C. member. Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah stepped down temporarily Monday from the I.O.C. amid allegations by Swiss prosecutors of forgery.At the Youth Olympics in Argentina last month, the I.O.C. hired the accounting firm PwC to oversee the judging at the boxing event after previous tournaments were mired by accusations of rigged decisions. Virgets said steps had been taken to address those challenges and deal with 38 doping cases dating to 2010 that had not been tackled by the previous leadership.Documentation of the corrective measures taken by A.I.B.A. and a file with letters exonerating Rakhimov from the authorities in Russia and Uzbekistan has been sent to the I.O.C., Virgets said.\u201cI\u2019d be the first person here to say, \u2018If you can show evidence that Gafur Rakhimov is guilty, don\u2019t just remove him from A.I.B.A., but put him in jail,\u2019 \u201d Virgets said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA website called Gossip Cop fact-checks gossip. Who will fact-check Gossip Cop?Gossip Cop relies heavily on celebrity publicists to knock down rumors about their famous clients, so it\u2019s tempting to dismiss the site as a public relations arm of the entertainment industry. But there is an emerging rigor to Gossip Cop\u2019s methodology, reflected in the latest iteration of the site and the actions of the website\u2019s founder, Michael E. Lewittes. On the surface, it appears that Gossip Cop has ambitions to become, or at least be treated like, a full-blown fact-checking service on par with PolitiFact and Snopes.This notion is disputed by Mr. Lewittes, a former Access Hollywood producer and tabloid columnist who launched the site with financial backing from Dan Abrams, a television journalist and founder of Abrams Media, the boutique online publisher of Mediaite and The Mary Sue. (Mr. Abrams is listed as co-owner and co-founder, but is not connected to the editorial content of the site; he currently serves as chief legal correspondent for ABC News.)And Mr. Lewittes is the son of Joel Lewittes, a former federal judge, also in New York\u2019s Southern District, and his wife, Lee Kushnir Lewittes, is a booker for the Fox News morning show \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d (According to an online newsletter published earlier this year, the Lewittes family attends Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, the Upper East Side synagogue that, until early 2017, counted Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump as members.)While giving verified independent outlets special license to fact-check may help embattled platforms like Facebook and Google help to restore their image in the short-term, in the long-term, as the Weekly Standard episode suggests, the same arrangement has the potential to do more damage.\u201cThe only people \u2018cheated\u2019 here are the tabloid\u2019s readers,\u201d the story said. Around the world, the spheres of politics and entertainment continue to overlap. The need for fact-checking outlets with an understanding of tabloid and celebrity culture, which is now political culture, is only likely to grow. Facebook, as is its way, wouldn\u2019t go into detail about its process for certifying third-party fact checkers. Controversially, the company enforces nondisclosure agreements with fact-checking partners, leaving the facts about fact-checking in a state of shadow. And Gossip Cop, for its part, would not speak of its plans for the future of fact-checking. But there is a world in which Gossip Cop could help determine what celebrity gossip gets to even exist on the internet.The Trump-Daniels affair is an uncomfortable reminder that in 2018, celebrity gossip can regularly be the real news. Almost every outlet that has covered the scandal has quoted or mentioned the story in The Dirty to establish the fact that the rumor predated Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Seven long years ago, Gossip Cop deemed the underlying rumor as false. Maybe more disturbingly, it also was one of only two outlets that bothered to check it out at all. Advertisement"}

He believes in truth too, and in joy \u2014 especially in joy \u2014 and in the brotherhood of humankind and the freedom of the human spirit. Everywhere he goes, he brings a dog-eared copy of Rousseau\u2019s \u201cConfessions\u201d and the battered \u201cAlso Sprach Zarathustra\u201d that he has carried around since his youth in Venezuela. Now he and his orchestra, along with the chorus of the London Symphony, were about to tackle one of the purest expressions of the ideals he finds most stirring \u2014 the final movement of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony, the \u201cOde to Joy.\u201dThe tip of Dudamel\u2019s baton dipped. BOOM! BADADA-DOOM! The timpani thundered in the empty auditorium.

Nicht diese T\u00f6ne!Sondern lasst uns angenehmere anstimmen, undfreudenvollere.O friends! Not these sounds!Let us instead strike up more pleasingand more joyful ones!The instrumentalists were jet-lagged after their flight from Los Angeles. Dudamel himself spent the morning conducting a youth orchestra and then presided, onstage at the Barbican, over the release of a manifesto on the future of the arts written by young people from Los Angeles and Britain. He was exhausted, and he was starting to lose his voice. Slowly, though, over the course of the next hour, the music started to change.Dudamel uses the word \u201cmagic\u201d without hesitation when he talks about music; what happened now was that the Ninth began to be magical. Dudamel moved his hands on the air like a person describing the ocean, and the strings melted. He shook his fist like a king defying god, and happy avalanches crashed down on the empty seats. This, this was what he loved, the plummet and swell of it, the rumble, the hush, the roar when he lifted his arms. The beauty! The joy! The music!When everything comes together like this, when hundreds of people work as one to create something so special, he knows he is right to believe what Maestro Abreu taught him. What can sound na\u00efve and superficial in hard times is actually fundamental. Music can unite the world. The hope of human freedom lives in art. The world will change \u2014 he believes this sincerely \u2014 if people only listen.In Los Angeles, Dudamel conducts one of the best-paid, most critically acclaimed and most financially stable orchestras in America. The base pay for an L.A. Phil musician is more than $150,000, with the top principal making $500,000 or more; Dudamel himself earns just over $3 million a year. The orchestra reported $141 million in revenue in its 2016 tax filings and $170 million the year before that. Dudamel works in one of the world\u2019s great palaces of music, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, a shining silver confetti-burst designed by his close friend Frank Gehry. At times there\u2019s something almost comical about the ease with which the Phil\u2019s success has toppled conventional wisdom. At a moment when classical music is said to be divided between traditionalist audiences and progressive musicians, the Phil draws large, enthusiastic crowds to concerts of challenging new music. At a time when classical music is said to be exclusively for rich white people, hundreds of children from diverse racial and economic backgrounds participate in the Phil\u2019s education program, Youth Orchestra Los Angeles, which Dudamel helped found as one of his first acts after being hired in Los Angeles. Soon YOLA will have a new center in Inglewood, also designed by Gehry.The L.A. Phil\u2019s current season, 2018-19, is its 100th. This fall, it started an ambitious centennial celebration, a yearlong dazzle of world premieres and spectacular performances, with Dudamel squarely at the center. There have been parades, parties, concerts with pop stars. All over the city, on the poles of streetlights, advertising banners show him in the throes of performance, his face rapturous, his baton crashing down, his curls flying. Dudamel loves making music in Los Angeles. \u201cWe are doing something here that is an example of how things can work,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is bringing people together. For people to feel included. You know?\u201d The orchestra was in great shape before he arrived, under its previous music director, the acclaimed Finnish conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, but under Dudamel, it has soared. \u201cYou cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cI see people here sitting, they can be Democrats, they can be Republicans, they can be Catholics, they can be Protestant, or they can be whatever. But they are sitting listening to music. And they say hi and they embrace each other and they talk.\u201dMany conductors see their roles as explicitly political. Daniel Barenboim campaigns for the rights of Palestinians; Leonard Bernstein was famously ridiculed by Tom Wolfe, in his essay \u201cRadical Chic,\u201d for hosting a Black Panthers fund-raiser at his apartment. Dudamel\u2019s approach is more circumspect. A central part of his message is that music is not ideological. It is a way of \u201cbuilding bridges,\u201d he thinks, a language \u201cthat talks to everybody.\u201d The danger of thinking ideologically, he feels, is that \u201cyou get stuck in one or the other side, and we don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t believe in that. I don\u2019t believe in one or the other. I believe in the people that I see.\u201dDudamel is aware of what some people say about him. He tries to tune it out. \u201cPeople will always criticize,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople will always create stories. If you get inside of that, then you don\u2019t live, you don\u2019t have a life.\u201dThose are hard questions. But for now? The music is marvelous, the long days are full of pleasure and all the time, he says, \u201cI get more and more and more in love with what I do.\u201dDidn\u2019t Rousseau say somewhere that we carry our own happiness with us, in our hearts?That first day, though, he was only clowning around. This was in Barquisimeto, Dudamel\u2019s hometown, the capital of the northwestern Venezuelan state of Lara. The teacher didn\u2019t show up for his orchestra class, so Dudamel got up from his seat in the violin section and pretended to lead the rehearsal. His friends laughed. But then something happened that no one could explain. The mood in the room changed. He asked the class to play a passage, and he found that being up there, directing the music, felt perfectly natural to him. He seemed to know what to say, and how to move, to make the young musicians follow him. His friends stopped laughing and started working on the piece. The teacher, arriving late, watched from the back of the room. Afterward he asked Dudamel to be his assistant conductor.El Sistema is legendary in Venezuela. There is no way to talk about Gustavo Dudamel, its most famous product, without reckoning with the ways in which El Sistema influenced him or with the ways in which he was molded by its director, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abreu.Abreu: almost as legendary in Venezuela as the institution he founded. Picture him: A gaunt, penetrating man, bald, with a prominent brow, glasses and a crooked mouth. Jacket and tie; heavy overcoat even in the summer. In 1975, Abreu, who studied economics as well as music, and who served in the Venezuelan congress, started a new youth orchestra, dedicated to the idea that music can inspire social change. The first meeting was held in a parking garage. The \u201corchestra\u201d was made up of a handful of teenagers. He had a gift for uniting followers behind his vision; within a year, he had built an ensemble, taken it to a festival in Scotland and won critical praise for his work. He persuaded the government to finance what he soon began to see as his movement.What Abreu\u2019s message consisted of \u2014 what sort of social change El Sistema was meant to promulgate \u2014 was not always precisely clear. His statements tended toward the gnomic: The orchestra is an ideal image of society; music strengthens the spiritual development of the country; students who play in an orchestra develop a different set of values. He was also a canny politician who knew how to frame El Sistema\u2019s message to suit the priorities of whatever government happened to be in power. Are you a revolutionary socialist with strong authoritarian tendencies? Meet our symphony, which projects a proud national image and elevates children in poverty. (Please remember these keywords when it\u2019s time to renew our funding.)The older maestro was no fool. He knew what he had when he saw it. One reason it matters that all children have access to the arts, after all, is that the history of the world is a graveyard of lost geniuses. Think about the poems, songs and paintings that might have been, if a wider range of people had been given the tools to create them; if women, say, had been encouraged to explore their creativity rather than having it forcibly repressed for millenniums or if poor children had been taught to read. The mind reels. The symphonies we don\u2019t have are greater than the symphonies we do.There\u2019s the physical element, of course: the ability to communicate the rhythm, flow, texture and shifting moods of a piece of music through a set of traditional (yet freely elaborated) gestures. Conducting is a kind of strange, proactive dance. You move your body not in response to music but in anticipation of it. You need a perfect sense of tempo \u2014 you can have the most fluid wrists in the world, but that won\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t keep good time.The Venezuelan director Alberto Arvelo, who became a close friend of Dudamel\u2019s while filming a 2006 documentary about El Sistema, remembers giving Dudamel a copy of the score for the film, music he had never seen before. Dudamel read it as if it were a poem, turning the pages, smiling at the happy parts, looking sad when the mood darkened.More mysterious is the gift of communication. How do you put across your understanding of a musical work to the group of musicians whose performance of it will usher it into existence? Musicians who work with Dudamel tend to say that what sets him apart from other conductors isn\u2019t anything grand or obvious; it\u2019s an accumulation of small moments. How he speaks to them. How he listens to them.It was the end of May, the end of the season. On Friday night, the Phil would begin its final run of performances before moving for the summer from the Disney Hall (indoors, posh) to the Hollywood Bowl (outdoors, Sting plays there, you can eat a Snickers in your seat). For the finale of the orchestra\u2019s 99th season, essentially the lead-in to this year\u2019s centennial extravaganza, Dudamel was putting on \u201cDas Paradies und die Peri,\u201d Schumann\u2019s gigantic concert oratorio: nearly two hours long, renowned singers in dramatic roles, a huge chorus, shattering climaxes, tunes for days. The text tells the story of a Peri, a kind of benevolent fallen angel, who can gain admission to heaven only by bringing the proper gift to the gates of paradise. She tries three times, in escalatingly romantic-allegorical ways, and it\u2019s the third gift, the last tear of a sinner who repented on his deathbed, that causes the gates to open. The Peri enters heaven, to cloudbursts and hosannas.Famous in Schumann\u2019s lifetime, \u201cDas Paradies,\u201d composed in 1843, is seldom performed now; Dudamel came across it a few years ago and immediately felt he\u2019d discovered a masterpiece. \u201cI was like, my God,\u201d he whispers, recalling the moment. \u201cWhat is this? My God, how to deal for such a long time with that amount of beauty?\u201dThe difficulty seemed great enough when he was studying the score on his own, but once he began working with the musicians, it became even more pronounced. On Tuesday of that week, when the full chorus came in to rehearse with the soloists, Dudamel realized that the production design had caused them to be seated too far back, all the way behind the stage, in seats normally reserved for audience members, from which hinterland they couldn\u2019t see him properly and couldn\u2019t hear the soloists. The chorus members had little LED lights that clipped onto their music folders so they could see their scores in the dark; from the podium, they looked like a sea of distant white pinpricks. Then on Wednesday, when the singers were joined by the full orchestra, it became clear that the location of the soloists\u2019 elevated platform, which was positioned above and behind the instrumentalists, would make it hard for the Peri and others to be heard over the strings and winds. Now the singers were all out of sync, and the orchestra members were playing too loudly, because they weren\u2019t listening to the singers at all.The way Dudamel looks at it, he\u2019s not a ruler; he\u2019s more like an ally of the players. He is on hand to offer his thoughts, help them sound their best. Cooperation gets better results. Musicians, he thinks, are like everyone else. Music is supposed to feel good. Doesn\u2019t everyone do their best when they feel good?Dudamel does not see it that way, however. From his perspective, life is a series of invisibly overlapping moments, and he has lived each one as sincerely as he could. \u201cMy path,\u201d he says, \u201cthis path has been so natural.\u201d All his experiences have led him here, to this place where he feels so happy. Why would he draw lines? Every day is new.He goes hiking now, for instance. Maria, his new wife, takes him, and not in a million years could he ever have seen himself doing that. But he does it because he loves her, and because he loves her, he finds that he loves it, too. Being in love \u2014 nothing is more beautiful than that! Love is \u201cpure, pure, pure inspiration,\u201d he says. Love expands your horizons in ways you never could have imagined. Life is not about measuring up to arbitrary stages. Life is about staying open to the experience of life.He was sitting in his office, an hour or so before the season\u2019s final concert. Martin, his 7-year-old son, was encamped behind his desk, playing Minecraft on the iMac. Outside the door, Dudamel\u2019s assistant, Ebner Sobalvarro, a young man with a shaved head and rimless glasses, sat at his own desk, greeting the musicians going past with their instrument cases. An oboist was warming up down the hall. A soprano sang scales.How to deal for such a long time with this amount of beauty? When so much of the world is not, cannot be, beautiful? It made him sad, he said, so sad, to see the suffering in the world, the hunger, the misery in Venezuela. \u201cVery complex and very bad,\u201d Dudamel told me. In 2014, amid falling oil prices and violence in the streets, Dudamel and Abreu appeared on television with Maduro, to look at the blueprints for a new concert hall in Barquisimeto. It would be designed by Frank Gehry and named after Dudamel.El Sistema views music as a source of social change, but depends on the good will of an authoritarian government for its survival; hence perhaps Dudamel\u2019s reluctance to speak explicitly about politics. The more political he becomes, the more he puts his social movement at risk. Now he was rehearsing with the Bol\u00edvars, but only over FaceTime, and there were rumors on music blogs that he had been banned from going home or that Maduro would have him arrested if he tried. A Mi Maestro, the two-concert celebration of Abreu\u2019s life that he organized in June, was held in Chile, not in Venezuela. He told me he would go back to Venezuela. \u201cIt is not yet the time,\u201d he said.But, I asked, what if avoiding ideology only plays into the hands of the people abusing their power? Is there a line beyond which the only possible response is resistance?\u201cI believe in people,\u201d he said gently. \u201cIt makes me sad sometimes. It makes me desperate. But at the same time, I take all of that to, to, I don\u2019t know, to the muscle, or to this part of the soul that is optimistic, and I see things can be better.\u201dHow to see the parable that connects one note to another? It occurred to him that the struggle to make a better world was like the struggle in \u201cDas Paradies.\u201d \u201cYou cross all that\u201d \u2014 you pass through the time of hardship, like the Peri through her trials, and then you find the tear of heaven, listening, music, togetherness \u2014 \u201cYou arrive to the paradise,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd paradise is here. You cannot expect to see the paradise in another place. We have to think the paradise is here. In this planet we have to make the paradise work.\u201dHe remembered a quote he loved, about democracy and happiness. He couldn\u2019t remember who said it. It was a woman, he thought. A religious woman. How did it go?Dudamel got up from his chair. He called to his assistant and asked for help translating the phrase. Ebner stood in the doorway, his head modestly bowed, light gleaming off his smooth scalp.\u201cIt is the sum of the happiness of the people,\u201d Ebner said.\u201cDemocracy,\u201d Dudamel said, and smiled.Brian Phillips is the author of \u201cImpossible Owls: Essays.\u201d This is his first feature article for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ghosn Arrest Exposes Stress in Japanese-French Auto Marriage", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is probably never a good time for an auto empire to have its leader thrown in jail. But for Nissan and Renault, the arrest of Carlos Ghosn comes at an especially inopportune moment.The two carmakers can ill afford turmoil in the alliance headed by Mr. Ghosn when the global auto market is entering a downturn, a trade war provoked by the Trump administration is interfering with supply chains and Silicon Valley is spawning well-financed new competitors.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest in Tokyo this week on suspicion that he deceived Japanese authorities about his pay package, exposed deep fissures in the union between Renault and Nissan that he engineered in 1999, and which Mitsubishi Motors joined in 2016.Whatever the outcome of legal proceedings against Mr. Ghosn, he is unlikely to regain his previous stature. Instead, analysts said, there could be a destructive power struggle within the alliance as Nissan tries to assert more control. Renault has been the dominant partner of the three carmakers even though Nissan sells more cars, a state of affairs that appears to rankle executives in Tokyo.Hiroto Saikawa, the chief executive of Nissan, made no attempt to disguise his enmity toward Mr. Ghosn after his arrest Monday. Even though Mr. Ghosn has not been formally charged with a crime, Mr. Saikawa told reporters Monday that his boss\u2019s behavior had been intolerable and he would recommend his removal as the company\u2019s chairman.The Nissan board followed through on Thursday with a unanimous vote to remove Mr. Ghosn as chairman and to eliminate Greg Kelly, a board member and former human resources director, who has also been implicated in the financial misconduct allegation. Mr. Ghosn stepped down as Nissan\u2019s chief executive last year, but remained chairman and continued to lead the alliance, also serving as chairman at Mitsubishi, and chairman and chief executive at Renault.The board also emphasized, in a statement, that \u201cthe long-standing Alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged and that the mission is to minimize the potential impact and confusion on the day-to-day cooperation among the Alliance partners.\u201dThe statement was telling \u2014 and fell in line with the economic realities of the industry. Regardless of whatever problems the two carmakers may be having in their relationship, analysts say, they would be in much worse shape alone. Other car companies are trying to get bigger, joining forces with onetime rivals so they can share the enormous costs of developing electric, so-called self-driving cars.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has made no secret about its desire to merge with another big carmaker. Ford and Volkswagen are discussing cooperation on the production of commercial vehicles. Honda and General Motors have formed a partnership to develop autonomous vehicles.\u201cBreaking the alliance would be a very negative thing for all of the parties,\u201d said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a market research firm. \u201cCarmakers are realizing that being alone is more difficult. Going out of the alliance would be going against the trend.\u201dTo some extent the companies were victims of circumstances beyond their control. Nissan was hit by slowdowns in the United States and China, the world\u2019s two biggest car markets. Renault suffered from declines in emerging markets like Africa and India. Renault also felt some collateral damage in a geopolitical conflict after it bet big on Iran, then was forced to withdraw after the United States restored sanctions.But analysts also question company strategies that Mr. Ghosn, the dominant personality at Nissan, Renault, Mitsubishi and the alliance among them, championed. The United States is a prominent example.Nissan has long been perceived as the No. 3 Japanese automaker in America after Toyota and Honda. As the auto industry recovered after the 2008 recession, Mr. Ghosn laid out a new global strategy that called for increasing the company\u2019s U.S. market share to more than 10 percent \u2014 about a 50 percent increase from 2007 \u2014 in hopes of pushing past Honda.To drive sales, Nissan heavily discounted prices, often in ways that caused dealers to lose money on some sales. Under a strategy called \u201cGrow or Go,\u201d it pushed small dealerships to sell or close their franchises. At the same time it favored certain \u201cpreferred\u201d dealers by secretly paying them up to $1 million or more to help them build plush, new showrooms.While Nissan achieved its market-share goal for a while, it also alienated many dealers, and even some who were profitable sold their franchises because of the company\u2019s practices.And this year, with overall United States sales flat, Nissan\u2019s sales have declined 6.5 percent through October. It has been particularly hard hit by slumping sales of sedans.\u201cThey have increased market share,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader, an online buying and selling platform. \u201cBut they have not done it in a way that is healthy.\u201dNissan is not in a good position now that the United States market is losing steam, Ms. Krebs said.\u201cCar sales are edging downward,\u201d she said. \u201cOther carmakers are ramping up their incentives. Where have they got to go? They already have big incentives.\u201dRenault would be in an even weaker position as a stand-alone company. It is a minor player in China and has no presence in the United States. Without a substantial footprint in those two giant markets, it has little hope of achieving the scale needed to bargain for the best prices from suppliers and invest in new technologies.All traditional carmakers are trying to maintain their existing businesses, rooted in internal combustion engines, and at the same time they are investing heavily to develop autonomous, electric vehicles. Those new products are not yet generating profits, and there is competition from companies like Uber and Google, which are using their formidable financial resources to move into the car companies\u2019 turf.Car companies also face higher prices for steel and aluminum because of tariffs that President Trump has imposed on imports from foreign producers. And the levies he has imposed on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory tariffs from China, have interfered with the flow of car parts.Those challenges may help explain why Renault has been more reluctant than Nissan to cut Mr. Ghosn loose. The company appointed an interim replacement, Thierry Bollor\u00e9, the company\u2019s chief operating officer. But Mr. Ghosn remains chief executive even though he occupies a jail cell in Tokyo, apparently prohibited even from communicating with his family.Sooner or later, though, the companies will not be able to avoid a painful re-examination of their relationship.\u201cWe have seen there are differences,\u201d Mr. Munoz of JATO Dynamics said, \u201cas beautiful as it seemed when Ghosn was in charge.\u201dNeal E. Boudette contributed reporting from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How China Is Rewriting Its Own Script", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "\nWhen was the last time you watched a movie with a Chinese villain?If you can\u2019t remember, that may not be too surprising. Take the 2012 remake of the Cold War drama \u201cRed Dawn.\u201d It  depicted Chinese enemies invading an American town.In the end, MGM spent $1 million digitally erasing evidence of the Chinese Army, frame by frame, and substituting in North Koreans instead.China wields enormous influence over how it is depicted in the movies Americans make and watch. It\u2019s part of a broader push by the government to take control of its global narrative and present a friendlier, less menacing image of China to the world.China\u2019s booming box office and seemingly inexhaustible cash reserves have provided a much-needed boost to Hollywood as it faces slowing ticket sales in the United States and challenges from Amazon and Netflix.But Hollywood\u2019s embrace of China has not come without strings attached.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see something that\u2019s like \u2018Seven Years in Tibet\u2019 anymore,\u201d said Larry Shinagawa, a professor at Hawaii Tokai International College who specializes in Asian and Asian-American studies. Studios that make films critical of China, he said, risk being banned from releasing movies in the country.At stake for China is more than just the validation of Hollywood\u2019s powerbrokers and celebrities. In speeches and at forums, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well\u201d \u2014 to make sure a coherent, compelling and, most important, Communist Party-sanctioned narrative of China\u2019s rise to power reaches global audiences.\u201cThere is a notion that its propaganda has not worked well enough,\u201d said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cSo this is where the film industry comes in. There\u2019s a real sensitivity to the blockbuster power of Hollywood.\u201dChina has raised its influence in Hollywood by bankrolling a growing number of top-tier films.Of the top 100 highest-grossing films worldwide each year from 1997 to 2013, China helped finance only 12 Hollywood movies:199719992000200520062007200820102012201319971999200020052006200720082010201220131997199920002005200620072008201020122013But in the five years that followed, China co-financed 41 top-grossing Hollywood films:201520162014201720182014201520162017201820142015201620172018Hollywood studios are also eager to grab a slice of China\u2019s fast-growing box office market, which surpassed the United States\u2019 in total revenue for the first time ever in the first quarter of 2018.Success in China can make up for a disappointing box office performance at home or even transform a hit into a global blockbuster. By the same token, getting shut out of the Chinese market can be devastating for a movie.That\u2019s a powerful incentive to avoid causing any offense to China.One of China\u2019s top movie regulators spelled it out in a speech at the U.S.-China Film Summit in Los Angeles in 2013.\u201cWe have a huge market, and we want to share it with you,\u201d said Zhang Xun, then the president of the state-owned China Film Co-Production Corporation, speaking to a room full of Hollywood executives.Then came the condition. \u201cWe want films that are heavily invested in Chinese culture, not one or two shots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see positive Chinese images.\u201dChina\u2019s campaign to push a positive image abroad has extended beyond Hollywood.Since then, China has stepped away from the big-budget co-production model, focusing instead on making features that cater to its large and still-expanding domestic market. To do that, it has enlisted Hollywood talent \u2014  producers, technical experts and even top celebrities.But they have had to walk a fine line.A number of actors, musicians and other celebrities have been barred from entering the country over behavior deemed inappropriate or critical of the Chinese Communist Party.Here\u2019s why some of them were barred from China:The difference in the \u201cChinese perspective\u201d was most evident in CGTN\u2019s coverage this year of an unexpected proposal to abolish presidential term limits in China\u2019s Constitution. While Western news media outlets raced to explain why the amendment, which would open the door to President Xi\u2019s indefinite rule, was unprecedented, CGTN\u2019s anchors were calm \u2014 and eerily synchronized \u2014 in their message praising the change.It is difficult to tell whether China\u2019s push to soften its image through movies, media and cultural projects has been successful.\u201cChinese soft power has not been that successful outside of the developing world,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies Chinese society and cinema. \u201cIf China does have any soft power, it\u2019s probably because of the success of their economy and the Chinese model that they\u2019re pushing very hard now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A tangle of political boundaries and postal zones, school districts and community associations means many neighborhoods that appear to be part of one place actually belong to another.Searching for a home in the affluent village of Bronxville, N.Y., for instance, yields a long list of properties that are technically in the city of Yonkers. The two share a ZIP code (10708), although they\u2019re separated by the skinny Bronx River, with Yonkers on the west side and Bronxville on the east.

But in the neighborhood of Lawrence Park West \u2014 which encompasses adjacent enclaves like Cedar Knolls, Longvale and Armour Villa \u2014 properties can trade for a third of the cost of similar Bronxville versions. Taxes are also steeply discounted relative to those of their neighbor, another major selling point.On the flip side, Yonkers\u2019s public schools are considered weaker than Bronxville\u2019s. But many residents say the trade-off is worth it.\u201cWe feel like it\u2019s a gift to not pay the same taxes but still be a part of the community. That\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d said Nonie Flannery, 59, who bought a four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom 1900 house in the summer of 2016 for $835,000, with her husband, Robert, 61, a Manhattan lawyer.Their property and school taxes total $9,000, Ms. Flannery said, although she pointed out that Yonkers, like New York City, imposes an income tax.A stay-at-home-mother to six children, Ms. Flannery may be a good judge. For 14 years, she lived in Bronxville, in a vintage colonial with the same number of bedrooms as the house she has now, but her property taxes were about $48,000 a year. To be fair, she pointed out, her previous house was larger and on a bigger lot. The true tax discount, brokers say, is about 50 percent.Buyers also get confused. \u201cI always thought Yonkers wasn\u2019t very nice. And then you get to Lawrence Park West, and you say, \u2018This is Yonkers, too?\u2019\u201d said Donna Bancroft-Lewis, who bought a six-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom colonial built in 1922 on about a quarter of an acre last fall. It cost just under $1 million.Indeed, Ms. Bancroft-Lewis, who works in finance in Manhattan and shares the house with her husband, Bryan Lewis, 45, a retired police officer, and their two young children, said she didn\u2019t even really realize she lived in Yonkers until she received a city bill.When the family lived in a three-bedroom house in Colonial Heights, a hillier part of Yonkers, getting around on foot was tough. Now, Ms. Bancroft-Lewis said, she can hoof it anywhere within minutes. \u201cI can actually do things,\u201d she joked, \u201cinstead of being trapped on top of a mountain.\u201dA diversity of housing stock and terrain makes up this eastern swath of Yonkers, with Lawrence Park West perhaps the area\u2019s highest-profile enclave. Nearby, on rectilinear streets where Tudors are interspersed with more prosaic houses, is Sunnyside Park, a once-common moniker that has fallen off maps. Other micro-neighborhoods are minuscule, like Longvale, which comprises a few blocks along Millard Avenue.North of the Sprain Brook Parkway, which cleaves the neighborhood, is Cedar Knolls, a 145-property historic district (announced by brown street signs) that is one of four such districts in Yonkers. Capacious Tudors, a common style in southern Westchester, are prevalent.East of Chatfield Road is Armour Villa, the oldest and most diverse of the historic districts, with open-porch Victorians, stucco-walled 1930s colonials and the occasional raised ranch.\u201cI\u2019ve traveled a lot,\u201d said Mr. Wagner, who moved to the area from the Upper West Side in 1988 after family members were mugged. \u201cI think this is the best place to live in the country.\u201dCo-ops are plentiful, some of them in handsome prewar mid-rises along Pondfield, others in Brooklands, a three-building, 138-unit complex. Condominiums, though, are rare; red-brick conversions of rentals include 1133 Midland and Rockledge Manor.Prices are relatively stable. As of early November, 183 single-family houses, condos and co-ops had sold in 2018 for an average price of $457,000, according to Zillow\u2019s data; during the same period in 2017, 177 homes sold, at an average price of $494,000.But the 2017 tax law limiting property-tax deductions has been chilling the market, said Joseph B. Houlihan, an owner of the local Houlihan & O\u2019Malley Real Estate Services: \u201cWe\u2019re in a market that doesn\u2019t know where it is.\u201dThere are ample rentals, including co-op sublets. The least expensive unit, a one-bedroom at the Bronxville Terrace co-op, was $1,450 a month, according to Zillow, while the priciest was a two-bedroom at the Deco-style Croydon co-op for $2,800.A natural spot to bike and jog is the Bronx River Reservation, a path-lined, river-hugging park.In Yonkers, students are not zoned but select their schools, although preference is given to nearby residents, according to city policy.One local option is the Patricia A. DiChiaro School, which offers prekindergarten through eighth grade for about 520 students. On 2017-2018 state exams, 59 percent met standards in math, versus 45 percent statewide, and 50 percent met standards in English, versus 45 percent statewide.Occasionally students from outside the village of Bronxville may enroll in Bronxville\u2019s public schools, if there is room; the cost is $20,220 a year for kindergarten to sixth grade and $25,752 for seventh to 12th grade, said Connie Lourentzatos, a clerk, who added that it is usually easier to enroll in the high school. Of the 1,652 students currently enrolled in Bronxville\u2019s schools, 10 are from outside the village, she said. St. Joseph\u2019s, a Catholic school in Bronxville, is also well liked.Metro-North Railroad has a Bronxville stop on its Harlem Line. From the red-tile-roof station, commuters can catch seven trains to Grand Central between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. Trips take between 32 and 44 minutes, and a monthly pass is $239. The station is a short, pleasant walk from most parts of Lawrence Park West. The Fleetwood station, on the same line, is also a possibility.Bee-Line buses offer a handful of routes, with one, the BxM4C, running to Midtown Manhattan for $7.50.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dating App, Not the Parents, Brought Them Together", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsThough both were unattached 20-year-old accounting students at the time, Ms. Sagnia remembers Ms. Kaur outlining a few must-haves for her future wedding.\u201cShe liked a lot of greenery, and there was this flower crown she wanted to wear that was really earthy and ethereal,\u201d said Ms. Sagnia, a certified public accountant in Harrison, N.J.One thing Ms. Kaur, now 26 and also a C.P.A., was unsure about was whether she would find her future husband herself, or if her parents would arrange her marriage.\u201cObviously I knew there were people out there who meet someone and fall in love and have a love marriage,\u201d said Ms. Kaur, whose parents immigrated from Punjab, India, in the 1980s and now live in Bordentown, N.J.But arranged marriages, from her perspective, can have a lot to offer. \u201cPeople think, why would you ever want your parents to choose your spouse,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I say, Are you kidding me? If my parents are going to set me up with someone who\u2019s educated and stable and from a nice family, those are major boxes to check. I was definitely open to it.\u201d\u201cI was checking my phone now and then, but I had no signal,\u201d he said. It was late in the day by the time he kicked the dirt off his boots and saw a picture of a wavy haired, big-smiling Indian woman on the app. \u201cI had to make a quick decision. I was like, yes, let\u2019s try this.\u201dDays later, after a flurry of texts in which they found that Mr. Mattson\u2019s best friend since sixth grade, Corey Wu, was an accounting classmate of Ms. Kaur\u2019s at Rider, they met in Princeton, a town between their then-residences, his in Old Bridge and hers in Morristown. Coffee was the plan. But the parts of Mr. Mattson\u2019s profile that initially attracted Ms. Kaur, including his work at the time as a physics researcher at Rutgers University, proved worth exploring in a more in-depth way.After coffee they decided to have dinner, then go for a walk and have ice cream, and walk some more. Their date lasted seven hours, past 2 a.m.\u201cGreg was just this cute guy with really blue eyes, and I like to learn and he was a researcher, and I was like, great, he\u2019s interesting,\u201d Ms. Kaur said.Most of the men she had been meeting online were not. \u201cI kept coming across finance bros; they\u2019re very into themselves,\u201d she said. The prospect of dating someone her parents selected \u2014 someone Indian who practiced Sikhism, like them \u2014 was on the back burner after a series of unsuccessful phone setups in her early 20s. \u201cIt never got to an actual date,\u201d with suitors her parents chose, Ms. Kaur said. But if her parents were disappointed, they didn\u2019t let on.\u201cOf course they wanted it to work out, but I don\u2019t think they took it personally,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they never made me feel like I was doing something wrong that was making it impossible to arrange my marriage. I think they realized that it\u2019s just not as easy as people think. Especially here in the U.S.\u201dMs. Kaur was not thinking about marriage after her first few dates with Mr. Mattson. Too much was unsettled with him.He knew around the time of their first date that soon he would be applying to graduate schools. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I\u2019d end up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe agreed early on, after two or three dates, that what we had was good, but that we weren\u2019t that serious yet, so we shouldn\u2019t start planning any big decisions around it.\u201dMs. Kaur accepted Mr. Mattson\u2019s imminent move without reservations. \u201cWe were on the same page about it,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, let\u2019s just be honest with each other.\u201dNot that she hadn\u2019t daydreamed about moving far from New Jersey with Mr. Mattson. \u201cA lot of times when you\u2019re in an arranged marriage you don\u2019t meet someone from down the street, you end up moving,\u201d she said. Despite her closeness to her parents and extended family in New Jersey, \u201cI knew moving away would be a possibility if I went that route.\u201d Moving for a love marriage would be the same: hard but doable.When Mr. Mattson was accepted to the University of Illinois and moved to Urbana in the fall of 2016, neither was ready to call the relationship quits, even temporarily.\u201cWe were talking as much as possible,\u201d Mr. Mattson said. \u201cWe found this app where we could log in and share a screen so we could watch movies together.\u201dThey also went on formal \u201cvideo dates.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d both pick up the same takeout and have dinner together, on our computers,\u201d Ms. Kaur said. \u201cGreg would wear a button-up and tie, and I would no longer be in sweatpants.\u201dBy the start of his second year in graduate school, Mr. Mattson was ready to propose. He had never met her family. (Both sets of parents declined to be named because of privacy concerns.)\u201cI remember sitting down and giving the idea of getting engaged some actual thought. Like, Is this the best thing? Is this what I want?,\u201d he said. From his Urbana apartment, \u201cI decided yes.\u201dMr. Mattson knew Ms. Kaur\u2019s parents would likely not have included him on a shortlist of most eligible grooms. When Ms. Kaur arranged a Sunday brunch at her parents\u2019 house during Mr. Mattson\u2019s visit in October 2017, he was nervous.\u201cThere was this layer of being nervous to meet your significant other\u2019s parents as a baseline. Then there was the whole other layer of the cultural issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how forward-thinking her parents would be.\u201d Ms. Kaur convinced him they would be welcoming. And they were.\u201cWe\u2019re both big Harry Potter fans. It\u2019s one of the first things we talked about on the dating app, before we even exchanged numbers,\u201d Mr. Mattson said. On Jan. 3, after a full day at the amusement park during which he had to beg a security guard not to make him empty his pockets \u2014 they contained a moissanite solitaire ring he bought in Chicago \u2014 he proposed in the hotel room.\u201cOne of the elements in the first \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 book is an enchanted mirror that doesn\u2019t show your reflection, but what you truly desire,\u201d he said. \u201cI stood in front of the mirror with her and said, You know what I see? It\u2019s a yes.\u201d Then he dropped to one knee and proposed.Ms. Kaur said she was too overwhelmed to verbalize a response. \u201cI just nodded like an idiot and cried. I couldn\u2019t speak for like 10 minutes.\u201dWhen an engaged couple\u2019s religions don\u2019t match, bride and groom often choose a nondenominational ceremony or default to the more religious partner\u2019s traditions. Ms. Kaur wasn\u2019t comfortable with those options.The 10-person bridal party, in long, autumn-inspired burgundy dresses, included Ms. Sagnia, and on the grooms\u2019 side, Mr. Wu. Ms. Kaur wore a traditional white wedding gown in an A-line shape with a lace, boat-neck top, Mr. Mattson a royal blue suit. About 90 guests lined the pews, some who had made the trip from India.After initial prayers, accompanied by three turbaned, heavily bearded granthis playing hand drums and harmonium, the granthi placed a scarf worn by Mr. Mattson in Ms. Kaur\u2019s hands. Bride and groom were then instructed to stand and circle the holy book a total of four times, with pauses to sit and pray between each round. Ten male relatives standing at intervals around the holy book were there to symbolically \u201cpass off\u201d Ms. Kaur to Mr. Mattson, and make it known that they will continue to nurture and protect her once she leaves home.After the holidays, Ms. Kaur will move to Illinois and start looking for accounting work. \u201cI\u2019m really going to miss my family,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be different and it\u2019s going to be difficult.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Soon to Be Alone in Oakland, the A\u2019s Inch Closer to a New Stadium", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn BaseballIt all seems so perfect, naturally, in the artist\u2019s rendering of the Oakland Athletics\u2019 proposed new stadium. Fans of all kinds flock to the ballpark by Howard Terminal \u2014 young, old, black, white, one in a wheelchair, one walking a dog. The distinctive silver cargo loaders on the bay loom to the left, while a military flyover roars overhead. The marquee declares this the 2023 World Series.That would mark 33 years since the Athletics\u2019 last appearance in the World Series, a stretch that would nearly rival the franchise\u2019s chasm between pennants from 1931 to 1972. Those fruitless decades were eventful, at least, as the franchise migrated from Philadelphia to Kansas City to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, where it has remained.Twenty-two teams have changed ballparks in the last 30 seasons, creating more revenue and a better fan experience than the A\u2019s enjoy in the creaky, charmless facility they share \u2014 for now \u2014 with the Raiders of the N.F.L.The A\u2019s have spent more than a decade trying to escape \u2014 prisoners at Alcatraz had better luck \u2014 but this time, they believe they will finally succeed. If they do, they will play in baseball\u2019s first stadium to fit within a grassy, tree-lined public park on the perimeter above it.For the Athletics, this week\u2019s ballpark announcement caps one of the more interesting seasons in the majors.The ballpark would be their most ambitious adventure of all, as long as it does not become more of the same. Since the middle of the last decade, the A\u2019s have proposed building on the existing Coliseum site in East Oakland; in Fremont, Calif.; in San Jose; and at Oakland\u2019s Laney College, a plan that was halted last December by the board of the Peralta Community College District.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot, especially from the Peralta episode, about how important community engagement is in Oakland, and getting a sense of what the community wants and the pulse,\u201d said Kaval, adding that the team had held hundreds of one-on-one meetings and hosted dozens of workshops with civic groups. \u201cWe think that\u2019s an important differentiator.\u201dThe A\u2019s pledge to privately finance the entire project \u2014 with the nonspecific price tag of \u201chundreds of millions,\u201d Kaval said \u2014 but do not expect to break ground for at least two years. A legally mandated environmental-impact study will take about a year, with a 270-day window to resolve any possible lawsuits. The A\u2019s also must complete negotiations with the Port of Oakland to control the 55-acre site, and reach a development deal with the city on how to pay for infrastructure changes.Kaval is the former president of Major League Soccer\u2019s San Jose Earthquakes, who privately financed a $100 million stadium in 2015. That experience involved many of the same challenges, he said, which gives him reason for hope.Before Kaval joined the A\u2019s in 2016, the team had spent years trying in vain to move to San Jose, where the Giants hold territorial rights. In the meantime, the other Oakland teams struck deals to move. The Warriors will open a waterfront arena in San Francisco next season, and the Raiders, who are building a stadium in Las Vegas, could leave Oakland as soon as next season.The Athletics\u2019 plan includes redevelopment of the Coliseum site, which they have offered to buy from the city and county, to preserve Oracle Arena for concerts and other events. The Coliseum itself would be razed, though a baseball field would remain, as it does at the site of the old Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The parking lots would turn into residences, offices, retail space and a tech campus.\u201cWe feel a great sense of responsibility in being the last professional sports team in Oakland,\u201d Kaval said. \u201cI think there is a groundswell of support around that, from the elected leaders and the populace, everyone in the East Bay, to do whatever we can do to make sure it\u2019s a success.\u201dThe A\u2019s are using the term \u201cjewel box\u201d to describe the stadium, which would have around 34,000 seats, essentially the fewest in the game and almost 15,000 fewer than they have at the Coliseum, not including the tarped-off football seats high above the outfield. The A\u2019s wanted a sleek, modern feel \u2014 not a 1990s-style throwback \u2014 and Kaval is pleased that some members of the Danish design firm, Bjarke Ingels Group, have no knowledge of baseball.\u201cThey had people on the team who had never been to a baseball game,\u201d he said. \u201cThey approached it almost like an anthropologist would approach ancient Mayans playing a sport, asking all these questions that never get asked.\u201dBesides the leafy walking paths that will ring the top of the venue, the A\u2019s envision other curiosities like a retractable hitters\u2019 backdrop beneath the center-field scoreboard. But with the closest Bay Area Rapid Transit station about a mile away, the team is proposing using aerial gondolas to take fans from downtown to Jack London Square near the stadium.Bringing it all to life, as always, will be the hard part. Kaval is convinced there are treasures in that jewel box of dreams.\u201cOur team already does amazing work with what they have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to think of what that new version of the future could be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Buy a Used Phone Without Getting Fleeced", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew smartphone season is here, but last year\u2019s models can offer similarly impressive features at great discounts. These tips will help you grab one without regretting it later.Apple, Samsung and Google have all launched their new phones. Everyone in the world is itching to upgrade to the latest and greatest, but not you. You\u2019re a deal hunter, and while everyone else is paying $1,000 or more for a shiny new device, you\u2019re buying a used version of last year\u2019s almost-as-good model for a fraction of the cost. Here\u2019s how to get a deal without getting scammed.When a carrier blacklists a device \u2014 which can happen if the device is reported as lost or stolen, or if someone sells it while it\u2019s still on a payment plan \u2014 it can\u2019t be activated on any carrier. That means you\u2019ll be stuck with a $400 paperweight.Some sellers may prefer to keep the IMEI private, and that\u2019s fine \u2014 as long as you have a return policy and buyer protection, you can check the IMEI after receiving the phone. You\u2019ll just have to go through the hassle of returning it if something goes wrong.If you\u2019d rather buy locally and hold the device before handing over your hard-earned cash, Mr. Edwards recommends checking the IMEI in person. \u201cWhen I was buying phones on Craigslist, I would always insist on meeting in a carrier store for the transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cThen the carrier can check to see if it\u2019s blacklisted.\u201dAgain, none of this is foolproof since a phone can be reported lost, stolen or unpaid-for after you\u2019ve purchased it, but it\u2019s a good thing to check before you do.These days, many phones are compatible with multiple networks. But there are two caveats: You need to make sure the device isn\u2019t software-locked to another carrier, and you need to make sure its hardware is optimized for your carrier.When you buy a phone directly from Verizon, AT&T or another carrier, it usually comes \u201ccarrier locked.\u201d That means that phone will only be usable on Verizon, AT&T or whatever carrier you bought it from unless you ask them to unlock it.If you\u2019re buying a used phone, you want to make sure it isn\u2019t locked to a carrier other than your own. If you\u2019re on AT&T, you can\u2019t buy a phone that\u2019s locked to Verizon. You\u2019ll either want an AT&T-branded phone or a phone that\u2019s listed as \u201cunlocked\u201d by the seller.In addition, \u201csome phones have a few different numeric models that work better on some carriers than others,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cFor full and optimal compatibility, you need to pay attention to the specifics.\u201dThat means you shouldn\u2019t just search for \u201ciPhone 7\u201d and buy the cheapest listing that pops up. The iPhone 7 A1660 may look nearly identical to the A1778, but the former works on all carriers, while the latter lacks support for some of the technologies used on Verizon and Sprint. In other cases, you may run into \u201cinternational\u201d models, which can lack support for certain features (like Samsung Pay, in the case of the international version of the Galaxy S7).If you aren\u2019t sure which model numbers are compatible with your network, check on the manufacturer\u2019s website, or Google around to find out which model your carrier sells; then, search for that on your marketplace of choice.Once you\u2019re able to hold the phone \u2014 whether during a physical meetup or after receiving it in the mail \u2014 be sure to inspect it for damage. If you\u2019re meeting in person, find a spot with good light, so you can inspect the phone slowly and carefully.\u201cObviously, scratches, dents and cracked glass will be evident by handling the phone,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cWater damage is harder to spot from the outside of the phone, but every phone usually does have one or two moisture indicators \u2014 sometimes behind the battery, sometimes in the SIM card tray. That\u2019s one of those things that should be checked once you\u2019ve got the phone in hand.\u201d Before you buy, research to see if there are moisture indicators you can check once you have the device.You\u2019ll also want to turn on the screen and swipe around for a bit. \u201cIf an item\u2019s been repaired or refurbished, it may have been a shoddy repair job,\u201d said Mr. Edwards. \u201cThat can be sometimes be harder to spot, but give the screen a quick usability test once you\u2019ve got it.\u201dIf you don\u2019t find any damage, perform a factory reset on the phone right away to ensure it isn\u2019t locked to the seller\u2019s iCloud or Google account, which will prevent you from using it. If it resets and you\u2019re able to log in with your account, you\u2019re good to go.On the other hand, if you find damage that wasn\u2019t indicated in the listing, you can either call off the purchase, negotiate the price down or \u2014 if the phone was purchased online \u2014 open up a dispute with the seller. Remember, even if you aren\u2019t annoyed by a particular flaw, it could lower the phone\u2019s resale value if you decide to sell it down the line. So it\u2019s usually in your best interest to get a phone in good condition, even if you can get a damaged one for cheaper.There are never any guarantees with buying used, even if you stick to these best practices. In my experience, though, problems are pretty rare, and for every broken device you might receive, you\u2019ll have many more that work perfectly \u2014 and even if you occasionally get fleeced with no recourse, you\u2019ll likely save money in the long run.

{"Headline": "What Kind of Democrat Can Beat Trump in 2020?", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "OpinionThe midterms will answer some questions, but not the biggest one of all.Supported byOpinion ColumnistSo I figured that his thoughts about the best Democrat to take on Trump in 2020 were as germane as anybody\u2019s. He noted that Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Senate candidate in Texas, had impressively crossed the threshold of celebrity. Andrew Gillum, the candidate for governor in Florida, had caught lightning, too.A moderate or a progressive? An old-timer or a newcomer? A woman or a man? That part of the drill is familiar, but it will have an unfamiliar urgency, because Trump ratchets up everything, especially the stakes. [Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]And this time around, assuming that nothing interrupts the president\u2019s bid for a second term, there will be a host of additional questions and concerns. They\u2019re peculiar to his intentionally abrasive personality, his deliberately provocative tactics and his almost mystical domination of the media.But plenty of other prominent Democrats told me that the smartest strategy is to float above the muck, because campaigns are about contrasts and many Americans are desperate for something cleaner and calmer.I happened to reconnect with O\u2019Rourke recently in Fort Worth, Tex., and I asked him about the optimal tone for a Democrat at this juncture and about Avenatti\u2019s and Holder\u2019s repudiations of Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cthey go low, we go high\u201d credo.\u201cAvenatti does not represent us,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told me, meaning most Democrats. \u201cEric Holder \u2014 what he said \u2014 that\u2019s not where we\u2019re at.\u201d He added that among American voters, \u201cthere is a real concern about civility \u2014 not for the sake of manners but for the sake of the country working.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about confronting him where he\u2019s weakest,\u201d said Bob Kerrey, the former senator and former Nebraska governor. \u201cYou have to say to the audience: This country is dangerously divided and it\u2019s on the edge of something awful.\u201d Kerrey said that in a perfect world, a Democratic candidate would go even further than that in the primary and tell voters: \u201cYou\u2019re going to get angry at me, because I\u2019m going to embrace a Republican idea if it feels good. Don\u2019t expect me to be 100 percent \u2014 100 percent may make you happy, but it won\u2019t pull this country together.\u201d Standing out will require one nonnegotiable quality: the vividness to loosen Trump\u2019s stranglehold on the media. To that end, any serious challenger has to figure out how to tell his or her story in a riveting way.So there\u2019s pressure on a Democratic challenger not just to communicate memorably but to say memorable things \u2014 i.e., new ones.\u201cThat would be fatal,\u201d said Beth Myers, a prominent Republican consultant and longtime senior adviser to Mitt Romney. She wasn\u2019t speaking as someone who wanted a strategy to dislodge Trump; she was just sizing up the situation.Lewandowski and I didn\u2019t get into that, but we got into plenty else. He said that politicians with fewer years in office and shorter records often have an advantage over those with more years and longer ones: There\u2019s less to defend and explain. Obama, he noted, wasn\u2019t even midway through his first term in the Senate when he announced his presidential bid.Be direct, blunt and consistent. \u201cHe has the same message today that he did the day he came down the elevator at Trump Tower,\u201d Myers observed. \u201cThe message discipline is incredible. He has never wavered. It\u2019s very real and very powerful.\u201dConvey strength. More than ever voters seem to crave that, and many see it in Trump \u2014 in the steadiness that Myers mentioned, in the way he confronts cultural headwinds, in his sustained advocacy for Kavanaugh. \u201cThe American people like a fighter,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cDonald Trump proved that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Will Flinch in a Game of Chicken Between Italy and the E.U.?", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe short-term political interests of both sides are in a collision with their long-term political and economic interests \u2014\u00a0not to mention the global economy\u2019s.Mr. Zingales is a co-host of the podcast \u201cCapitalisn\u2019t.\u201d This decision has no immediate economic consequences, but it does have huge political ones. It marks a sharp increase in the political tension between Italy and the rest of Europe \u2014 tension that might even cause Italy to exit from the eurozone.This escalation is in the short-term political interest of both sides, but it is against their long-term political and economic interests. How is it possible that the Italy-Europe relationship has arrived at this low point?Exasperated by stagnant income and increased uncertainty, Italians overwhelmingly voted last March for two parties \u2014 the Five Star Movement and the League \u2014 that promised change, especially in the relationship between Italy and the European Union.Italy\u2019s E.U. partners, however, have shown no interest in reshaping this relationship. Everyone sees the flaws of the current system. The problem is that it would be political suicide to be seen as granting Italy concessions. It\u2019s not just budget issues; it also extends to immigration, for which Italy (and Greece) bear more than their share of the cost.This raises a question: The commission has bent budgetary rules before. So why the intransigence toward the new Italian government?There are optimistic and cynical possibilities for the commission\u2019s rejection. The optimistic one is that the commission had to intervene aggressively to save its reputation because the Italian government made a mockery of the budgetary process. The economic case for the larger Italian budget deficit seemed less like a good-faith argument and more like a deliberate provocation to create a casus belli with European officials. If this were the case, however, it would not make sense for the commission to fall for it.The more cynical view is that the commission is playing a game of national politics, pitting one nation against another against another, even at the cost of the long-term well-being of the European Union. With President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany losing popularity at home, both leaders love to blame an external villain like the new Italian government. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron have certainly not been outdone by the new Italian government, which in turn loves to blame Europe for Italy\u2019s problems.The real loser, in this scenario, is the hope of a functioning Europe.If the unelected European commissioners care about the future of Europe as much as they proclaim, they should make every effort to engage the Italian government in a sensible budget plan that finds a balance between preventing the debt from exploding with the demands the Italian population has made on its government. The best way to prevent the worst form of populism from spreading \u2014 which is in the interests of both the European Union commissioners and Italian citizens \u2014 is recognizing and addressing the legitimate grievances that a large fraction of the population has voiced in electing this new Italian government.One of the lessons we learned from 1930s Germany is what happens when an intransigent group of nations tries to humiliate a prostrated borrower country for petty national politics. It would be an unforgivable tragedy if the European Union were to repeat the same mistake with Italy today.Advertisement"}

She surprised Germany when she announced last month that she would step down as party chief in December and would not seek re-election as chancellor in 2021, when her term ends.Among the leading contenders are a traditionalist struggling to distance herself from the chancellor, a former rival of Ms. Merkel\u2019s seeking to burnish his political credentials after a nine-year hiatus in finance, and a 38-year-old upstart who argues that the party needs to appeal to a new generation.Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, has followed a traditional path among Christian Democrats, rising through the party ranks to win three state election campaigns on the way to a seven-year run as governor of Saarland. This year, she left regional politics for a stint as party general secretary in Berlin, a move Ms. Merkel had encouraged.But Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s association with the chancellor may prove to be her biggest liability. She has been seeking to distance herself from Ms. Merkel recently, and on Thursday she called for increased domestic security and for a \u201crejuvenation\u201d of conservative values.She also emphasized her history of winning difficult races in Saarland, Germany\u2019s smallest state, on the border with France. \u201cAt the end of the day, what matters is whether you can win elections and in all honesty, I have made it through a lot of elections, against a lot of opposition,\u201d she told the public broadcaster ZDF last week. \u201cYou can be rhetorically very gifted, but at the end of the day, you need something to show for it.\u201dThat remark was clearly a jab aimed at Mr. Merz, 62, a charismatic speaker who is remembered for his approachability during a brief term as conservative floor leader that ended when Ms. Merkel ousted him in 2002.\u201cThose are not nationalists or anti-Semites, those are voters who are disappointed with the conservatives,\u201d Mr. Merz said in an interview with the newspaper Bild that was published online on Wednesday. \u201cIn the short term, we won\u2019t get rid of the AfD, but we can halve it.\u201dYet in the same interview, he refused to answer a question about the size of the personal fortune he had amassed since leaving politics nine years ago, going on to lead the Germany office of BlackRock, considered the world\u2019s largest private fund manager, and to become senior counsel at an international law firm.Pressed on whether he was a millionaire \u2014 many Germans are skeptical of extreme wealth, believing that social equality helps to ensure public peace \u2014 he said only that his net worth was \u201cnot below that.\u201dThe third candidate, Jens Spahn, the current minister of public health, is calling for more open debate in the party, and an effort to attract more younger voters, who are increasingly heading to the Greens.\u201cI am offering a generational change,\u201d Mr. Spahn told party delegates gathered in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia on Nov. 7. Though he comes from the more conservative wing of the Christian Democratic Union, as an openly gay man who married his partner months after Germany changed the law to allow same-sex marriage, he brings a socially progressive face to the party.Although the candidates appeared largely to agree with one another during the debate on Thursday, that it even took place is part of an unusually democratic process for the Christian Democratic Union.The party was born out of the chaos in the immediate aftermath of World War II, intent on binding together people from disparate social backgrounds under an umbrella of shared Christian values. For decades, party leaders \u2014 there have been only seven since 1950 \u2014 were largely decided behind closed doors, rendering congress votes little more than a formality.\u201cThere is no official crown prince or princess \u2014 the race is truly open,\u201d said Stefan Marschall, a professor of politics at the Heinrich-Heine-University of D\u00fcsseldorf. \u201cIt\u2019s as if a window had been thrown open and stirred up discussions and debates, including about the direction of the party, that were previously not taking place.\u201dWhoever emerges as the winner after Dec. 7 may determine whether the country faces a snap election. While Ms. Merkel has shown in the past year that she can work with Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, it would be hard to see her upholding her promise to serve out her term until the end of 2021 if Mr. Merz becomes the next party leader.And the center-left Social Democrats, who make up the other part of Ms. Merkel\u2019s government, have indicated that they view Mr. Merz as unacceptably right-leaning, making their departure from the governing coalition more likely.Advertisement"}

She was 95.Her death, at a hospice facility, was confirmed by a family spokesman, Andy Stern.While her brothers hemorrhaged money and plunged into years of lawsuits, fines, damage claims and bankruptcy proceedings, Ms. Hunt, who inherited about $600 million, enlarged her portfolio of oil, gas, timber and real estate to $1.3 billion by venturing successfully into apparel, charter helicopter and small-plane services, shopping centers, office complexes and luxury hotels in the United States, Europe and Asia.While her brothers caught the public eye with financial high-wire acts in silver, oil and sugar, Caroline Hunt led a relatively normal life. She attended college, married a World War II pilot, raised five children, wrote two cookbooks and a novel, and became a philanthropist and a Presbyterian Church deacon. She and her financial advisers made investment decisions, but she left day-to-day operations to executives whose decision-making was based on Christian principles.\u201cIf she has had any influence on the management of her enormous wealth,\u201d The New York Times reported in 1986, \u201cit has been to instill a certain ethos among the people in charge \u2014 an insistence on integrity and propriety that has been markedly absent from her brothers\u2019 affairs.\u201dThe big gamble by Bunker and Herbert was trying to corner silver, much of it bought on margin or with borrowed money. When the bubble burst in 1980, their holdings plunged in two months to a $1.7 billion debt from a $7 billion value.Years later they emerged from bankruptcy as millionaires, though no longer fabulously wealthy.Rosewood entered the luxury hotel business in the early 1980s by buying the lavish Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas. It also bought the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan and hotels in Los Angeles, Washington, London, Switzerland and Tokyo; office complexes and shopping centers in Texas, Florida, Georgia and New York; and holdings in Phillips-Van Heusen apparel, semiconductors and military electronics.

She attended the Hockaday School, a boarding school for girls in Dallas; Mary Baldwin College (now university) in Staunton, Va., for two years; and the University of Texas at Austin, where she earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in English in 1943.Ms. Hunt is survived by her sons Stephen and Patrick Sands; a daughter, Laurie Sands Harrison; her brother William Herbert; a half brother, Ray Hunt; three half sisters, Ruth Hunt, Helen Hunt Hendrix and Swanee Hunt Ansbacher; 19 grandchildren; and 23 great-grandchildren. Haroldson Hunt died in 2005, and Margaret Hunt Hill died in 2007.Ms. Hunt\u2019s philanthropies included many organizations in Dallas, where she lived all her life: the Dallas Opera, the Dallas Symphony, the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden, Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas and the United Way of Metropolitan Dallas. She was a trustee of Mary Baldwin College for 20 years, and with her sister financed the restoration of Hilltop, an 1810 campus building on the National Register of Historic Places.

{"Headline": "The Land That Failed to Fail", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "They didn\u2019t like the West\u2019s playbook. So they wrote their own.The West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It\u2019s still waiting.In the uncertain years after Mao\u2019s death, long before China became an industrial juggernaut, before the Communist Party went on a winning streak that would reshape the world, a group of economics students gathered at a mountain retreat outside Shanghai. There, in the bamboo forests of Moganshan, the young scholars grappled with a pressing question: How could China catch up with the West?The students and researchers attending the Academic Symposium of Middle-Aged and Young Economists wanted to unleash market forces but worried about crashing the economy \u2014 and alarming the party bureaucrats and ideologues who controlled it.Late one night, they reached a consensus: Factories should meet state quotas but sell anything extra they made at any price they chose. It was a clever, quietly radical proposal to undercut the planned economy \u2014 and it intrigued a young party official in the room who had no background in economics. \u201cAs they were discussing the problem, I didn\u2019t say anything at all,\u201d recalled Xu Jing\u2019an, now 76 and retired. \u201cI was thinking, how do we make this work?\u201dHow China became a superpowerThe Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation. The proposal that Mr. Xu took from the mountain retreat, soon adopted as government policy, was a pivotal early step in this astounding transformation.China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.An epochal contest is underway. With President Xi Jinping pushing a more assertive agenda overseas and tightening controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war and is gearing up for what could be a new Cold War. Meanwhile, in Beijing the question these days is less how to catch up with the West than how to pull ahead \u2014 and how to do so in a new era of American hostility.The pattern is familiar to historians, a rising power challenging an established one, with a familiar complication: For decades, the United States encouraged and aided China\u2019s rise, working with its leaders and its people to build the most important economic partnership in the world, one that has lifted both nations.During this time, eight American presidents assumed, or hoped, that China would eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization: Prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring China into the fold of democratic nations. Or the Chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot.But neither happened. Instead, China\u2019s Communist leaders have defied expectations again and again. They embraced capitalism even as they continued to call themselves Marxists. They used repression to maintain power but without stifling entrepreneurship or innovation. Surrounded by foes and rivals, they avoided war, with one brief exception, even as they fanned nationalist sentiment at home. And they presided over 40 years of uninterrupted growth, often with unorthodox policies the textbooks said would fail.In late September, the People\u2019s Republic of China marked a milestone, surpassing the Soviet Union in longevity. Days later, it celebrated a record 69 years of Communist rule. And China may be just hitting its stride \u2014 a new superpower with an economy on track to become not just the world\u2019s largest but, quite soon, the largest by a wide margin.The world thought it could change China, and in many ways it has. But China\u2019s success has been so spectacular that it has just as often changed the world \u2014 and the American understanding of how the world works.There is no simple explanation for how China\u2019s leaders pulled this off. There was foresight and luck, skill and violent resolve, but perhaps most important was the fear \u2014 a sense of crisis among Mao\u2019s successors that they never shook, and that intensified after the Tiananmen Square massacre and the collapse of the Soviet Union.Even as they put the disasters of Mao\u2019s rule behind them, China\u2019s Communists studied and obsessed over the fate of their old ideological allies in Moscow, determined to learn from their mistakes. They drew two lessons: The party needed to embrace \u201creform\u201d to survive \u2014 but \u201creform\u201d must never include democratization.China has veered between these competing impulses ever since, between opening up and clamping down, between experimenting with change and resisting it, always pulling back before going too far in either direction for fear of running aground.Many people said that the party would fail, that this tension between openness and repression would be too much for a nation as big as China to sustain. But it may be precisely why China soared.Whether it can continue to do so with the United States trying to stop it is another question entirely.None of the participants at the Moganshan conference could have predicted how China would take off, much less the roles they would play in the boom ahead. They had come of age in an era of tumult, almost entirely isolated from the rest of the world, with little to prepare them for the challenge they faced. To succeed, the party had to both reinvent its ideology and reprogram its best and brightest to carry it out.Mr. Xu, for example, had graduated with a degree in journalism on the eve of Mao\u2019s violent Cultural Revolution, during which millions of people were purged, persecuted and killed. He spent those years at a \u201ccadre school\u201d doing manual labor and teaching Marxism in an army unit. After Mao\u2019s death, he was assigned to a state research institute tasked with fixing the economy. His first job was figuring out how to give factories more power to make decisions, a subject he knew almost nothing about. Yet he went on to a distinguished career as an economic policymaker, helping launch China\u2019s first stock market in Shenzhen.Among the other young participants in Moganshan were Zhou Xiaochuan, who would later lead China\u2019s central bank for 15 years; Lou Jiwei, who ran China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and recently stepped down as finance minister; and an agricultural policy specialist named Wang Qishan, who rose higher than any of them.Mr. Wang headed China\u2019s first investment bank and helped steer the nation through the Asian financial crisis. As Beijing\u2019s mayor, he hosted the 2008 Olympics. Then he oversaw the party\u2019s recent high-stakes crackdown on corruption. Now he is China\u2019s vice president, second in authority only to Xi Jinping, the party\u2019s leader.The careers of these men from Moganshan highlight an important aspect of China\u2019s success: It turned its apparatchiks into capitalists.Bureaucrats who were once obstacles to growth became engines of growth. Officials devoted to class warfare and price controls began chasing investment and promoting private enterprise. Every day now, the leader of a Chinese district, city or province makes a pitch like the one Yan Chaojun made at a business forum in September.It was a remarkable act of reinvention, one that eluded the Soviets. In both China and the Soviet Union, vast Stalinist bureaucracies had smothered economic growth, with officials who wielded unchecked power resisting change that threatened their privileges.Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, tried to break the hold of these bureaucrats on the economy by opening up the political system. Decades later, Chinese officials still take classes on why that was a mistake. The party even produced a documentary series on the subject in 2006, distributing it on classified DVDs for officials at all levels to watch.Afraid to open up politically but unwilling to stand still, the party found another way. It moved gradually and followed the pattern of the compromise at Moganshan, which left the planned economy intact while allowing a market economy to flourish and outgrow it.Party leaders called this go-slow, experimental approach \u201ccrossing the river by feeling the stones\u201d \u2014 allowing farmers to grow and sell their own crops, for example, while retaining state ownership of the land; lifting investment restrictions in \u201cspecial economic zones,\u201d while leaving them in place in the rest of the country; or introducing privatization by selling only minority stakes in state firms at first.\u201cThere was resistance,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cSatisfying the reformers and the opposition was an art.\u201dAmerican economists were skeptical. Market forces needed to be introduced quickly, they argued; otherwise, the bureaucracy would mobilize to block necessary changes. After a visit to China in 1988, the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman called the party\u2019s strategy \u201can open invitation to corruption and inefficiency.\u201dBut China had a strange advantage in battling bureaucratic resistance. The nation\u2019s long economic boom followed one of the darkest chapters of its history, the Cultural Revolution, which decimated the party apparatus and left it in shambles. In effect, autocratic excess set the stage for Mao\u2019s eventual successor, Deng Xiaoping, to lead the party in a radically more open direction.That included sending generations of young party officials to the United States and elsewhere to study how modern economies worked. Sometimes they enrolled in universities, sometimes they found jobs, and sometimes they went on brief \u201cstudy tours.\u201d When they returned, the party promoted their careers and arranged for others to learn from them.At the same time, the party invested in education, expanding access to schools and universities, and all but eliminating illiteracy. Many critics focus on the weaknesses of the Chinese system \u2014 the emphasis on tests and memorization, the political constraints, the discrimination against rural students. But mainland China now produces more graduates in science and engineering every year than the United States, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan combined.Another explanation for the party\u2019s transformation lies in bureaucratic mechanics. Analysts sometimes say that China embraced economic reform while resisting political reform. But in reality, the party made changes after Mao\u2019s death that fell short of free elections or independent courts yet were nevertheless significant.The party introduced term limits and mandatory retirement ages, for example, making it easier to flush out incompetent officials. And it revamped the internal report cards it used to evaluate local leaders for promotions and bonuses, focusing them almost exclusively on concrete economic targets.As the economy flourished, officials with a single-minded focus on growth often ignored widespread pollution, violations of labor standards, and tainted food and medical supplies. They were rewarded with soaring tax revenues and opportunities to enrich their friends, their relatives and themselves. A wave of officials abandoned the state and went into business. Over time, the party elite amassed great wealth, which cemented its support for the privatization of much of the economy it once controlled.\u201cI basically don\u2019t see them even once a year,\u201d said James Ni, chairman and founder of Mlily, a mattress manufacturer in eastern China. \u201cI\u2019m creating jobs, generating tax revenue. Why should they bother me?\u201dIn recent years, President Xi has sought to assert the party\u2019s authority inside private firms. He has also bolstered state-owned enterprises with subsidies while preserving barriers to foreign competition. And he has endorsed demands that American companies surrender technology in exchange for market access.In doing so, he is betting that the Chinese state has changed so much that it should play a leading role in the economy \u2014 that it can build and run \u201cnational champions\u201d capable of outcompeting the United States for control of the high-tech industries of the future. But he has also provoked a backlash in Washington.He is the party\u2019s most powerful leader since Deng and the son of a senior official who served Deng, but even as he wraps himself in Deng\u2019s legacy, Mr. Xi has set himself apart in an important way: Deng encouraged the party to seek help and expertise overseas, but Mr. Xi preaches self-reliance and warns of the threats posed by \u201chostile foreign forces.\u201dIn other words, he appears to have less use for the \u201copening up\u201d part of Deng\u2019s slogan.Of the many risks that the party took in its pursuit of growth, perhaps the biggest was letting in foreign investment, trade and ideas. It was an exceptional gamble by a country once as isolated as North Korea is today, and it paid off in an exceptional way: China tapped into a wave of globalization sweeping the world and emerged as the world\u2019s factory. China\u2019s embrace of the internet, within limits, helped make it a leader in technology. And foreign advice helped China reshape its banks, build a legal system and create modern corporations.The party prefers a different narrative these days, presenting the economic boom as \u201cgrown out of the soil of China\u201d and primarily the result of its leadership. But this obscures one of the great ironies of China\u2019s rise \u2014 that Beijing\u2019s former enemies helped make it possible.The United States and Japan, both routinely vilified by party propagandists, became major trading partners and were important sources of aid, investment and expertise. The real game changers, though, were people like Tony Lin, a factory manager who made his first trip to the mainland in 1988.Mr. Lin was born and raised in Taiwan, the self-governing island where those who lost the Chinese civil war fled after the Communist Revolution. As a schoolboy, he was taught that mainland China was the enemy.But in the late 1980s, the sneaker factory he managed in central Taiwan was having trouble finding workers, and its biggest customer, Nike, suggested moving some production to China. Mr. Lin set aside his fears and made the trip. What he found surprised him: a large and willing work force, and officials so eager for capital and know-how that they offered the use of a state factory free and a five-year break on taxes.Mr. Lin spent the next decade shuttling to and from southern China, spending months at a time there and returning home only for short breaks to see his wife and children. He built and ran five sneaker factories, including Nike\u2019s largest Chinese supplier.\u201cChina\u2019s policies were tremendous,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey were like a sponge absorbing water, money, technology, everything.\u201dMr. Lin was part of a torrent of investment from ethnic Chinese enclaves in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and beyond that washed over China \u2014 and gave it a leg up on other developing countries. Without this diaspora, some economists argue, the mainland\u2019s transformation might have stalled at the level of a country like Indonesia or Mexico.The timing worked out for China, which opened up just as Taiwan was outgrowing its place in the global manufacturing chain. China benefited from Taiwan\u2019s money, but also its managerial experience, technology and relationships with customers around the world. In effect, Taiwan jump-started capitalism in China and plugged it into the global economy.Before long, the government in Taiwan began to worry about relying so much on its onetime enemy and tried to shift investment elsewhere. But the mainland was too cheap, too close and, with a common language and heritage, too familiar. Mr. Lin tried opening factories in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia but always came back to China.Now Taiwan finds itself increasingly dependent on a much more powerful China, which is pushing ever harder for unification, and the island\u2019s future is uncertain.There are echoes of Taiwan\u2019s predicament around the world, where many are having second thoughts about how they rushed to embrace Beijing with trade and investment.Over lunch at a luxurious private club on the 50th floor of an apartment tower in central Beijing, one of China\u2019s most successful real estate tycoons explained why he had left his job at a government research center after the crackdown on the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square.\u201cIt was very easy,\u201d said Feng Lun, the chairman of Vantone Holdings, which manages a multibillion-dollar portfolio of properties around the world. \u201cOne day, I woke up and everyone had run away. So I ran, too.\u201dUntil the soldiers opened fire, he said, he had planned to spend his entire career in the civil service. Instead, as the party was pushing out those who had sympathized with the students, he joined the exodus of officials who started over as entrepreneurs in the 1990s.\u201cAt the time, if you held a meeting and told us to go into business, we wouldn\u2019t have gone,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo this incident, it unintentionally planted seeds in the market economy.\u201dSuch has been the seesaw pattern of the party\u2019s success.The pro-democracy movement in 1989 was the closest the party ever came to political liberalization after Mao\u2019s death, and the crackdown that followed was the furthest it went in the other direction, toward repression and control. After the massacre, the economy stalled and retrenchment seemed certain. Yet three years later, Deng used a tour of southern China to wrestle the party back to \u201creform and opening up\u201d once more.Many who had left the government, like Mr. Feng, suddenly found themselves leading the nation\u2019s transformation from the outside, as its first generation of private entrepreneurs.Now Mr. Xi is steering the party toward repression again, tightening its grip on society, concentrating power in his own hands and setting himself up to rule for life by abolishing the presidential term limit. Will the party loosen up again, as it did a few years after Tiananmen, or is this a more permanent shift? If it is, what will it mean for the Chinese economic miracle?The fear is that Mr. Xi is attempting to rewrite the recipe behind China\u2019s rise, replacing selective repression with something more severe.The internet is an example of how it has benefited by striking a balance. The party let the nation go online with barely an inkling of what that might mean, then reaped the economic benefits while controlling the spread of information that could hurt it.Panicked officials considered shutting down the most popular service, Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, but the authorities were afraid of how the public would respond. In the end, they let Weibo stay open but invested much more in tightening controls and ordered companies to do the same.The compromise worked. Now, many companies assign hundreds of employees to censorship duties \u2014 and China has become a giant on the global internet landscape.\u201cThe cost of censorship is quite limited compared to the great value created by the internet,\u201d said Chen Tong, an industry pioneer. \u201cWe still get the information we need for economic progress.\u201dChina is not the only country that has squared the demands of authoritarian rule with the needs of free markets. But it has done so for longer, at greater scale and with more convincing results than any other.The question now is whether it can sustain this model with the United States as an adversary rather than a partner.The trade war has only just begun. And it is not just a trade war. American warships and planes are challenging Chinese claims to disputed waters with increasing frequency even as China keeps ratcheting up military spending. And Washington is maneuvering to counter Beijing\u2019s growing influence around the world, warning that a Chinese spending spree on global infrastructure comes with strings attached.The two nations may yet reach some accommodation. But both left and right in America have portrayed China as the champion of an alternative global order, one that embraces autocratic values and undermines fair competition. It is a rare consensus for the United States, which is deeply divided about so much else, including how it has wielded power abroad in recent decades \u2014 and how it should do so now.Mr. Xi, on the other hand, has shown no sign of abandoning what he calls \u201cthe great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d Some in his corner have been itching to take on the United States since the 2008 financial crisis and see the Trump administration\u2019s policies as proof of what they have always suspected \u2014 that America is determined to keep China down.At the same time, there is also widespread anxiety over the new acrimony, because the United States has long inspired admiration and envy in China, and because of a gnawing sense that the party\u2019s formula for success may be faltering.Prosperity has brought rising expectations in China; the public wants more than just economic growth. It wants cleaner air, safer food and medicine, better health care and schools, less corruption and greater equality. The party is struggling to deliver, and tweaks to the report cards it uses to measure the performance of officials hardly seem enough.\u201cThe basic problem is, who is growth for?\u201d said Mr. Xu, the retired official who wrote the Moganshan report. \u201cWe haven\u2019t solved this problem.\u201dGrowth has begun to slow, which may be better for the economy in the long term but could shake public confidence. The party is investing ever more in censorship to control discussion of the challenges the nation faces: widening inequality, dangerous debt levels, an aging population.In effect, Mr. Xi seems to believe that China has been so successful that the party can return to a more conventional authoritarian posture \u2014 and that to survive and surpass the United States it must.Certainly, the momentum is still with the party. Over the past four decades, economic growth in China has been 10 times faster than in the United States, and it is still more than twice as fast. The party appears to enjoy broad public support, and many around the world are convinced that Mr. Trump\u2019s America is in retreat while China\u2019s moment is just beginning.Then again, China has a way of defying expectations.Philip P.

{"Headline": "A Wake-Up Call for the G.O.P.", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sanford is a Republican representative from South Carolina.But somehow in politics, it\u2019s different. Too often, political figures simply blame the other side \u2014 or at least someone besides themselves.While it\u2019s human nature to blame someone, what happened here is far bigger than any postelection spin, given that it has been more than 40 years since a Democrat has held this seat, which runs along South Carolina\u2019s coast and leans Republican by 10 points. In fact, there was not a more conservative district in the country to flip to the Democrats. For this reason, I think the race offers a chance for conservative soul-searching, and I say this as a committed conservative, who just happens not to be Trump enough in the age of Trump.The normal political dynamics at play in districts across the country held in this race. Both contestants were well financed, and you saw the same midterm drag on the Republican side that you saw in other congressional races. But three things made this race different \u2014 things that could prove instructive for Republicans, if we choose to look at them.One, the environment matters to voters. As a party, we have somehow forgotten that conservatism should apply to more than just financial resources. Being conservative should entail being conservative with natural resources, too. I\u2019ve always believed this \u2014 so much so that the Sierra Club endorsed me in my race for re-election as governor. Not so many years ago, I was hardly an outlier. But the Republican playbook has changed, and it damages Republicans in suburban districts.In the primary, Ms. Arrington criticized my stand against offshore drilling and my disagreement with President Trump\u2019s plan to repeal a moratorium on offshore drilling \u2014 a moratorium that has held under Republican and Democratic presidents for 37 years. She attempted to pivot away from this stand in the general election, but voters didn\u2019t forget, and Mr. Cunningham was able to use it as a wedge issue. As Republicans, we\u2019ve drifted from our roots. The party, in fact, has a remarkable legacy on conservation and the environment \u2014 and this race suggests we should recommit ourselves to it.Two, financial irresponsibility proved a drag. Even in a hyperpartisan world, you still need reasons for traditional conservatives like myself to show up. It\u2019s got to be more than the blue team is bad. One of the underpinnings of the Republican Party has long been financial responsibility, but here, again, the party has drifted. The president has done very little to trim the size of the federal government or entitlement spending, even as he asks for more money for corn farmers hit by his tariffs. That\u2019s hardly motivating for a traditional conservative. We need to once again be the party of not just lower taxes, but less spending.Third, civility is important. What happened to Ronald Reagan\u2019s notion of being a happy warrior? Like his policies or not, he was pleasant. He smiled. He joked. He played to optimism rather than fear. He and Tip O\u2019Neill, the Democratic speaker of the House, had a famously strong working relationship despite their political differences.The Republican Party that so many of us care deeply about continues to be held hostage these days, and what I saw last week in a district I grew up in and know well is that there is a half-life to insults, bullying and an embrace of a post-truth world.I heard it from young soccer moms and longtime Republican voters alike. They don\u2019t want to condone behavior that is counter to what they\u2019ve taught their children.In this district, my former opponent adopted Mr. Trump\u2019s highly combative style. It worked in the primary, but it fell flat in the general election. Mr. Cunningham presented himself as warm and affable. Republicans got a wake-up call last week. But will we wake up?My party would be wise to take a step back from President Trump\u2019s approach to politics. We should renew our commitment to tenets like environmental conservation and financial responsibility. We should run from the president\u2019s zero-sum approach to politics. These are not revolutionary ideas. But adhering to the simple approaches of kindness and respect, principles that have long guided society, could these days be groundbreaking.Mark Sanford is a Republican representative from South Carolina.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Jew Hatred, and Ours", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new CNN poll reveals that one in four Europeans are anti-Semitic.Ms. Weiss is an editor and writer in the Times Opinion section.Paris. Toulouse. Malmo. Copenhagen. Brussels. Berlin.For most people, they are lovely cities where you might happily take a holiday. But for the world\u2019s Jews, they are something else, too. They are place names of hate.The poll, which surveyed more than 7,000 people across Austria, France, Germany, Britain, Hungary, Poland and Sweden, didn\u2019t only discover ignorance. It exposed bigotry.It\u2019s no wonder that to be a Jew in Europe today is to live your life in the closet. How did Europe reach this pass?In many ways, it never left it. Anti-Semitism has been a fact of European life for more than 2,000 years. The postwar generation who lived with the shame of the Holocaust is dying out. Their children and grandchildren are less abashed when it comes to the old prejudices.But the story of European anti-Semitism isn\u2019t simply a case of the resurgence of the neo-fascist right. Now add a third ingredient to this toxic brew: the fashionable anti-Semitism of the far left that masquerades as anti-Zionism and anti-racism. European Jews must now contend with this three-headed dragon: Physical fear of violent assault, often by young Muslim men, which leads many Jews to hide evidence of their religious identity. Moral fear of ideological vilification, mainly by the far left, which causes at least some Jews to downplay their sympathies for Israel. And political fear of resurgent fascism, which can cause some cognitive dissonance since at least some of Europe\u2019s neo-fascists profess sympathy for Israel while expressing open hostility to Muslims.Now these three strains of hate are beginning to show up on this side of the Atlantic.The biggest threat is on the far right. This is the anti-Semitism of \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d marchers in Charlottesville, Va., and the killer at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh who ranted against globalists and the \u201ckike infestation.\u201d It is the anti-Semitism of Representative Steve King of Iowa and of alt-right Reddit boards and some of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters.For reasons historic, aesthetic and political, we Jews are most attuned to the anti-Semitism of the far right \u2014 and we find the most sympathy among our progressive allies when these are our attackers. But when Jews point out the other two kinds, we are often dismissed as sensitive or hysterical, or as mistaking legitimate criticism of Israel for something darker.This is nonsense. The same was said of the Jews in Europe when they sounded the alarm bells. Look where they are now.An earlier version of this article misidentified the event at Copenhagen's main synagogue at which a member was gunned down in 2015. It was a bat mitzvah, not a bar mitzvah.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Small Companies Avoid I.P.O.s, Sapping U.S. Economy\u2019s Vitality", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Smith spent years planning to sell shares of his software company, Qualtrics, on the stock market, meeting with bankers, carefully auditing financials and shaping a Wall Street-friendly narrative about the company\u2019s prospects. Two weeks ago, the finish line was close, with a listing on the Nasdaq just a few days away.But shortly before a staff meeting to update Qualtrics\u2019 employees about the public listing, Mr. Smith received a phone call from Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d Mr. McDermott told Mr. Smith.Mr. Smith then stunned Qualtrics\u2019 workers with a totally different message: SAP had agreed to buy the company for $8 billion in cash, nearly double the valuation bankers had set for the company\u2019s public listing. It was a decision, Mr. Smith said in an interview, that he did not second-guess one bit.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more peace in my life,\u201d he said.That kind of last-minute deal, an increasingly common occurrence in the tech industry, is contributing to a major reshaping of the American financial landscape that has been underway for years.Small and midsize companies are fading from stock markets, leaving far fewer publicly traded companies. Many of the smaller companies are bought by larger organizations or are enticed to stay private by the sharp rise in venture capital money, both of which allow them to avoid the volatility and scrutiny that come with going public. The number of listed companies peaked in the late 1990s, before the dot-com bust, plummeting 52 percent by 2016.Some economists say the buyouts of early-stage companies by large dominant players help explain why, by many measures, the American economy has been less dynamic in recent years. Less competition can contribute to sluggish rates of entrepreneurship, business creation, wage growth and productivity, they say.Even some companies that do go public can find that their time there is short-lived. In March, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, a software integration company, just a year after its public offering.\u201cCompanies like Qualtrics are saying, \u2018Huh, why bother the fighting in the public markets if I can do just as well by presenting myself for acquisition in sort of a premarket sale?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a Cornell University finance professor who has studied the decline of publicly traded companies.The traditionally vibrant American small business sector was long viewed as a strength for the economy. Small businesses are more likely to develop innovative new technologies, forcing large companies to reinvest significant amounts of profits to keep pace. The economy benefits from that competition, improving productivity and generating new and higher-quality products and services for consumers.The ability of large, cash-rich companies to buy smaller businesses before they have the chance to emerge as formidable competitors has altered the corporate landscape, said Thomas Philippon, a professor of economics at New York University, who has studied the increased dominance of large companies in many American industries.From 2001 to 2017, the median age of a venture-backed start-up going public was 11 years, according to a study by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. That\u2019s three years older than in the 1980s and 1990s, excluding the dot-com boom.Big tech companies like SAP and Cisco are attracted to the reliable revenue streams of the new class of cloud-based software providers, which charge monthly subscription fees for their offerings.\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for some of these big companies that need to adapt to a new way of doing business,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of I.P.O.-related research and services.\u201cThe public markets would not have awarded these companies those kinds of multiples,\u201d Ms. Smith said.While Qualtrics is growing quickly, its $290 million in annual revenue will not make an immediate difference in the earnings of SAP, which brought in more than $20 billion in 2017. But Mr. Smith of Qualtrics said that joining with SAP would help him accomplish in two years what would have taken five.\u201cOur only reason to go public was not for the financial side. It was to go take this to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got that in one swoop.\u201dTraditional investors in early-stage companies that used to go public have had to adjust to the new reality. For instance, the asset manager and mutual fund company T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, has increased its investing activity in pre-I.P.O. companies, including Airbnb and Uber, as well as Snap, the social media company, before it went public in 2017.\u201cWe are seeing opportunities to invest in companies with very similar characteristics to what would have been early-stage public market companies decades ago \u2014 only these companies are oftentimes raising money through private markets instead,\u201d Corey Shull, an analyst who leads early-stage internet investments at T. Rowe Price, wrote in an email.Investing in hot private start-ups is not generally available to the public. Retail investors seeking to ride the wave of hot cloud companies, for example, have had numerous opportunities to jump on an enterprise tech public offering this year. But some of the most notable ones, including Qualtrics, Adaptive Insights and Mulesoft, are now under the umbrella of much larger conglomerates.\u201cIf they don\u2019t have to tap the public markets to raise money, then why would you?\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who focuses on I.P.O. advisory work.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netanyahu, Citing Israel\u2019s Security, Tries to Avoid New Election", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel made an impassioned attempt on Sunday to salvage his crumbling government, warning his teetering coalition partners that toppling the government at such a complex time for national security would be \u201cirresponsible.\u201dIn a live 10-minute address timed for the main evening television news broadcasts, Mr. Netanyahu drew on his military record and political clout to try to prevent early elections, listing his accomplishments in what commentators described as a pre-emptive campaign pitch.\u201cWe are in the midst of a battle, and in the middle of a battle we don\u2019t abandon our posts,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cIn the middle of a battle, we do not play politics. The security of the nation is beyond politics, and the security of the nation is also beyond personal considerations.\u201dEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, who leads another party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition \u2014 the hawkish Jewish Home party \u2014 then demanded to be named defense minister; he was rebuffed by the prime minister.Mr. Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, also of Jewish Home, are scheduled to make statements on Monday morning, when they are expected to issue an ultimatum or even quit the government.An exit by Jewish Home would bring down the government, forcing elections as early as March, since Mr. Lieberman\u2019s withdrawal of his party from the coalition last week left it with a precarious majority of one seat in Parliament.Elections were originally scheduled to take place a year from now.Mr. Netanyahu \u2014 who also serves as foreign minister and, nominally, as health minister \u2014 said that he was for now taking on the role of defense minister. In addition to the volatile situation along the southern border with Gaza, Israel has been grappling with what it views as the graver threat of Iranian entrenchment across its northern border, in Syria.Mr. Lieberman quit his post as defense minister after the government accepted what he and many other Israelis viewed as a premature and humiliating cease-fire with Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, to end a fierce 48-hour bout of cross-border fighting.Mr. Netanyahu said that he understood the criticism, but that the public could not be privy to all of the details for security reasons. He also hinted at plans for further military action.\u201cI will not say this evening when we will act and how we will act,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cI have a clear plan. I know what to do and when to do it. And we will do it.\u201d\u201cWe will overcome our enemies,\u201d he added gravely. \u201cAnd I tell you in advance, it will require sacrifice.\u201dRecalling his service to the country, and how he had lost friends, his older brother and almost his own life in battle, he said, \u201cI dedicate my whole life for the security of Israel.\u201dHe recounted his efforts as a former finance minister to strengthen the country\u2019s economy, and said that Israel\u2019s international relations were now \u201cat an all-time peak, without a drop of exaggeration.\u201dPressing his point that early elections would be an unnecessary distraction from the urgent affairs of state, he hurried off with the parting words \u201cI\u2019m going to work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s located in Oslo, but its tradition-bound type is disappearing everywhere. A piano player works on a mezzanine, showering the dining room with arpeggios from Bach and other \u201cgreat composers.\u201d The customers below appreciate the chef but don\u2019t treat him as a deity. Nobody thinks twice about asking for substitutions, for dishes that aren\u2019t on the menu or for extra nuts and seeds on the goat cheese salad with passion fruit vinaigrette. The Art Nouveau-style oak frames on the mirrors were installed in 1901. Most of the restaurant\u2019s human fixtures appear to have been around nearly as long, including the waiter who narrates the novel. Stability is the product that the Hills sells.It\u2019s also the only thing keeping the waiter in one piece \u2014 that and the row of 25-millimeter horn buttons on the front of his white-canvas jacket, made by an old-guard firm that also manufactures military shirts. The waiter is a bundle of nerves with a corkscrew in one pocket \u2014 a neurotic, you\u2019d say, although he calls himself a \u201csensitive.\u201d He doesn\u2019t handle coffee well, even when somebody else is drinking it. \u201cOther things we highly sensitives react to are noise and complex social contexts,\u201d he says. \u201cThe mixing of roles. And hunger, or being given too many jobs to do at once.\u201dMost of all, there\u2019s a new customer, a friend of the Pig\u2019s, a woman. Everything about her unnerves the waiter: her quadruple-espresso order, her refusal to read a newspaper while she waits, her indeterminate age and place in the social order and her appearance. \u201cLike debauchery dressed as asceticism,\u201d the waiter thinks. \u201cA generator for jealousy.\u201dA hard-working sensitive can take only so much and the waiter starts to malfunction. He delivers food to the wrong table. He makes inane replies to reasonable requests. He catches his hand in a wine drawer and bandages it badly. He keeps the Widow Knipschild waiting an uncomfortably long time for her second glass of port. He grows more and more glitchy, threatening the principle that he has organized his life around, disappearing into his professional role. As he puts it, \u201cI make objects and food come and go without being noticed myself.\u201dThese do not sound like the ingredients of a page turner, but Faldbakken has a way with nonaction. He builds a delicious tension between the paucity of events and the lavishness of the technique with which they are described. His waiter, though taciturn while on duty, is a chatterbox as a narrator, providing a busy, intricate analysis until each minor stumble achieves seismic status. Played in slow motion, his malfunctions unspool as slapstick with an undertow of dread.As the story moves along, the waiter loses his sense of who he is and what he\u2019s supposed to be doing so completely that he starts to seem like a man who could do anything. He\u2019s like Travis Bickle played by Buster Keaton.The waiter himself, with his mix of self-dramatization and self-disparagement, thinks he resembles another movie character, the maniacal oilman in \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d Daniel Plainview. \u201cBut Plainview is more durable than I am,\u201d he says. \u201cHe looks more outdoorsy. I\u2019ve got more of a cafe vibe. Where he\u2019s determined and vengeful, I\u2019m more service-oriented and jumpy.\u201dI can\u2019t vouch for how closely Alice Menzies\u2019 translation follows Faldbakken\u2019s Norwegian original, but that \u201ccafe vibe\u201d gives a sense of her light colloquial touch with the narrator\u2019s loping, halting, self-revising tone. Faldbakken has written three other novels, known collectively as the Scandinavian Misanthropy Trilogy, which have not been published in English. Outside Norway, he is better known as an artist whose exhibitions often feature everyday objects, like newspapers and cardboard boxes, altered in ways that make them useless.The waiter seems to be heading for the same fate. He has no personal life to speak of, or at least none that he speaks of; his entire sense of himself is built on how well he does his job. Between episodes of professional breakdown, he\u2019s given to rueful inner monologues on the theme of futility. He can, at times, sound like one of Thomas Bernhard\u2019s pessimists, but Faldbakken deploys a mild, noncaustic humor that was not prominent in Bernhard\u2019s chemistry kit.The waiter is an anachronism and he knows it. The modern world that is at the doorstep of the Hills has devalued his style of careful service work, even as it needs more of it, and makes more intense demands on the people who do that work. Those who make the lives of the comfortable even more comfortable are society\u2019s shock absorbers. They may start to screech, but the car keeps rolling along.Pete Wells is the restaurant critic for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Plan to Turn New York Into a Capital of Cybersecurity", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new partnership among two prominent Israeli venture capital funds, a handful of major private-sector companies and the city\u2019s economic growth development enterprise is hoping to turn New York City into the nation\u2019s leading center for yet one more major industry: cybersecurity.\u201cWe are at a seminal moment in the trajectory of the cybersecurity industry,\u201d said James Patchett, president and chief executive of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is spearheading the Cyber NYC initiative, including assembling and leading public-private partnerships and developing and overseeing six programs to grow New York\u2019s cyberindustry and expand the work force.\u201cMaking New York City the epicenter of cybersecurity makes complete sense because New York City is where all the customers are,\u201d Mr. Patchett said.Two new cybersecurity centers in separate locations will work in tandem to anchor this project. In SoHo, a 50,000-square-foot cybersecurity investment hub will support cybersecurity start-ups in New York City. In Chelsea, the 15,000-square-foot Global Cyber Center will bring together investors, corporations and start-ups and serve as a virtual testing ground to run simulations. Both are expected to be completed before the end of 2019.Despite the clear need for cybersecurity upgrades and improvements, not everyone is convinced that a project like Cyber NYC is the right solution.Mr. Margalit, who as a former member of Israel\u2019s legislative body, the Knesset, led its cybersecurity task force. Mr. Margalit earned his Ph.D. at Columbia and was living in New York City during 9/11. He says that his company will oversee much of the business end of the venture. \u201cMost innovation occurs when the two disciplines meet: investors and cybersecurity experts,\u201d he said.Equally invested in Cyber NYC\u2019s success is Uzi Scheffer, chief executive of SOSA, which has offices in Tel Aviv and New York. The company mostly focuses on protecting major financial companies from cyberattacks. While SOSA already has been operating out of another New York location for about 18 months, it is building the Global Cyber Center in Chelsea and plans to move into it in 2019.\u201cThe Global Cyber Center will expose New York\u2019s largest players to the best cybersecurity solutions out there,\u201d said Mr. Scheffer.Mr. Scheffer said a global cybersecurity hub doesn\u2019t really exist anywhere yet. \u201cIt\u2019s about seizing the opportunity rather than taking it away from someone else,\u201d said Scheffer, whose firm, like Jerusalem Venture Partners, secured its partnership with Cyber NYC through a competitive bidding process.There\u2019s also a serious academic element to the overall cybersecurity partnership, which involves the participation of virtually every major academic institution in New York City. \u201cWhether or not this leads to New York becoming the single, cybersecurity hub of the world is a story that will be played out over the next 15 years,\u201d said Orin Herskowitz, senior vice president of Intellectual Property and Tech Transfer for Columbia University. In the meantime, he says, the combined efforts will train and link local university students with substantive cybersecurity jobs in NYC.\u201cThere is a real chance this will become a catalytic event,\u201d Mr. Herskowitz said.There\u2019s even a so-called Cybersecurity Boot Camp planned, where the city\u2019s Fullstack Academy and CUNY LaGuardia Community College plan to educate and place more than 1,000 students in high-paying cybersecurity jobs over the first three years of the program. Program development for the boot camp has begun with the first session scheduled to take place in spring 2019.Until now, all of the major cybersecurity stakeholders in New York City have been physically and operationally separated, said Satish Rao, associate director of physical sciences licensing at Columbia, who helps to support cybersecurity start-ups. But with Cyber NYC, he said, \u201ca coalition of stakeholders is coming together.\u201dOne such stakeholder is Mark Gazit, chief executive of ThetaRay, an Israeli financial cybersecurity specialty company, which opened a temporary New York office at another location 18 months ago, but will be ultimately be housed in the SoHo building early next year. ThetaRay will start with about 15 to 20 employees at the location, but plans to have more than 100 within several years, Gazit said.\u201cFew people come to a bank branch and use a gun to steal money,\u201d he said. Today, the thief is far more likely to be behind a server in some remote country, stealing money without any physical access to the bank, he says. His company, which aims to prevent the spread of this cybercrime, works with such clients as General Electric.To be a cybercriminal is the highest-paying, low-risk job in the world, Mr. Gazit said. \u201cNobody knows who you are, and you can disappear without a trace,\u201d he says.His and other cybersecurity companies hope to make New York City the center of halting cybercrime. There is no better location than New York, said Mr. Gazit, because New York is where the talent is and where the financial giants are headquartered.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Mr. Gazit said, \u201cwe have to make sure the good guys win. \u201dBecause of editing errors, earlier versions of picture captions with this article misidentified a building in SoHo that is part of the Cyber NYC initiative. It is a future cybersecurity innovation hub, not the future Global Cyber Center, which will be in Chelsea. One of the captions also misspelled the surnames of two people involved with the hub. They are Tali Rabin, not Raben, and Gil Becker, not Beker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018It\u2019s Time to Try to Change the Men\u2019: Papua New Guinea\u2019s Epidemic of Abuse", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGOROKA, Papua New Guinea \u2014 Claiming that the rice she had cooked for dinner was too hot, Ambai\u2019s husband suddenly punched her in the temple and dragged her out of the house by her hair. Another beating began, watched silently by her two aunts, who knew that speaking up would get them beaten as well.He forced her to her knees at the small river behind their house and pulled out his rusty, homemade pistol. She felt the metal on the back of her neck, and waited for her husband to kill her.\u201cI thought, this is finally the end,\u201d Ambai recalled. \u201cAt least the beatings will finish.\u201dInstead, he pulled her back inside and bashed her eye with a tire iron, cracking her orbital socket and sending her to the hospital once again. After a year of abuse, Ambai, who is 23 years old, finally felt she had to go to a shelter.Among lush and rolling mountains in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, women experience some of the highest rates of domestic violence in the world.Ambai, who is being identified by a nickname out of concern for her safety, is one of the dozens of women waiting in a quiet and packed unmarked shelter on the edge of Goroka, a town in Eastern Highlands Province.\u201cThe police have offered to help make mediation between me and my husband,\u201d Ambai said, nervous and unrested. \u201cI want to get away, but there is no money.\u201d\u201cTo beat a woman is to pick a mango from the tree,\u201d said Sharon Sisopha, a counselor at the Goroka women\u2019s shelter. \u201cIt costs nothing.\u201dIn November, the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference will bring world leaders to Papua New Guinea\u2019s capital, Port Moresby, and thrust the developing country onto the world stage.Without even a single road to connect Port Moresby to the northern part of the country, the money and hopes in the capital seem a lifetime away.\u201cThere are two Papua New Guineas: Port Moresby and the rest of us,\u201d said Mary Kini, a human-rights activist from the Eastern Highlands.The laws against abuse are vague. Until recently, women in Papua New Guinea were treated as property. As soon as bride prices were settled, husbands could legally beat and rape their wives.After years of outcry, the government passed a family protection law in 2013, essentially banning the abuse of wives and children. A police division devoted to combating family and sexual violence was established, and government-sponsored shelters were built all around the country.But as soon as they were built, the money stopped. Rife corruption and mismanagement swallowed budgets, and most shelters outside the capital were left to fend for themselves.\u201cWe rely on donations from foreign NGOs and charities,\u201d said Ms. Sisopha at the Goroka women\u2019s shelter. \u201cWhen there\u2019s none, women surely are being killed.\u201dWhen the police are called about domestic disputes, they often cannot afford the gasoline to drive there. Human rights defenders like Mary Kini must gather donations and financing from NGOs, like Oxfam, to help pay the police to rescue women from their abusive spouses.\u201cFor every five women that come, we send five away,\u201d said Judy Girua, a Goroka family violence police sergeant. Outside her office, in a tiny shack behind the main police station, 30 women waited on the dirt ground, hoping to make their cases. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t even have ink to print out the report.\u201dThe island nation of Papua New Guinea is a fractured set of communities, clans, tribes and families living in an area about the size of California. Some 800 languages are spoken, the most in any single country. From one street to the next, there are entirely different and unique sets of unwritten rules. While abuse of women is almost universal in some parts of the country, other areas have matriarchal traditions, with land passed down from mother to daughter.But since Papua New Guinea declared independence from Australia in 1975, women have generally been subordinate to men. No women sit in Parliament. Divorce laws are complicated and strict, most often forcing women to pay back their own bride prices.Ancient traditions are still an everyday part of life, and people across the country still believe in the practice of sorcery. In the highlands, stories of neighbors murdering neighbors based on accusations of poisons and hexes are routine.\u201cAnything can lead to the accusation. A family member gets sick, a child dies in birth. People use it as an excuse,\u201d said Ms. Kini, who spends much of her time helping to get people who have been falsely accused to safety. \u201cMost of them are women and most of the time they are killed for nothing.\u201dOn the outskirts of Goroka, hidden behind a vast homemade garden, Angela Kaupa has created a shelter of her own. For the past 11 years, she has opened up her small, three-bedroom farmhouse to women in need. With only a few sheets and dingy mattress pads, she calculates that more than a thousand survivors have come to her over the years.\u201cIt\u2019s better to be independent,\u201d Ms. Kaupa said, cooking outside her small home, where she raises chicken and pigs.With little assistance from government or NGO programs, makeshift shelters like hers have become an important alternative to what she called \u201cthe broken government system.\u201d\u201cPeople come and go as they please. Every day they arrive. I don\u2019t ask for money or any of their stories,\u201d Ms. Kaupa said. \u201cYou can see in their eyes when they\u2019ve felt pain.\u201dThe women she takes in are afraid of the formal shelters. Knowing the government will offer them little assistance, makeshift shelters offer a safer alternative, without the involvement of police reports and official filings that could easily stoke more violence.A woman named Ambo has been at the shelter for eight years, longer than any other resident. Frail and quiet, she had been accused of being a witch in her home village. Ambo\u2019s neighbors locked her in a house and spent weeks beating and raping her, Ms. Kaupa said.When she eventually broke out, she could no longer speak and had been infected with H.I.V. Ms. Kaupa met her at a hospital and took her in.\u201cPeople who come here don\u2019t know themselves,\u201d Ms. Kaupa said.Her latest resident is a first: A man convicted of beating his wife and raping a girl in his village. He served time in prison, and now Ms. Kaupa has taken him in, too.\u201cWe have to find the good in every one,\u201d she said. \u201cNow maybe it\u2019s time to try to change the men.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Facebook Movie Told Us What We Needed to Know About Mark Zuckerberg", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorEverything we needed to know about Facebook was right in front of our faces, on the big screen, in 2010.Come with me on this journey back in time, to the AMC Mountainside 10, on Route 22 in New Jersey, where I first saw \u201cThe Social Network.\u201dAt the time, I was rooting for the young Mark Zuckerberg to get the better of the people trying to hold him back. He was an unusual movie protagonist, introverted and inconsiderate, but wasn\u2019t it time for the geeks to take the power from the old guard? For the underdogs to beat the establishment?His journey to moguldom began ignobly, with Facemash.com, a meanspirited site that encouraged his fellow male students at Harvard College to rate women on campus by their looks.Every movie needs foils, and the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and the director David Fincher found theirs in a pair of well-heeled alpha males, the Winklevoss twins.But now, the Winklevii don\u2019t seem quite so bad. Weren\u2019t they, after all, the first of many to be run over by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s ambitions?Watching this origin story unfold from stadium seating eight years ago, I thought I was seeing a series of hard lessons learned as a callow 19-year-old came of age. Streaming it in 2018, I saw something else: the beginning of a pattern that has become all too familiar.Facebook, which had no comment on Sunday, has responded defensively.\u201cThe reality of running a company of more than 10,000 people,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said on Thursday, \u201cis that you\u2019re not going to know everything that\u2019s going on.\u201dNothing was more at variance with their promises of transparency than The Times\u2019s revelation that the company had hired Definers Public Affairs, whose founders are known in Republican circles as lords of the so-called \u201cdark arts\u201d of political opposition research.In his recent remarks, Mr. Zuckerberg told reporters that Facebook had gotten rid of Definers and that neither he nor Ms. Sandberg knew about its tactics. Yet he still felt it necessary to say that highlighting wealthy donors to Freedom From Facebook was a fair way to show it was \u201cnot a spontaneous, grass-roots movement\u201dMr. Soros did not directly finance the anti-Facebook coalition. Though he has given to some of its member groups, it was not specifically to go after Facebook, according to his nonprofit organization, the Open Society Foundations. The Open Society also said on Friday that it declined a request to donate directly to Freedom from Facebook.Mr. Soros and his colleagues saw at least one obvious reason to single him out. \u201cThey were trying to stir up animus and rally right-wing support for Facebook,\u201d said Patrick Gaspard, the president of Open Society Foundations. \u201cAnd the best way to do that is to lift up old tropes against George Soros.\u201dMr. Pariser attributed Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s failure to appreciate Facebook\u2019s destructive capabilities to a hyperfocus on his rivals. \u201cI just think the problems that Facebook was looking at in 2012 and 2014 were, \u2018Hey, is Twitter going to eat our lunch? Is Snapchat going to eat our lunch?\u2019\u201d Mr. Pariser said.In the final scene of \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d a lawyer advises Mr. Zuckerberg to settle with the people who had accused him of steamrolling them \u2014 the Winklevii and his Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin.I knew in 2010 that he would do just that as the camera showed him alone in an office to ponder it. But I had the reason wrong. It wasn\u2019t about doing right by those he had trampled.

They are served up in plain sight, for profit, at airport bookstores, at movie-theater chains and on cable television.They come by way of publishing houses like Hachette and Penguin Random House; film distributors like Universal Home Studios and Lionsgate; theater chains like AMC and Cinemark; and 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News.Those companies have all helped feed a segment of the media business that should be called what it is \u2014 the Incitement Industry.It rakes in profits by serving up agitprop that targets liberals, Democrats and \u201cdeep state\u201d operatives who are said to be plotting to destroy America for the benefit of darker-skinned migrants or a shadowy consortium of elites.You can see this kind of thing in the pages of \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals\u201d by the Fox News opinion host Jeanine Pirro. Published in July by Center Street, a division of the Hachette Book Group, Ms. Pirro\u2019s book lays out \u201cthe globalist, open-border oligarchy\u201d that, the author asserts, is seeking to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe perpetrators of this anti-American plot include, but are not limited to, the leadership at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies, the Democratic Party and perhaps even the FISA courts,\u201d she writes.Another recent best seller in the same vein, \u201cResistance Is Futile!\u201d by the conservative provocateur Ann Coulter, was published by Sentinel, an imprint of the publishing giant Penguin Random House. It argues that the \u201cresistance\u201d that sprang up in the wake of President Trump\u2019s election is \u201cnothing less than a coup.\u201d And it lights into a conveniently vague villain \u2014 \u201cthe media\u201d \u2014 in a chapter titled \u201cFor Democracy to Live, We Must Kill the Media.\u201d\u201cThe media\u2019s position is that they\u2019re allowed to engage in lies, deception and even illegal acts to swing an election,\u201d Ms. Coulter writes.The film makes the case that the Nazi platform was similar to that of today\u2019s Democratic Party. Prominent among its villains is George Soros, who was allegedly sent a pipe bomb by Cesar Sayoc Jr., who also is accused of sending similar packages to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama.\u201cThe progressive Democrats are the true racists,\u201d the film\u2019s narrator intones. \u201cThey are the true fascists. They want to steal our income. They want to steal our earnings and our wealth and our freedom and our lives.\u201d\u201cDeath of a Nation\u201d will have a second life on the streaming platforms Amazon, iTunes and Google Play, as well as on DVD, sold at Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers. The distribution is being handled by Quality Flix and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.The hysteria led Bill Kristol, the conservative Republican who was once a regular on the Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox News, to tell Brian Stelter of CNN that it was time for Fox\u2019s owners and investors to take a hard look at the rhetoric spilling out of its news channel.(Representatives for Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, did not comment for this article.)But where is the line between falsehoods that may incite violence and good, old-fashioned American political hyperbole? And should book publishers and entertainment companies be more careful about the products they send out into the world in a tense sociopolitical atmosphere?\u201cI don\u2019t want some publisher telling me that something is beyond bounds,\u201d Mr. Kristol told me in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m a libertarian on points of view and even interpretations of history.\u201dBut after noting that conspiracy theories of recent vintage have whipped up fear and hatred, Mr. Kristol added, \u201cThere are things that normal fact-checking would rule out. It\u2019s not a matter of ideology; it\u2019s truth.\u201dI asked Hachette, the company behind \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals,\u201d whether Ms. Pirro\u2019s statement that Mr. Soros has \u201can agenda to destroy this country and the capitalist system\u201d had passed muster with the publisher\u2019s editors and fact-checkers. I got no answer.Sentinel, the division of Penguin Random House that published Ms. Coulter\u2019s recent best seller, was at least willing to engage. Its publisher, Adrian Zackheim, told me the author\u2019s views were \u201cexpressions of opinion.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s time to stop labeling her book \u201cnonfiction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Swiss Town Designed for the Glory of Time", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere, about 200 feet below, is the reason: The town was built on a grid of wide streets, and its stucco townhouses, terraced up the side of a hill, have garden spaces in front. It was designed for the glory of time.After a serious fire in 1794, the town fathers hired a local engineer, Charles-Henri Junod, to rebuild it in a way that favored the primary industry: watchmaking.At the time, the man of the house might create dials in his front parlor workshop, while his neighbor next door specialized in balance wheels and the fellow down the street fashioned crowns. This shared production system, called etablissage, started in the 1600s, said Marikit Taylor, a local historian. Residents had been making watches by hand for a couple of centuries \u2014 sometimes getting local lacemakers to sell them along with their own goods during peddling trips.In this town in the Jura Mountains, about 3,300 feet above sea level, snow is a way of life; \u201cthere are two seasons, last winter and this winter\u201d is a favorite local saying. The wide streets allowed horse-drawn carriages with angled wooden plows to clear snow, and the townhouses were designed with stoops of white Jura limestone so front doors would be accessible \u2014 allowing the exchange of watch parts to proceed smoothly, no matter how much snow fell.The open space in front of each home ensured that as much natural light as possible could enter the workshops throughout the year.Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier, also made his mark here. His father made dials while the budding architect went to school to learn how to engrave watches. Struck by his design prowess, a professor had him work on some of the houses that now pepper the hillside of La Chaux-de-Fonds.In 1912, the 25-year-old Le Corbusier completed his first independent project, La Maison Blanche, for his parents. It is up the hill from another lovely mansion where Breitling was based in the late 1800s, and past the one occupied by Girard-Perregaux in the early 1900s. (Both buildings still are used to make watch components, but for different companies.)As La Chaux-de-Fonds\u2019s watch business grew, and so did some of the robotics, computing and medical equipment companies developed over the years by the skilled workers, there also developed a need for more space \u2014 space that the 22-square-mile town did not have in the city center.Many of those companies now line what locals call \u201cthe industrial zone,\u201d an area along the three-mile road that leads to the neighboring town of Le Locle. There, along with cows grazing in open fields and a chocolate packaging and distribution center, are the offices and factories of many big names in watches: Cartier, Patek Philippe, TAG Heuer, Breitling, Jaquet Droz.The concentration has drawn other watch brands, too. Mido, for one, moved from Biel, Switzerland, to Le Locle in 1997.Le Locle is much smaller than its neighbor, only about nine square miles, and has roughly 10,000 residents. It also is a watchmaking town, sharing a bit of history \u2014 and the Unesco citation \u2014 with La Chaux-de-Fonds: After a fire in 1833, Charles-Henri Junod was called upon again to rebuild a small part of Le Locle, adding the same kind of street grid system as in La Chaux-de-Fonds.But the smaller community has another claim to watch fame. It is where the Swiss industry became modernized.A delegation of Swiss watchmakers were shocked by the modern, under-one-roof production of some American watch companies exhibiting at the 1876 World\u2019s Fair in Philadelphia. As a result, the Zenith brand, founded in 1865 in Le Locle by Georges Favre-Jacot, opened a factory in the town. Other watchmakers followed suit and \u201cby the 1900s, the region was producing half the world\u2019s watches and watch components,\u201d said St\u00e9phanie Bavaresco of the Neuch\u00e2telois-Montagnes tourism office.Zenith now opens its doors every Friday, from 9 a.m. to noon. The tour, arranged by appointment, starts in the original factory building, where a wall contains Mr. Favre-Jacot\u2019s ashes. (The company now has 18 buildings.)It includes a stop in the attic where, during the rise of inexpensive quartz watches in the 1970s, an employee named Charles Vermot defied orders to destroy the machines used to make the company\u2019s famous El Primero caliber movements. A decade later, when mechanical watches were regaining favor, his action meant the company could easily resume production of the movements. And it did: For the 1984 Rolex Daytona, its own models and those of several other major watch makers.Of course Zenith was not alone in its struggles during what area residents still call the Quartz Crisis, the tone of their voices capitalizing the term in a lingering reminder of what the sudden popularity of inexpensive quartz watches did to the region.The growth of what now is one of Kering\u2019s primary watch brands underscores the fact that today almost every family in the two towns has someone employed in the watch industry.As Claudine Buehler, a local guide, described: \u201cMy grandfather was a watchmaker, my mother was a bookkeeper for a dial-making association, my father was a bookkeeper for a hands factory and my father-in-law is the owner of a mainspring factory where my husband worked.\u201dIt\u2019s the kind of link between industry and community that has helped these towns stand the test of time.An earlier version of this article misstated the elevation of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. The town is about 3,300 feet above sea level, not 300.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Democrats\u2019 Agenda: Ethics, Infrastructure and Medical Legislation", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic leaders say they would use their first month in the House majority to advance sweeping changes to future campaign and ethics laws, requiring the disclosure of shadowy political donors, outlawing the gerrymandering of congressional districts and restoring key enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act.\u201cThis is going to be a bitter pill for them all to swallow when they see the election results, if they turn out as we expect,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in an interview last week. She added of the prospect Mr. Trump would collaborate, \u201cI don\u2019t think he himself knows what he is going to do.\u201dDuring the campaign, Ms. Pelosi and her deputies sought to project a more modest and politically popular agenda on issues ranging from health care to criminal justice changes. They said they would work to improve the Affordable Care Act, for example, rather than rushing to replace it with a single-payer health care plan.And even as they prepare an onslaught of investigations into alleged malfeasance by the president and his administration, they said common ground could be found with Mr. Trump.\u201cWe\u2019re still going to have Donald Trump as president, so obviously that\u2019s going to limit to an extent what we can accomplish in the short term,\u201d Representative Jim McGovern, the Massachusetts Democrat in line to chair the Rules Committee, said last week. \u201cBut one thing we can accomplish is we can run the place like professionals and restore some integrity to the institution.\u201dMr. Trump has shown an interest in working with Democrats in the past, on issues like gun control and immigration, only to backtrack, and he could emerge from Election Day determined to shun Democrats.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, would have his own motivations to bypass or block House proposals, much as he blockaded legislation pushed by President Barack Obama. Then there is the challenge of reining in the most energized liberal lawmakers, for whom anything short of a presidential impeachment would be a compromise too far.But after eight years in the minority, most Democrats believe they will need to do more than embarrass the White House with subpoenas and investigative hearings if they want to be more than a one-term majority and reclaim the presidency in 2020. Ms. Pelosi made clear her party would only bend so far. Democrats are not \u201cgoing to lowest common denominator to get a presidential signature,\u201d she said.Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Ms. Pelosi\u2019s longtime No. 2, said Mr. Trump\u2019s stances would speak for themselves to 2020 voters. \u201cThe best politics for us is trying to work toward adopting the best policy for the American people,\u201d he added.As they talked up possible bipartisan initiatives, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer said that Democrats would push through \u2014 on party-line votes if necessary \u2014 other more liberal agenda items they say enjoy broad public support but have been stymied for years by Republican majorities. They include gun safety legislation; a bill to give permanent legal status and a path to citizenship to young, undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children; and the Equality Act, which would amend longstanding civil rights laws to extend legal protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Ms. Pelosi said that she would urge her caucus to revive a select committee focused on climate change, similar to the one that Democrats financed from 2007 to early 2011, to \u201cprepare the way with evidence\u201d for energy conservation and other climate change mitigation legislation. Republicans defunded the panel when they took the majority, but Ms. Pelosi said it was clearly still needed to educate the public about the impact of more frequent extreme weather events.\u201cThe template for 2020 is getting built in the House,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, a progressive in line to chair the Natural Resources Committee, summing up another Democratic view.Democrats have also prepared detailed, more liberal approaches for a $1 trillion infrastructure package and how to slow the increases in prescription drug costs, but indicated that they would steer proposals through the regular committee process in an effort to try to build a consensus with Republicans first. Mr. Hoyer said Democrats and Republicans would disagree over how to fund infrastructure spending, but they could bridge the gap with Mr. Trump\u2019s help.At least in theory, Democrats view election and ethics reform as another issue of potential collaboration. But their legislative package of more than a dozen bills, overseen by Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland, looks more like a retort to Mr. Trump\u2019s popular campaign claims that he would \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington \u2014 a difference Democrats have weaponized on the campaign trail.In an echo of actions they took in 2007, the last time they assumed House control, Democrats plan to use a package of rules governing the chamber prepared by Mr. McGovern to take unilateral steps that they say will tighten ethical standards, including \u2014 in a nod to a continuing ethics scandal roiling Republicans \u2014 a ban on House members\u2019 sitting on corporate boards.Together, Ms. Pelosi said, putting those efforts first would \u201ccaffeinate\u201d the Democrats\u2019 agenda, even if Republicans in the Senate do not take up the legislation.\u201cWhen people know the priority that we are giving to the integrity and government piece, it increases the confidence they have that we can do what we said,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.Chief among the legislation\u2019s provisions would be a measure by Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama that would amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to comply with a 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder that gutted the bill\u2019s key enforcement provision. In issuing its 5-to-4 decision, the court urged Congress to replace the scheme under which the federal government had overseen changes to election laws in states with a history of voting rights abuses.Another measure would require certain political nonprofits to disclose the identity of most of their donors for the first time. Democrats would like to go further, passing a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision and restore to Congress the power to limit money in politics, but those political prospects appear slim.Yet another provision would require all states to establish independent commissions to draw congressional districts. Several states already employ such bodies, but gerrymandering of political boundaries is the norm in most states, allowing the party in control of state government to create the most favorable jurisdictions for its congressional elections every decade, distorting the will of voters, Democrats argue.Also included are a series of bills tightening restrictions on federal lobbyists, beefing up the executive branch\u2019s Office of Government Ethics, which clashed with Mr. Trump early in his presidency, and requiring the president and vice president to divest any business holdings to prevent a possible conflict of interest.Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Famine Looms in Yemen, Saudi-Led Coalition Redoubles Attacks", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saudi-led coalition, which the United States has armed and supported, has launched a punishing wave of airstrikes against the rebel Houthis. The warplanes have hit targets in the capital, Sana; in the mountainous northern provinces; and in the Red Sea port of Hudaydah where, aid workers warn, the country\u2019s main humanitarian lifeline hangs by a thread.Columns of Yemeni militias fighting under the coalition flag have burst across a major front line and swept through the desert on the eastern edge of the city, threatening to encircle it completely, they say. Warplanes and attack helicopters have pummeled Houthi positions in the city in what aid workers called a near-continuous barrage of air attacks.Inside the city, local people reported that Houthi fighters had entrenched themselves, taking up positions in apartment buildings, hospitals and homes. At least 150 fighters from both sides have been reported dead so far.Tens of thousands of civilians, including some who only recently returned to the city during a lull in fighting, are sheltering in their homes, anxiously waiting. As the front lines have shifted, some have been forced to flee. A handful have been killed by stray gunfire.Even with the clashes, the port of Hudaydah, which lies just north of the city, is still working. On Tuesday, seven ships were at berth with an additional eight waiting to dock, including one vessel containing 10,000 tons of relief grain, the Western officials said.Strikingly, they added, the relief shipment was financed by the United Arab Emirates \u2014 the same power that was sending warplanes screaming over the city as its officers commanded the assault on Hudaydah from the south.The surge in fighting may stem from a Saudi desire to score territorial gains before any talks. But analysts say it could just as easily plunge the country deeper into war.\u201cAny military escalation does not help efforts to relaunch the political process,\u201d Martin Griffiths, the United Nations peace envoy, said in a text message. \u201cNo one wants to see a catastrophe in Hudaydah.\u201dThe Khashoggi crisis has called attention to a largely overlooked Saudi-led war in Yemen. On a rare trip to the front line, we found Yemenis fighting and dying in a war that has gone nowhere.For now, the main concern is keeping Yemen\u2019s chief gateway for humanitarian supplies open.About 75 percent of all international relief passes through Hudaydah, and the city\u2019s population has swelled in recent weeks as refugees who fled in June filtered home. Radhwan Shujaibi, a father of four, said he could no longer stand the cramped, desperate conditions his family had endured in Sana.\u201cNow, here we are in our home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live with dignity, we die with dignity.\u201dIn the city center, Houthi fighters riding motorbikes circulate through the largely empty streets, carrying sniper rifles and rocket launchers. Some ousted residents from their homes, which they used for sniper positions. The Houthis have been preparing for a battle inside the city for months, digging trenches in streets and laying land mines.Residents say there is a steady drumbeat of explosions from artillery or strikes by coalition warplanes and Apache attack helicopters. Early Monday, mortar shells hit a printing plant on the city outskirts, killing at least one worker and wounding three, according to plant officials.Over the weekend, the United Nations intervened to stop the Saudi-led coalition from bombing the hospital, where Houthi fighters had taken up positions on the roof.That is a frequent problem in Hudaydah, where Houthi fighters often fight near humanitarian buildings that are protected by a \u201cno-strike\u201d list drawn up by the coalition, the United States and the United Nations. Houthi fighters cache weapons or station troops beside such buildings in the hope of protecting them from airstrikes \u2014 but in so doing, can turn the buildings into legitimate military targets.The Saudi-led coalition has assured the United Nations that it does not intend to bring the fight into Hudaydah or to capture the city port. But the Saudi-led forces are now a few miles from the city\u2019s northern gates. Should they capture that area, they could encircle the city and impose a siege that would trap tens of thousands of civilians alongside the Houthis.The Khashoggi killing has cast light on Saudi tactics in Yemen, where an economic war has pushed millions to the brink of starvation.The United Nations has positioned a ship offshore to evacuate its staff should fighting spread to the streets. For civilians, a siege would even further limit access to food or clean water, and could lead to a deadly cholera epidemic. As the fighting nears, many are making difficult calculations.Bandar Khaled, a shipping official who has been out of work for months, said he feared that his family would soon be unable to leave. \u201dGetting trapped in here would be the worst,\u201d he said.Part of the problem, said a senior Western official familiar with the peace efforts, is the political turmoil caused by the death of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. With Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a critical American ally, under intense scrutiny over his presumed role in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, the direction of Saudi policy in Yemen is increasingly unclear.Some American officials, led by Mr. Mattis, are seeking to help Prince Mohammed extract himself from the Yemen war, a grinding and thus far unsuccessful campaign that some officials fear is becoming a military and diplomatic quagmire akin to Vietnam.The Western official said that Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of the United States Central Command, had drafted a proposal that would see the Saudis reduce airstrikes over Yemen in return for a Houthi commitment not to fire rockets into Saudi Arabia.In parallel, Mr. Griffiths, the United Nations envoy, is hoping to achieve some political momentum before he addresses the Security Council on Yemen on Nov. 16.But there remains a deep gulf of trust. An attempt to bring the Houthis to peace talks in Geneva in September collapsed after Houthi officials failed to turn up. Houthi officials complained then that they did not trust the Saudis, who control the airspace over Yemen, to ensure their safe passage to and from the country.United Nations officials say they are currently working to overcome those concerns and get both side to the talks.Mohammed Ali Kalfood reported from Hudaydah, Yemen, and Declan Walsh from Cairo.Advertisement"}

Players Association, Eric Winston is up against billionaire owners, the commander in chief and an existential threat to football itself.Supported byWanting only to let his muscles start their slow recovery for the next practice, Mr. Winston plunged into an ice bath. And then kept plunging. Even though he\u2019s nearly seven feet tall on his tiptoes, he had to tread water because, for no discernible reason, the ice tubs were a baffling eight feet deep.\u201cYou had to put a stool in it,\u201d Mr. Winston said recently over lunch in Washington, D.C., near the headquarters of the N.F.L. Players Association, where he has a second job \u2014 a kind of pro bono side hustle \u2014 as union president. \u201cThen you\u2019d press it down because you were in the cold tub and you didn\u2019t want to go all the way down. You had to submerge a stool to stand on.\u201d Mr. Winston\u2019s employer was a profit-sharing partner in a multibillion-dollar syndicate \u2014 one of the few truly risk-free ventures in American commerce. And it couldn\u2019t be bothered to provide an ice tub that required no active effort to avoid drowning.(Mark Dalton, a Cardinals spokesman, disputed Mr. Winston\u2019s characterization of the tub, saying it was closer to 5.5 or 6 feet deep. \u201cTo exaggerate those details in order to provide a more colorful and dramatic anecdote for a story does not change the fact that the details are simply not true,\u201d he said.)Of the many challenges Mr. Winston faces, a meta one is this: a lack of sympathy for his constituents because they are assumed to be coddled millionaires. Hence his eagerness to point out that the work of an N.F.L. player is far from glamorous. In 2013, by the time Mr. Winston and his colleagues were pushing stools into ice water, trying to keep them from floating up and conking them in the face, the Cardinals\u2019 facility was 23 years old. (The space got an upgrade after Mr. Winston left the team.) By now, rookies from major college programs \u2014 Texas A&M, Ohio State, Oregon, Penn State \u2014 are routinely \u201ctaking a step down in facilities when they go to the pros,\u201d Mr. Winston said.His on-field career is over, but now he has 18 more months as a player emeritus to complete a lifetime of work and, perhaps more important, help the union gear up for a gathering holy war with ownership: the renegotiation of the N.F.L.\u2019s current collective bargaining agreement, which expires after the 2020 season.Owners have heard such posturing before. It\u2019s Mr. Winston\u2019s job to make sure they believe it. And this time, things really are different. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the tension between N.F.L. players and franchise owners is higher than it\u2019s ever been, and it goes well beyond traditional labor conflicts and into issues of basic human worth. Too often, the players feel, owners must be dragged into treating them like they\u2019re human beings, rather than glorified auto parts.\u201cGuys are fed up,\u201d said Andrew Whitworth, an All Pro left tackle and Mr. Winston\u2019s former teammate in Cincinnati, who now plays for the Los Angeles Rams. \u201cThe game right now \u2014 as strong as it is, as much money as is being made, and you\u2019ve got a commissioner out there making the kind of money he\u2019s making, guys are getting frustrated with how teams treat players in general sometimes. They\u2019re getting tired of it.\u201dThey\u2019ve noticed that the training facilities are inferior, but the opioid painkillers are plentiful.And players have noticed all kinds of tiny nuances in How Things Work that always seem to cut against players. Take, for instance, how all team employees get biweekly paychecks throughout the year \u2014 except players, who get checks only during the football season. The N.B.A. does not work this way; their players get paid twice a month, just like everyone else in the company. N.F.L. owners won\u2019t change the arrangement.\u201cA billion-dollar corporation,\u201d Mr. Winston said, \u201cand you\u2019re telling me accounting can\u2019t figure it out?\u201dA press official for the league declined several requests for comment.When trust breaks down, suspicion creeps into everything, and Mr. Winston sees malign intent even here. Most N.F.L. players, he pointed out, are young men in their early 20s, who often come from modest means, and don\u2019t know how to budget. \u201cDo you want your players saving money or not saving money?\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want your players needing to play football, or not needing to play football?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all about control,\u201d Mr. Winston added. \u201cEven more than money, it\u2019s always been control.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no responsibility for them to pay you what they said they were going to pay you,\u201d Mr. Whitworth said. \u201cThere\u2019s just something not right about that.\u201dMr. Winston, who knows what a powder keg this issue is for both sides, is more circumspect about it. For one thing, he said, guaranteed contracts are not forbidden by the current C.B.A. It\u2019s just been (again) How Things Work for so long that changing it is like getting the earth to reverse its rotation. Even so, players have made significant headway on it over the course of this C.B.A.; according to the players\u2019 association, 386 players now have their contracts fully guaranteed and 300 more have nearly full guarantees. It\u2019s nowhere close to the N.B.A.\u2019s 100 percent, but it\u2019s a marked improvement over 2011, when only top-tier quarterbacks could pull off such a demand.For Mr. Winston, one of the keys to setting up a win in 2021 is making the case in public today that most N.F.L. players are getting a raw deal. He knows what most fans think: that pro athletes get to play a game for a living, and how dare they whine about that? He knows he needs to persuade fans to see pro athletes the way he does: as employees who go to work every day just like the rest of us, with crummy bosses and substandard workplaces and a power imbalance between labor and management.Just as it was during the last C.B.A. negotiation, the face of management is the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, who is, to put it mildly, not popular among players. Mr. Goodell has often described his job with a military metaphor: \u201cprotecting the shield,\u201d a reference to the N.F.L.\u2019s Captain America-style logo. But to the union, Mr. Goodell\u2019s real job is using the shield to keep players a safe distance from the owners who pay his salary; his compensation can rise to $40 million a year with incentives. What frustrates Mr. Winston is that, to fans, N.F.L. labor disputes are seen as a greedy fight between two comparably rich sides over who gets more of the pie \u2014 and that historically, the league has swayed most fans to side with owners in the name of team spirit. To Mr. Winston, those fans are wrong in a fundamental way: Including retired players, most N.F.L.ers are not rich, and won\u2019t ever get rich from the game. Players drafted after the first two rounds each get the same basic contract: four years, non-guaranteed, escalating from a base salary of $480,000 in year one to $705,000 in year four. Sixty percent of the athletes in the league make the minimum salary.Mr. Winston has gotten rich playing football, with more than $20 million in career earnings. But he\u2019s always been the type to speak his mind, and he\u2019s always been practical and meticulous. His father was a school vice principal in Midland, Tex., and his mother was a nurse. \u201cBoth very hard-working, didn\u2019t have a ton, both very detailed-oriented,\u201d he said. \u201cYou come from modest upbringings, and you kind of keep track of things.\u201dThe players union is not the S.E.I.U., and Eric Winston is not football\u2019s Che Guevara. The N.F.L. is a league filled on all fronts with rabid capitalists, and Mr. Winston, who studied international finance in college at the University of Miami, is certainly one of them. He doesn\u2019t think teams should be forbidden from cutting players; he doesn\u2019t think issues like guaranteed contracts are morally or economically cut-and-dried. He doesn\u2019t even think all of the team owners are terrible; Mr. Kraft in particular, he said, is a reasonable person and a model for respectful labor relations.In an interview, Mr. Kraft praised Mr. Winston\u2019s even-handedness as a counterpart, but lamented that \u201csometimes you can run into players who are focused solely on short-term decisions. Almost like football coaches, you know \u2014 they want to win and that\u2019s all they care about.\u201d Owners, meanwhile, \u201cwant what\u2019s good for the game long-term. I mean, our family is in this long-term.\u201d A multigenerational investment perspective is not available to, say, a 23-year-old running back drafted in the fourth round.Mr. Kraft has a clear grasp, though, on why the Kaepernick issue still looms large for so many players and how urgent it is for the league to resolve it. \u201cLet me say this: I would very much like to see him in the league,\u201d he said.One unconfirmed media report in mid-September claimed that his team had engaged in discussions with Mr. Kaepernick, ultimately fruitless, to back up quarterback Tom Brady. In the interview, Mr. Kraft called the report a \u201crumor\u201d that had originated with a lawyer in Kaepernick\u2019s camp, but when asked if that meant the report was untrue, he paused for three seconds. \u201cI\u2019m done talking about it,\u201d he said finally. (Mr. Kaepernick and his lawyer, Mark Geragos, did not respond to requests for comment.)The Kaepernick dispute is, at root, a labor issue, one Mr. Winston would like to see resolved before he steps aside in 2020, though he\u2019s not holding his breath. In the meantime, he said, it just gets added to the growing list of corrosive incidents that are eating through players\u2019 trust for their bosses like battery acid. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to sugarcoat it, because it\u2019s like, \u2018Listen, you want us to sit down and do a deal and figure this out \u2014 but the last eight years, you want us just to forget about?\u2019\u201d Mr. Winston shook his head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the way it works. That\u2019s not human nature.\u201dAny politician worth his lapel pin doesn\u2019t just choose the hills he\u2019s willing to die on; he also wants to make sure he gets credit for the work he\u2019s already done. Mr. Winston\u2019s biggest wins have come on things that seem small, but that chip away at this culture of control and take some back for the players. After lunch, back at the N.F.L.P.A. headquarters, he reflected on the gains that make him proudest: financial literacy training for rookies, a roster of league-verified money managers, more investment in training facilities, improved post-retirement medical care.But it\u2019s what he does with these last few months that could make the most lasting impact, as the players\u2019 union positions itself for the most consequential fight of its existence. When Mr. Winston took over in 2013, he said, he expected to be a peacetime leader. Then came \u201cDeflategate,\u201d then Adrian Peterson\u2019s child-abuse case, then Mr. Kaepernick, then President Trump, then Jerry Richardson and Robert McNair. \u201cBoom, boom, boom, boom,\u201d Mr. Winston said.An earlier version of this article inaccurately described the compensation of the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell. It is based on salary and incentives; it is not guaranteed.Advertisement"}

Murtagh, the first designated \u201ckeeper\u201d of the National Register of Historic Places and a paladin among preservationists, died on Oct. 28 in a retirement community in Sarasota, Fla. He was 95.The cause was congestive heart failure, his nephew Dean F. Murtagh said.Hoping to reverse what he called \u201cthe visual trashing of America\u201d inflicted by urban renewal bulldozers and interstate highway billboards, Dr. Murtagh galvanized architects, historians, preservationists, archaeologists, local civic leaders and an informed public to consider places worth saving. He was driven, he said, by a concern \u201cfor what we might call the cultural ecology of the country.\u201dThe sites on the register \u2014 from districts to structures to objects \u2014 are recommended by state and local officials and now number 93,000. Their historical value must be taken into account by federal agencies planning construction or other measures that might alter the sites.Unless the federal government is involved in financing or licensing the property, owners can legally demolish the sites, but they may be eligible for tax breaks and grants for preserving them.Mr. Murtagh in 2013. \u201cA colossus in our field,\u201d said Stephanie Meeks, who heads the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\u201cIn many ways, Dr. Murtagh gave preservation in America itself a history,\u201d Stephanie Meeks, president and chief executive of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said in a statement. Calling him \u201ca colossus in our field,\u201d she said \u201chis leadership and scholarship guided the legislative origins and growth of historic preservation in America in the 20th century.\u201dWilliam John Murtagh was born on May 2, 1923, in Philadelphia. His father owned butcher shops, and his mother was a homemaker.Once he recuperated from a serious automobile accident, he returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a master\u2019s degree in art history and a doctorate in architectural history. He received a Fulbright Scholarship to attend the Universities of Bonn and Freiburg in Germany to study local influences there on Pennsylvania Dutch architecture. His appreciation for preservation was further heightened when he visited German cities ravaged in World War II.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018His marriage to Mary Louise Morton ended in divorce. His nephews Dean and Reed Murtagh are his closest survivors.Dr. Murtagh expanded the park service\u2019s mission from conserving land to preserving places. And he broadened its constituency from, as he put it in a National Historic Preservation Program oral history in the Cornell University Library, a narrow base of \u201crich, white, WASP, American women with their historians or curators in tow.\u201dDr. Murtagh also sought to incorporate preservation into urban planning and differentiate between landmarking an individual building and protecting a broader area, like a district or a neighborhood or a battlefield.He was the recipient of several distinguished awards, and in 1988 established the Keepers Preservation Education Fund to provide scholarships in preservation. (They are now administered by the Maine Community Foundation; he had a home in Castine, Me.)Dr. Murtagh preferred a bottom-up preservation agenda driven by local priorities, and he would emphasize it when state and local officials sought his advice on sites for the National Register.In the oral history, he recalled one official asking: \u201c \u2018We have 16 lighthouses on the Oregon coast. How many do we nominate to the National Register?\u2019 And I developed the stock answer by saying, \u2018How many of them do you think you need to retain your sense of locality and place? You tell me. I\u2019m not going to tell you.\u2019 \u201d\u201cAlways think of the programs in terms of local significance,\u201d Dr. Murtagh said. \u201cYou know, who\u2019s going to look after the hot-dog stands of America?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nissan\u2019s Ghosn to Spend at Least 10 More Days in Custody", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Carlos Ghosn, one of the world\u2019s most powerful car industry leaders, will be detained for 10 more days as prosecutors investigate accusations of financial misconduct against him, and French and Japanese officials prepare to meet over the case.Japanese prosecutors arrested Mr. Ghosn, who oversaw an alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, Monday on his corporate jet shortly after it landed at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. He has yet to be charged with a crime.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s detention could last several more weeks. Under Japanese law, prosecutors can hold suspects for up to 23 days without filing charges. While he is held, Mr. Ghosn is likely to live in spare conditions. Even a request for extra blankets would have to go through lawyers.\u201cThere will be no special treatment\u201d for Mr. Ghosn, said Tsutomu Nakamura, a former prosecutor in Japan who is now a private defense lawyer with no role in the case. \u201cHe will be treated in the same way as a burglar.\u201dThe extended inquiry adds to the drama surrounding Mr. Ghosn\u2019s sudden arrest, which shocked an industry facing challenges amid a global trade war, slowing economies and rapid changes in automotive technology.The case has riveted Japan, home to Nissan and Mitsubishi and a country where Mr. Ghosn has long been admired. In France, where Renault employs 47,000 workers, the case against Mr. Ghosn, the carmaker\u2019s chairman and chief executive, has unleashed similar intrigue.At a news briefing on Wednesday, Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance and economy minister, said that his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshige Seko, would fly to Paris for a meeting on Thursday to discuss the alliance between Renault and Nissan. The two men spoke by phone on Tuesday.A spokeswoman for Mr. Le Maire said he was likely to seek information about Nissan\u2019s allegations against Mr. Ghosn. Mr. Le Maire had previously said there was no evidence that Mr. Ghosn engaged in wrongdoing in France, but that under the circumstances he had to step down temporarily from his role at Renault.The arrest on Monday came after an internal Nissan inquiry that found Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a onetime Nissan human resources manager and current member of the company\u2019s board, had underreported Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation to the Japanese government for several years.The Nissan board is to meet Thursday in Japan. Hiroto Saikawa, the carmaker\u2019s chief executive, has said the company is recommending that the board remove Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly from their posts. Mitsubishi said it would also seek to remove Mr. Ghosn as its chairman at a board meeting set for next week.NHK, Japan\u2019s public broadcaster, showed footage of Toshiyuki Shiga, Nissan\u2019s former chief operating officer and a current member of the board, entering the Tokyo prosecutors\u2019 office as part of the inquiry. He told reporters that he was submitting to questioning voluntarily.According to the Tokyo prosecutors\u2019 office, Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly underreported Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation from 2011 to 2015 by more than 5 billion yen ($44.5 million) \u2014 understating his true earnings by half \u2014 in reports to a bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance.The prosecutors\u2019 office declined to answer questions about where Mr. Ghosn or Mr. Kelly were being held. Mr. Nakamura, the former prosecutor, said they were probably at a detention center in eastern Tokyo.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty common in Japan to detain suspects for a long time,\u201d Mr. Nakamura said. \u201cThis is very different from the Western criminal justice system.\u201d Even after 23 days, Japanese law permits prosecutors to rearrest suspects on suspicion of other crimes and detain them for extended periods.Suspects are usually held in 50-square-foot rooms where they sleep on futons on the floor. They are allowed a limited set of clothes, Mr. Nakamura said. Long socks, which can be used to attempt suicide, are not allowed.While being held, he is not even allowed visits with family members. Criminal suspects not from Japan like Mr. Ghosn, a citizen of France and Lebanon, can see their lawyers and representatives from embassies.Laurent Pic, France\u2019s ambassador to Japan, visited Mr. Ghosn in detention on Tuesday. Landry Pierrefitte, deputy press counselor for the French Embassy in Tokyo, declined to comment on Mr. Ghosn\u2019s health or mental state.In a statement, the United States Embassy in Tokyo said that \u201cdue to privacy concerns,\u201d it could not comment on whether members of its diplomatic staff had visited Mr. Kelly.Under a change to Japanese criminal law that took effect in June, prosecutors can offer immunity to suspects in certain cases involving financial, drug or firearm crimes in exchange for information about criminal activity committed by third parties.Nissan said it was cooperating with the inquiry.\u201cNissan has been providing information to the Japanese public prosecutors office and has been fully cooperating with its investigation,\u201d Nicholas Maxfield, a Nissan spokesman, said. \u201cWe will continue to do so.\u201dAnalysts criticized Mr. Saikawa and the Nissan board for failing to detect the false reporting earlier.\u201cIt seems like there were complaints against Ghosn within the company,\u201d said Takashi Inoue, chief executive of Inoue Public Relations. Mr. Saikawa, he added, \u201cis responsible for missing the false reporting.\u201dMr. Inoue said other Nissan executives may have been jealous of Mr. Ghosn, who was paid was much more than anyone else at the company. As Nissan\u2019s chairman last year, Mr. Ghosn reported income of \u00a5735 million ($6.5 million) while Mr. Saikawa was paid \u00a5499 million ($4.4 million) as chief executive.Some analysts said that Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation may have prompted an outsize response to the alleged financial misconduct.\u201cJapanese media seems to be playing the ire of the public against large compensation of C.E.O.s to support the charge, but the inequality in compensation between ordinary workers and C-class managers are moral issues, not criminal issues,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors in Tokyo, referring to positions like chief executive and chief financial officer.\u201cThis dramatic arrest does seem excessive for what he has been alleged to have done,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf he evaded a huge amount of tax to the authorities, the arrest would be justified.\u201d But, Mr. Okubo said, given that the allegations involve not declaring income to corporate regulators, \u201cI think this seems excessive.\u201dThere is no current allegation that Mr. Ghosn did not pay appropriate taxes on his income.Renault, which owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, appointed a temporary leadership team on Tuesday to fill the gap created by Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest, but has said that he remains chairman and chief executive.Motoko Rich reported from Toyko, and Liz Alderman from Paris.

A mix of shame and self-preservation would make candidates less inclined to put out ads that were false or just plain ugly.Adorable.The video was so demonizing of Latino migrants and so defamatory of Democrats that it took a place alongside the infamous Willie Horton ad that helped George Bush defeat his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, in the 1988 presidential election.Mr. Trump\u2019s tactic wasn\u2019t unusual in a year of new lows in politics and media.It\u2019s enough to make a political slasher of yore feel irrelevant.\u201cGuys like me are anachronisms now \u2014 the candidates can curse themselves,\u201d said Floyd G.

During the early months of 2016, when the business discussions were taking place, he was publicly pressing for warmer relations between the United States and Russia and an end to economic sanctions imposed by the Obama administration, policy positions that might have benefited his family business.After pleading guilty in a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday morning, Mr. Cohen said that he made the false statements to Congress out of loyalty to the president and to align with Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical messaging.\u201dUnited States of America v. Michael Cohen: the special counsel\u2019s charges against Michael D. Cohen related to the Russia investigation. (PDF, 10 pages, 0.3 MB)Mr. Cohen said on Thursday that he discussed the status of the project with Mr. Trump on more than the three occasions he had previously acknowledged and briefed Mr. Trump\u2019s family members about it.Some of those exchanges, which continued until January 2016, included the president\u2019s children Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., both of whom are executives at the Trump Organization, according to three people familiar with the documents that the company turned over to Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.In one email exchange in 2015, Ms. Trump made a suggestion about the architecture, according to two of the people familiar with the messages.Donald Trump Jr. appeared to have replied to only one message, saying \u201cCool\u201d in response to an update about the project, the people said.Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen discussed Mr. Trump himself traveling to Russia after the Republican National Convention, though that trip never materialized.Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president.\u201cThere was a good chance that I wouldn\u2019t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?\u201d he said to reporters as he left Washington for the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires.\u201cWe decided \u2014 I decided ultimately \u2014 not to do it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThere would have been nothing wrong if I did do it.\u201dRoger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.Mr. Trump accused his former fixer of lying to receive a reduced sentence for the crimes he has pleaded guilty to. Under his earlier plea agreement, Mr. Cohen faced about four to five years in prison.\u201cHe was convicted of various things unrelated to us,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s a weak person and what he\u2019s trying to do is get a reduced sentence.\u201dThe acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, was told of Mr. Cohen\u2019s impending plea Monday or earlier, a person familiar with the special counsel\u2019s investigation said. The White House learned of it late Wednesday, people close to Mr. Trump said.The new revelations also came a week after Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers provided Mr. Mueller with written responses to a set of questions.The special counsel identified Mr. Cohen\u2019s false statements to Congress in testimony and materials that Mr. Cohen provided to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, which have been conducting their own investigations into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason people shouldn\u2019t lie when they\u2019re in front of a congressional investigation,\u201d Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday. The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, said that the panel had made additional criminal referrals to Mr. Mueller, but he gave no specifics.Mr. Trump said on Thursday that discussions about the Moscow project took place in early 2016, but that he did not know exactly when he decided to stop pursuing it.Mr. Cohen\u2019s new guilty plea in Federal District Court is the first time the office of the special counsel has charged him. In exchange for pleading guilty and continuing to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, he may hope to receive a lighter sentence.He is scheduled to be sentenced in two weeks. It is unclear what additional time he could face with the new guilty plea.During his plea hearing in August, Mr. Cohen admitted to making a $130,000 payment to an adult film actress, Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, to keep her quiet about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump.The payment amounted to an illegal contribution to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, prosecutors argued, since her silence bolstered his election hopes and campaign finance law prohibits individuals from donating more than $2,700 to a presidential candidate.He said that the payments to Ms. Clifford and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, were made \u201cin coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office\u201d \u2014 a reference to Mr. Trump.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea on Thursday only added urgency for congressional investigators who plan to begin an inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign business dealings when Democrats take control of the House in January.\u201cIf the president and his associates were being untruthful in real time as they were pursuing this deal,\u201d Mr. Schiff told reporters on Thursday, \u201cwhat does it mean now on how much we can rely on what the president is saying about any continuing Russian financial interest?\u201dMark Mazzetti reported from Washington, and Benjamin Weiser, Ben Protess and Maggie Haberman from New York.

{"Headline": "The Magnus Effect: Norway Falls Hard for Chess", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "Chess is omnipresent in Norway, the home to the world champion Magnus Carlsen. And, somehow, it has become cool. Supported byOSLO \u2014 Late on Friday night, a couple hundred people were packed into a dimly lit, stylishly decorated bar in the heart of Oslo\u2019s downtown night-life district.The place already was generating considerable buzz. It had been open for only a week, but one recent night the line to enter had snaked down the block. Inside, it felt like so many of the other hip spots in downtown Oslo \u2014 candlelight illuminating framed artwork on the walls, conversation humming over the clink of beer glasses \u2014 except for one small detail: the chess games happening at every table and countertop.\u201cThat\u2019s the Magnus Effect,\u201d said Martin Mortensen, a 32-year-old software developer at the bar, referring to the Norwegian world champion Magnus Carlsen. \u201cAlmost everyone in Norway has some relationship to chess nowadays. It\u2019s on T.V. and in newspapers all the time.\u201d He scanned the overflowing room. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre.\u201dCarlsen, 27, has been the world\u2019s top-ranked chess player for the past eight years. He has won the past three world championships, and this month in London he has been locked in tense competition with Fabiano Caruana, a 26-year-old American, in a bid to claim a fourth title.The Magnus Effect, as it were, describes the various sociocultural phenomena accompanying his rise: the way Carlsen, a menschy young man from Tonsberg, became one of the country\u2019s most famous people; the way television producers here turned a notoriously dawdling activity into a rollicking spectator sport; the way millions of Norwegians, most of them casual or new fans of the game, have integrated it into their lives.The effect then, can be seen everywhere. In a country of around five million people, close to half a million play chess regularly online, according to the Norwegian Chess Federation. Stores struggle to keep chessboards on their shelves. Chess podcasts hover atop the download charts in Norway, and trams are full of people playing on their phones. Children play chess on play dates. Adults play chess-themed drinking games at chess-watching parties.Chess is omnipresent, Norwegians say. And, somehow, it has become cool.\u201cI think per capita Norway is now the most chess crazy country in the world,\u201d said Lars Petter Fosdahl, 50, one of the owners of the chess-themed bar, The Good Knight.Carlsen became a chess grandmaster at age 13, and first topped the world rankings in 2010. But that was not enough, initially, to make Norwegians catch chess fever. The chess god, it turned out, needed someone to communicate his gifts, and the joys of the sport, to the masses.It was a gamble. The average professional chess match consists of little more than two men in dark suits staring down at a table with their heads cradled in their hands. The world championship unfolds as a best-of-12-games series. A single game can last hours, and the whole thing can take more than two weeks to finish. In 2012, the American news program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d aired a segment on Carlsen in which the correspondent, Bob Simon, mused that watching an elite chess match, for nonplayers, \u201cwould be like watching paint dry.\u201dUndaunted, NRK developed a talk show-style program \u2014 filmed on a soundstage in front of a live audience \u2014 that employed colorful graphics and running analysis from a panel of chess experts, television personalities and national celebrities curious about the game.The show was a hit. That first year, the final game drew an average of 335,000 viewers. The year after that, the deciding game drew 572,000. And in 2016, an average of 764,000 viewers, a 56 percent share of the national television audience, watched Carlsen clinch his third world title.\u201cIt was confirmation that anticipation can be action,\u201d said Reidar Stjernen, the show\u2019s producer.In some ways, the chess broadcasts mirrored one of the most distinctly Norwegian innovations of the 21st century: slow television.\u201cWe\u2019re weird in many ways \u2014 so many ways,\u201d Andersen said a few hours before the show last Friday. \u201cWe like things that no one else likes.\u201dThe chess game that night, the sixth between Carlsen and Caruana, was an 80-move draw that lasted six and a half hours. NRK said it drew a quarter of the national television audience.She said she and the other hosts \u2014 Torstein Bae, a professional chess player, and Heidi Roneid, who fields live inquiries from viewers \u2014 try to keep things lively, cracking jokes and analyzing past and potential moves, while cultivating the specific (and very Norwegian) feeling of being \u201cin a cabin watching chess.\u201dOn screen, a horizontal meter that displays the computer-generated odds of winning in real time provides a dose of dramatic irony and helps distill the immense but often-inscrutable tension of the game to a general audience.\u201cThat was some of the most exciting television I\u2019ve seen in years,\u201d Edvin Dybvik, a 54-year-old postal worker from Trondheim, said about the marathon broadcast.Dybvik said he liked to watch the show at home with a chessboard in front of him, so he could mirror the moves as he listened to the analysis.Others in Norway watch at home with family or groups of friends; the show has spawned various drinking games, even as the interminable chess broadcasts have been known to interrupt professional plans and social obligations.\u201cI watch every day, screaming at the TV,\u201d said Sonja Krohn, 77, a painter from Oslo, who has been struggling with her latest project while watching the games in her studio. \u201cMy work has to wait.\u201dThe continued success of Carlsen, and the broadcasts, has led even more Norwegians to take up the game themselves.Oystein Brekke, who owns a chess store in Drammen, said he had handled about 12 online orders a day in the years before NRK began broadcasting chess. In 2013, during one of Carlsen\u2019s games, his son called him over to show him something on the computer: They had received 200 orders in a single hour.\u201cIn our shop, it has never been the same again,\u201d Brekke said.Since 2015, the Norwegian bank DNB has financed a project through the Norwegian Chess Federation to provide chess education in 500 primary schools, an initiative that would have been unthinkable before the chess boom, according Hanne Evensen, a federation spokeswoman. But the payoff is showing up in other numbers: Sjakklubben Stjernen, a 95-year-old chess club in Oslo, has nearly doubled its membership in recent years after decades of stagnation.\u201cSmart is the new sexy \u2014 or something like that,\u201d said Vegard Ramstad, the president of the club.The chess boom even has served as a muse for some of the nation\u2019s most famous artists. Earlier this year, the Henie Onstad museum in Baerum, just outside Oslo, put on a retrospective for the conceptual photographer Dag Alveng. Alongside other work from his four-decade career, Alveng exhibited new photographs he shot around the world at the grave sites of former world champion chess players.To mark the opening of his show, Alveng organized a Fischer Random-style chess match between Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura that took place over five days on the museum floor. It was broadcast, naturally, on NRK.\u201cConceptual art, where art is an intellectual pursuit, exists on a purely intellectual level,\u201d said Alveng, 65, who said he was inspired by the recent surge of interest in the game. \u201cI think the beauty of ideas has a lot in common with the act of finding a new or interesting move in a chess game, that abstract thought.\u201dFor all of the buzz the game has garnered in the past five years, chess enthusiasts speak in wary tones about the life cycle of another national fad: curling.Thus, the question of whether chess one day will experience the same parabolic run in popularity has divided players here.\u201cYou can\u2019t play curling on your cellphone while you\u2019re on the bus to work, while you\u2019re babysitting, or in the five minutes before you go to sleep,\u201d said Kristoffer Gressli, one of the owners of the chess bar. \u201cSo even if the worst happens in this world championship \u2014 that is, Magnus Carlsen loses \u2014 I don\u2019t think the craze is going to fade.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the House Fell: Republican Chaos and Democratic Focus", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe message from Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, was urgent and unsparing. In a meeting with Republican lawmakers before they left Washington for the August congressional recess, Mr. McCarthy warned that time was running short: Unless they intensified their campaign efforts and forcefully delivered a coherent message, he said, Republicans would suffer grievous losses in November.Instead of arresting their political decline, House Republicans proved unable at every turn to stay ahead of their troubles \u2014 including many of their own making.By Labor Day, Republicans were fatally unprepared for an onslaught of Democratic campaign spending that overwhelmed their candidates from South Florida to Seattle. Party leaders on Capitol Hill and in the White House soon turned on one another and against their candidates with growing intensity. Two key groups \u2014 the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party\u2019s campaign arm in the House, and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a powerful Republican super PAC \u2014 plunged into all but open warfare over messaging and money.Democrats, in turn, delivered a message about health care with the repetitive force of a jackhammer. They cracked congressional maps drawn to favor Republicans and seized an array of open seats, while also felling longtime incumbents who had grown complacent.And in the end, President Trump may have delivered the final blow to his party across the diverse and growing metropolitan communities that decided control of the House. In the last weeks of the campaign, Mr. Trump cast aside a positive Republican message about economic prosperity in favor of stoking racial panic about immigration \u2014 with appeals that veered into overt racism, alienating moderate swing voters and further enraging Democrats.Republicans lost control of the House Tuesday night after eight years in power, with Democrats picking up seats in several suburban districts where the party traditionally did well. But if House Republicans were badly shaken by their defeat, few party leaders were genuinely surprised at the nature of their losses. In interviews with dozens of lawmakers, campaign strategists, activists and donors in both parties, a clear consensus emerged about the arc of the 2018 election.It was a campaign defined early by Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive persona and hard-right ideology, and by Republican leaders\u2019 unswerving decision to align themselves with Mr. Trump and his overwhelmingly white, rural base rather than politically vulnerable moderates in Congress who hailed from the country\u2019s population centers and represented the political middle.A campaign of retribution against Republicans who did not pledge fealty to Mr. Trump \u2014 and to Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s legislative agenda \u2014 triggered an exodus of senior legislators that opened the way for a Democratic takeover.Representative Ed Royce of California was not the first Republican to decide he would not run for re-election in 2018. But his announcement, in January, was the warning bell that tolled most ominously for Republican leaders.The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Royce held a quickly diversifying Orange County seat that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 even as it re-elected him. But he told colleagues that he bitterly resented the fruitless, politically damaging health care debate, and announced his retirement in a statement that took the N.R.C.C. by surprise.Within weeks, Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, followed suit. Though he had pledged to seek re-election, Mr. Frelinghuysen was incensed over the way Mr. Ryan treated him during the tax overhaul debate \u2014 the speaker, Mr. Frelinghuysen told associates, had threatened to eject him from his chairmanship.\u201cHe was appropriations chair, and there were lots of people trying to tell him what he could and couldn\u2019t do as appropriations chair,\u201d said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the head of the N.R.C.C. \u201cAt that point you\u2019re not as much of a chair.\u201dWith their pursuit of an orthodox conservative agenda on health care and taxes, Republican leaders split their party, driving moderate lawmakers into retirement and handing Democrats their most powerful issue of the campaign season \u2014 defending popular insurance coverage mandates in the Affordable Care Act.The shift to the left in the House in the 2018 Midterm elections went well beyond the districts Democrats flipped.By last spring, more than 40 House Republicans were leaving the chamber. In the Senate, two Republicans alienated by Mr. Trump, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, also quit in frustration.But the most stunning exit was Mr. Ryan\u2019s. After alienating senior colleagues with legislative arm-twisting and committing his conference to a hard-line agenda that left them gravely vulnerable, Mr. Ryan announced abruptly in April that he was retiring. While he promised to keep raising money for fellow Republicans, Mr. Ryan\u2019s contributions to the party would steadily decline; in the last fund-raising quarter of the campaign, his political committee transferred a paltry $1.4 million to the N.R.C.C., less than some first-time Democratic candidates raised for themselves.Mr. Ryan\u2019s decision left the Republican conference in a baleful mood \u2014 and enraged senior White House aides and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.\u201cHe thought it was selfish,\u201d said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell\u2019s top political adviser, recalling the lawmaker\u2019s reaction to Mr. Ryan\u2019s announcement: \u201cIf he wanted to leave, he could leave after the election. He let all his guys hang out to dry.\u201dMr. Stivers acknowledged that Mr. Ryan\u2019s retirement had choked the party\u2019s fund-raising. Mr. McCarthy and Representative Steve Scalise, the Republican whip, had stepped up to solicit donors as they jockeyed to succeed Mr. Ryan. But Mr. Stivers said there was no substitute for a formidable speaker.Beyond the speaker, Mr. Stivers said he pleaded with colleagues to run again and named several \u2014 including Mr. Frelinghuysen and Representatives Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Dennis Ross of Florida \u2014 as having undermined the party. He sniped at Mr. Ross, who quit the day Mr. Ryan retired: \u201cHe saw the cover of Paul retiring, and he slid right under it.\u201dMr. LoBiondo suggested he could change his mind and run for re-election, provided he could hang on to the chairmanship of a congressional subcommittee he was scheduled to relinquish. Republican leaders assented, but it was not enough.\u201cHe got what he said he wanted, and he still retired,\u201d Mr. Stivers said.Without the retirements, the Ohioan told a reporter who joined him as he knocked on doors in his district last Saturday, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even be talking about the House being in play.\u201dModerate Republicans in the House also quickly lost patience with what they saw as Mr. Ryan\u2019s deference toward the House Freedom Caucus, a far-right group aligned with Mr. Trump. \u201cListening to the Freedom Caucus is a problem,\u201d said Representative Will Hurd of Texas, a Republican who on Wednesday was clinging to a lead of a few hundred votes in his swing district.Former Representative Pat Tiberi of Ohio, a long-serving Republican who resigned in January to take a private-sector job, said Republicans had \u201coverreached\u201d and handed Democrats a decisive advantage on health care as a political issue.\u201cWe probably should have taken on infrastructure in a bipartisan way first and then maybe tax reform next, rather than health care first,\u201d Mr. Tiberi said.The tweet came without warning, on the day of the South Carolina primary. Watching television aboard Air Force One, on a flight back from his summit in Singapore with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean despot, Mr. Trump decreed that Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina must be defeated.Mr. Sanford, an idiosyncratic conservative who routinely criticized the president, was in a tough primary battle with Katie Arrington, a state legislator running as a Trump loyalist. Hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s message, Mr. Sanford conceded defeat.If Mr. Sanford suffered in June for his apostasy, Mr. Trump\u2019s party paid another price Tuesday: Ms. Arrington lost the general election in a heavily Republican district to Joe Cunningham, a Democrat.Mr. Trump\u2019s capricious approach to politics was destabilizing for Republicans up and down the ballot, leaving candidates exposed to the president\u2019s whims and grievances and the machinations of White House advisers. Rather than approaching the midterm campaign as a task of holding together a political coalition and steering it to victory, Mr. Trump focused chiefly on rewarding perceived friends \u2014 and punishing those who crossed him.He helped drive two senators, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake, into retirement, castigating them in humiliating terms online and driving up their unpopularity with Republicans. In gubernatorial elections, Mr. Trump helped anoint highly divisive nominees in states like Florida and Georgia \u2014 where the national G.O.P. had to burn millions staving off defeat \u2014 and Kansas, where Mr. Trump\u2019s favored candidate, Kris Kobach, was defeated by a Democrat, Laura Kelly.In other cases, Mr. Trump\u2019s associates lashed out at Republican candidates who failed to prostrate themselves sufficiently. When Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa issued a supportive statement about a renegotiated trade deal with Canada and Mexico, a White House aide sharply rebuked a strategist for Ms. Reynolds\u2019s campaign \u2014 because the governor did not praise Mr. Trump by name in her comment. And because of the perceived slight, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides dropped plans for the president to headline a fund-raiser for the governor, instead insisting that the event be held for the Iowa Republican Party.And in some cases, Mr. Trump upended his party\u2019s well-laid plans, only to change his mind or lose interest. In Florida, he endorsed Ron DeSantis, a member of Congress who defended him frequently on Fox News, for governor. Yet when Mr. DeSantis broke with the president, over Mr. Trump\u2019s false claim that the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria had been nefariously inflated, the president turned on his handpicked candidate.Mr. DeSantis ultimately won the governorship by a tiny margin, but Mr. Trump criticized him bitterly in the final days of the race. The former congressman, he complained to a friend, \u201cwas low-energy.\u201d Mr. DeSantis even earned a nickname: \u201cLittle Ronny D.\u201dFor members of the House, Mr. Trump was most burdensome mainly because of a mercurial approach to policy that left them unable to map legislation or political messaging in a coherent way. In one instance, Mr. Trump aggressively pushed members to vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and then, after a private dinner with Democrats in the middle of June, publicly derided Republicans\u2019 health care legislation as \u201cmean.\u201dOn two other occasions \u2014 when Congress was set to reauthorize an intelligence-gathering law and again when it was about to pass a sweeping government-funding bill for 2018 \u2014 Mr. Trump telephoned a senior aide after watching unfavorable Fox News coverage early in the morning and demanded, without effect, that the bills be taken off the floor.At no point, Republicans said, did Mr. Trump forge a cohesive political bond with Mr. Ryan. Indeed, when Mr. Ryan disagreed last month with Mr. Trump over a proposal to eliminate birthright citizenship, the president shot back with hot anger that echoed his attack on Mr. Sanford: The speaker, he said, should not be discussing \u201csomething he knows nothing about!\u201dMr. Ryan\u2019s allies only rolled their eyes at the all-too-familiar counterattack, predicting that the president would soon also pin the loss of the House on the speaker.Nancy Pelosi did not want to talk about Planned Parenthood.It was a meeting of House Democrats early in 2017, during Republicans\u2019 drive that March to strike down the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Pelosi and her political lieutenants laid out their counterattack: Democrats would talk about pre-existing conditions and millions of people losing coverage. And they would talk about an \u201cage tax\u201d \u2014 a provision in the Obamacare replacement passed by the House, which would have allowed health insurers to widen the premium gap between younger and older customers.That narrow focus on health care and a few economic issues came to define the Democrats\u2019 midterm campaign. It represented a wholesale rejection of Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed strategy in the 2016 campaign, which focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for office.Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in an interview that it had been challenging to break the habit of responding with reflexive, public outrage to Mr. Trump\u2019s utterances, especially as those utterances grew increasingly inflammatory. On a campaign swing in his home state the weekend before the election, Mr. Luj\u00e1n said Democratic leaders envisioned a starkly different path to victory, noting that in 2016 a character-driven campaign \u201cdidn\u2019t work.\u201d But the temptation persisted.\u201cEvery time he would say something or tweet something, it would come back: \u2018We need to come right back at him! Define him!\u2019\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n recalled. \u201cWe would say: Look, we don\u2019t need to talk about him, he\u2019s going to do it himself. We need to continue to have a conversation with the American people about kitchen-table issues.\u201dThat judgment was backed up by a vast trove of research, collected by Democratic committees and super PACs through polling and focus groups. House Majority PAC, the caucus\u2019s main super PAC, carried out two intensive research projects, studying right-of-center suburban voters and blue-collar whites who supported Mr. Trump. It concluded that only a message about health care and jobs could win over both groups.In a presentation compiled for the PAC in the summer of 2017 by the Democratic polling firm Normington Petts, party strategists delivered an unambiguous assessment: \u201cThe strongest policies for a Democratic candidate are almost entirely economically focused.\u201d And it warned that Mr. Trump was not the \u201cmost important villain\u201d \u2014 congressional Republicans were.The same presentation, focused on the white working class, noted vaguely: \u201cIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind, Democratic leaders will be a significant villain highlighted by the G.O.P.\u201d If the report did not name Ms. Pelosi as a target, the meaning was clear.The determination by party leaders to control Democrats\u2019 message in 2018 \u2014 channeling a tidal wave of liberal activism into a winning electoral strategy \u2014 extended to primary elections. Ms. Pelosi authorized party groups to meddle aggressively in California\u2019s open-primary system to ensure viable Democratic candidates would emerge. Her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, anointed centrist nominees for the open seats in Tennessee and Arizona.To the occasional consternation of the left, Democrats engaged sparingly on the issue of immigration, condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s harshest policies but never matching him blow for blow. In January, when activists pushed for a government shutdown over immigration, House Democrats concluded after a night of polling in swing districts that such a confrontation risked becoming a fiasco.That strategy of restraint brought Democrats steady gains, as they made inroads into Republican territory in a series of special elections and off-year elections, winning an improbable Senate seat in Alabama late last year, then seizing a solid-red congressional district near Pittsburgh in March. The Democratic victor there, Conor Lamb, ran on a message about health care and economic fairness, and pledged never to support Ms. Pelosi for speaker.Mr. Lamb\u2019s upset rattled the Republicans and spurred other moderate Democrats \u2014 including a sizable group elected this week \u2014 to disavow Ms. Pelosi. On the Republican side, the race stirred new doubts about whether attacks on Ms. Pelosi could save their majority.\u201cWhat was apparent there,\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n said, \u201cis that Republicans did not have a playbook to run against our candidates.\u201dMs. Pelosi herself was seemingly untroubled: During a fund-raising trip to Pennsylvania early in the summer, she expressed no discomfort with Mr. Lamb. On the contrary, she named him and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the left-wing insurgent who won a New York primary in June, as the ideological poles of an emerging Democratic congressional majority.A majority, Ms. Pelosi made clear, that she fully intended to lead.A 43-year-old House Republican who represented the well-to-do Kansas City suburbs, Mr. Yoder had to read about how the National Republican Congressional Committee was pulling its advertising from his district because it did not think he could win.Furious, Mr. Yoder telephoned Mr. Stivers and blistered him about being disloyal, reminding the campaign chairman that he had been a vice chairman of the N.R.C.C. and always paid his dues to the committee.Mr. Stivers accepted the tongue-lashing, but Mr. Yoder\u2019s campaign was beyond repair: he lost by 9 percentage points to Sharice Davids on Tuesday.Abandoning Mr. Yoder was a ruthless act of triage, aimed at saving money that could be used to rescue other members. But bitter personal clashes between Republican Party strategists hobbled their efforts to spend money coherently in the last stage of the election.Open animosity erupted between the Congressional Leadership Fund, the House super PAC funded heavily by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, and the N.R.C.C. The super PAC would ostentatiously leak word of plans to pull funding from vulnerable lawmakers, leaving the committee scrambling in some cases to make up the difference. In some cases, the groups seemed to make decisions more for the purpose of outflanking each other rather than thwarting Democrats.In late September, C.L.F. decided to cut loose two lawmakers, Mike Bishop of Michigan and Mike Coffman of Colorado, calling them unsalvageable. Disagreeing, the N.R.C.C. rushed new money into Mr. Coffman\u2019s district.Soon, both groups would change their assessments: When a poll showed Mr. Coffman losing by 14 percentage points, the N.R.C.C. rescinded much of the money it hastily deployed. And C.L.F., after humiliating Mr. Bishop, returned to spending in his district within weeks, trying to save him after all.Mr. Coffman lost decisively on Tuesday, while Mr. Bishop was losing by nearly four points with nearly all precincts reporting.In the campaign\u2019s finale, Democrats established an overwhelming advantage on television: A coalition of outside-spending groups, coordinated by House Majority PAC, poured an estimated $200 million into advertising, mainly around the tightly-organized themes laid out in the party\u2019s suburban and working-class opinion research.Bolstered by online donations, more than 100 Democratic candidates out-raised their Republican rivals in contested general-election races. And in October, a super PAC financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, ambushed still-complacent Republican lawmakers on the air with massive, late spending, helping to defeat incumbents like Randy Hultgren of Illinois and Steve Russell of Oklahoma.Rather than rallying to face that veritable war machine, Republicans turned on each other. Corry Bliss, the super PAC\u2019s sharp-elbowed chief strategist, badmouthed party strategy around Washington, criticizing the House committee for spending millions on incumbents he saw as hopeless, such as Barbara Comstock of Virginia, who enjoyed infusions of party cash through the end of the election \u2014 and lost by 12 percentage points, becoming the first incumbent defeated nationwide on Tuesday.But the N.R.C.C. viewed Mr. Bliss\u2019s group as reckless in its spending and insensitive to the delicate web of egos and relationships in the Republican conference.\u201cFighting with allies is hard, just look back at World War II,\u201d Mr. Stivers said, likening Mr. Bliss to Bernard Montgomery, the capable but egocentric British general.Even before Mr. Trump began thundering against an \u201cinvasion\u201d from Latin America \u2014 spurning with finality the moderate swing voters that Republicans desperately needed \u2014 his party\u2019s facade of election-year unity was crumbling.Panic mounting, Republican factions began looking out for themselves: Mr. McCarthy, currying favor with the right as he positioned himself to succeed Mr. Ryan, revived a push to fund Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall. On the weekend before the election, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a far-right rival of Mr. McCarthy, began calling colleagues to gauge their interest in supporting him for minority leader in a Democratic-led House.As Mr. Trump swallowed the already-faint Republican economic message with deafening appeals to right-wing nationalism, Republican campaign chiefs began expressing discomfort with his turn toward raw racial politics. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, head of the Republican Senate committee, expressed anxiety to allies that Mr. Trump\u2019s obsession with a migrant caravan could harm his Senate re-election in 2020.Among White House aides, improvisation and favor-trading overrode any semblance of political strategy. Even Vice President Mike Pence, aides noted, appeared less than deliberate in his approach: When conservative media began rippling with interest in John James, a long-shot Senate candidate in Michigan, Mr. Pence phoned the president from the state and urged him to campaign there. The same day, a public poll found Mr. James losing by 17 points to Senator Debbie Stabenow.Johnny DeStefano, counselor to the president, told an associate he used \u201cevery ounce of capital\u201d to keep Mr. Trump from visiting Michigan and other states where his party was sure to lose.And in a move that baffled their political peers, both Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy visited Kansas City on the Friday before the election to campaign with Mr. Yoder, among other Republicans \u2014 more than a month after the N.R.C.C. concluded Mr. Yoder could not win.Last weekend, the gulf between the two parties \u2014 in strategy and message, in political tenacity and internal cohesion \u2014 could not have been greater. Meeting with campaign donors in San Francisco, Ms. Pelosi declared confidently that the House majority would soon be in Democratic hands. Next up, she said, would be a \u201chuge amount of work to repair the fabric of the country,\u201d according to a person in attendance who paraphrased her comments.Campaigning in Georgia for Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, Mr. Trump delivered a message with all the subtlety of an arsonist\u2019s house fire, accusing Democrats of seeking to inflict \u201cmore crime and more caravans\u201d upon the country.And in a fluorescent-lit Republican Party office in Sheboygan, Wis., beneath a bleak sky, Mr. Ryan beamed through an upbeat pep talk to local Republicans about the economy.\u201cTwo hundred and fifty thousand jobs were created in America in October alone,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThis is working!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Blames Rogue Staff for Its 1MDB Scandal. That May Not Wash.", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchGoldman Sachs, facing one of the most significant scandals in its history, has turned to a well-worn defense: the rogue employee narrative.But the Wall Street firm seems unlikely to be able to slough off its role in the looting of a multibillion-dollar Malaysian government investment fund as the work of a few miscreants.Goldman\u2019s shares are down nearly 13 percent since Thursday\u2019s close because of concern over whether the firm\u2019s leaders might be dragged into the case.If only it were just some questionable shenanigans in the back room.Goldman earned $600 million from helping to arrange bond offerings of about $6.5 billion for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013. Goldman\u2019s management was sure to notice fees of that size, and it has been reported that Mr. Blankfein met with the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, Mr. Low and Mr. Leissner. But those fees were apparently not enough to raise questions about how the firm won a lead role in the transactions.An important question for prosecutors in determining Goldman\u2019s potential liability will be whether the company made any effort to review how the deals were approved or whether those responsible for vetting the transactions simply took the word of Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng.It will be interesting to see how hard a line the government takes, especially when there is evidence that hundreds of millions of dollars were diverted to fund questionable purchases, like a Picasso painting, and to finance the Hollywood movie \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201dThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has become an important tool used by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to police organizations that operate in parts of the world where bribery is an almost accepted means of doing business. A corporation like Goldman can be held responsible for criminal violations when one of its employees acts to benefit the firm through misconduct. Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng, along with lining their own pockets, clearly sought to bolster Goldman\u2019s bottom line at the expense of their client. The usual resolution of a case like this is a deferred prosecution agreement, in which the defendant admits to violations and makes an agreement with the S.E.C. not to violate the law again.Any settlement will be an indication of how tough the federal government will be in a case involving clear violations of the anti-bribery law. One likely penalty will be repayment of the $600 million in profits made from the bond deals, and perhaps a fine on top of that.It may be that only a few Goldman employees were responsible for the 1MDB violations, but they were not just functionaries who lost their way. A partnership at Goldman is one of the most coveted positions on Wall Street, so labeling high-level managers as uncontrolled rogues as a way to avoid criminal charges may not play well with prosecutors, especially when the deals were so lucrative for the company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Fight to Turn Red California Blue ", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig swaths of the Golden State remain conservative, and changing the political fabric and voting patterns of a community takes more than one election. Ms. Pawel, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of \u201cThe Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation.\u201dTURLOCK, Calif. \u2014 It started so small. Twenty people in Crystal Sousa\u2019s living room, traumatized by the election of Donald Trump, trying to channel desperation into constructive action. Be the Change, they called the group that coalesced in this small, conservative city in the Central Valley of California. Almost all the leaders were women. Most had never engaged in politics. But they had been PTA mothers, Girl Scout leaders and teachers. They knew how to get things done.Last weekend, almost two years after she hosted her first house party, Ms. Sousa stood on a flatbed truck dispatching wave after wave of volunteers to knock on voters\u2019 doors. So many hundreds of canvassers showed up that teams were sent back to revisit houses where no one had been home the first time. Their message was straightforward: The four-term incumbent, Representative Jeff Denham, was an ally of President Trump, loyal only to the Republican Party, betraying the interests of the people of the 10th Congressional District.Whether their argument proved persuasive enough may not be clear for days. On Wednesday, Mr. Denham was holding a slim lead over his Democratic challenger, Josh Harder, with many votes uncounted, including provisional ballots cast on Election Day and mail-in votes still in transit.Even absent results, Mr. Harder cast his campaign as part of the Democrats\u2019 larger success in retaking the House. \u201cOur real opponent was not somebody else on the ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was apathy and cynicism.\u201dA 32-year-old political novice who grew up in Turlock, Mr. Harder put together an old-fashioned campaign that drew on lessons from recent Democratic victories: Underdogs can topple incumbents only by organizing, not for months but for years, not after a candidate is chosen but before, not just by demonizing President Trump but by tying Republicans to issues that resonate with voters \u2014 reduced access to health care, attacks on immigrants.On paper, Stanislaus County, the bulk of the 10th district, has had a Democratic majority since April 2008. But as in much of California, party registration is not necessarily predictive of voting patterns. In a state that grew up fiercely committed to repudiating political machines, ticket splitting is a given. Stanislaus Republicans have long held a lock on local offices, even as the county has voted, until 2016, for every winning presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1972.\u201cCalifornia with Southern hospitality and a Southern mind-set\u201d is how Ms. Sousa describes the community where she grew up, a legacy of the long-ago migration of Southern Democrats to the Central Valley. Democrats here historically refrained from advertising their beliefs; there were few lawn signs for Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, though each carried the district.That changed after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, in ways that both enlarged and further polarized the electorate. A dozen groups like Be the Change sprung up \u2014 Our Revolution, Indivisible Manteca, Patterson Progressive Alliance. The groups came together as the CA 10 Progressive Alliance, united in their determination to flip the district. They reached out to engage the young and disenfranchised. And they registered voters; the total in the district increased 18 percent since the last midterm, almost double the statewide average.As in the rest of California, the biggest increase came in independent voters, whose numbers since the last midterm grew more than 50 percent; they now make up almost a quarter of the district\u2019s voters. That further complicates the political calculus, underscoring the degree to which personal beliefs and connections outweigh party loyalty.It will take weeks of analyzing votes that have not even been tallied to determine exactly who voted and how much of the race turned on support or opposition to President Trump versus the contest between Mr. Denham and Mr. Harder. That the Republican may have eked out another win is a testament to the strength of incumbency and the convictions of his conservative base, who vote far more reliably than the new and the disillusioned voters whom the Harder coalition worked to enfranchise.On the issues, Mr. Denham\u2019s alliance with the president increased his vulnerability. Growers have been among Mr. Denham\u2019s core supporters, but Trump policies on immigration and trade have hurt the walnut and almond growers and dairies that are bulwarks of the local economy. The congressman highlighted Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to help get more water for farms, although the promises have yet to translate to action. And on health care, a key concern for many in a district that relies heavily on Obamacare, Mr. Denham reneged on a promise to vote against cuts in the Affordable Care Act, joining Republicans\u2019 unsuccessful effort to repeal and replace.Mr. Denham\u2019s campaign script sought to distract attention from the issues and sow doubts about the values of the man he only referred to as \u201cBay Area Harder,\u201d often adding \u201cliberal\u201d as the ultimate pejorative. Like many young people, Mr. Harder had left the valley \u2014 in his case to attend Stanford and Harvard and work at a venture capital firm. He was not politically involved and did not even vote until he moved back to Turlock to run for Congress, galvanized by the election of Mr. Trump. The result was an unheard-of army of volunteers with clipboards and smartphones, traditional one-on-one organizing married with apps that tracked progress in real time. Some volunteers stayed with locals and built relationships that, like the Harder campaign, may lay the groundwork for future change.\u201cThis is not just one election,\u201d said Ms. Sousa, a teacher who was recently elected to her school board. The grass-roots groups will continue to meet regularly, regardless of the outcome of the congressional race. \u201cThis is going to change the whole make up of our district. It\u2019s been life changing, honestly.\u201dWhatever the outcome in this congressional contest, the Democratic campaign has laid the foundation for much-needed change in a district where fewer than 18 percent of the people have college degrees and 40 percent rely on MediCal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid. The Harder campaign marked a milestone here in the Central Valley, potentially an inflection point to empower a community badly in need of help. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gun Control Groups Eclipse N.R.A. in Election Spending", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmid a numbing succession of mass shootings, gun control groups outspent the National Rifle Association in the midterm election cycle, federal filings and additional reporting indicate, upending the usual order in the partisan battle over gun use.Two groups that are focused on gun control, Giffords and Everytown for Gun Safety, spent at least $37 million at the state and federal level in the midterms, compared with at least $20 million by the N.R.A. The figures are incomplete, because some of the spending done by such groups is not required to be disclosed, but all sides agreed that the N.R.A. was outspent, stemming a trend of financial dominance for the N.R.A. going back years.Both sides claimed victory after the election.\u201cDespite record spending by anti-gun billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, the gun control lobby once again failed to win elections,\u201d said Jennifer Baker, an N.R.A. spokeswoman.John Feinblatt, Everytown\u2019s president, countered with a different interpretation: \u201cThere\u2019s no question in our mind 2018 will be remembered as the year of gun safety and will be a reset moment.\u201dBoth the N.R.A. and Everytown said about 80 percent of the candidates they endorsed won. Elections, of course, are won at the margins \u2014 outside of the 80 percent. And it was swing districts that helped tilt the House back to the Democrats, often aided by gun-control groups.Giffords poured nearly $5 million combined into those contests, helping to make guns a front burner issue in the races. All four incumbents lost.\u201cWe\u2019re on the rise, and they\u2019re on the decline,\u201d said Peter Ambler, the executive director of the Giffords PAC.The N.R.A., however, was buoyed by Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, a staunch gun rights advocate who held an open Senate seat for the Republican Party. Their favored candidate also prevailed in Missouri, where Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, defeated the longtime Democratic incumbent, Senator Claire McCaskill. Oliver North, the N.R.A.\u2019s president, campaigned with Mr. Hawley in the race\u2019s closing days.\u201cN.R.A. efforts in pivotal U.S. Senate races were key to growing the pro-Second Amendment majority in the Senate, which will ensure the confirmation of federal judicial appointees who respect the Second Amendment,\u201d Ms. Baker, the N.R.A. spokeswoman, said.\u201cThose grades used to be seen as a kingmaker at election time,\u201d said Mr. Feinblatt, the Everytown president, who said they were now \u201ca scarlet letter\u201d for many swing voters.N.R.A. officials have scoffed at that, and said they merely reformatted the group\u2019s website.\u201cAfter the election they are no longer relevant,\u201d Ms. Baker said.In any case, both sides will have their champions in the new Congress.\u201cIt is unfortunately not surprising that on the same day I officially became a Congresswoman-Elect, other families in this country are receiving the same exact call that I did six years ago,\u201d she tweeted after Thousand Oaks. \u201cI pledge to do everything I can to make our communities safer.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Defeats Beto O\u2019Rourke for Senate in Texas", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEL PASO, Tex. \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, won re-election on Tuesday in one of the tightest midterm races in the country, defeating the best-financed and most popular Democrat to run in Texas in years, Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke.Mr. Cruz\u2019s narrow victory did more than dash Democratic hopes that the party could capture a Senate seat in Texas for the first time since 1988. It promised to restore Mr. Cruz\u2019s standing as a far-right force in American politics, after many leaders in his own party questioned whether he was likable enough to run successfully against a candidate like Mr. O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso congressman known for his charisma.\u201cThis was an election about hope and about the future, and the people of Texas rendered a verdict that we want a future with more jobs and more security and more freedom,\u201d Mr. Cruz told hundreds of supporters at a Houston hotel ballroom.Mr. O\u2019Rourke appeared before his supporters shortly after 10 p.m. Blocks from the United States border with Mexico, at a minor-league baseball stadium in his hometown, El Paso, Mr. O\u2019Rourke stepped onto a concert stage and said he had spoken to Mr. Cruz and congratulated him on his victory.\u201cI\u2019m as inspired, I\u2019m as hopeful as I\u2019ve ever been in my life, and tonight\u2019s loss does nothing to diminish the way I feel about Texas or this country,\u201d he said, later stepping off the stage as John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d played on the loudspeakers.Republican strategists and insiders said Mr. Cruz\u2019s narrow victory did not mean that Democrats stood to make substantial gains in Texas. Rather, they believed it had more to do with Mr. Cruz himself, one of the most divisive political figures in the state, and the anti-Trump energy of Democrats.Pivotal factors in the tightness of the election results were the Republican and independent voters who voted for Mr. O\u2019Rourke but also cast ballots for top Republicans in other races. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican whose views are in line with Mr. Cruz\u2019s but whose style is far less abrasive, easily won re-election, and a sizable number of Republicans appeared to have split their votes for Mr. Abbott and for Mr. O\u2019Rourke.\u201cIt was political nitroglycerin from the minute this campaign started,\u201d said Ted Delisi, a Republican political consultant in Austin who was Senator John Cornyn\u2019s chief campaign strategist in 2002. \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke couldn\u2019t have run this race against John Cornyn. He couldn\u2019t have run this race against Greg Abbott. This race had to be run against Ted Cruz, and it had to be run this year. This was the once-every-20-years opportunity.\u201dFor months on the campaign trail, Mr. Cruz was more often on the ropes than not, a surprising position for a top Republican incumbent in a state where Democrats hold no statewide offices.Mr. Cruz\u2019s fund-raising fell far short of his opponent\u2019s \u2014 he raised somewhat more than $40 million, compared with more than $70 million raised by Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u2014 and he sometimes found himself eclipsed on other fronts as well.Mr. O\u2019Rourke attracted bigger crowds at some rallies than Mr. Cruz did, including more than 50,000 people who attended a free concert for Mr. O\u2019Rourke in Austin starring the country music legend Willie Nelson. Even Mr. Cruz\u2019s rival event \u2014 the rally President Trump attended in Houston that drew up to 19,000 \u2014 reinforced the belief among his critics that Republicans were worried.Party officials acknowledged that the Cruz campaign had underestimated the threat posed by Mr. O\u2019Rourke early in the race and that it was slow to gather steam.Against that backdrop, Mr. Cruz turned up his rhetoric, casting Mr. O\u2019Rourke as a pro-tax liberal who was anti-police, who favored illegal immigrants over American citizens and who was \u201crunning to the left of Bernie Sanders.\u201dThroughout the campaign, Mr. Cruz repeatedly had to explain his relationship with Mr. Trump. After Mr. Cruz\u2019s bid for the Republican presidential nomination failed in 2016, the senator declined at first to support Mr. Trump, but later eagerly embraced him, even though Mr. Trump had mocked and demeaned Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife and father.His back-and-forth with the president made Mr. Cruz unappealing to many Texans, and allowed Mr. O\u2019Rourke to attract some votes from Republicans \u2014 but ultimately, not enough to change the course of the election. And it was clear that many voters believed the narrative that Mr. Cruz had hammered away at \u2014 that Mr. O\u2019Rourke was too liberal for Texas on many issues, including the border, health care, taxes and gun rights.Brenda Brauch, 66, a retired grandmother who voted Tuesday in an affluent section of northwest Austin and considered herself an independent, said she voted for Mr. Cruz, but described it as a tossup between him and Mr. O\u2019Rourke. What made the difference to her were the issues of immigration and border security.\u201cI don\u2019t want open borders,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there should be the right way to come into a country and the wrong way.\u201d She added of Mr. O\u2019Rourke, \u201cI like his enthusiasm, but I thinking he\u2019s missing some points. The border is a real issue for me.\u201dIn his victory speech, Mr. Cruz set aside the aggressive tone he struck during the campaign and thanked his opponent for a hard-fought race.\u201cI also want to take a moment to congratulate Beto O\u2019Rourke,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cHe poured his heart into that campaign. He worked tirelessly.\u201dSome in the crowd booed. \u201cListen, listen,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s important. He worked tirelessly. He\u2019s a dad, and he took time away from his kids. And I want to also say, millions across this state were inspired by his campaign. They didn\u2019t prevail, and I am grateful the people of Texas chose a better path.\u201dOther Republicans were not as gracious, and they relished their high-profile victory. James Dickey, the chairman of the Texas Republican Party, said Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s loss echoed the defeat in 2014 of Wendy Davis, another well-funded Democratic star who lost the governor\u2019s race to Mr. Abbott.\u201cGiven the track record now of Wendy Davis four years ago and Congressman O\u2019Rourke this time, I hope that Democrat donors from around the country realize now that they can\u2019t buy office in Texas,\u201d Mr. Dickey said.Texas Democrats, meanwhile, saw hope in their relatively narrow margin of defeat. They also saw progress in Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s success in bringing first-time voters to the polls, winning support from Texans who usually vote Republican and boosting turnout to a level that likely played a role in Democratic victories in down-ballot races.\u201cThere is certainly light at the end of the tunnel for Texas Democrats,\u201d said Julian Castro, a Democrat who is the former mayor of San Antonio and former secretary of housing and urban development in the Obama administration, and who is considering running for president in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s something to build on.\u201dAt times, Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s widely watched candidacy seemed to pull a page from Mr. Cruz\u2019s own playbook.In 2012, Mr. Cruz became a conservative rock star when he bucked the Texas political establishment and defeated a powerful lieutenant governor in a Republican primary runoff for the Senate seat. Mr. Cruz was a Tea Party-backed insurgent whose grass-roots campaign captured national attention.In 2018, though, it was Mr. O\u2019Rourke who played the part of grass-roots insurgent and Mr. Cruz who represented the establishment. It was a role Mr. Cruz seemed to relish, as he went from rally to rally warning voters that Texas\u2019 longstanding culture and identity were under assault by the left.\u201cDon\u2019t California our Texas \u2014 you\u2019re exactly right,\u201d Mr. Cruz told supporters in the East Texas city of Tyler, echoing a phrase a woman in the audience had used. \u201cWhenever liberty is threatened,\u201d he added, \u201cTexans rise to the occasion.\u201dMitchell Ferman contributed reporting from Houston, and David Montgomery from Austin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Democrats Can Deliver on Health Care", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew Jersey shows the way. You got a problem with that?Opinion ColumnistSo what did the campaigns that led to a blue wave talk about? Above all, health care, which featured in more than half of Democrats\u2019 ads. Which raises the question: Now that Democrats have had their big House victory and a lot of success in state-level races, can they do anything to deliver on their key campaign issue?Yes, they can.On the other hand, with Republicans still controlling the Senate and White House, major new federal legislation on health care isn\u2019t going to happen. Democrats may debate about their future agenda, which seems likely to include offering some form of Medicare buy-in option for Americans under 65. And it\u2019s important that they have this debate: One reason they were able to achieve major health reform in 2009-2010 was that, unlike 2017 Republicans, who had put no thought into the actual implications of repeal, they had hashed out key issues over the previous two years. But for now, at least, Washington will be gridlocked (which is better than where we were!).There can, however, be action at the state level.The A.C.A. didn\u2019t, strictly speaking, create a national program. Instead, it set rules and provided financing for 50 state-level programs. States were encouraged to create their own health insurance marketplaces, although they had the option to use healthcare.gov, the federal site. A 2012 Supreme Court decision also let states opt out of Medicaid expansion, and many did choose to refuse federal dollars and deprive their own residents of health care.What made the difference? Solid-blue California, with a Democratic governor and Legislature, did all it could to make Obamacare work: It expanded Medicaid, operated its own marketplace and made major efforts to get people signed up. North Carolina, under Republican rule, did none of these things.And the importance of state-level action has only increased in the past two years, as the Trump administration and its congressional allies, unable to fully repeal the A.C.A., have nonetheless done all they can to sabotage it. They eliminated the individual mandate, which pushed people to sign up while they were still healthy; they eliminated reinsurance that helped insurance companies manage their own risk; they cut back drastically on outreach.All of these measures acted to drive premiums up and enrollment down. But states can, if they choose, fill the Trump-size hole.Now that Democrats have won control of multiple states, they can and should emulate New Jersey\u2019s example, and move beyond it if they can. Why not, for example, introduce state-level public options \u2014 actuarially sound government plans \u2014 as alternatives to private insurance?The point is that while the new House majority won\u2019t be able to do much beyond defending Obamacare, at least for now, its allies in the states can do much more, and in the process deliver on the agenda the whole party ran on this year. As they say in New Jersey, you got a problem with that?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Is Carlos Ghosn and Why Is He in Trouble? ", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA titan of the auto industry, Mr. Ghosn was known for cost-cutting and performance-based compensation. His management of his own pay package may be his downfall. Carlos Ghosn, the man who created what was effectively the world\u2019s largest carmaker, was arrested in Japan on Nov. 19. The arrest is a remarkable fall from grace for a man regarded as one of the most powerful executives in the auto industry.Mr. Ghosn (pronounced \u201cGoan\u201d) has been credited with reviving Japan\u2019s Nissan car company and the French automaker Renault, in an alliance that later expanded to include Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. Last year, the three companies sold 10.6 million cars.Nissan said its investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower who said that Mr. Ghosn had been misrepresenting his salary and using company assets for personal purposes. Greg Kelly, Nissan\u2019s first American director and its former head of human resources, was also arrested. The two men are suspected of masterminding a long-running scheme to mislead financial authorities. Neither man has yet been charged. The prosecutor\u2019s office could request additional extensions from the court, to hold Mr. Ghosn for up to a total of 23 days, before it decides whether to seek an indictment.Renault has been more cautious. It is keeping Mr. Ghosn as chairman and chief executive, but the board has tapped Thierry Bollor\u00e9, the chief operating officer, to assume Mr. Ghosn\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities. Philippe Lagayette, the board\u2019s lead independent director, will take over as chairman temporarily. The French government is Renault\u2019s biggest shareholder. The finance and economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said France had no evidence of the accusations that Mr. Ghosn faces in Japan. But labor unions are already concerned about the affect the arrest could have on the more than 47,000 workers at Renault. Yes. But chief executives do \u2014 and Mr. Ghosn had a reputation for rewarding good performance and expecting to be rewarded for his job performance.After he took over as chief operating officer at Nissan in 1999, Mr. Ghosn overhauled how senior employees were paid. Instead of the Japanese tradition of rewarding seniority, Mr. Ghosn enforced a performance-based system and gave bonuses to midlevel managers. According to the Tokyo prosecutor\u2019s office, he is being investigated for hiding tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of compensation from 2011 to 2015. Prosecutors said he underreported his pay package by more than \u00a55 billion ($44.5 million) \u2014 understating his true earnings by half \u2014 in reports to a bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance.Mr. Ghosn has been embroiled in several fights over his executive pay, attracting the ire of investors and politicians. In 2016, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, who was at the time the finance minister, pressured Renault into reducing Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation. His salary came under scrutiny again the next year, and in 2018 he agreed to a 30 percent pay cut in return for another four-year term as chief executive. His own pay far outstripped those of his counterparts in Japan \u2014 he earned four times the pay of Toyota\u2019s chairman in 2017 \u2014 and he was unrepentant. In 1999, Renault acquired a large stake in Nissan, and Mr. Ghosn was sent to Japan to become chief operating officer. Months later, he closed five domestic factories and eliminated about 21,000 jobs, some 14 percent of the work force. Mr. Ghosn was pilloried in the press, but the aggressive cost-cutting worked and stabilized Nissan finances. He is seen as an innovator for how he later engineered an arrangement that allowed the two automakers to operate like a single carmaker, sharing the cost of developing new models and buying components together. He stepped down as Nissan\u2019s chief executive last year, but remained chairman and continued to lead the alliance. He was lionized in business circles, seen as the epitome of a high-flying, multitasking manager as he zipped between Paris and Tokyo. But in Japan, he was a rarity: a foreign leader at a domestic company, who instituted equally rare layoffs and was paid handsomely compared with other Japanese leaders, if not by international standards. The allegations against Mr. Ghosn could trample his legacy. An economist from Japan Macro Advisors in Tokyo described his arrest this way: \u201cLosing Mr. Ghosn from the Japanese corporate managerial scene is a loss for Japan. We need more non-Japanese corporate bosses who are willing to take risks, propose a vision and exert top-down leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Names a Successor to Elon Musk as Board Chief", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix weeks after settling a securities-fraud lawsuit with federal regulators, Tesla and Elon Musk have made good on one of the agreement\u2019s key provisions \u2014 naming a new board chief to impose order on a company whose automaking has often been overshadowed by Mr. Musk\u2019s behavior.The company said a current director, Robyn Denholm, would become its chairwoman immediately. Mr. Musk stepped down as chairman last month but remains Tesla\u2019s chief executive.Ms. Denholm, 55, is the chief financial officer of Telstra, which dominates telecommunications in Australia. She is a longtime technology executive with experience in Silicon Valley, where Tesla is based, and once worked for Toyota in Australia.Under the settlement, Tesla agreed to name a new leader for the board, splitting those responsibilities from Mr. Musk\u2019s post as chief executive, by next Tuesday.The company was also required to add two independent board members and to set up a permanent committee to monitor Mr. Musk\u2019s public declarations, including his Twitter posts. It has several weeks to complete that requirement.Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the appointment of Ms. Denholm \u201ctechnically complies\u201d with the S.E.C. settlement, but he questioned how much Ms. Denholm would be able to push back against a forceful personality like Mr. Musk.\u201cIf the goal is to provide adult supervision, it won\u2019t accomplish that,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cShe\u2019s been on the board through all of the shenanigans. She never resigned in protest. She is a Musk supporter. If it doesn\u2019t work out, she will be the one who leaves. It won\u2019t be Musk who leaves.\u201dMr. Musk has galvanized investors and the public imagination with his sleek electric cars and his big dreams for space travel and other ambitions. But his public declarations increasingly unnerved Tesla shareholders and the directors who represent them. Production problems only added to those concerns.Tesla reported a substantial profit in the third quarter, powered by a significant jump in production and sales of its Model 3 sedan. The earnings beat the expectations of many analysts and eased worries about its finances, for now. In the first half of 2018, the company reported losses and used up more than $1 billion in cash.\u201cThey are doing much better than we thought they would a quarter ago,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cYou have to give them credit for that.\u201dYet Tesla still faces challenges. It must prove it can sustain profits in the fourth quarter and beyond, pay out more than $1 billion to bondholders over the next few months, address quality issues and fix a chaotic delivery system.Tesla has also had an exodus of senior executives. It has had three chief accounting officers this year. And while the fraud suit with the S.E.C. has been settled, Tesla\u2019s past production forecasts for the Model 3 are still being examined by the agency.\u201cIn just about every area, they\u2019ve had extraordinary volatility,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said.David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar who follows Tesla, said the appointment of Ms. Denholm was \u201ca good balance\u201d and was probably best for Tesla\u2019s stock price. Bringing in a hard-nosed outsider \u201cwho wouldn\u2019t put up with Elon\u2019s Twitter nonsense,\u201d he added, \u201cwould clash with Elon and it wouldn\u2019t work at all.\u201dTesla shares rose almost 1 percent on Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s troubling to me that since the settlement Elon has already made a mockery of the S.E.C. twice,\u201d Mr. Whiston said.

{"Headline": "$3,700 Generators and $666 Sinks: FEMA Contractors Charged Steep Markups on Puerto Rico Repairs", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFEMA is spending more than $1 billion on emergency repairs to homes in Puerto Rico damaged by Hurricane Maria, but much of it is going to contractors charging steep markups and overhead.SAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 Juan F. Rodr\u00edguez had substantial damage to his house in northeastern Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria slammed through in September 2017, but he felt better when he was told that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would pay for $5,000 in repairs.The contractor hired by Puerto Rico\u2019s FEMA-financed housing recovery program treated the roof with sealant, replaced four feet of cabinets and installed smoke detectors around his house with Velcro.\u201cI looked around and said, \u2018Wait a minute, that treatment costs $100, and I can buy those cabinets for $500,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cI know. I worked construction. Let\u2019s say they did $2,000 worth of work, because prices are high now and you have to pay for labor. But $5,000?\u201dMr. Rodr\u00edguez wasn\u2019t the only homeowner who complained after the devastating storm \u2014 the worst to hit Puerto Rico in 89 years \u2014 that federal taxpayers were being charged far more for emergency home repairs than residents ever saw in improvements to their homes.Extravagant markups, overhead and multiple levels of middlemen have helped lead to huge costs in the FEMA-financed repair program. Known as Tu Hogar Renace \u2014 Your Home Reborn \u2014 the program is spending $1.2 billion in Puerto Rico to repair up to 120,000 homes.More than 60 percent of what FEMA is spending in the program, the largest emergency housing program in the agency\u2019s history, is not paying for roofs, windows or doors, The New York Times found in a review of its expenditures. Instead, it is going toward overhead, profit and steep markups.Homeowners, who were approved for up to $20,000 each in aid, in nearly every case received less than half of what they were approved for, while layers of contractors and middlemen took the rest, a review of hundreds of invoices and contracts associated with the program shows.The significant costs of transportation, warehousing, insurance and other services that are built into the prices for repairs are not unusual for FEMA disaster relief programs, which reflect the substantial expense of operating in disaster zones. But in Puerto Rico those costs were often so much greater than what would have been possible if homeowners had done the work themselves that they caused a public uproar.A local opposition legislator, Luis Vega Ramos, called the housing program, which is operated by the Puerto Rico Department of Housing with FEMA funding, a mixture of \u201cincompetence and corruption.\u201d He called for federal investigators to examine the contracts awarded to repair companies to make sure the government was getting what it paid for.\u201cThe government\u2019s responsibility is to watch out, to be custodians of the proper and effective use of those funds,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they need to pay hundreds of millions of those dollars to middlemen who turn around and permit overpricing.\u201dThe pricing issues and widespread complaints of long waits and shoddy work highlight the challenges of managing a billion-dollar disaster aid program in a region that is far from the mainland, with institutions that historically have had limited outside oversight or accountability.Puerto Rico housing officials said they were proud of the repair program, and that prices were in many cases less than those paid in other disasters, including repairs after Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the Virgin Islands, which have similar transport challenges.Michael Byrne, FEMA\u2019s federal coordinating officer for Puerto Rico, said the housing department had done an impressive job of getting homes repaired quickly for people who had nowhere else to turn.\u201cBy the end of November, I fully expect them to have repaired about 120,000 homes,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty impressive.\u201dRecords show a large gap between the amounts FEMA contractors hired by the Department of Housing were paid and the actual cost of the work that was ultimately performed. Across the board, from removing debris and cleaning mold to repairing roofs and installing appliances, the amounts for labor and materials that were paid to the people who actually performed the work were only about 40 percent of what FEMA was assessed, meaning homeowners got less help than many of them expected.In case after case, a door worth about $50 would be billed to FEMA at perhaps $700, with a succession of intermediary contractors passing along costs and profits along the way, according to Mar\u00eda Elena Villalobos, who worked as both an inspector and an administrator for several companies in the housing repair program. \u201cA lot of the money went down the drain,\u201d Ms. Villalobos said.The Tu Hogar Renace program was intended for homes that were not damaged enough to be considered destroyed, and could be made habitable with relatively quick remedies like roof repairs, electrical work and the replacement of doors and windows, sinks, toilets and appliances.The housing department hired seven major contractors to do the repair work and two more firms to manage the program. The job was so expansive and the timeline so tight that the companies hired subcontractors, who in turn hired smaller companies to carry out the actual repairs.The private company that received a separate $202 million contract to manage the overall Tu Hogar Renace program, Adjusters International, was itself run by a former senior FEMA official, Daniel A. Craig, who worked at the agency during the Bush administration and was the Trump administration\u2019s nominee to be deputy director of FEMA last year. He was forced to withdraw after the Project on Government Oversight let some members of Congress know that the inspector general\u2019s office had investigated Mr. Craig for going on job interviews with companies that had received no-bid contracts after Hurricane Katrina.The investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing, but Mr. Vega, the Puerto Rican opposition legislator, questioned how Mr. Craig\u2019s company had come to be selected to run the program. Adjusters International was chosen by the housing department after a bidding process.Mr. Craig, in an interview, said his company won the contract as a result of its capabilities, not because of any past connections to FEMA. Contracts establishing prices for goods and services were not within the scope of his company\u2019s management oversight, but were handled directly by the housing department, he said.The New York Times visited more than 150 homes in Punta Santiago to document the damage that remains a year after Hurricane Maria.Lisandra Oquendo, who lives in Punta Santiago on Puerto Rico\u2019s eastern coast, was told that her house had been approved for $18,000 in FEMA repair funds, and she was stunned at how little was accomplished with the money. The contractors patched up her roof, gave her a generator, replaced more than a dozen broken window crank operators, installed several appliances, two windows and a door, and cleaned mold off the walls. But because her roof is made of concrete, she said, they told her they could not repair it.\u201cThey said, \u2018We don\u2019t do paint, we don\u2019t do floors, we don\u2019t work with cement,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo what do you do?\u201dContractors have said that the rates they collect cover a variety of expenses, including shipping fees, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, vehicle and warehouse rental, taxes and profit. But prices charged for equipment and appliances often bore little relation to what was charged on the retail market, even in storm-ravaged Puerto Rico.According to Department of Housing records, FEMA paid for about 12,400 people to receive generators at a cost of $3,700 each. The 5,500-watt portable devices and supplies they came with cost the contractors about $800 each, other documents show. FEMA paid $666 apiece for new bathroom sinks, but the contractors who actually bought and installed them paid $260 apiece. FEMA paid almost $4 a square foot to repair roofs; the work was done by subcontractors for $1.64 a foot.The deal the Department of Housing signed required smoke detectors in every sleeping area, so each of the 122,000 houses in the program was equipped with the devices, for which FEMA was billed $82 apiece. A receipt reviewed by The New York Times showed that one subcontractor ordered them in bulk from an Ace Hardware store in the city of Aguadilla for $6.99 each.\u201cFifty-eight percent is being taken off the top as overhead and profit from the two contractors above us,\u201d said Brandon Padgett, owner of BVP Construction in Houston, which conducted repairs on 52 houses under the program. \u201cIs there 58 percent overhead and profit needed to implement this? No, because we are doing 90 percent of the work.\u201dSeveral smaller companies, including Mr. Padgett\u2019s, which were required to buy their materials from the middlemen, registered complaints with FEMA and with Puerto Rico\u2019s consumer affairs agency, saying that the markups amounted to illegal price gouging.James Little, who owns J & G Construction in Texas, a company hired as a subcontractor to carry out repairs, said that a lot of the markup was legitimate, because the principal contractors who split up the work had to rent vehicles, pay for warehouses and fly hundreds of people to the island. But some of it, he said, was just greed.Both Mr. Little and Mr. Padgett are involved in payment disputes with LionsGate Disaster Relief, the Louisiana subcontractor that hired them. A LionsGate official said prices charged for repairs were reasonable, given the constraints under which companies were operating in the aftermath of the storm, which left large areas of the island facing fuel and supply shortages.\u201cThe prices in Puerto Rico are a little bit higher than what we are used to,\u201d said Kristopher Clark, the chief operations officer for LionsGate. \u201cIt\u2019s not a crazy high price. It\u2019s enough for us to make a little bit of money, and enough for the subs to make a little bit of money.\u201dHe said he paid a markup on materials to the two larger companies that hired him. He also charged markups and service fees to the smaller companies that he brought on. But he denied that the prices were unreasonable. \u201cI know our margin is stiff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult margin to navigate if we are not doing volume.\u201dOne of the prime contractors that hired Mr. Clark, J.W. Turner Construction, is a veteran disaster relief company that has worked on a number of previous disaster relief programs managed by FEMA. The owner, James W. Turner, said that in several of those cases, the prices charged were even higher. In Puerto Rico, he said, it was insurance and local taxes that brought up the rates.\u201cThe profit percentage is going to be lower in each house in Puerto Rico than any house we have ever done,\u201d Mr. Turner said.Francisco D\u00edaz-Masso, the owner of a Puerto Rico construction firm that is another one of the prime contractors, said he had to fly in materials because of the urgency of the project, which drove up costs.\u201cThat rate doesn\u2019t show in that price all that\u2019s behind it, all the logistics, the amount of effort, the amount of people putting all this together, the pre-purchasing of most of this,\u201d Mr. D\u00edaz-Masso said.The Department of Housing said Tu Hogar Renace guidelines for awarding contracts and setting prices were approved by FEMA. The prices charged for equipment and services were opened to bidding and then chosen by a process called \u201cinterquartile range,\u201d where the low and high outlier bids for each item are eliminated and all the companies agree to be paid the middle price. A Department of Housing evaluation committee awarded contracts to all seven companies that submitted bids on time.FEMA officials said the agency uses a nationwide construction cost database to establish prices, adjusted for \u201csupply chain challenges\u201d in a place such as Puerto Rico.\u201cLooking at individual line item prices can be inaccurate and misleading,\u201d Mr. Byrne, FEMA\u2019s federal coordinating officer in Puerto Rico, said in a statement. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take into consideration the context of actual location, difficulty of installation and other factors. We will not pay costs that cannot be justified. As with all FEMA programs, we will do a rigorous analysis of what was actually expended. We will only pay for things that were reasonable.\u201d\u201cThe people, the beneficiaries, don\u2019t have to pay a single cent \u2014 these are federal funds,\u201d Mr. Gil said. \u201cIf the person had to pay that, obviously that would worry me a lot.\u201dThe housing department declined to make Mr. Gil available for an interview.Mr. Craig, the ex-FEMA official managing the program, emphasized that Tu Hogar Renace will be the largest undertaking ever attempted under FEMA\u2019s emergency shelter program. He said the program has delivered what it set out to do during a year when much of the island was without electricity and transportation connections were extraordinarily difficult.\u201cIt has been done very efficiently,\u201d he said. \u201cCostwise, for the island of Puerto Rico to get that many people back in their homes that quickly is an incredible undertaking for the program itself, the government of Puerto Rico and the Department of Housing of Puerto Rico.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s \u2018Hollowed Out\u2019 Politics, Explained", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 83______What does it all add up to?So what do you make of the week\u2019s head-spinning political developments? They say history happens slowly and then all at once. I think the convulsions we are seeing in Australian politics right now \u2014 in fact , since John Howard was defeated in 2007 \u2014 are a culmination of decades-long trends that center on the slow decline of our two big political parties.The more popular explanations \u2014 the acceleration of the news cycle, the social media information bubble, the rise of populism \u2014 may play a part, but the big factor is the transformation of our political parties from mass movements to professionalized and hollowed-out political machines.This is a common phenomenon in Western democracies. With party membership (and union membership) in decline, both major parties lack a real social base, a group of people that defines who the party represents and what it stands for.The two major parties remain powerful because they have engineered the political and electoral system to their benefit, but that arrangement is now straining against the decline in their vote share.Right now, it is the Liberals who are suffering, but Labor has had its turn and it will have another.One headline I saw called Australian politics \u201cfractured.\u201d How would you describe it?I would say hollowed out. There\u2019s a void at the center of our politics because the public and the political class have both retreated. Again, this is happening in all Western democracies: people have stopped joining political parties and civic organizations with a political voice, and the parties have responded by making politics more elite and professional.For most Australians, politics these days is a spectator sport rather than a participatory sport.And the trend is self-reinforcing \u2014 when a major scandal now breaks, the public distrust in politics is so severe that often the first instinct of politicians is not to address it themselves but to call a Royal Commission.The prospects for independent candidates and small parties are better than ever. At the last federal election, nearly 25 percent of voters gave their primary vote to an independent or small party, and that figure is on a slow upward trend as the primary vote of the two major parties declines.I know the conventional wisdom right now is for a thumping Labor victory at the next election, but remember that Labor has won only one federal election outright in the last 20 years.I would not be at all shocked to see Labor form a minority government after the next election because dissatisfaction with the government will benefit independents and minor parties rather than Labor.In fact, minority government might be the new norm in Australian federal politics.That\u2019s not necessarily a disaster \u2014 Julia Gillard would argue with some justification that the minority government she led got an awful lot done, and many Western democracies function perfectly well that way.The question will be how the major parties behave as they decline. Can they adjust to this new norm?I\u2019m sure Julie Bishop has a point, but the fault does not lie only with politicians. The public needs to take its share of the blame, too. If you feel strongly that politicians are not trustworthy, then muck in. Get involved and change things!Unfortunately, however, I don\u2019t think the cynicism about politicians actually motivates the public to get involved. In fact, it may just reinforce the retreat I talked about.Now, for the most part, that has not been terribly damaging \u2014 O.K., politics is hollowed out and Australians are deeply cynical, but by global standards the place is still pretty well run, and economically we are in enviable shape.The risk is that politics becomes so broken that the voters, who are largely disengaged, are more or less forced to intervene to fix things.That\u2019s what happened in the U.K. with Brexit. Britain\u2019s relationship with the E.U. was a white-hot political issue within the Tories, but it\u2019s not as if the British public was clamoring for a vote on that subject. It was only because the Tories could not solve their internal dispute that it was \u201cexternalized.\u201d Essentially, the Tory leadership said to the public: \u201cWe can\u2019t fix this \u2014 you sort it out!\u201dThe expectation, of course, was that the public was just as invested in Britain\u2019s European future as the vast majority of the political class was. That turned out to be dead wrong.What might that look like in Australia? Is there an Australian Brexit on the horizon?Well, in a sense this has already happened. The Liberal Party was hopelessly split on the question of same-sex marriage, so it called on the public to intervene.If you\u2019re looking for a more direct parallel with Brexit, well, what about immigration, which was a key issue in the Brexit campaign? Australia\u2019s commitment to high levels of immigration is pretty well entrenched across the two major parties, but in the past leaders of both parties have flirted with the argument that Australia is \u201cfull.\u201dIf one of the two big parties went to an election on that kind of platform \u2014 not just a cut in migration but a sustained policy of zero net population increase \u2014 Australia would effectively be faced with a referendum on immigration.And a vote like that would be a proxy for some pretty fundamental issues of Australian identity and our place in the region.Now for news and features of the week from around the world ...______It\u2019s another fascinating sign that the \u201cisms\u201d of the 20th century have been stripped of idealism in favor of raw power and networking. This is our new era, resembling many of old.Also big news from China: ______Climate change is complicated, and there\u2019s no shame in asking questions. In fact, we encourage it.Bonus Read: ______Then he proceeds to tear down that argument, which was spurred on, of course, by Australian morning TV and a question about spanking.Extra credit: ______Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s not all we do.

Just out of view behind some hills to the south are the congested streets of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.But in this corner of northwest Hong Kong, tens of thousands of cormorants, herons, egrets, sandpipers and other birds, including endangered species like the black-faced spoonbill, gather each winter to feed on the mud flats. Eucalyptus trees line a path that cuts along the shrimp and fishponds, where small restaurants serve up the day\u2019s harvest.For bird watchers, bike riders and day-trippers from Hong Kong, the wetlands offer welcome respite from the city\u2019s crowds, even if the sound of birdcalls is regularly interrupted by the clank of hammers and the beep-beep of reversing vehicles from an industrial district nearby.But in a place where land prices are among the most expensive in the world, shopping malls and apartment blocks are far more profitable than shellfish, and the area is increasingly attractive to developers.\u201cIn a few years, this will all be housing,\u201d said Yip Ka-kit, 32, as he took a break from riding his bicycle around Nam Sang Wai, a 400-acre wedge of the wetlands bounded by two rivers and filled with fish ponds and reed beds. \u201cPeople in Hong Kong only care about the economy.\u201dSigns warning of the punishment for arson \u2014 up to life in prison \u2014 hang prominently in the wetlands, a reminder of one of their most imminent threats: fire.

Last year during a public hearing, a representative of a company that has applied to develop the area denied it had any role in the blazes.\u201cThere has been a longtime struggle between the landowners and preservationists about the future of that piece of wetland,\u201d said Eddie Chu, a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council who represents the area and has called for protection of Nam Sang Wai.Seen from above, the wetlands look like a net, with thin bands of land looping around blue blocks of water.For centuries, rice paddies filled the area. Then beginning in the 1940s, the people who worked this land, many of them refugees from war and political chaos in China, turned the paddies into fishponds that earned far more than rice.For decades, landowners have sought to develop the area, only to be rebuffed by the courts and government agencies. Last year the local planning board rejected the most recent proposal from a developer because of concerns about the potential loss of wetlands. The developer said it would appeal.The total size of the wetlands area is about 4,350 acres, equivalent to five of Manhattan\u2019s Central Park. Part of the wetlands are off limits to large-scale development, including the Mai Po Nature Reserve, which is protected under the Ramsar Convention, an international treaty for the conservation of wetlands.The reserve includes traditional shrimp farming ponds that have largely disappeared from the rest of China. The ponds, known as gei wai, make use of the tides to suck in young shrimp from Deep Bay. The ponds are then closed off, allowing the shrimp to grow in protected lagoons, until they are harvested by draining the water during an ebb tide.The World Wide Fund for Nature in Hong Kong operates 21 gei wai in the reserve. The shrimp are harvested at night.One night several pounds of shrimp were netted as a group of environment officials from mainland China watched and later dined on the shrimp, which were accompanied by soy sauce, chili peppers and beers.\u201cWhen we harvest there are small fish and shrimp we don\u2019t want, and the birds come and eat,\u201d said Wen Xianji, assistant director of the Mai Po reserve. \u201cThis traditional way of aquaculture benefits both humans and birds.\u201dThe nature reserve has the added protection of its location along Hong Kong\u2019s border with Shenzhen, where permits limit entry from the Hong Kong side, and a 15-foot fence topped with barbed wire blocks people from crossing from the mainland.Still, poachers do sometimes visit by boat to catch mudskippers, amphibious fish used in Chinese medicine.But other areas nearby, like Nam Sang Wai, have less concrete protections.The most recent development proposal in Nam Sang Wai would have included apartments for 6,500 people.The developer, a joint venture between a family that has long owned the land and Henderson Land Development, a large Hong Kong property company, said it would follow a model like the London Wetland Center, which included a residential development that financed a habitat preservation project.The proposed development itself would take up less than 10 percent of Nam Sang Wai\u2019s 400 acres, with the remainder preserved as managed wetlands, its backers say.Environmental groups, however, oppose the plan.\u201cSo far from what we\u2019ve seen the scale of development is not compatible with the area,\u201d said Woo Ming-chuan, conservation officer for the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society. \u201cIt\u2019s quite sensitive and unique, and they want to build residential towers.\u201dMs. Woo said she believed any plan that sacrifices some of the wetlands would only encourage further encroachment.\u201cWe are afraid that once approved it will be a precedent for similar applications in the future,\u201d she said.For now, the area remains a popular weekend destination for walkers, cyclists and nature lovers, with the entrance to the wetlands a short walk from a shopping mall that sits atop a rail station.A short sampan ride takes visitors across a branch of the Shan Pui River. The captain can often be found sleeping on the boat, waiting for passengers to board the small wooden craft, with a maximum capacity of seven. It is the only ferry in Hong Kong that traverses a river and the only one human-powered.Among people who visit the area, the fear is that the forces of development will eventually win out.\u201cOf course I want them to preserve this place,\u201d said Mr. Yip, the cyclist. \u201cIf they fill in everywhere in Hong Kong with houses, there will be nothing left to do here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the waterway that is traversed by a sampan to the wetlands. It is a branch of the Shan Pui River, not an eddy in the river.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The American Casualties of Trump\u2019s Trade War", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "FeatureTariffs on Chinese imports have endangered small business around the United States \u2014 a growing nightmare that critics say the president could have avoided.Supported byIn the packed hearing room, Cobb listened as dozens of witnesses detailed how tariffs on Chinese-made bicycles and tires and fruit juice \u2014 and the reciprocal taxes that would inevitably be imposed on American exports to China in response \u2014 would lead to higher prices and lost jobs in the United States. This was part of a series of public hearings to address a proposed Section 301 tariff list, named after the provision of the Trade Act of 1974 that permits the United States to impose tariffs on other nations in response to unfair trade practices \u2014 in this case, the administration claimed, the Chinese theft of intellectual property. The proposed tariffs would hit businesses from virtually every industry, including many that had little to do with intellectual property.For Cobb and the 247 employees of Real Wood\u2019s affiliated companies, the stakes were high. Their business is exporting hardwood from the forests of southern Missouri to their partners in China, who mill it into veneer, laminate it to a plywood subsurface and finish it into designer flooring. The partners then ship the engineered hardwood back to Real Wood, which sells it to high-end builders from coast to coast \u2014 an ocean-spanning supply chain that nevertheless keeps costs down. The simple possibility of tariffs had killed virtually all the company\u2019s orders for engineered hardwood from China. Real Wood was already paying an anti-dumping duty of as much as 25 percent on much of the flooring it imported from that country, a tariff that the International Trade Commission had levied on a number of Chinese flooring companies whose prices it deemed to be below market value. The Trump administration\u2019s proposal called for an additional 10 percent tariff, with the threat of a further 15 percent in 2019, which Cobb claimed would force Real Wood to make large price increases and would hamstring the whole industry.Cobb, 42, a genial, bearlike, bearded father of seven, stayed up late the night before the hearing, rehearsing his performance in the mirror of his hotel room, cutting it in half to make sure it stayed within the strict time limit. He was dressed sharp for the event, in a three-piece suit, with a pocket square and nonprescription eyeglasses to make him look smart, or so he hoped. He purchased the entire outfit in China while on one of his countless trips there.Now he got up to make his pitch for real. \u201cYou have five minutes,\u201d an official from the Office of the United States Trade Representative told Cobb.\u201cOur group of companies comprise the second-largest employer in the poorest county in Missouri,\u201d Cobb said. He talked about how high-quality engineered flooring couldn\u2019t be manufactured domestically at a competitive price. He talked about the hardship of the potential loss of good jobs in his heartland hometown. As he spoke, Cobb suspected that the hearing, despite the presence of career officials from a broad cross-section of departments and agencies, wasn\u2019t designed to give him a meaningful voice in the process. Questions from the government panel were perfunctory, typically one per witness, and it seemed to him that the decision to levy the tariffs had already been made.As the session adjourned, Cobb started to chat with one of the Chinese reporters covering the proceedings, who was astounded at the damage the tariffs might do to American companies. A senior policy adviser from the Department of Agriculture, who had sat stone-faced listening to the testimony, approached Cobb \u2014 an unprecedented breach of protocol, in Cobb\u2019s experience. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to go through all this,\u201d the official said to him quietly, according to Cobb. \u201cWe have no idea what\u2019s going on here, either.\u201dCompanies were also permitted to submit written arguments for why they should be excluded from the tariffs, and the deadline for those written submissions was in less than three weeks, at midnight on Sept. 6. Liz Levinson, a trade lawyer whom Real Wood and a group of other flooring companies had retained, made sure her tightly reasoned 11-page brief arrived on time. Thousands upon thousands of other companies from across the private sector had made similar submissions, arguing that the tariffs would gut their businesses, and that the reasoning behind the Trump administration\u2019s proposal made no sense. \u201cDuties on flooring would accomplish nothing with respect to encouraging China to reform its intellectual-property regime,\u201d Levinson wrote. \u201cFlooring is not a high-tech industry.\u201dFor a person to read and weigh all the submissions would take weeks, if not months, but the day after the deadline \u2014 as if to prove his indifference to the formality of the investigation \u2014 President Trump announced that the tariffs on $200 billion in goods could \u201ctake place very soon.\u201d He also upped the ante, saying, \u201cBehind that there is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want.\u201dThe tariffs, which took effect on Sept. 24, have been front-page news, but their impacts on the domestic economy \u2014 which traded $710 billion in goods and services with China in 2017 \u2014 have not been reckoned with yet. Tariffs are a powerful weapon in a trade war, but finding the right targets can prove challenging. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to impose tariffs on billions of dollars in imports without shooting yourself in the foot,\u201d says Wendy Cutler, a former acting deputy United States trade representative. Historically, Cutler says, the various branches of government that deal with global trade \u2014 the Departments of Commerce and of the Treasury, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative \u2014 have tried to carefully study the domestic impacts of sanctions like tariffs before they were imposed, aiming to anticipate unintended consequences, calculating ways to minimize harm to the United States while maximizing pain for the intended target.By contrast, in Trump\u2019s new tariff regime, Cobb and other business owners see a hurried and blunt approach that has been carried out, they believe, with little public debate about how it could affect the American economy and equally little sense of the long-term strategy. Was Trump playing a giant game of geopolitical poker with President Xi Jinping, or was he unilaterally declaring war?\u201cAt first, the Chinese saw Trump as a businessman and assumed he wanted a deal,\u201d says Chad P. Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank devoted to economic policy. \u201cNow they don\u2019t know what Trump wants.\u201dReal Wood\u2019s headquarters sits down a gravel road off the main highway, a collection of warehouses filled with various kinds of flooring packed onto shrink-wrapped pallets. When I visited in late October, one side of the main warehouse was piled high with finished flooring from China, veneered in different varieties of American hardwoods like white oak and walnut and hickory. On the other side were finished boards that had been manufactured in Cambodia and Indonesia. Real Wood\u2019s 55,000-square-foot facility was filled with more than $6 million in flooring, the most the company had ever had in inventory; Cobb was racing to import as much as possible from China before the additional tariff of 15 percent was imposed at the end of the year.The weeks after Trump\u2019s announcement on tariffs were unsettling for Cobb, as he tried to cope with the impact of the new tax and guess at the intentions of a president who seemed to be intent on escalation but also quite possibly bluffing. Engineered hardwood was just one type of good among more than 5,745 product lines tariffed; in this one sector, nearly 500 million square feet of engineered hardwood flooring is sold in the United States annually, and roughly a third of that is imported from China. In the wake of the tariffs, Real Wood had postponed five new hires, along with the purchase of a new van and truck. For the past three years, the company grew at a healthy rate of 15 percent. But now, with the new 10 percent tariff, the best-case scenario was for revenue to be flat next year \u2014 and even that seemed improbable.\u201cThe economy is going to slow down,\u201d Cobb told me. \u201cPeople will figure out how to get around the tariffs over time, but it\u2019s definitely going to have an impact on our business and lots of others.\u201dThe range of consequences wasn\u2019t entirely negative, or even understood yet. The day before I arrived, Cobb discovered that it might be possible to rebid on a flooring contract for a Los Angeles apartment project that he had narrowly lost; the winner, it turned out, proposed a tariffed product, while Real World hadn\u2019t. Cobb\u2019s existing Chinese suppliers were able to provide products at low prices largely because of their lower labor costs. The question was how competitive their prices would still be after the tariff. Cobb said that a project he was pricing for 325,000 square feet of flooring in an upscale Manhattan residential development perfectly illustrated the new reality. Finished Indonesian flooring cost the company $4 per square foot, while flooring from the Netherlands was $4.50 and Italian flooring $5.70. The flooring Cobb preferred to sell \u2014 and that many interior designers liked most, he said, because of its distinctive artisanal appearance and low price \u2014 was Chinese-made and cost about $3.50 per square foot before the tariff.Real Wood\u2019s main supplier was a company in Liaoning Province in northern China. Some of its other Chinese suppliers refused to share the cost of the tariff, but the Liaoning company agreed to split the 10 percent tax on one product line, as well as the pending 25 percent step-up. Cobb, though, wasn\u2019t confident the deal was sustainable. There was one factor that might help Real Wood, however. Its main supplier had already shifted some of its production to Cambodia, where labor was even cheaper \u2014 and the anti-dumping duty didn\u2019t apply. This early migration put the manufacturer in a good position to rush even more of its operations to Cambodia, Cobb told me. Doing the work in Cambodia, which had carved out an economic zone where many other Chinese companies had moved, meant that China-specific tariffs wouldn\u2019t be levied, even as all the profits would continue to accrue to Chinese companies.\u201cEveryone speaks Chinese there,\u201d he said. His supplier \u201csent their skilled managers to Cambodia. There are real job losses going on in China. Our main supplier is going to get as much as he can to Cambodia as soon as possible.\u201dThe notion that jobs being lost in China would somehow magically result in jobs being created in America was risible to Cobb. Making flooring was hard and relatively low-paying. Cobb said he couldn\u2019t find enough local workers for the company\u2019s local affiliated mill as it was, and the cost structure for the products it sold made the economics impossible. Turning lumber into veneers required the quarter-inch-thick planks to be separately tempered, a very labor-intensive process. One of the new veneers Cobb had recently perfected, in collaboration with the Liaoning company, required every plank to be hand finished to make it look as if the wood had been reclaimed from old buildings. Cobb thought it was preposterous to believe that this could be done in the United States for a competitive price. Even if it could, he went on, building a factory in the United States would be not just expensive but extremely risky, given that the tariffs on China could be removed at any time by the president or some future administration. Cobb noted that some of his competitors manufactured engineered hardwood flooring in America through the use of prison labor \u2014 an arrangement that illustrated the economic reality of the global market, where inexpensive labor makes high-end flooring affordable.\u201cIt makes me wonder if anyone is pro-trade in this country anymore,\u201d he said.Tariffs totaling $200 billion on nearly every part of the American economy presented an entirely different magnitude of complexity, and the U.S.T.R. was ill prepared to cope with the challenge. One former trade executive, who asked to remain anonymous, told me he saw it as his duty to try to avoid harming American interests as much as possible. He began advocating that the U.S.T.R. develop a method to determine, as accurately as possible, the effects of the proposed tariff package: the number of American factories that would close, the number of jobs eliminated, the value of sales lost and so on.\u201cI thought the U.S.T.R. needed a systematic approach so if a court reviewed the tariffs it would be able to see a consistent analytical framework,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was for domestic legal challenges. We could show that there wasn\u2019t favoritism or politics involved in who the tariffs were applied to. I thought we should have something like that.\u201dA formalized methodology for determining harm might also have helped the U.S.T.R. deal with the tsunami of applications for exclusion from the tariffs that arrived this fall. It became increasingly evident to some within the agency that the decision-making process was now very top down, involving the president and the cabinet with little input from career officials.As it happened, almost none of the applications were accepted. The rejection letters were perfunctory and often cited a failure to show severe economic harm, without saying how that was defined. Another frequently cited justification was that the product in question was strategic to the Made in China 2025 policy, a Chinese government initiative to make China a direct high-tech competitor of the United States by that year. The implication seemed to be that if China said it wanted to compete in an industry, that was enough to drive America\u2019s own trade policy for that industry.The implementation of the tariffs and the tariffs themselves elevated the ideology of Robert Lighthizer, who is 71 and came out of retirement to occupy the normally obscure cabinet-level position of United States trade representative. A former corporate lawyer, Lighthizer developed his views on trade during and after a long career in Washington, both inside and outside the government. A formative experience came during his tenure as deputy United States trade representative during the Reagan administration, which in the 1980s forced Japan to curb auto and steel exports to the United States.That success is often cited by tariff advocates today, but some historians question the analogy. \u201cChina is much bigger than Japan was,\u201d says Douglas Irwin, the Dartmouth economist and author of \u201cClashing Over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not an ally; it\u2019s a rival. We don\u2019t have the leverage with China. Japan never retaliated, but China did so immediately. The Chinese lived through the Opium Wars and the unequal treaties, which involved Western interference. The Chinese clearly resented that and will make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. China won\u2019t be pushed around on trade matters.\u201dAfter leaving the government, Lighthizer spent decades practicing law, doing advocacy work for American steel producers during their downward spiral and China\u2019s inexorable rise. In this role, Lighthizer was often taking the petitioner side of trade disputes in front of federal authorities, portraying China as a menace and a cheater, a view shared by many leading trade unions and Democrats. \u201cAn identity of interest with your clients develops,\u201d says Alan Wolff, a deputy director of the World Trade Organization, who worked alongside Lighthizer for decades. \u201cYou think in similar terms \u2014 client and country don\u2019t diverge.\u201dAlong the way, Lighthizer developed an America-first ideology long before Trump used the slogan. Testifying before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission in 2010, Lighthizer laid out at length his argument that China was America\u2019s biggest source of trade difficulties, costing millions of jobs and destroying domestic manufacturing. Since China ascended to membership in the World Trade Organization in 2001, he said, it had failed to turn into a market economy in the mold of Western nations, as many hoped. To the contrary, Lighthizer claimed that China\u2019s form of state capitalism did not respect intellectual-property rights or the rule of law.Now in the White House, Lighthizer has a firm ally in the presidential adviser Peter Navarro, director of Trump\u2019s Office of Trade and Industrial Policy. An economist who has run unsuccessfully for a variety of political positions in California, Navarro is a rabid antagonist to everything Chinese; in his 2011 book, \u201cDeath by China,\u201d he calls the U.S.-China relationship \u201cparasitic\u201d and refers to China as \u201cthe dragon.\u201d Lighthizer, who rarely appears in the press, declined to comment for this article, as did Navarro, but Navarro is routinely on cable television making vociferous arguments against trade with China. In his book, he described companies doing business with the \u201cmurderous gangster regime\u201d of China as \u201ccorporate turncoat lemmings.\u201d\u201cAt some point,\u201d Lighthizer noted in his 2010 testimony, \u201cone must ask whether potential retaliation from China really would or could even remotely offset the benefits to the United States of more aggressive trade measures.\u201d He also said, \u201cWe need strong leaders who are prepared to make tough decisions, and who will not be satisfied until this crisis has been resolved.\u201dThe real process of deciding what Chinese-made goods would receive tariffs took place behind closed doors. When the tariffs were proposed earlier this year, a long list of target products started circulating within the upper reaches of the government, according to a former senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A list was created by the U.S.T.R. identifying products that America bought from China that could also be bought from other countries, so domestic supply wouldn\u2019t be hurt by tariffs; the list also included products that only China manufactured and that therefore should be exempted to avoid needlessly damaging the American economy. Certain industries were also recommended for exclusion. One of these was housing, and so flooring, nails, trim and all manner of building-related products were dropped from the preliminary list.But trade hawks in the administration challenged the recommendations, the former senior official said, pushing the president to make the tariffs as broad as possible and reminding him that he had made a campaign pledge to take action against China. On one side of the argument stood anti-China figures like Navarro and Lighthizer, who advocated tariffs; on the other, the people Trump and his inner circle called \u201cglobalists,\u201d including Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and the former National Economic Counsel director Gary Cohn, who chiefly advocated protecting intellectual property and gaining access to Chinese markets for American companies and resisted widespread and untargeted tariffs. Ultimately, the former senior official recalled, the president decided that he was going to put tariffs on \u201call of it,\u201d and the decision was final. (The White House declined to comment on the decision-making process.)\u201cThere was no sense of reality,\u201d the official said. It would take years to build factories in America, and who would want to spend that kind of capital with uncertainty about Trump\u2019s re-election, or the real possibility of Trump\u2019s changing his mind and tariffs being lifted? There was no evidence any of that would happen. \u201cAll the president needs is one or two people to tell him he\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cPeople are making these decisions that don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a clue.\u201dScheurich, a Trump supporter, said he couldn\u2019t believe the president intended to hurt his business, but the process for getting an exclusion nonetheless seemed overwhelming. He would have to fill in 84 different forms, one for each product he imported, with various law firms offering to assist at a price of $3,500 to $5,000 per form, which he couldn\u2019t afford. After completing the forms himself, he received only a handful of exemptions.\u201cMaybe the ends justify the means,\u201d Scheurich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If only I could get in front of the president, I could change his mind. Businessman to businessman. I would hope that a light would come on.\u201d He paused. \u201cGood lord,\u201d he sighed.The co-founder of Real Wood Floors, Sam Cobb\u2019s father-in-law, Clyde Elbrecht, chuckled when I told him about the idea of appealing to Trump as a businessman. A lifelong Republican, Elbrecht didn\u2019t think Trump was much of a businessman. Elbrecht, 73, had recently invested $3.5 million in a mill called Missouri Hardwood, he said, saving roughly 100 jobs in tiny Birch Tree, population 656, only to lose 25 percent of its business with customers in China because of the trade war. Likewise, a lumber yard that he had started developing in Arkansas, employing a dozen people, with many more to be hired as it expanded, had come to what he called a screeching stop.\u201cI was shipping a container of timber a day to China,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s around $20,000 per day, or $5.5 million annually, and I\u2019ve stopped shipping entirely.\u201dAs painful as the tariffs in the United States appeared to be as they took hold, they seemed to be having their intended effect in China. Elbrecht had just returned from a trip to visit his main manufacturer in Liaoning, and he said that the owner was very frightened by what was happening to his business. He described the owner as \u201calmost Western\u201d in his thinking, a phrase he meant as praise for the man\u2019s keen business sense and integrity; the affection and empathy for his partner were palpable.\u201cHe\u2019s moving to Cambodia as quickly as he can,\u201d Elbrecht said. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t made the decision to move some of the production there years ago, we\u2019d be in big trouble. Our other Chinese suppliers who haven\u2019t already set up in Cambodia or somewhere else will get hurt the worst. They don\u2019t have an escape plan.\u201dElbrecht said that only a fraction of the value per square foot went to China, while Real Wood had to pay the tariff on the entire price of the flooring. But he wasn\u2019t sure anyone in Washington wanted to hear about his struggles. West Plains\u2019s member of Congress, Representative Jason Smith, toured the mill in March, and at the end of the visit, Elbrecht tried to explain the permanent and real damage tariffs could do to his companies and the fragile economy of the Ozarks. \u201cWith tariffs you won\u2019t have a business model,\u201d Elbrecht said. He explained to the young Republican congressman that China was the biggest market for red oak, and that was the predominant species in the forests in those parts. But the congressman seemed indifferent. (Smith, who serves on the House committee that oversees trade and tariffs, declined to comment for this article; he was re-elected in the midterms with 73 percent of the vote.)\u201cIt was like he didn\u2019t care, he didn\u2019t understand it and he didn\u2019t care to understand it,\u201d Elbrecht said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so disappointed in my representative my whole life. I expect him to care about the people in his district. This impacts their lives. He should try to understand the facts.\u201d\u201cI love China,\u201d Scott Gill, Real Wood\u2019s vice president of sales, told me. \u201cThe people. The food. I was amazed by the beauty of the country.\u201d He was a reluctant Trump voter and himself the father of a recently adopted Chinese boy, now 15. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we both win from trade?\u201d he went on. \u201cWhy does it have to be zero sum?\u201dA member of Real Wood\u2019s finance team walked into the room. \u201cWe got our first invoice for the tariff,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve been Trumped,\u201d someone joked.The summary for the Harmonized Tariff Schedule provided a multidigit code for engineered wood flooring. The purchase price to Real Wood on the invoice was $65,842, and in a column across the page was a line item for the additional tax the company had to pay: $6,584.20. The sum seemed small, perhaps, but Cobb says he expects to pay more than $200,000 in tariffs before the year is out.The president could remove the tariffs at any moment, but identifying the winners this early in the age of the Trump tariffs is difficult, if not impossible. Economists tend to agree that all sides are likely to lose, at least in the short term. Employees of a nail manufacturer in Poplar Bluff, Mo., recently told a local television station that they were counting on presidential intercession to save their jobs. In South Carolina, a television maker named Element Electronics announced that it was closing down and laying off 126 workers as a result of the tariffs, only to gain salvation when Gov. Henry McMaster and other state political figures personally interceded to get the company an exclusion, the kind of random political intervention that trade policy is meant to prevent.In recent days, Cobb and his sales force traveled to Phoenix, Ariz., for a series of meetings with builders, hoping to win contracts to supply hardwood floors to small and midsize single-home companies across the country. The sessions went well, with Real Wood presenting its nontariffed products from Cambodia and Indonesia, not even bothering to show the favored China-made flooring styles. One builder mentioned that for his next project he might swap out hardwood flooring from China for vinyl, to save on costs.\u201cDo you know your vinyl flooring is on the tariff list?\u201d Cobb asked. \u201cIt\u2019s also tariffed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors,\u201d the builder said. \u201cWhat else is on the list?\u201d\u201cNails, molding, cabinetry, all types of flooring,\u201d Cobb said, citing only a few of the thousands of items subject to tariffs \u2014 no exclusions allowed \u2014 that will hit the entire American economy.\u201cIs that really going to happen?\u201d the builder stammered.\u201cIt already has,\u201d Cobb replied.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs Ensnarled in Vast 1MDB Fraud Scandal", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoldman Sachs is facing one of the most significant scandals in its history, a multibillion-dollar international fraud that investigators say was masterminded by a flamboyant financier with a taste for Hollywood and carried out with help from the Wall Street firm\u2019s bankers.Federal prosecutors on Thursday unveiled a guilty plea from one former Goldman Sachs banker and announced bribery and money laundering charges against a second banker, as part of an investigation into the alleged embezzlement of billions of dollars from a state-run investment fund in Malaysia. Prosecutors also brought charges against the Malaysian businessman they believe stole some of the money: Jho Low, who spent millions of dollars on gifts to celebrities like the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and the model Miranda Kerr.The money was used to buy a Picasso painting, diamond necklaces and Birkin bags as well as to pay for the Hollywood blockbuster \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d Najib Razak, the Malaysian prime minister who established and oversaw the so-called sovereign wealth fund, lost his re-election bid over the scandal, in which American prosecutors said $731 million of the missing money was deposited into his own bank accounts.The charges against senior employees of a major American bank, a rare move in the decade since the financial crisis, put enormous pressure on Goldman Sachs and its new chief executive, David M. Solomon. American prosecutors are continuing to investigate other bankers and Goldman itself, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.The bank has spent years trying to rehabilitate a reputation that was severely damaged by allegations of misconduct and putting profits ahead of clients during the financial crisis. Goldman executives today take pains to emphasize the good that their bank does in societies around the world \u2014 efforts that could be eroded by the bank\u2019s role in the sprawling Malaysian scandal.The lengthy court filings by prosecutors in Brooklyn paint an ugly picture for Goldman, which was instrumental in raising money for the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. According to court documents, the former bankers paid bribes and kickbacks to foreign leaders to secure $6 billion in bond underwriting deals for Goldman that generated $600 million in fees.The authorities said that at least one high-ranking executive in the bank\u2019s Asian operations was aware of the scheme, which dodged Goldman\u2019s systems to detect the payment of bribes. That person, unidentified in the court filings, has not been charged. According to three people familiar with the matter, the executive was Andrea Vella, who was the co-head of Goldman\u2019s Asian investment banking business.Federal prosecutors said Tim Leissner, a former Goldman investment banker who spent years courting Mr. Low, pleaded guilty in August to taking part in the bribery and money laundering scheme. He left the firm in 2016 after the scandal first emerged.The court filings were sealed until Thursday when the two other men, Mr. Low and Roger Ng, Mr. Leissner\u2019s former deputy, were charged. Mr. Ng, who left Goldman in 2014, was arrested in Malaysia; Mr. Low remains at large.Although the bank knew Mr. Leissner was at the center of the investigation, the breadth of the charges appeared to have caught Goldman off guard. The bank was not expecting a leader of its Asian investment bank to be implicated as well. Goldman on Thursday suspended Mr. Vella, according to a person with direct knowledge but was not authorized to speak publicly.Goldman has repeatedly played down its role in the 1MDB scandal, saying it was unaware of how money from the fund was being used. The company said in a statement that it was cooperating with the investigation.Goldman\u2019s chairman, Lloyd Blankfein, sought to frame the matter as the misdeeds of rogue employees.\u201cThese are guys who evaded our safeguards, and lie, stuff like that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said on the sidelines of The New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. \u201cSomebody\u2019s going to use phones away from us, and personal this and personal that,\u201d he said, referring to personal devices.Federal prosecutors have depicted Mr. Low as the mastermind of the scheme to loot the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. During one exchange with Mr. Leissner, Mr. Low advised of the need to \u201csuck up to\u201d 1MDB officials, including sending \u201ccakes\u201d \u2014 that is to say, bribes, according to government filings.Court filings unsealed on Thursday showed that federal prosecutors have built out their case since they first filed charges against Mr. Leissner in June. Back then, the charges did not contain any reference to the co-conspirator identified by people familiar with the matter as Mr. Vella. But the court documents associated with Mr. Leissner\u2019s plea on Aug. 28 do.According to that filing, the co-conspirator identified separately as Mr. Vella agreed with Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng, in a 2012 meeting, to keep Goldman\u2019s compliance department in the dark about the scheme to bribe government officials to secure financing for a deal.\u201cThis looks pretty terrible and a far cry from post-financial crisis settlements,\u201d said Alex Turnbull, the son of the former Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and a former Goldman Sachs employee in Singapore who raised concerns about how Goldman valued the bond deals in 2012.Mr. Vella could not be reached for comment. He has retained a lawyer, according to three people familiar with the case, but those people declined to identify the lawyer.Prosecutors contend that the bankers had to conceal Mr. Low\u2019s unofficial involvement in the fund because the Goldman\u2019s legal team had concerns about the source of his wealth. Mr. Leissner and other Goldman bankers helped 1MDB raise money through three bond issues while making hundreds of millions of dollars in commissions. During each deal, Mr. Leissner followed Mr. Low\u2019s directions about whom to bribe to win contracts for bond issues that were internally nicknamed \u201cProject Magnolia,\u201d \u201cProject Maximus\u201d and \u201cProject Catalyze.\u201dThe money raised was supposed to be spent on projects to help the Malaysian people like those described in the deals\u2019 financing documents. Instead, the court filings describe an elaborate plan to funnel millions of dollars of bond proceeds to so-called shell companies controlled by Mr. Low and others. Some of the money went into bank accounts in Hong Kong.Internal emails, included in the court documents, show that Mr. Leissner and his team referred to one of the bank\u2019s earliest proposed deals with the Malaysians as \u201cProject Tiara.\u201d Among the luxury goods Malaysian authorities eventually seized because they had been purchased with money from 1MDB: 14 diamond-studded tiaras.According to those lawsuits, Mr. Najib\u2019s wife, Rosmah Mansor, received $30 million worth of jewelry bought with money originating from 1MDB, including a 22-carat pink diamond necklace worth $27.3 million alone.Mr. Leissner also kept some of the funds for himself, according to the authorities. In pleading guilty, he was ordered to forfeit nearly $44 million that he earned from scheme.Mr. Leissner\u2019s lawyer did not return a request for comment. It was not known who was representing Mr. Ng.A spokesman for Mr. Low said Mr. Low was innocent.\u201cAs noted in the indictment today, Mr. Low held no formal position at 1MDB, nor was he ever employed by Goldman Sachs,\u201d the spokesman, Jim Haggerty, said. He added, \u201cFurthermore, the bond offerings detailed in the indictment were undertaken openly and lawfully between experienced, well-regulated financial institutions and government entities.\u201dKate Kelly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Winter Is Coming", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs your home ready for the first deep freeze?When I moved into a 1920s stand-alone shotgun style house in southern New Jersey earlier this year, I suspected it would cost a lot more to cool and heat than the rowhouse I had previously owned, because the \u201ccharm\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d that come with old houses often mean they leak like a sieve.So when fall arrived, I decided to take the necessary steps to winterize the house. The first: a home-energy audit, in which contractors and utility companies come into your house and tell you everything that\u2019s wrong with it when it comes to energy efficiency.Sure, the home inspection I had before I bought it revealed that the sewer pipe was cracked and the crawl space needed to be waterproofed. But it didn\u2019t tell me that my attic insulation was worthless or that the previous owner\u2019s renovation had covered up a vent in the kitchen with linoleum and a refrigerator, which is why the kitchen was boiling in the summer, even when the oven was off.My bedroom was also oddly hotter than the other living spaces, and once the weather turned cool, the clothes in my closet, which protrudes from the rest of the house, felt cold, even damp.\u201cThe cheapest electricity we can make is the energy you don\u2019t use,\u201d said Ken Sheehan, the director of the clean-energy division at the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. Making homes more efficient means \u201creducing the cost for you and reducing the cost for the entire state \u2014 it\u2019s a benefit for everybody up and down the food chain.\u201dEmily Dean, the director of market development for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, said the state\u2019s program aims \u201cto engage homeowners and provide them with quality information about their home, and pinpoint where and how the home is losing energy and which systems are working efficiently.\u201d Since 2012, some 126,000 New York state residents have had home-energy audits through the program, and 60 percent of them \u201chave gone on to do some kind of energy project,\u201d she said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s coming through the program and getting incentives, or working with a contractor outside the program, or even doing the work themselves.\u201d In New York, the cost of an audit through the state program is based on a homeowner\u2019s income. In New Jersey, where I live, contractors set their own rates. Some offer the same audit to everyone for free. Others offer a basic audit at no charge, but for a fee will conduct a more comprehensive audit that can include diagnostic tests on the furnace and hot-water heater and something called a \u201cblower door test,\u201d which pulls air through the home to see how leaky it is.I had two energy audits done on my home. One contractor did the audit for free; the other offered a free audit and a more extensive test for $250. I went for the more extensive test.Homeowners are told that there is no obligation to make any of the changes recommended in an audit, but those who get work done can qualify for low- or no-cost loans, and for state rebates based on how much energy they will save by making the recommended changes.Mr. Sheehan said that contractors who are certified and accredited by the state of New Jersey offer free or cheap audits because they know they can pitch homeowners to do the work. Those contractors also become part of a marketing cooperative that provides marketing materials and rebates for some marketing costs.The audit process itself was relatively simple. The contractors asked similar questions about the house, whether I had allergies or asthma and where I felt variations in temperature. They also asked for a copy of my utility bills to see how much energy I was using, as the amount helps determine how much of a rebate I could get from New Jersey. Contractors usually want a full year of bills, but since I had been in the house only since July, they looked at what I had available.Then they poked around and performed a few basic tests to see where I was losing heated or cooled air. The tests included using a thermal camera to document changes in temperature; identifying which parts of the house bumped out from the main structure; and going into the crawl space, attic and basement to see what kind of insulation (if any) was there. Each audit took about three hours.The first estimate for the work my house needed came in at a little over $9,000 and the second at $14,000. Both proposals included things like replacing the insulation in the attic and adding insulation to the basement and the attic stairs. The insulation in the attic was old and porous enough that you could see lines of dirt where air was streaming in, as you would on an air filter. My house has balloon-style framing, meaning that the studs that make up the frame are long pieces of lumber extending from the top of the basement up to the roof. The basement pockets had some insulation, but not a lot, and what was there was old and needed replacing.As for the attic stairs, adding insulation underneath would stop cold or hot air from flowing into the main living space \u2014 a problem that apparently helped create an overheated bedroom and kitchen in the summer.The more expensive proposal also included replacing my hot-water heater, furnace and air-conditioning condenser with more energy-efficient units, although the ones I had were less than three years old. The contractor explained that my hot-water heater used atmospheric venting, which can be a problem in spaces where appliances are close together \u2014 in a utility closet, for instance, that holds a furnace, hot-water heater and washer and dryer. But that was not the case in my house, where the hot-water heater was in a big, open basement. He also urged me to apply for state financing before I had seen his final proposal, a suggestion that, combined with pushing me to replace everything, felt a bit too aggressive.When I did some research on the two companies, I learned that the first contractor had done an audit and renovations on the home of some close friends who had been extremely happy with the work, so I went with him.The process wasn\u2019t all that different from finding a plumber to replace my sewer pipe, except that this time I qualified for a $4,000 rebate and a zero percent-interest loan \u2014 all funded by utility bill payers.Yes, us. Rebate and loan programs in most states are funded by a monthly surcharge on customers\u2019 utility bills. In New Jersey, no-interest financing is available for home-energy work that costs less than $10,000, and 4.99 percent financing is available for upgrades over $10,000. \u201cYou\u2019ve been paying into the charge as long as you\u2019ve been a New Jersey ratepayer,\u201d Mr. Sheehan said when I told him that I planned to take advantage of both the rebate and the no-interest financing. \u201cYou\u2019re getting back some of the money you\u2019ve put into the process.\u201dWhile this is overseen at a state level, local municipalities can also play a part in encouraging homeowners to get audits, which is what Summit, N.J., did when it partnered with Ciel Power, a contractor, to offer home-energy audits to residents for $49. When the city first formed the partnership and sent fliers to residents, the goal was to get 150 households to sign up for audits. Two hundred did, and 40 homeowners decided to install upgrades, said Nora G. Radest, the mayor of Summit.Ms. Radest was one of them. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the most energy-efficient house,\u201d she said of her 1930 Tudor-style home. \u201cPlus, being mayor, I wanted to set an example in the community.\u201d After the audit, Ms. Radest and her husband were presented with three levels of changes they could make. They chose the middle one, which cost about $9,000 and included insulating the attic and garage as well as a crawl space under a newer addition to the house. They decided not to add insulation behind the exterior walls because it would have meant drilling holes in the hand-applied stucco to blow it in, and the contractor couldn\u2019t guarantee that the stucco, which was original to the house, wouldn\u2019t be damaged.The upstairs rooms, Ms. Radest said, are now far less drafty in the winter, and her daughter\u2019s, which has two exterior walls, was cooler this summer than it had been before. She also said they used their air-conditioning less.Ciel has partnered with a number of other New Jersey municipalities as well, including Highland Park, Woodbridge, Watchung, Glen Rock, Millburn, Princeton, Morristown and Madison, where Peter Teshima lives. Mr. Teshima got a flyer about the program soon after moving into a 1950s ranch house. His wife\u2019s grandfather built the home, so he and his wife knew it well, and were aware that it needed some work. The Teshimas got one audit and were offered three options for upgrading. Like Ms. Radest, they took the middle road, which included installing insulation in the attic and basement, and closing off a kitchen fan that hadn\u2019t been used in years but was letting air in and out of the house.Mr. Teshima, who works in the energy industry, keeps track of his bills and said the home has used far less energy since the upgrades. In November 2016, they used 148 therms of energy; in November 2017, that number dropped to 91. In December 2016, they used 242 therms; last December, they used only 194.\u201cThe study I\u2019m sitting in right now used to be very chilly,\u201d he said on a recent crisp autumn day. \u201cBut now it\u2019s nice and toasty, and I don\u2019t even have a space heater in here.\u201d While home-energy audits are focused on saving energy, they also touch on safety issues, something that was on Stephan Edel\u2019s mind when he had an audit done in 2013 on a two-bedroom, one-bathroom home in Queens that he and his wife were renting.They were about to have a child, and they knew that the home, built in 1926, wasn\u2019t ideal: Radiators in the master bedroom and the one small bathroom were the same size, so \u201cour bedroom was always cold and the bathroom was just boiling,\u201d said Mr. Edel, the director of the New York Working Families Project. The attic also wasn\u2019t well insulated, he said, and \u201cwhen the heat was on you could just feel wind going up the stairs.\u201dThe estimate to fix everything, which included sealing up gaps and cracks around windows and doors, insulating walls and pipes, replacing the old boiler and refrigerator, and venting and replacing the stove, was $24,000.The owner of the home balked at making such extensive repairs, but Mr. Edel decided to take some of the recommendations himself. He added weatherstripping on windows and doors, caulked cracks, put plastic sheets over some windows, switched to LED and CFL bulbs and closed up the gap in a basement door. After the boiler and hot-water heater finally died, the owner replaced them with Energy Star units, and Mr. Edel replaced some of the pipe insulation himself.When he and his family moved to Holyoke, Mass., in September (he telecommutes now), they bought a four-square bungalow built in 1924 and had a home-energy audit done through the local utility company.\u201cI knew the boiler needed at least servicing, so I went ahead and scheduled it right away,\u201d Mr. Edel said. The audit showed that not only did the boiler need to be replaced, but so did the heating and air-conditioning system. He hopes to make those changes in the future; for now, he is working with a contractor on air-sealing and weatherizing the home \u2014 many of the same things he did in Queens, which are relatively easy and inexpensive.\u201cI\u2019m not a great handyperson, so none of it was perfect or permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re the kind of simple things that anybody who can follow basic instructions can do to reduce their heating bill.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Economy Shrinks Unexpectedly, Adding to Europe\u2019s Risk", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Germany\u2019s once unstoppable economy has gone into reverse, adding another threat to European stability just as Italy escalated its dispute with fiscal overseers in Brussels.If the quarterly decline in Germany signaled a trend \u2014 which some economists doubted \u2014 the implications for the rest of Europe would be ominous at a time when Italy is rattling financial markets. Italy\u2019s populist government, which faced a deadline Tuesday to resubmit a national budget earlier rejected by the European Commission, made only minor concessions. The commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, is expected to respond next week.As Europe faces a confluence of economic and political turbulence, Germany and its powerful auto and machinery exporters have provided crucial stability.Without Germany as a locomotive, Europe would have much more trouble withstanding shocks that, in addition to Italy, include Britain\u2019s messy separation from the European Union and trade tensions with the United States.Economists expressed hope that Germany could bounce back quickly from the surprise decline in output, which was caused in part by temporary production backlogs at automakers. All of the major carmakers have struggled to adjust to new, more rigorous European emissions testing procedures.Germany\u2019s Federal Statistical Office blamed the setback on reduced exports. China is an important customer for Mercedes-Benzes, Volkswagens and BMWs as well as German-made factory machinery. But China has been buying fewer German goods because its economy has suffered from tariffs imposed by the United States.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the start of a trend,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Bank in Germany. \u201cBut assuming it is, it clearly means bad news for the rest of the eurozone.\u201dItaly\u2019s continued confrontation with the European Commission could have economic consequences for the eurozone if not the entire world. The country is seen as a threat to financial stability because of its enormous government debt, which equals more than 130 percent of gross domestic product.The Italian government, a coalition between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right wing Lega, is trying to finance welfare programs as a solution to economic stagnation. But its spending would produce a deficit considered dangerously high for a country with so much debt.The spending is limited to what \u201cis strictly necessary to counteract the slowing of the economic cycle,\u201d Mr. Tria wrote. And he said some of the outlays were justified by emergencies, including flood damage and investment in roads and other infrastructure after a deadly bridge collapse in Genoa.The European Commission will issue an opinion by next Wednesday, a spokesman said. What happens after that is uncertain.Officials in Brussels will try to walk a fine line, enforcing European Union rules while avoiding a war of words with Rome that would play into the hands of populists. The commission could penalize Italy by imposing fines or withholding European Union funds for economic development. But the commission rarely moves quickly.The big risk is that investors will lose confidence in Italy and no longer buy government bonds at interest rates the government can afford, a development that would ripple through the economy. The risk premium on Italian bonds spiked early Wednesday, though it later retreated.The International Monetary Fund said the stimulus would be futile unless paired with measures to improve the functioning of the economy such as dismantling rules that make it costly for businesses to fire workers.\u201cItaly could be forced into a large fiscal consolidation when the economy is weakening,\u201d I.M.F. economists wrote. \u201cThis could transform a slowdown into a recession.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels, and Jason Horowitz and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One African Nation Put the Brakes on Chinese Debt. But Not for Long.", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 The new international airport in Sierra Leone was supposed to be a shiny welcome center for travelers \u2014 a symbol showing that after a devastating civil war and an Ebola epidemic, the nation was finally open for business.But last month, the government decided that the multimillion-dollar price tag was too high, so it canceled the financing that made construction possible: a more than $300 million loan from China that Sierra Leone might have struggled to repay.President Julius Maada Bio was soon hailed by analysts for putting the brakes on a project that could have deeply indebted his nation, already one of the poorest in the world.It seemed that Sierra Leone was heeding the hard-earned lessons of other developed nations that have found themselves owing enormous amounts to China.\u201cWe are a developing nation,\u201d Mr. Bio told the interviewer, \u201cand we look forward to nations that want to help us develop.\u201dAcross sub-Saharan Africa, governments like Sierra Leone\u2019s are opting to overlook glaring examples of developing countries teetering toward economic distress after borrowing heavily from China.Forty percent of countries in the region are close to falling into debt crisis, the International Monetary Fund has cautioned. And many of those are still seeking loans from Beijing for help to finance airports, highways, railways, dams and power projects.But Chinese-backed ventures have also hit snags in Africa.The added fact that China has flooded African markets with low-cost manufactured goods means that many African factories have been driven out of business, making it harder for African countries to raise the hard currency \u2014 mostly dollars \u2014 that they need to repay loans from Beijing.China has extended lines of credit to nations rich in natural resources like oil, bauxite, iron and other metals. So even if a resource-rich developing country has trouble repaying its loans for a while, the thinking goes, it can pay with natural resources sooner or later. China also gains politically by extracting promises of support for the Beijing government over Taiwan as a condition of eligibility for a loan.At the China-Africa Forum for Cooperation summit in Beijing this month, China announced that it had set up a $60 billion fund for African infrastructure projects to strengthen ties with the continent.Numerous analysts and experts, including the former secretary of state Rex W. Tillerson and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the monetary fund, have warned nations to be cautious about taking on too much Chinese debt.Angola, the Republic of Congo and Zambia were some of the nations that Moody\u2019s listed this month among the most indebted to Chinese creditors. A report from the financial research company said interest payments in Ghana, Angola, Zambia and Nigeria already absorbed more than 20 percent of government revenue.This month, while speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Vice President Mike Pence accused China of using \u201cdebt diplomacy\u201d to expand its global influence. But Chinese officials have repeatedly disputed any notion that its loans are creating so-called debt traps for African nations.\u201cOn the contrary, cooperating with China helps these countries raise independent development capabilities and levels, and improves the lives of the local people,\u201d said Hua Chunying, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, in a statement responding to Mr. Pence.China has promised to forgive some of its loans to some of Africa\u2019s poorest nations. But it was unclear which countries would benefit, and the promise applied to only interest-free loans.China is strengthening ties in new areas on the continent, specifically in West Africa where it is adding more African countries to the list of nations in its Belt and Road initiative, which envisions major infrastructure projects backed by the Chinese government around the world.One of the new Belt and Road countries is Senegal, which was part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s four-country visit to the continent this summer. During a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Senegal\u2019s growing capital city, Mr. Xi handed keys to a new wrestling stadium built by the Chinese to President Macky Sall.Across the country, billboards line the roads touting Mr. Sall\u2019s \u201cEmerging Senegal\u201d plan to transform the economy with a new city, a new commuter rail link and other projects. Chinese loans are paying for a highway to the city of Touba and part of an industrial park.The agreements benefit both governments. Mr. Sall is facing re-election next year and eager for his vision to be completed. And Senegal, along Africa\u2019s westernmost coast, is of particular geographical importance to China as a base for manufacturing and exports.The same is true on the opposite side of the continent, in Mozambique, where Chinese loans are paying for bridges and numerous other projects. It\u2019s part of a plan to double down on places that have strategic importance, said Anna Rosenberg, sub-Saharan Africa director at Frontier Strategy Group, an emerging markets advisory firm.\u201cFor Africa this is not a bad thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need the infrastructure. They can\u2019t wait for aid to come from the West. They need it fast, and the Chinese government has realized that.\u201dFor nations like Sierra Leone that are eager to put years of political instability behind them, the lure of Chinese deals can be irresistible.

The monetary fund had also warned against the deal. Canceling the loan was one of the first major moves Mr. Bio made after taking office this year.But on Chinese television, Mr. Bio backpedaled, explaining that he was negative about only the terms of the airport deal, and that the cancellation wasn\u2019t intended as a sweeping indictment of dealing with China. He went on to praise a Chinese health center and other aid the nation has given to Sierra Leone.Sierra Leone is home to one of the largest iron ore deposits in the world and its economy is dominated by a China-backed mining project that exports ore for use in Chinese steel mills.

{"Headline": "What an Italian Donkey\u2019s Fate Tells Us About the Future of Europe", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA fable about Italy, bond yields and politics in the European Union.Dr. Rubinelli is a research fellow in the history of political thought at Robinson College, University of Cambridge. When asked about the little donkey\u2019s peculiar name, he answered that it would help us all to laugh a little about Italy\u2019s troubled economy and years of instability. \u201cLo spread\u201d had become shorthand for everything that was wrong. The yield on a bond reflects how much interest a borrower \u2014 in this case, the government \u2014 has to pay to borrow money. Germany, with its booming economy, is considered an excellent credit risk. So its bond yields are very low. Italy, by comparison, is seen as an overspender, so its yields are much higher.The difference is, in effect, encapsulated by that one number, \u201clo spread,\u201d an object of respect and fear that tells us a lot about the messy state of European politics.\u201cLo spread\u201d soon took center stage not only in politics but also in everyday life. I saw it in graffiti condemning the European Central Bank. On a trip to the Dolomites, I heard it in casual conversations at the bar. \u201cLo spread\u201d even made it to pop music, including a song called \u201cIl ballo dello spread,\u201d or \u201cThe Dance of the Spread.\u201d The chorus says it all: \u201cWhile lo spread goes up, up, up, Italian citizens go down, down, down.\u201d You\u2019re supposed to dance to it by mimicking the oscillations of the spread.These various attempts to desacralize \u201clo spread,\u201d to make fun of it and demystify it, served partly to make sense of its sudden and inescapable presence on the scene of Italian politics and partly to blame Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s government for getting us there in the first place.The spread reigned sovereign. It was constantly scrutinized and regularly on the front page of Italian newspapers. The government approved or rejected policies depending on its movements. Lo spread seemed to have the final word on Italy\u2019s future.In 2013, when Italy\u2019s economic situation began to stabilize, the phantom of the spread retreated.It reappeared in March, when a new coalition government came to power \u2014 one elected on an anti-austerity, euroskeptic agenda. The gap between Italian and German bond yields again started to grow, and with it, the spread made its reappearance in the headlines.In other words, Italy\u2019s leaders have discovered what so many Italians realized long ago: Mockery is a powerful tool, particularly when applied to the European Union\u2019s rigid rules. Apocalyptic predictions about what would happen if \u201clo spread\u201d became too large have not come to pass, at least for now. The government no longer accepts an abstract bond finance term as the unappealable judge of Italian politics, and there is a widespread sense that it is time to challenge not just the commission\u2019s fiscal rules but also the E.U. in general.Instead of a symbol of Italy\u2019s weakness relative to Germany and the rest of Europe, \u201clo spread\u201d has become a symbol of all that is frustrating about the E.U.My grandpa figured this out a while ago. When Angela Spread was fully grown, he sold her.Lucia Rubinelli is a research fellow in the history of political thought at Robinson College, University of Cambridge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "God\u2019s Red Army", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republican Party hopes to beat back the Democrats on Tuesday with a big push from the Christian right.Ms. Stewart writes regularly about the political activities of evangelicals and other religious groups.If Democrats fail to realize their dream of a blue wave in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, perhaps the biggest factor will be the organizing power of the Christian nationalist movement. \u201cIf we do our jobs,\u201d Ralph Reed of the Faith & Freedom Coalition boasted at the Values Voters Summit in September, \u201cthey are going to be more shocked than they were the last time.\u201dAmong leaders of the Christian right, conversations about 2018 tend to begin with happy memories of 2016.Political commentators may argue that some combination of racism and economic anxieties of the white working class put Mr. Trump over the top, but leaders at the Values Voters Summit took a different view.\u201cIf you back the evangelicals out of the white vote, Donald Trump loses whites,\u201d Mr. Reed told the crowd. \u201cIf the rapture had occurred, Donald Trump would have lost by the worst landslide since George McGovern.\u201dMr. Reed and other conservative evangelical leaders are convinced they can do it again in 2018. \u201cFrom an overall perspective of where the voters are, I am very bullish,\u201d Chris Wilson, the C.E.O. of the political consulting firm WPA Intelligence, told Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, in an October radio segment.Evangelical policy groups have been investing serious money in turning out votes to shore up a red firewall. Mr. Reed\u2019s coalition, for instance, is putting $18 million into this cycle, up from $10 million in 2016 and $5 million in the 2014 midterms. \u201cThe only thing that matters is who comes out on Election Day,\u201d Mr. Reed said.The Christian nationalist turnout machine relies heavily on an extensive network of conservative pastors. The Family Research Council, for example, runs \u201cpastor briefings\u201d through its organization Watchmen on the Wall, which claimed 28,000 members in 2014. At a Watchmen pastors briefing in Unionville, N.C., on Oct. 4, Mr. Perkins said: \u201cThe members of your congregation need to vote. As pastors, you need to \u2014 I\u2019m not going to say \u2018challenge them\u2019 \u2014 you need to tell them to vote.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t much doubt about how he and other speakers expected their people to vote. At the same event, J.C. Church, Watchmen on the Wall\u2019s national director of ministry engagement and a founder of the Ohio-focused get-out-the-vote initiative Awake88, said, \u201cthe No. 1 thing\u201d anybody can give you is \u201cthe supreme Christ.\u201d But \u201cthe second greatest thing we can give this generation,\u201d he swiftly added, \u201cis the Supreme Court.\u201d\u201cWe can build a firewall for our children and grandchildren that they just might scale the seven mountains of influence,\u201d Mr. Church continued. \u201cSeven mountains\u201d alludes to an aspect of Christian dominionist ideology, according to which God has commanded true Christians to gain control of seven areas of civilization \u2014 including government, business, education and the media.Unionville, not coincidentally, sits in one hotly contested congressional district and in driving range of two others, all three currently in Republican hands. \u201cIf we lose those three seats to progressives,\u201d Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition, told the audience at the pastor briefing, \u201cthe whole Congress could be lost.\u201dThe Republican Party candidate in one of those districts, Mark Harris, was on hand in Unionville with a speech that sounded a lot like a sermon \u2014 unsurprising given that he is also a pastor. \u201cThe greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion,\u201d he said. It was a reminder that at this conference, there was no easy place to draw the line between preacher and politician, just as there seemed to be little or no space between church and political party.A glance at the schedule of pastor briefings across the country suggests that they are precisely targeted according to the needs of the Republican Party. The same is true of the itinerary of the Family Research Council\u2019s \u201cValues Bus\u201d initiative, which is sending buses as mobile get-out-the-vote units to evangelical churches and events to key congressional districts.The Family Research Council offers pastors comprehensive tool kits, including a 36-page ivotevalues.org resource guide and instructions for establishing \u201cCulture Impact Teams\u201d within churches, which aim to turn out congregants to vote their \u201cbiblical values.\u201d Mr. Church\u2019s Awake88 group offers a \u201cChurch Voter Lookup,\u201d which essentially marries a church database with a voter database. The Faith & Freedom Coalition is working with 30,000 churches and aims to distribute millions of voter guides by Tuesday.To comply with tax and campaign finance rules, the voter guides put out by these groups are all ostensibly nonpartisan. But that doesn\u2019t mean their message isn\u2019t clear: One party is \u201cpro-life\u201d and supports \u201creligious freedom.\u201d The other party is presumably against life and wants to oppress believers.After pipe bombs were mailed to over a dozen Democratic leaders, Tony Perkins did make calls to end the rhetoric of division. \u201cThe path forward is a civil one,\u201d he wrote on Oct. 24. But in his appearances before Christian nationalist audiences, he takes a different tone. \u201cAre the growing reports of left-wing violence random, or is there is an intentional effort to intimidate conservative-leaning voters?\u201d he asked in the Oct. 18 radio segment with Mr. Wilson, a theme he returned to multiple times. At the Unionville pastors\u2019 event, Mr. Perkins asserted, \u201cWe are in a spiritual war.\u201d He left little room for doubt that, in his view, \u201cthe rulers of darkness\u201d and \u201cthe spiritual host of wickedness\u201d are to be found on the Democratic Party\u2019s side of the aisle.Alongside the mobilization of pastors, Christian nationalist organizations are pursuing a data-driven strategy. The Faith & Freedom Coalition reportedly plans \u201cto micro-target around 125 million social conservative voters across 19 different states through door-to-door interactions, digital ads, phone calls, and mailers,\u201d according to an article in The Christian Post.\u201cFaith & Freedom monitors voters\u2019 databases to see which of the people they have interacted with vote early,\u201d Lance Lemmonds, the communications director of the coalition told The Christian Post. \u201cFor those that haven\u2019t voted early, the organization will send out about 28 million digital ads encouraging them to vote in the last weekend and Monday.\u201d The coalition, he added, \u201cwill inundate Christian conservative voters in the last weekend. We will send those ads directly to their cellphones.\u201dThe Faith & Freedom Coalition and the Family Research Council have also teamed up with United in Purpose, a data-mining operation that seeks to \u201ctransform culture\u201d in \u201cwhat some people call the seven mountains,\u201d according to the president of United in Purpose, Bill Dallas. According to a 2012 article on NPR\u2019s website, the organization assigns citizens points for certain characteristics, such as membership on anti-abortion lists or an interest in Nascar. If a voter\u2019s score \u201ctotaled over 600 points,\u201d Mr. Dallas said, \u201cwe run that person against the voter registration database.\u201d If not registered, \u201cthat became one of the key people we were going to target.\u201dIn a 2016 interview on Daystar TV, Mr. Dallas was even clearer: \u201cWe have a ministry consultant who will work with each church to help them get their people out to vote on Election Day.\u201dIt would be inaccurate to assume that Christian nationalists are targeting only white evangelicals. Conservative Catholics are very much part of the focus, as are nonwhite evangelicals. Latino pastors and churches are targeted with messages about abortion, \u201creligious freedom\u201d and economic self-sufficiency.At the same event, a businessman named Craig Huey, speaking through a translator, told the assembled pastors: \u201cYou need to be able to explain to your fellowship these issues. When we talk about abortion, for example, what is more important, talking about the minimum wage or about life?\u201d Mr. Huey volunteered to host election forums at the pastors\u2019 churches. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do it for you. And if you want to do it, we have a PowerPoint that you can use to go straight down the ballot. It\u2019s not Republican, it\u2019s not Democrat. But where do they stand on abortion?\u201dLeaders of the Christian nationalist movement appear to be aware that their political activity may raise questions about their compliance with the legal and tax guidelines intended to prevent churches from engaging in direct campaigning for political candidates and parties. At the Unionville pastor briefing, Tami Fitzgerald instructed pastors on how to thread the needle: \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you can talk about issues all day long as a pastor, you can tell people who you\u2019re going to vote for,\u201d she said. But \u201cyou must not publish that information in a church newsletter or state it from the pulpit.\u201dIn his first months in office, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the Johnson Amendment, a federal law barring houses of worship, charitable nonprofits and private foundations from endorsing or financially supporting political parties and candidates. But it\u2019s unclear what a repeal of the Johnson Amendment would accomplish. In Unionville, San Diego and elsewhere across the country, it\u2019s all but impossible to separate pastors from political operatives, parties from houses of worship, and the redemptive messages of theology from the slogans of partisan placards.Still, the narrative that government is stomping all over the rights of conservative churches to enter the public square is one of the best ways to get the base to the polls. With so much at stake on Tuesday, it seems too useful to set aside just because it\u2019s not true.Advertisement"}

Open discussion of salaries among peers and co-workers, experts say, is a powerful tool to fight pay inequity.And yet!

In just the past few years, cultural norms and legislation have begun to unravel some of the forces that discourage open salary discussion, sometimes even tilting pay negotiations in favor of employees.Having these conversations is much easier said than done, but there are ways to gain confidence in discussing your salary.Most important, Ms. McGurran said, is to be open and genuine, framing these conversations as beneficial for everyone involved.

{"Headline": "Behind Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s Rise, Two Loyal Enforcers", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents has focused attention on their roles as enablers of the crown prince\u2019s impulsiveness and aggression, and Saudi watchers consider the men\u2019s fate a bellwether of the royal court\u2019s direction as it grapples with the international outrage over the killing.\u201cThey are the closest people to the crown prince,\u201d said Kristin Smith Diwan, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. \u201cThey are his political enforcers and the face of the brash new \u2018Saudi first\u2019 posture at home and abroad, and those opposed to the hypernationalist, thuggish direction in Saudi foreign policy would be happy to see them cut down to size.\u201dBut the kingdom has already assigned some blame for the killing to Mr. Qahtani, the social-media czar. He lost his title as an adviser to the royal court because he contributed to the vitriolic rhetoric toward the kingdom\u2019s critics that led to Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, a Saudi official said. It is unclear which of his many duties Mr. Qahtani has relinquished.Mr. Sheikh, the sports commissioner, was in New York for medical treatment during the killing, according to Saudis who know him, and has since avoided the spotlight.Mr. Qahtani did not respond to messages seeking comment. Mr. Sheikh did not respond to a request for comment sent to the sports commission.Both men run portfolios \u2014 social media and sports \u2014 that resonate with the large population of young Saudis whom Prince Mohammed has courted as his base. Both have sought to fire up the fierce nationalism that the prince has encouraged by pouring money into battles against rivals in stadiums or on the internet.Although neither portfolio relates to foreign affairs, foreign envoys often seek out the two men because of their influence, said Dennis Horak, the former Canadian ambassador to Riyadh who was expelled in August after other Canadian diplomats called for the release of detained rights activists.Mr. Sheikh was approachable while Mr. Qahtani \u201chad a much fiercer reputation,\u201d Mr. Horak said. The pair, he said, was \u201cnot so much good cop-bad cop, more bad cop and lesser-bad cop.\u201dLike Prince Mohammed, neither was well known before the prince\u2019s father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015. Both were educated inside the kingdom with scant experience abroad.But each man had skills the prince treasured.He also appears to have developed an interest in hacking. As early as 2009, someone using credentials associated with Mr. Qahtani was trawling amateur hacking forums to learn about surveillance software, according to images of the posts captured by other forum members.In 2012, someone using Mr. Qahtani\u2019s government email address solicited services from the Italian spyware company Hacking Team, according emails later released by WikiLeaks. In one email, the writer sought a visit by people with \u201chigh technical knowledge\u201d to \u201cexplain the solutions you offer and training and costs.\u201d\u201cWill bear all the costs of the trip from A-Z,\u201d the author of the email added.In an extension of his royally financed campaign to build a sports empire, Mr. Sheikh became the honorary president of one of the most successful and popular soccer teams in Egypt, an honor widely believed to reflect heavy investments of money from the crown prince. But Mr. Sheikh resigned in a dispute with the board after just a few months and instead bankrolled his own rival franchise, Pyramid. He recruited three star Brazilian players and launched a sports channel dedicated to his team, reportedly pouring in as much as $33 million.But he complained publicly that Egyptian referees, fans and commentators were failing to appreciate his investments, and said he had asked Egypt\u2019s president to intervene. In September, a stadium of Egyptian soccer fans broke out in vulgar chants denouncing Mr. Sheikh and the Saudis, and he responded by abandoning the team.\u201cStrange attacks from everywhere, and a new story every day,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cWhy the headache?\u201dMr. Sheikh also splurged last September on a $4.8 million limited edition Bugatti Chiron sports car, according to a sales contract obtained by The New York Times. The seller, the Emirati businessman Saeed Mohammed Butti Alqubaisi, declined to comment.When an entertainment program on the Saudi-owned satellite network MBC last year seemed to hint at a rumored affair between Mr. Sheikh and an Egyptian singer, Mr. Sheikh ordered the network to fire the production team, according to industry executives familiar with the case. The show remains off the air.Both men played signal roles in Prince Mohammed\u2019s rise. In June 2017, Mr. Sheikh and Mr. Qahtani were among a handful of Prince Mohammed\u2019s loyalists who forcibly detained the previous crown prince and interior minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, holding him overnight and threatening him until he agreed to give up his claim to the throne, according to members and associates of the royal family.In a video made the next day, Mr. Sheikh can be seen hovering behind the ousted prince as he pledges allegiance to Mohammed bin Salman. A social media campaign spread rumors that a cocaine addiction had made the ousted prince unfit to rule, and people close to the royal family said Mr. Qahtani fueled the rumors.Both men sprang into action again when Saudi Arabia led a blockade of its tiny neighbor Qatar in June 2017, over its support for political Islam. They unleashed insults and promoted hashtags bashing Qatar, and Mr. Qahtani forced MBC to stop airing Turkish soap operas because of Turkey\u2019s support for Qatar, costing the network millions in losses, according to industry executives.A Qatari-owned network, BeIN Sports, had acquired the exclusive rights to broadcast this year\u2019s World Cup in the Arab world. So Mr. Qahtani helped promote BeoutQ, a bootleg operation beamed from Riyadh-based Arabsat. BeoutQ ripped live events from BeIN\u2019s feed and broadcast the games without paying for rights, spurring international lawsuits. The Saudi government has denied any relationship to the pirate network.Both men also played key roles again last fall when Crown Prince Mohammed arbitrarily detained hundreds of the kingdom\u2019s richest businessmen and several of his royal cousins in a Ritz-Carlton hotel in what was billed as a crackdown on corruption \u2014 just a few weeks after Mr. Sheikh had picked up his $4.8 million Bugatti.Both men acted as interrogators, demanding that the captives confess to corrupt self-enrichment and pledge to surrender vast sums, according to relatives and close associates of several detainees. Although blindfolded during some interrogations, detainees told relatives that they saw the two men or recognized their voices from broadcast interviews. Others said that through hotel room windows, they saw Mr. Sheikh coming and going surrounded by armed guards.Several former detainees have reported physical mistreatment during the interrogations, including beatings, electrical shocks and suspension upside down for long periods.Some have shown their family members lasting scars from the beatings and shocks, and in one case photographs of the bruises and scars have been shared with The New York Times; some of the pictures included the electronic monitoring bracelet that the government has forced released detainees to wear to track their movements. One was forced to make his consent to a forced confession with only a thumb print because he was too incapacitated to write out his signature, according to a relative informed by the detainee.Although no evidence has emerged that either man directly abused the captives, both questioned detainees who had been abused.The government of Saudi Arabia has called the allegations of physical abuse \u201cabsolutely untrue.\u201dNeither Mr. Qahtani nor Mr. Sheikh have commented publicly on the killing of Mr. Khashoggi. But Mr. Qahtani, who lost his title as a royal court adviser, appears to believe his days of serving the prince are not over.After his dismissal, he tweeted his thanks to the king and crown prince for \u201cthis great opportunity to have the honor to serve the homeland.\u201d\u201cI will remain a loyal servant of my country forever,\u201d he added.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and David D.

When he proposed, three months after meeting his future wife at a family wedding, he traveled six hours to her hometown, carrying 15 boxes of confections: baklava, kenafeh and Turkish delights.The couple settled in Baghdad, opened a bakery and started a family. As Catholics, though, they faced discrimination and threats of violence. When those threats turned deadly, they fled and sought asylum in America.\u201cNow we have a big name,\u201d Mrs. Najjar beamed.Amid the turbulence of life in Iraq during this period, the family still found its routine, running the bakery, raising the children. \u201cWe lived, like, no problem,\u201d Mrs. Najjar said.Fifty-eight people died in the attack. Among the victims were two of Mr. Najjar\u2019s relatives, one of them an infant.Two weeks later, Mrs. Najjar, who had not been at the church during the attack, found a note slipped under the front door of the family\u2019s home. It said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to kill you,\u201d she recalled recently.Their children were 4 and 2 years old at the time, and the Najjars decided they needed to pack up the family in a few suitcases and join the exodus of Iraqi Christians fleeing to northern Iraq, then to Turkey.Once there, the Najjars initially settled in Usak, a provincial capital in eastern Turkey, where Mr. Najjar quickly found a job at a bakery. Soon after, they applied for asylum in America. It was granted in 2014, and the family moved to the San Diego area, where the parents worked in bakeries for three years and dreamed of again opening their own.\u201cWe wanted to make something together, something strong,\u201d said Mrs. Najjar, 38. \u201cIt is my dream and my husband\u2019s dream.\u201dTheir new bakery, Al Hamdani Sweets, opened in a popular shopping center near an interstate in August 2017. Mr. Najjar bakes, while Mrs. Najjar handles management, marketing and deliveries.Their experience running a bakery in Baghdad, though, went only so far in Spring Valley. Taxes, permits, health codes and other regulations proved challenging. \u201cIn Baghdad, you don\u2019t have taxes,\u201d Mr. Najjar, 43, said in the back room of the shop, with Turkish delights on the counter and stacks of trays and pastry boxes piled up around him.As the Najjars tried to keep their business, named after the town where the couple married, going after a slow start, the International Rescue Committee helped the Najjars navigate the unfamiliar rules and manage their finances.\u201cI.R.C. helped so much,\u201d said Mrs. Najjar, who kept her Bluetooth device in her ear throughout an interview last month. \u201cThey make everything easy.\u201dSome of the shop\u2019s baking equipment was purchased through funds from the committee\u2019s individual development accounts program, a saving program that, in March, matched $4,000 of the couple\u2019s business income.Financed by three-year federal grants, the program is intended to ease refugees into the economy by helping small-business ventures. Over the past three-year cycle, it has enrolled 115 clients in the San Diego area, matching almost $420,000 in savings, said Fady Amin, a committee coordinator who worked with the Najjars. Funds are used to help buy assets, like a house, business equipment or a car. (The Najjars just purchased a new Toyota Sienna, which Mrs. Najjar uses to make deliveries.)In a separate loans program, the organization doled out more than $1.4 million nationwide in 743 small-dollar loans from July 2016 to September 2018. Most borrowers were from Syria or Iraq.More than a year in, business at the Najjars\u2019 shop is good, with a steady stream of customers, many from a nearby hookah lounge. They have hired two employees. A wide variety of sweets, which Mr. Najjar bakes daily, are sold at local grocery stores and a university, and wholesalers in Sacramento and Seattle buy them, too.Early next year, the family will be eligible for citizenship, and they plan to apply. The couple\u2019s two children, now 13 and 10, enjoy school and sometimes help at the bakery.In the back room, Mrs. Najjar scrolled on her smartphone through photos of the children, laughing and covered in flour. Others were taken at SeaWorld, where the family has an annual pass.\u201cHere, my children have a good future,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a coordinator with the International Rescue Committee.

She did so in a speech about Europe\u2019s future before the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, which was seen as an effort to leave a legacy as her own power slowly fades.Her comments came hours after President Trump launched a blistering personal attack on President Emmanuel Macron of France, who also has proposed a European army.\u201cThe days where we can unconditionally rely on others are gone,\u201d Ms. Merkel said in a speech televised around the Continent. \u201cThat means that we Europeans should take our fate more into our own hands if we want to survive as a European community.\u201dThat language echoed comments Ms. Merkel has made before. But in the current climate and in the twilight of her chancellorship, there was a new urgency to her call, analysts said.\u201cWe should work on a vision to create a real European army one day,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. Such an army, she said, would show the world \u201cthat there will never again be war between European nations.\u201dStressing that such an army would not be \u201cagainst NATO\u201d but complement it, the chancellor also proposed a European Security Council with rotating seats for member states that would make speedy foreign policy decisions without the need for unanimity.\u201cIt is remarkable to hear the German chancellor, leader of the most Atlanticist country in the world, talking about European defense and Germany\u2019s responsibility toward it like this,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.Whether this language is backed up by actual institutions is an open question. Many see a European army as a distant ambition.\u201cCalling for a European army is a bold long-term vision,\u201d said Guntram Wolff, director of the Bruegel research institute in Brussels, \u201cbut let\u2019s acknowledge that it\u2019s long-term.\u201dThe political authority and legitimacy to send soldiers into a fight still resides firmly within national parliaments, he pointed out.Others see an opportunity for Germany to escape its traditional unease about taking on a leadership role in foreign and defense policy by rooting such a role firmly in a collective European effort.As Mr. Leonard put it: \u201cA European military operation might be an easier sell than a German military operation.\u201dAt best, a European army can be considered an aspiration. Some European governments, including Germany\u2019s, require parliamentary approval each time their national armies are deployed abroad, let alone fight. How any European army would be organized, led or governed \u2014 let alone financed when so many countries cannot even spend 2 percent of GDP on defense \u2014 are questions few advocates have even tried to answer.It has long been a French idea, one that Charles de Gaulle tried to organize unsuccessfully in the 1950s. For the most part, European nations have been content to participate in NATO for collective defense, with an American guarantee under an American nuclear umbrella. Even France returned to the NATO command structure in 2009, 43 years after Mr. de Gaulle pulled it out in 1966 and sent NATO packing off to Belgium.With Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism about NATO, which he has portrayed as a club in which member countries somehow pay dues to the United States, there has been renewed interest in a more forceful European defense capability, but within NATO, not in opposition to it.Think-tanks debate the idea of European \u201cstrategic autonomy,\u201d a label American policymakers resist because it implies separation.Europeans argue that \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d simply refers to their own capacity to collectively do small-scale military operations that NATO does not want to do. Then there are the debates about whether European defense spending would be designed to promote European military manufacturers at the expense of American ones, one of the Trump administration\u2019s criticisms of any efforts toward more European defense.Ms. Merkel is said to have been deeply moved by the weekend centennial events for World War I in France, much of it spent by the side of Mr. Macron. He has regularly supported the idea of a European army and a European intervention force, designed to handle sudden conflict outside of NATO.Her speech came after the summit meeting in Paris that displayed many of the strains between Mr. Trump and European allies. An interview given by Mr. Macron was misinterpreted by some journalists to suggest that he favored the creation of a European army to defend against Russia, China and even the United States. In fact Mr. Macron discussed the need for France to defend itself against cyber attacks and cyber espionage involving those countries.Only later in the interview did he discuss a European army, but that was without any direct reference to competition against the United States. Instead Mr. Macron emphasized how Europe must do more for its own security, which Washington has regularly urged.\u201cWe need a Europe which defends itself better alone, without just depending on the United States, in a more sovereign way,\u201d he said.Ms. Merkel, wearing a blue blazer echoing the color of the European flag, won a standing ovation in the chamber on Tuesday \u2014 but also copious amounts of booing and heckling.\u201cEurope\u2019s soul is tolerance,\u201d she said. That tolerance has been strained in recent years, she said, as one crisis after another pulled at the social fabric of the Continent.Katrin Bennhold reported from Berlin and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nissan Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, Is Arrested Over Financial Misconduct Allegations", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Carlos Ghosn, who created an alliance between Nissan and Renault that made it effectively the world\u2019s largest carmaker, was arrested by the authorities in Japan on Monday in a remarkable tumble for one of the industry\u2019s most powerful and admired leaders.Mr. Ghosn, a larger-than-life figure widely hailed for saving Nissan, reviving Renault, and rethinking how automakers could share technologies, was detained after an internal company inquiry found that he had underreported his compensation to the Japanese government for several years.The alliance, which in 2016 was broadened to include Mitsubishi, accounts for 10.6 million cars sold annually. The arrest of Mr. Ghosn, who is chairman of Nissan, chief executive of Renault and chairman of the board at Mitsubishi, stunned the industry. It comes at an uneasy time: The companies face a slowing economy, a global trade war and a shift toward electric cars.If the alliance were one entity, it could be considered the world\u2019s largest automaker, on track to sell more cars than Toyota or Volkswagen this year \u2014 if it can match results in the first six months of this year, when it sold 5.5 million vehicles.Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, said he would recommend to his board, which will meet Thursday, that Mr. Ghosn be removed. \u201cNeedless to say, this is an act which cannot be tolerated by the company,\u201d he said.Mr. Saikawa, speaking at a 90-minute news conference at Nissan headquarters in Yokohama, described Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a director who was also arrested Monday, as \u201cmasterminds\u201d of a long-running scheme to mislead financial authorities. He offered few details, citing the prosecutors\u2019 continuing investigation.\u201cI feel a big disappointment,\u201d said Mr. Saikawa, who did not bow in deep apology before television cameras, as is customary in Japan. \u201cAnd I feel frustration and despair, and indignation or resentment.\u201dMr. Kelly was Nissan\u2019s first American director, appointed in 2012, but had a much lower profile than Mr. Ghosn. Neither of the men could be reached for comment.Nissan said it was cooperating with Japanese prosecutors and that its investigation into Mr. Ghosn began after a whistle-blower said he had been misrepresenting his salary and using company assets for personal purposes.Born in Brazil to Lebanese parents and educated at elite universities in France, Mr. Ghosn made his reputation after joining Nissan in 1999. Renault, where Mr. Ghosn was an executive vice president, had bought a large stake in the Japanese company, which was on the verge of collapse at the time.Mr. Ghosn made sweeping changes at Nissan, closing five domestic factories and cutting 21,000 jobs. Later, he engineered an arrangement between Renault and Nissan that allowed them to operate like a single carmaker. Short of a full merger, the alliance enabled them to share the cost of developing new models and to negotiate better deals with suppliers by buying components together.As chairman and chief executive of the partnership, Mr. Ghosn was celebrated in Japan: His life story was made into a manga comic, although critics on the left noted he had earned his French nickname, \u201cLe cost killer.\u201d Still, he had enough political savvy to retain the support of the French government, which owns 15 percent of Renault, despite some bitter pay disputes.In 2016 and 2017, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s salary at Renault was questioned publicly, by French government officials and a shareholder group; this year he agreed to a 30 percent pay cut in return for another four-year term as chief executive.Under Mr. Ghosn, the alliance overcame the kinds of differences in corporate and national cultures that have often doomed megamergers like the ill-fated marriage between Daimler and Chrysler, which was dissolved in 2007.He earned a reputation as a hard-nosed manager who drew up rigorous business plans and kept close track of their progress.\u201cHis world is the world of efficiency,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows the auto industry. \u201cIt\u2019s the American style of management: clear plans, clear goals and permanently monitored.\u201dMr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer said it was questionable whether Nissan or Renault would have survived in the brutally competitive market for mid-price autos without Mr. Ghosn. In a measure of investors\u2019 regard for him, Renault shares slid 10 percent on the Paris stock exchange Monday; Nissan shares fell 9 percent in trading in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Nissan was down more than 5 percent in early trading in Tokyo.According to Nissan\u2019s securities filings, Mr. Ghosn was paid 735 million yen, about $6.5 million, in cash in 2017. That is a drop of 33 percent from the \u00a51.1 billion he received in 2016.In insular Japan, where foreign leadership of domestic companies is rare, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s downfall could be taken as a referendum on the perils of working with outsiders.\u201cHe\u2019s always the go-to when people say foreigners can never succeed in Japan,\u201d said Pernille Rudlin, managing director of Rudlin Consulting, which specializes in intercultural consulting with Japanese companies. \u201cNow there are no good examples left.\u201dThe misconduct allegations about Mr. Ghosn are of another order, analysts said.\u201cFor Nissan, Mr. Ghosn is a big hero,\u201d said Shin Ushijima, a lawyer who specializes in corporate governance. \u201cThis news is so embarrassing.\u201dAt a news conference with the Belgian prime minister on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron of France said it was too early to comment. But the French state, as a major Renault shareholder, would be \u201cextremely vigilant about the stability of the alliance\u201d between Renault and Nissan, he said.Mr. Macron added that the French government would seek to maintain stability and \u201cfull support\u201d for Renault\u2019s workers. The company employs more than 47,000 workers in France.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s pay was long debated there. In 2016, Renault was pressured by Mr. Macron, the finance minister at the time, to reduce his compensation. In 2017, he insisted on a package of 7.4 million euros, about $8.5 million. The French government balked but Renault shareholders ultimately approved that payout.In Japan, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation made him an outlier. Japanese executives typically earn far less than their American or European counterparts. Takeshi Uchiyamada, chairman of Toyota, for example, was paid \u00a5181 million in 2017, compared to Mr. Ghosn\u2019s reported \u00a5735 million.Foreign investors tend to criticize Japanese companies as not paying executives enough. \u201cFor the Japanese market, the main concern from foreign institutional investors is the question of whether compensation will be less incentive driven,\u201d said Hideaki Miyajima, professor of commerce at Waseda University in Tokyo. \u201cThe criticism of Japanese firms is that compensation is not related to performance, and Japanese leaders are less likely to take risks.\u201dReporting was contributed by Jack Ewing from Frankfurt, Liz Alderman from Paris, and Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wheels on These Buses Go Round and Round With Zero Emissions ", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWHITE PLAINS, N.Y. \u2014\u00a0\u201cSome of the kids call it the singing bus,\u201d said Juliessa Diclo Cruz, 10, as she rode in back of one of New York State\u2019s first-ever electric school buses on a chilly October morning.It was easy to see why. The rumbling diesel engines on conventional yellow school buses can be heard a block away. But the five new battery-powered buses in White Plains, which went into service this fall, run so quietly that they have to play a four-tone melody for safety as they roam the streets.The school district\u2019s five singing buses \u2014 which cost $365,000 apiece, more than three times the price of a new diesel bus with modern pollution controls \u2014 are still a rarity. Of the roughly 480,000 school buses in the United States, only a few hundred are fully electric. But that\u2019s slowly changing. State officials are looking to limit children\u2019s exposure to the harmful exhaust from older diesel buses. They\u2019re also increasingly concerned about the carbon emissions that drive global warming. At the same time, the price of electric buses, while still out of reach for most school districts, keeps falling as technology improves. \u201cWe see this as the beginning of something that\u2019s very cutting edge,\u201d said Joseph Baker, senior vice president of operations at National Express, the company that operates the school buses in White Plains. \u201cWe often joke that someday these White Plains buses will be in a museum.\u201dSimilar experiments are proliferating across the country. California has already spent millions of dollars to help budget-strapped school districts purchase dozens of new electric buses, while New York and Massachusetts have funded their own smaller projects.Those efforts could soon get a boost from an unlikely source. In the meantime, school administrators are carefully monitoring early projects to make sure the buses have sufficient range and run reliably. As Bayard Guerson, 50, drove one of the new buses through White Plains to pick up elementary school students one morning last month, he checked the digital console on his dashboard showing how much charge he had left: 56 miles\u2019 worth. It was more than enough to travel the 19 miles of his morning routes before he\u2019d plug in the vehicle to recharge for the afternoon.\u201cI could go the whole day without charging,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like your cellphone: better to charge all the time.\u201dEventually, as charging stations become more common across the state, worries about range could dissipate. For now, though, the White Plains district is mainly using its electric buses for its shortest school routes. And administrators are hesitant to use them for out-of-town field trips, like one to the Bronx Zoo, about 16 miles away. On dependability, officials in White Plains give the buses, which were made by Lion Electric, a Quebec-based company, a passing grade. \u201cSo far, so good,\u201d said Sergio Alfonso, the district\u2019s director of transportation. \u201cWe always expect issues with new technology, but we haven\u2019t seen anything out of the ordinary yet.\u201dLion Electric says it has learned from those early missteps and is training mechanics in White Plains, as well as helping to establish a service center nearby in New Jersey for more serious problems.White Plains was only able to afford its five buses with outside help. National Express received a state grant that offset $120,000 of the cost of each vehicle. The company then set up a partnership with Consolidated Edison, the local electric utility, which agreed to chip in another $100,000 per bus.The grid project is one of the first of its kind, and, in theory, could be a way for utilities to help finance electric school buses elsewhere in the state. As New York builds more solar and wind power, it will need lots of new energy storage. The utility plans to test the buses\u2019 batteries next summer to see how they hold up under heavy use and to check whether the economics work.In California, the Twin Rivers Unified School District in North Sacramento has purchased 16 electric school buses over the past year with a combination of state and local aid. To date, according to Timothy Shannon, the district\u2019s transportation director, the electric buses have cost about 75 percent less to fuel. They use smart chargers to power up during off-peak hours when electricity rates are lower. And, with fewer moving parts, they cost 60 percent less to maintain.But even with those savings, Mr. Shannon said, the upfront cost of electric buses would have to fall considerably for school districts to consider buying them without outside help.According to Marc B\u00e9dard, the chief executive of Lion Electric, that day could come sooner than many expect. \u201cWithin seven years, we think electric school buses will get to a similar price as diesel,\u201d Mr. B\u00e9dard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all changing so fast. Three years ago, there was a lot of skepticism about whether electric buses were even feasible. Now, we\u2019re not talking about whether they\u2019re feasible. It\u2019s all about how to make the business case work.\u201dFor now, not all states are convinced that electric buses are the way to go. Arizona plans to spend $38 million of its Volkswagen funds to replace its oldest school buses, but will focus primarily on propane or cleaner diesel technology. In its analysis, the state found it could buy 150 such buses for the cost of fewer than 50 electric buses and eliminate far more pollution overall.Beyond the economic factors, school administrators in White Plains see an intangible value in electric buses: They\u2019re educational. The district has been integrating environmental lessons into its curriculum, offering a farm-to-table elective and encouraging students to compost. The buses represent another teachable moment.\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous learning experience,\u201d said Joseph Ricca, superintendent of the White Plains school district. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to read about this in a book, it\u2019s another to get on and actually ride it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data-Driven Medicine Will Help People \u2014 But Can It Do So Equally?", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "Technological advances threaten to make a crushingly unequal system even more so.There is a great lesson here as we anticipate the rise of data-driven diagnostic and intervention techniques in health care. It\u2019s not that new methods won\u2019t help people; it\u2019s that they will increase health inequality \u2014 not just among those who can afford it and those who cannot, but among those who can undertake the research and take advantage of the new techniques and those who cannot.Further, these new data-driven medical techniques could lead to more discrimination. If there are no legal restrictions, for example, what\u2019s to stop companies from trying to hire people who have fine-tuned their sleep patterns with biofeedback, who have better exercise outcomes thanks to genomic analyses or are less likely to develop cancer in the long run?Legislators are not unaware of these problems. In 2008, the United States passed a landmark law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which bars companies from hiring, firing or promoting workers based on genetic-test results \u2014 or requiring such tests \u2014 and insurance companies from requiring or using such tests to decide coverage. But legislative protections are easily reversible. In fact, last year Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that would carve out several significant exceptions to the law.It may seem perverse to worry about inequality when we are talking about something that can improve so many lives, but a society isn\u2019t held together by making wonderful things available to just a few rich people. This isn\u2019t an argument for holding back improvements in health care. It is an argument instead that we must focus on equitable outcomes for all of us: how to make sure that access to new forms of health care is fair and evenly distributed; how to make sure that we guard against new forms of discrimination that can emerge from all this data; and how we avoid a corporate-driven version of these shifts, in which health outcomes are mobilized not for our happiness and our well-being but to squeeze another hour or two from us at work.Considering that the United States is alone among developed nations in its refusal to recognize health care as a fundamental right, it\u2019s even more crucial to recognize that inequality risks poisoning the fruits of American medical ingenuity. The right measure for successful health care isn\u2019t about the maximum possible for a few but the average for everyone, the median for a society and the minimum opportunities available to even those with the fewest resources and privileges. That\u2019s not just fairness. That\u2019s what a healthy society looks like.Zeynep Tufekci is a contributing writer for Opinion and the author of \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Goldman Sachs Banker Said Colleagues Were Involved in 1MDB Scandal", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe banker, Tim Leissner, told the judge that he had \u201cconspired with other employees and agents of Goldman Sachs\u201d to keep compliance and legal department employees from discovering that bribes and kickbacks were being paid to help the bank secure more than $6 billion in bond work for the investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad.During his guilty plea in August, Mr. Leissner also said that his decision to hide his actions from Goldman\u2019s compliance department was \u201cvery much in line\u201d with a wider culture at the firm.The newly released statements by Mr. Leissner were the latest indication of the scope of Goldman\u2019s role in a scandal centered on the looting of more than $2.7 billion from an investment fund meant to benefit the people of Malaysia. Instead, the money financed the lavish lifestyles of people connected to the former prime minister Najib Razak, whom Malaysian authorities charged with corruption in July.Mr. Leissner pleaded guilty to bribery and money laundering charges in Brooklyn on Aug. 28. A redacted transcript of the plea hearing was released by federal prosecutors on Friday after Judge Margo K. Brodie in Brooklyn approved a request by lawyers for The New York Times to lift a sealing order on the proceeding.During the hearing, Mr. Leissner said he and his unnamed colleagues hid the fund\u2019s involvement with Jho Low, a flamboyant Malaysian financier, from Goldman\u2019s compliance team. Mr. Leissner said that Mr. Low served as an intermediary on behalf of Goldman in its dealings with Malaysian officials and 1MDB.\u201cI and several other employees of Goldman Sachs at the time also concealed that we knew that Jho Low was promising and paying bribes and kickbacks to foreign officials to obtain and retain 1MDB business for Goldman Sachs,\u201d he told Judge Brodie.Mr. Low was indicted in October on foreign bribery and money laundering charges along with another former Goldman banker, Roger Ng.The bank has said it was cooperating with the investigation. A person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak publicly said Goldman was unaware of the identities of the employees Mr. Leissner was referring to in his plea beyond himself and Mr. Ng.Mr. Ng, who reported to Mr. Leissner, was arrested last week in Malaysia, and federal prosecutors plan to seek his extradition to the United States. Mr. Low, who is also wanted on criminal charges by Malaysian authorities, is a fugitive.Federal prosecutors unsealed the indictment against Mr. Low and Mr. Ng, along with a criminal information to which Mr. Leissner pleaded guilty, last week.Mr. Leissner\u2019s charging document described another Goldman executive as a co-conspirator in the bribery scheme. The banker has been identified by people familiar with the matter as Andrea Vella, who most recently served as co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment banking group in Asia. He was suspended by Goldman last week. Mr. Vella could not be reached for comment.After prosecutors released details of their case last week, Goldman Sachs said for the first time in a regulatory filing it expected to pay \u201csignificant fines\u201d to resolve the investigation into its role in the 1MDB scandal. The bank made over $600 million in fees on the three bond deals.Until last week, Goldman had sought to portray its role as that of a victim of the actions of Mr. Leissner, whom the bank had cast as being a rogue employee. The firm put Mr. Leissner on leave more than two years ago after it discovered he had personally vouched for Mr. Low\u2019s character on Goldman letterhead without the bank\u2019s permission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Co-Living Goes Affordable", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York offers city financing to encourage developers to build co-living projects that are below market rate.The co-living trend \u2014 in which renters lease sleeping quarters that are often tiny, and share common living space with roommates \u2014 now has the city\u2019s official backing.On Thursday, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development is expected to announce a pilot program that will allow developers to vie for public financing to create a more affordable version of the dorm-style living arrangement that has emerged in some of the city\u2019s priciest neighborhoods. Much of what already exists is at or above market rate, with some buildings offering additional amenities to residents.The city\u2019s pilot, called ShareNYC, will seek proposals for private development sites that favor mostly income-restricted units, including those for very low-income renters. The units will vary in design, but will likely run between 150 and 400 square feet per bedroom, may or may not have private bathrooms, and will include a common kitchen and living space that is shared with other roommates, according to a briefing on the program and an agency official. A mix of conventional and market-rate units will also be considered.The deadline for submissions is March 14, 2019.Some of these existing co-living arrangements may be less expensive to rent than larger, conventional units, but still veer toward luxury prices. With this pilot, city officials are hoping to create new models of shared housing that will bring down construction costs and incentivize the creation of more affordable units.\u201cIt\u2019s really a decision that reflects what we see in the world \u2014 a shortage of small apartments,\u201d said Maria Torres-Springer, the department\u2019s commissioner, who noted that about two-thirds of households in the city consist of just one or two people, yet less than half of available housing caters to them.Even the smallest apartments are often out of reach for many renters. More than 436,000 single adults living in New York in 2015 were rent-burdened, meaning they spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent, according to an analysis by New York University\u2019s Furman Center. Among them, 250,000 spent more than half of their income on rent.Building smaller units, with higher density, could be one way to create more affordable units, said Jessica Yager, the executive director at the Furman Center.\u201cWe show that as the units get smaller, the amount of money needed to support the development is less,\u201d she said. The idea is far from new. For many struggling New Yorkers, co-living is just another name for informal room-sharing, said Sarah Watson, the deputy director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a nonprofit research organization.\u201cWe\u2019re moving toward nontraditional households, and our housing stock hasn\u2019t quite caught up yet,\u201d she said.According to the group\u2019s 2017 census analysis, almost a quarter of New York adults were unmarried, considered low-income (making $58,481 a year or less), and living in a shared apartment with family or roommates. The data also dispel the stereotype that only the very young and relatively affluent seek these arrangements: Among that group, the median income was $22,000 and the median age was 36, she said.Part of what the city is seeking in the proposals is answers to questions that anyone who has roomed with strangers might ask: Who cleans the living room? Who pays for damages to the common area? Who buys the toilet paper?All entrants must address how their project will manage tenant relations, and the city will likely look to models established by private companies who are already in this space.\u201cWe mitigate the risk that someone is a freeloader,\u201d said Brad Hargreaves, the founder and chief executive of Common, a co-living management company with 319 beds in New York City and another 400 in the works. His company not only furnishes the bedrooms and shared spaces of the apartments, but also pays for routine toiletries and cleaning services, which he said could otherwise become points of conflict in the home.\u201cA lot of people see that we\u2019re buying the toilet paper and, oh my god, you\u2019re pampering these people,\u201d said Mr. Hargreaves. But he argued that it was just a small way to keep the peace. (Olive oil and Windex, for instance, are also provided.)Residents pay for the privilege. Prices for a co-living unit at the Baltic, a project in Brooklyn\u2019s Boerum Hill neighborhood with both co-living and traditional apartments, range from $1,950 to $2,100 a month. Considering these are furnished units with amenities, that is somewhat less expensive than conventional studios in the area, which asked for a median $2,200 a month last quarter, according to StreetEasy. Mr. Hargreaves said it was more typical for their co-living units to lease at about 20 percent less than conventional studios. The pilot program could attract some new players. The Collective, a London company that has developed co-living units overseas, recently purchased a 350,000-square-foot vacant site at 555 Broadway, in southeast Williamsburg, where it plans to build more than 500 co-living units.At that project, 30 percent of the units will be rented below market rate, said James Penfold, the company\u2019s planning and zoning director, adding that the market-rate units will still be 20 percent less expensive than conventional rentals nearby.The company has not yet reviewed the city\u2019s co-living program, but Mr. Penfold said they were keen to look into it. \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re actively looking at more projects.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "George Washington, William T. Sherman and Viking Marauders", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWar StoriesThe United States has been engaged in land wars in the Middle East for so long that it\u2019s easy to forget some of our nation\u2019s most significant battles have been fought at sea. Two good new books remind us of the importance of maritime warfare in our national history.Nor is Philbrick afraid to make sweeping assertions. He writes that \u201cthe bitter truth was that by the summer of 1781 the American Revolution had failed,\u201d in that it was a stalemate that many Americans no longer supported physically or financially. Victory would be secured, he continues, not by Americans but by French funds, guns, ships and soldiers. (Philbrick also does hurricanes well.) On top of that, at a time when many books of military history have poor maps or none, this book has many, all of them instructive and graceful. As a writer, I\u2019m envious of Philbrick\u2019s talents, but as a reader, I\u2019m grateful.Hone examines the United States Navy of World War II through his lens as a management consultant. Sample: \u201cThe Pacific Fleet would not advance as a monolith; it would attack as a distributed network.\u201d Personalities do not loom large in his tale. The real hero here is not an individual but a large, complex organization, the American Navy, that quickly grew from second-rate status to become the world\u2019s premier maritime force.Even so, Hone tells the story of the 1942-43 Guadalcanal campaign particularly well. That history is often related from the Marine Corps\u2019s point of view, which in painful summary is that the Navy ran away and left the Marines to fight it out alone against the Japanese. As Hone tells it, Navy commanders knew they were outmatched by the Japanese but also recognized that Guadalcanal was a decisive campaign of the Pacific War. Understanding those stakes, they engaged in suicidal missions in an effort to keep the Japanese Navy from bombarding the Marine airfield on the island and also from landing reinforcements.Hone\u2019s history is good as it goes, but it would have been better had he also addressed the Navy\u2019s clear failures of the time. For example, it seemed unable to devise an effective response to the German U-boat campaign along the East Coast in 1942. Also, it went into the war having developed a deeply flawed torpedo, the Mark 14, which among other things often failed to detonate, and sometimes ran 10 feet deeper than intended and so passed under enemy warships. These problems seem to raise a few doubts about Hone\u2019s thesis that the Navy went into the war as an innovative, flexible organization brilliant at learning from its mistakes and so able to address them quickly.Three other new books are seemingly obscure, but actually quite illuminating.The American effort in Liberia had a dual purpose: to fend off encroaching colonial powers, but also to help the 15,000 former American slaves who colonized Liberia to subjugate the approximately 730,000 indigenous people who resented the newcomers. One of the most effective American advisers was Col. Charles Young, who was born a slave in Kentucky in 1864, fought for the Army in the Philippines, was briefly acting superintendent of Sequoia National Park, was active in the N.A.A.C.P. and wound up serving repeated tours in Africa.The book is instructive in the multiple hazards and difficulties of foreign training missions. Liberian government officials wanted to have a military force, but feared having one that was too effective. In a terrible irony, at one point they shunted aside the American advisers and used their own troops to round up indigenous people, who then were shipped to forced labor camps elsewhere in West Africa.Adams\u2019s book isn\u2019t really a military history, and his publisher has done him no favor with the book\u2019s American title. It was published last year in Britain as \u201c\u00c6lfred\u2019s Britain: War and Peace in the Viking Age,\u201d which is a more accurate description. Battles do not figure largely in it, but the reasons for war and their outcomes do.But the financing of wars has become a peculiar political issue nowadays, notes Kreps, a former Air Force officer who teaches government at Cornell University. While our recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been controversial, she observes, how we pay for them has not been. Despite our current partisan polarization, politicians of neither party raise the issue much. She concludes that there now exists a broad, quiet political consensus to insulate the American people from the human and financial costs of their wars. This agreement is insidious, she writes, because it has undermined democratic accountability.One complaint: A volume written by an Ivy League professor and published by Oxford University Press should not contain historical howlers. Two that I noticed: She has Harry Truman losing to Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, and refers to \u201cthe Tea Party Massacre and the origins of the American Revolution,\u201d a seeming conflation of the Boston Massacre of 1770 and the same city\u2019s Tea Party three years later.What does William T. Sherman\u2019s march through Georgia in 1864 have to do with today\u2019s controversy over Confederate monuments? Lots, I think. The monuments quarrel grows in part out of an incomplete understanding of our past. Monument supporters charge that taking them down reduces our history, but the problem is that many of the people involved in the controversy simply don\u2019t know enough history. Imagine, for example, if Southern plantations were more accurately called \u201cslave labor camps.\u201d Would young lovers then still dream of being married in such places?But Sherman did achieve his goal of eviscerating Southern morale, both at home and at the front, where rebel officers realized that their families and homes were unprotected. By doing that, Sherman helped bring an end to the war. He should be ranked among our top five generals, ever.Dickey, the author of \u201cEmpire of Mud,\u201d looks at the march mainly through the eyes of soldiers and other participants, like nurses. Perhaps as a result of this perspective, he tends to overemphasize the role of subordinate commanders like John Logan, while underestimating Sherman\u2019s extraordinary ability to juggle troop movements, logistics and intelligence, all while adapting to a new way of war built around the railroad and the telegraph. So \u201cRising in Flames,\u201d while interesting, is unlikely to take a place alongside essential texts like Joseph T. Glatthaar\u2019s \u201cThe March to the Sea and Beyond.\u201dEide, an English professor at Texas A&M, and Gibler, a former Army officer, have compiled what amounts to a primer on what it was like to be enlisted in the Army in the post-9/11 era. People who know the military won\u2019t be surprised by much, but others can learn a lot from it.And there are still some illuminating surprises. I\u2019ve covered military operations as a reporter in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, yet I\u2019d never before heard about a kind of \u201cmortar bingo,\u201d in which soldiers would bet on where enemy mortar shells would next hit their base. \u201cAfter Combat\u201d captures the odd humor of war.Also, I hadn\u2019t before seen this observation from one soldier: \u201cMost of the platoons had people on suicide watch. \u2026 It was the powerlessness, and suicide is one way of getting power back. Suddenly, you\u2019re in control again; you can do something. \u2026 Part of it is they see violence as a solution.\u201d Finally, it offers a line true in any war: \u201cIt was really boring and then really stressful.\u201dFor female soldiers, a major stressor was internal. One comments that \u201cthere was no training about how to deal with the constant advances.\u201dOnly one line in the book made me shake my head. I generally appreciated the tone of the editors, which is neither mawkish nor militaristic. But at one point they assert that it is polite for civilians to say to veterans, \u201cThank you for your service.\u201d Some vets I know don\u2019t mind that phrase, but some others hate it. I think it is better to simply say, \u201cWelcome home.\u201dThomas E. Ricks, the Book Review\u2019s military history columnist and the author of five books about the American military, is a visiting fellow in Bowdoin College\u2019s history department.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Calgary Really Want the Winter Olympics? Does Anyone?", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesCALGARY, Alberta \u2014 Hobbled by a reputation for gross expense and corruption, the International Olympic Committee has become a mendicant, shuffling from nation to nation, shaking its cup and asking if anyone might be interested in bidding on the 2026 Winter Games.Norway, the greatest of all Winter Olympic countries, found too many expenses and too much potential environmental damage. Pass. In Innsbruck, Austria, which hosted the 1976 Winter Games, the burghers shook their heads and voted no. A canton in Switzerland, home of the I.O.C., voted to bolt the door.So Olympic officials turned their eyes to Calgary, the lively Canadian city that hosted the 1988 Winter Games. They murmured softly and smiled sweetly and asked: Might you like to bid?Calgary officials nodded, yes, they might like that indeed. And the I.O.C. officials, well-heeled princelings beneath their tattered robes, smiled so broad.This is a city brimming with optimism. Mayor Naheed Nenshi is a quick-witted urban wonk, and the city has a diverse and educated population. Its most recent public work is a breathtakingly beautiful public library that arrived on time and under budget. Hizzoner walked into a debate last week and a later interview with me intent on selling all on his vision ahead of a referendum Tuesday on whether to submit a bid.\u201cThe International Olympic Committee does worry me and keep me up a bit at night,\u201d Nenshi said. \u201cBut this is an outstanding deal for Calgary.\u201dNenshi and his supporters propound Canadian Exceptionalism: We would stage these Games as we do everything, which is to say on budget and without corruption or toleration of doping.You are tempted to root even as you wince. So many optimistic cities and nations have walked this path only to tumble down the Olympic stairs of inflated hopes, spiraling costs and corruptions\u2019 bruises.Quite a few in Calgary share my skepticism. Boosterish sorts admit to jumping nerves before Tuesday\u2019s referendum.The city is mired in an oil and gas slump, and 25 percent of its downtown towers are vacant. A survey group hired by the city surveyed more than 7,000 people and found decidedly more with a negative view of the Olympic bid. Of late, a councilor who was allied with the mayor in pushing the Olympics announced that he could no longer support a bid.\u201cThere are too many unanswered questions and an incredible amount of risk,\u201d the councilor, Evan Woolley, said at a public debate on the plebiscite.When Tokyo signed on for the 2020 Summer Games, officials sounded remarkably like those in Calgary. They promised to deliver a frugal penny- and pound-wise Olympics for about $7.3 billion.Oops.Calgary hired Ernst & Young to crunch its numbers. I sat in a council meeting as its sober gentlemen took us skipping through the numbers, all of which \u2014 miracle! \u2014 added up in favor of the bid.I nosed about afterward on the internet and noticed that Ernst & Young had served as a richly compensated \u201cexclusive provider\u201d to the Rio Olympics. Previous Olympic cities, Ernst & Young noted in a news release, had seen arenas turn into white elephants. Not Rio, no no. \u201cWe have established sustainable postgame use for facilities\u201d through a regimen of good governance and finance, the release said.Two years later, Rio de Janeiro is stuck with a rumbling herd of white elephants, Olympic pools filled with rat feces, and a burned and collapsed velodrome and wrecked arenas. Officials have scrapped promises to turn Olympic handball courts into four public schools. As ESPN reported, the only one of the sports federations not found implicated in corruption was the Brazilian Confederation of Sports for the Visually Impaired.You can only hope that Olympic and perhaps Ernst & Young officials had some fitful nights of sleep.So Calgary would, for the most part, refurbish facilities used in the 1988 Olympics and focus construction on a much-desired new winter field house. The I.O.C.\u2019s case is not vaporous, and city officials have debated it publicly.A snow-capped wall of Rockies rises to the city\u2019s west, and the region is rich in winter sports, because of the legacy of hosting the 1988 Games. To drive to Canmore, a ski town that sits within the ice-blue shadow of those mountains and would host Olympic events, is to find world-class winter athletes on nearly every block.That said, Calgary officials take a parochial, Calgary-centric view of costs, the details of which were still being worked on in the days before the vote. Mayor Nenshi said Calgary\u2019s share would come in at a touch more than $400 million. The provincial Alberta government would fork over $700 million, and the federal government in Ottawa has promised a barrel of money, too.\u201cThis is almost a tax rebate,\u201d the mayor said.This would be so if we assumed tax dollars not gathered in Calgary fell from the sky like snow. Alberta is hard-pressed by the same slump in oil revenue, and money spent renovating curling and skating rinks could mean less money to build and repair schools, roads and parks.More broadly, Calgary officials speak of the Olympics as a defibrillator for local spirits grown gloomy. The Games offer two weeks of free global advertising.David Finch, a professor specializing in marketing, participated in that recent debate and wove a splendid web. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 30 years of data that shows they will come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the equivalent of hosting 21 Super Bowls.\u201dThis is debate as a P. T. Barnum marketing seminar. I called Brad Humphreys, an economics professor at West Virginia University who studies Olympic finances. He acknowledged that the Olympics make you feel good, and it\u2019s a two-week advertisement.The remainder is a busted model.\u201cThere is a lot of temporary employment and no evidence of substantial economic impact,\u201d Humphreys said. \u201cThe very fact the I.O.C. is desperate to force cities to compete to host the Games is to extract as much benefit as they can for themselves.\u201dMayor Nenshi acknowledges the Olympics are no economic silver bullet. But he is convinced Calgary can game the gamers.\u201cI believe Calgary can host the cleanest, most cost-effective Games in history,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s not what they want, we\u2019ll say, \u2018Thank you.\u2019\u201dAs I listened, a tale from dim memory jumped to mind. Decades back, my wife and I were newly married, and we wandered in a fine mood through Manhattan and came upon a game of three-card monte. We are city natives and knew the game was a flytrap for na\u00efve tourists. But we watched, and by God, after a while we had it figured out.I raised my hand and put down a $20 bill.The three-card-monte curator waved me in and smiled so sweetly and set to moving his cards a little faster and a little better. I guessed wrong. Damn. We were church-mouse poor, and I needed that $20. So I put down another bill. My stupidity ended at 60 unaffordable dollars.Here\u2019s my advice to Calgary: Keep an eye on those I.O.C. cardsharps. I guarantee the cards will end up moving faster than you guess.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a ski town near Calgary. As a picture caption correctly noted, it is Canmore, not Cranmore.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats, Don\u2019t Procrastinate on America\u2019s Health", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf lawmakers hope to build on the Affordable Care Act and fix its flaws, they have to get to work now.This is not as far away as it sounds. If Democrats want the chance to pass health reforms that will build on the Affordable Care Act and fix its defects, they need to start planning now.The bill should go beyond simply fixing the A.C.A., though much certainly needs fixing. The insurance marketplaces are a godsend for 12 million people, particularly those with low incomes or chronic illnesses. Yet in many ways, the marketplaces proved disappointing. Middle-class families face high premiums and punishing out-of-pocket costs. One thing we won\u2019t see: a leap to a single-payer system. Many Democrats have embraced Medicare for All. I\u2019m sympathetic to that. A single-payer health system would be more functional, more economical and fairer than what we have. America may someday have a single-payer system, but we won\u2019t get there in a single bill that phases out private health insurance, rewires our byzantine health care delivery and finance systems and markedly cuts payments to hospitals and other providers. So what can Democrats do, when tweaking the Affordable Care Act is insufficient, and when leaping to Medicare for All is unrealistic?Employers could provide Medicare Extra for their workers alongside their private offerings. Compared with single-payer, these plans appear reasonable and realistic. By providing competition and better options for near-retirees and those with costly conditions, such an approach could also improve private marketplace coverage. It would include valuable disability components, too.The next round will be different. Given all that\u2019s happened, Democrats have an angrier, more partisan edge than they did then. The Democratic Party is also more unambiguously progressive. Ten years ago, conservative Democrats insisted on protracted negotiations and opposed the public option. For better and worse, these bridge figures are almost all gone. Progressive voters will be demanding a single-payer bill, and will be disappointed when they don\u2019t get it. They are entitled to a feasible alternative they can genuinely be proud of.Harold Pollack is a professor of social service administration and public health science at the University of Chicago.Advertisement"}

So he spent a day arranging the bird.\u201cNo matter what I did, it just looked like a dead chicken,\u201d he said.The next morning, he started over.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Helping Women in Labor Vote", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this soggy Monday.For women who are about to have a baby on or before Election Day, getting to a polling center to vote is probably the last thing on their minds.That\u2019s why Erin Ainslie Smith, an assistant nurse manager, and Lisa Schavrien, an obstetric nurse navigator, started a pilot program at the Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side to help patients vote with an absentee ballot.\u201cWe\u2019re doing all the legwork,\u201d said Ms. Smith, which will include multiple runs to pick up and drop off ballots at the Board of Elections offices in the five boroughs, Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties.The idea came about in 2016, when Ms. Smith realized it was difficult for many patients to vote absentee. That same year, for the first time, Ms. Schavrien helped a patient vote.\u201cIt was a lot of work, I had to make two trips back and forth to Staten Island, by 5 o\u2019clock, which was not easy,\u201d she said. The program relies on volunteers who must drop off absentee ballot applications, pick up the ballots and bring them to the hospital, and then return to the Board of Elections to drop it off.Because Ms. Smith and Ms. Schavrien wanted more patients\u2019 voices heard, they began planning to make it possible for every patient at Lenox Hill Hospital to vote by the 2020 election.So what about women who are experiencing contractions near Election Day?\u201cOn T.V., labor happens very quickly and you have to move quickly, and that\u2019s not what happens, generally, in labor,\u201d said Ms. Smith, who is pregnant and will be induced, if she doesn\u2019t go into labor first, on Nov. 13. \u201cThere are pauses, say, and depending on where you are in labor, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019d be done with labor by the time I need to give you the information.\u201dIf there is a partner or family member in the room, they will help them vote by absentee and collect their ballot, too. And their focus is not just on helping women in labor vote.It could be helping a parent with a sick child. A person recovering from a car accident. Even relatives who spent the day in the hospital lobby for a loved one.\u201cIn New York City we have a lot of medical institutions and smaller hospitals, and then multiply that by 49 other states and that\u2019s a huge population of people who don\u2019t have the opportunity to vote because of an unplanned event in their lives,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\u201cIn a world where every vote really does count, and a midterm election that really is important,\u201d getting even a few people to vote matters, said Ms. Smith. \u201cWe aren\u2019t telling you whom to vote for, or even to vote at all. We just don\u2019t want you to lose the opportunity because you\u2019re unexpectedly in a hospital.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Two reasons to smile this morning: You got an extra hour of sleep (we hope) over the weekend, and this week, while wet, looks fabulous for fall.The only bummer today: The sun sets at 4:48 p.m.Nice ShoesDear Diary:I was at the corner of 42nd Street and Third Avenue rushing to work on a sunny morning when a well-dressed woman came up next to me.

I squinted at the insole but couldn\u2019t make out the letters without my reading glasses. I turned the shoe over. Finally, I held the shoe out toward the woman.She leaned in, and the two of us looked at the insole together.She read out the brand name.\u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d I exclaimed.I slipped my shoe back on and hurried to work.\u2014 Deborah Rood GoodmanWhen you\u2019re in the voting booth tomorrow, don\u2019t forget to flip your ballot over.Campaign financeThis proposal would lower the amount of money candidates can receive from donors. It would also increase the amount of matching funds the city would give to candidates, to an 8-to-1 ratio, from 6-to-1. In other words, if someone gives $250, the candidate would receive an additional $2,000 in public matching funds.Civic engagementThis proposal would create a Civic Engagement Commission that would implement citywide participatory budgeting, which allows residents to determine where public funds are spent in their community. Also, more resources would be provided to community boards and translators would be placed at voting sites.Community boardsThis proposal would limit the terms of community board members to eight years.

{"Headline": "What 52,000 Percent Inflation Can Do to a Country", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyI walked into the empty restaurant in Managua carrying a backpack stuffed with cash, thick stacks of Nicaraguan c\u00f3rdobas bound by rubber bands. The waiter, as expected, asked me to hand over the entire stash. It may have looked like an illicit transaction. But this was Nicaragua, in 1990, at the end of its war with the American-trained contra rebels, and I was only trying to buy a meal before my money lost its value. A decade of guerrilla war and deficit spending had whipped up a maelstrom of hyperinflation and shortages. Only two items on the menu were available, and prices had doubled in a matter of weeks. With inflation surging past 13,000 percent annually, the restaurant now demanded payment upfront \u2014 to ensure that the staff had enough time to tally it. As I ate my rice and beans, two waiters at another table counted every bill. I finished before they did, even though the meal \u2014 and all those millions of c\u00f3rdobas \u2014 added up to less than $10.Hyperinflation is a mercurial phenomenon, a rupture that occurs when a government persistently spends (or prints) money that it doesn\u2019t have, and the public loses confidence in the process. The distortions that emerge \u2014 like the backpack full of soon-to-be-worthless cash \u2014 can seem absurd, even laughable. Yet there is nothing amusing about the damage that hyperinflation can inflict on the lives of people and nations. \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust the money the government issues, then you can\u2019t trust anything,\u201d says Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and a leading expert on hyperinflation (which he has defined as 50 percent monthly inflation sustained for at least 30 days). Hanke has studied the 58 cases of hyperinflation that have been recorded, from Germany\u2019s Weimar Republic to the episode I witnessed in Nicaragua, each one an earthquake that caused people to lose faith in the very foundation \u2014 the value of money \u2014 on which their lives depended.The newest addition to the ignominious list, and a cause for alarm in Washington, is the crisis in Venezuela. Even with the world\u2019s most-abundant oil fields, Venezuela has mismanaged its way to economic disaster. Hyperinflation and its common companion, chronic shortages of food and medicine, have impoverished almost all of the country\u2019s 31 million people. Nine out of 10 Venezuelans do not earn enough money to buy sufficient food, according to a recent survey. Over all, Venezuelans have lost an average of 24 pounds each. Malaria is on the rise, as is crime. Those who can are getting out: More than 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, including more than half of the nation\u2019s doctors.The situation is still out of control. Venezuela\u2019s economy shrank by 35 percent between 2013 and 2017, and economists forecast another 18 percent drop in 2018. Oil production, crippled by the lack of maintenance and investment, fell in July to its lowest point in nearly seven decades. According to Hanke, the rate of inflation over the last 12 months was 52,000 percent. The chaos poses a risk for the entire region. \u201cVenezuela has sparked the most serious economic, humanitarian and political crisis in the Americas in decades,\u201d says the Brazilian economist Monica de Bolle, the director of Latin American studies at the Johns Hopkins University School for Advanced International Studies. \u201cThere has never been a crisis quite like this in the region, and we\u2019ve had plenty.\u201dLenin\u2019s dark musings seemed almost prophetic in the jittery aftermath of World War I. Weimar Germany had gambled, badly, in financing its losing war effort with borrowed funds. Buried in debt and forced, in 1921, to pay reparations to the victorious Allies, Germany printed bank notes and ignited the most infamous bout of hyperinflation. By late 1923, prices were doubling roughly every three and a half days, and at one point a single American dollar was worth 6.7 trillion German marks. An even more severe hyperinflation followed the end of World War II, when Hungary printed notes of ever-higher value to finance its recovery. The fastest-ever recorded hyperinflation resulted: At its peak in July 1946, prices doubled every 15 hours.War has often played a catalytic role in hyperinflation, but it rarely acts alone. In the early 1990s, the phenomenon stalked countries in Eastern Europe (Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Armenia) that were confronting wars and the fall of the Soviet Union. A decade later in Zimbabwe, despite a long slide in agricultural output, Robert Mugabe\u2019s regime printed money to pay the bloated bureaucracy and to line its own pockets. By the time Mugabe declared inflation illegal in 2007, people had lost belief in their currency. Within a year, inflation shot up to 79.6 billion percent, so high that even the government\u2019s $100 trillion bills became useless souvenirs soon after they were printed.Hyperinflation is not, as some might assume, just inflation gone bad. It\u2019s a different beast altogether, driven by politics and psychology as much as economics. A government\u2019s decision to continue spending (or printing money) far beyond its means is political, whether done to finance war, win an election or assuage its populace. Such monetary incontinence, unchecked, leads to a spiral of food shortages, price hikes and currency devaluations. Those hit hardest are not the rich (whose wealth is in property, stocks and commodities) but the middle class, which depends on local-currency salaries, savings and pensions whose value is siphoned off by hyperinflation.Venezuela now finds itself isolated, like a virus contained. In 1990, three South American countries \u2014 Peru, Argentina and Brazil \u2014 were in the throes of hyperinflation. Venezuela\u2019s case doesn\u2019t look contagious, but it could still have destabilizing impacts on the region. The millions of refugees flooding into neighboring countries are already sparking a backlash. In Brazil, where army troops have been deployed to control the border, the presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro has used the Venezuelan migrants to fuel his Trump-like anti-immigrant campaign \u2014 and warn against leftist populism.Maduro has made only halfhearted efforts at reform. In August, he lopped five zeros off the bol\u00edvar and introduced a new currency tied to the \u201cpetro\u201d cryptocurrency. The move has had no impact, in part because the petro isn\u2019t traded. But there has been one unexpected result: As people turn to credit cards or bank transfers for even small transactions, Venezuela has accidentally become a nearly cashless society.Normally, a country facing insolvency would turn to the I.M.F. for a bailout. But Venezuela broke off relations with the I.M.F. in 2007 and has turned to China instead. For the past decade, China has kept Maduro\u2019s bankrupt regime afloat with more than $50 billion in loans. In September, Maduro traveled to Beijing and received several billion dollars more of credit to boost oil production and double oil exports to China. \u201cWe are taking the first steps into a new economic era,\u201d he said.A new era isn\u2019t likely to begin as long as Maduro remains in power. He has shown no interest in taking steps that might restore economic balance, like cutting spending and tying the bol\u00edvar to a solid foreign currency. Washington murmurs about regime change. But the biggest threat to Maduro now may be a series of civil cases in American courts against Citgo. The Venezuela-owned company is the regime\u2019s biggest generator of hard currency, the only asset creditors can go after. If these cases succeed in claiming damages for being nationalized by the Ch\u00e1vez regime, Maduro\u2019s main lifeline could be cut off. \u201cIf the money disappears,\u201d de Bolle says, \u201cso does his support, and the regime crumbles.\u201d Only then, it seems, will Venezuelans be able to escape a nightmare in which they can\u2019t trust the money in their hands.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Three New York City Ballot Proposals, One Worth Supporting", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLowering campaign contribution limits could blunt the impact of large donations.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Though these are good goals, some of the proposals are flawed.Ballot Proposal 1: YesThe first proposal would lower limits for contributions to candidates who participate in the campaign finance system, while increasing the funding match given for candidates in the program. Its goal is to boost the impact of smaller donations, to pave the way for more competition in the city\u2019s elections. The contribution limit for citywide candidates would be lowered to $2,000 from $5,100. Matching funds would increase under the proposal, to an 8-1 match from a 6-1 match now.Combined, these changes would be likely to help blunt the impact of large donations, and encourage more candidates to run for office.The new rules wouldn\u2019t become binding until 2022. Some critics of the proposal have said making the new rules optional for candidates running in the city\u2019s 2021 elections \u2014 in which voters will choose a new mayor and a plethora of new City Council members \u2014 is a reason to vote against the initiative. This conclusion seems shortsighted, given the potential long-term benefits for the city.Ballot Proposal 2: NoSome of the initiatives the commission would be tasked with overseeing are worthy, such as expanding translation services at poll sites. But it would be wiser to implement them through legislation in the City Council or existing city agencies instead. That would preserve the powers of the Council and prevent the addition of unnecessary bureaucracy, better serving New Yorkers. Ballot Proposal 3: No Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As U.S. Sanctions on Iran Kick In, Europe Looks for a Workaround", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Europeans consider the 2015 Iran nuclear deal crucial to their national interests, and say they intend to keep honoring it. But to date, they have not managed to put in place a mechanism for sidestepping the sanctions without antagonizing the Trump administration.European Union members including Britain, France and Germany have said they will continue to abide by the nuclear deal, as have China and Russia. They are trying to keep Iran in compliance, too, by countering the American economic sanctions.So far, however, no European country has agreed to host the vehicle, for fear of American retaliation.\u201cWe remain committed to implementing\u201d the nuclear deal \u201cas a matter of respecting international agreements and of our shared international security, and expect Iran to play a constructive role in this regard,\u201d the statement said.Realistically, European officials say, they may be able to preserve only 20 percent to 30 percent of existing trade with Iran, given that large European companies with ties to the United States have already pulled out of Iran or are in the process of doing so to avoid the sanctions. Stefano Stefanini, a consultant and former Italian diplomat based in Brussels, said that the European officials think 40 percent would be optimistic.Of all the issues between Europe and the Trump administration, Iran has become the most divisive. The Europeans are actively working against United States policy, which effectively puts them in league with Russia, China and Iran.\u201cIt is a huge strain in the trans-Atlantic relationship,\u201d Mr. Stefanini said.If the Europeans manage to create \u201ca small breach in the hold that the U.S. has on international financial transactions, that could be replicated,\u201d he said. And if they fail, he said, \u201cit will be another big grievance with Washington, creating another minefield.\u201dSo far, European unity is holding, but there are worries among some European officials that Britain may not remain so firm in the face of a Washington that wants to give little quarter to Iran.Russia, which has less exposure to American sanctions and is allied with Iran in Syria, has said that it will continue to buy and trade oil and gas from Iran \u2014 much of which they then sell to other countries.And Washington has also granted waivers to eight countries, including Turkey and China, to continue to buy Iranian energy, but only, Washington says, to keep the oil market stable. Those waivers are not permanent.Iran has been willing to remain in the agreement and has promoted European support for it at home, despite the increasing economic pain of the sanctions.\u201cIran will have patience for another five or six months, but the streets matter,\u201d said Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations, referring to Iranian public opinion and public demonstrations.At the same time, the assassination attempts in Denmark and France \u201cwon\u2019t mean that the Europeans will pull the plug on the deal,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it definitely dampens the attitude to go farther on economic easing.\u201dMs. O recently returned from Iran and said the mood there was defiant and wary. \u201cThere is a general sense of despair among interlocutors,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s more and more difficult for them to support engagement with the West.\u201dMr. Trump has said that his main aim is to force Iranian leaders into negotiations that would include restrictions on their missiles and their support for regional allies. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the sanctions are meant to make Iran choose: \u201cEither fight to keep its economy off life support at home or keep squandering precious wealth on fights abroad. It won\u2019t have the resources to do both.\u201dSpeaking on Fox News on Sunday, Mr. Pompeo said that Mr. Trump was \u201cputting the world on notice that the terror regime which threatens Israel through Iranian funding of Lebanese Hezbollah, that the terror regime that attempted to conduct an assassination in Denmark over that past few weeks, that the terror regime that continues to fund Houthis launching missiles into Riyadh and into Dubai, that\u2019s going to stop.\u201d\u201cThat behavior must change,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, \u201cand sanctions of the United States will be reimposed at midnight tonight.\u201d\u201cThe extent to which the Islamic republic feels threatened or senses opportunity in its neighborhood largely defines its conduct,\u201d the report said. \u201cMeasured against that standard, the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policy is likelier to spur Iran\u2019s regional activism than to curb it.\u201dIn the meantime, European and Iranian officials are watching the midterm elections in the United States, as is the rest of the world, and trying to gauge how likely Mr. Trump is to be re-elected in two years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Everyone Wants to \u2018Influence\u2019 You", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsThere are two contradictory truisms about people under the influence of alcohol. One is that, intoxicated, they become their real selves: mean or weepy, loving or angry, violent or desperate. (According to the Roman historian Tacitus, ancient Germanic tribes would hold wartime negotiations drunk, reasoning that it made all parties incapable of hiding anything.) But the other thing we like to say about drunks \u2014 often while shepherding someone apologetically out of a party or a bar \u2014 is that \u201che\u2019s not himself\u201d or \u201cthis isn\u2019t like her.\u201dSo which is it: Are we always ourselves, or are our selves tenuous, warped by company and context? \u201cInfluence\u201d suggests some alchemy between the two \u2014 between an internal self and an outside pressure \u2014 and makes no claims about which is stronger. Power is overtly coercive, but influence is wily: It can slip into your consciousness without your noticing and start renovating.Last year, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which coordinates findings from across multiple agencies, concluded that Vladimir Putin had ordered an \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d to swing the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. Bots and sock puppets \u2014 Russian operatives pretending to be ordinary Americans \u2014 spread disinformation and prejudice online, while Russian intelligence agents harvested emails from D.N.C. networks to fuel embarrassing news stories before the election. Playing on racism, sexism and partisan resentment, the campaign \u2014 which domestic intelligence says is ongoing \u2014 raises the same questions we ask about intoxication: Did it merely bring forth what was already present, or did it make those attitudes worse, leading some of us to behave (and vote) in ways we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have?Americans are, at the moment, preoccupied with Russia\u2019s capacity to manipulate us; a poll last year showed 63 percent of Democrats and 38 percent of Republicans saw \u201cRussia\u2019s power and influence\u201d as a significant threat to the United States. But Russia is just one influence in a whole ecosystem of modern pressures: lobbyists, drugs, Facebook, covert agents, dark money, foreign agendas, dupes and double agents, fake news, bribes, threats. In the midst of all these contradictory influences, the world of politics can seem illegible, a chaotic mass of swirling powers. \u201cThere\u2019s a war on for your mind!\u201d as the slogan for the conspiracy website Infowars says. So how are we supposed to know what we think?Along with this belief came a certain anxiety about its spiritual implications. The medieval Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas accepted that the planets and stars could affect our physical bodies, but he rejected the idea that they could control our minds, which would mean the end of free will. C.S. Lewis summed up medieval attitudes in his 1964 book \u201cThe Discarded Image\u201d: The belief, he wrote, was that influence \u201cgenerates, not a necessity, but only a propensity, to act thus or thus.\u201d And this propensity could be resisted: \u201cThe wise man will over-rule the stars. But more often it will not be resisted, for most men are not wise.\u201dOver time, as astrology was discarded as junk science, influence gradually became the work not of celestial bodies but of governments and advertisers. Propaganda became easier with the printing press; influence became a bona fide business with the rise of behavioral marketing. Lewis complained that this 20th-century use of \u201cinfluence\u201d had a \u201cwithered senility\u201d in comparison to its powerful original meaning. But that astrological sense of influence as a malign, opaque and distant force \u2014 something that tempts us against our characters or better wisdom \u2014 still lingers in the way people talk about the dark orbits of global power and wealth. Just as kings were once thought to rise and fall by the power of the heavens, we now wonder which influence broker might have been responsible for a president\u2019s election: the Russians or the Mercers?For much of the 20th century, America\u2019s dark planet was the Soviet Union. The Soviet brain, said the director of central intelligence Allen Dulles in a 1953 speech, is \u201ca phonograph playing a disc put on its spindle by an outside genius over which it has no control.\u201d Soviet brainwashing, he said, might come through indoctrination or some kind of \u201clie serum,\u201d but whatever it was, it was \u201cabhorrent.\u201d (Never mind that, the same year, Dulles started a program to conduct secret mind-control experiments on unsuspecting Americans and Canadians.) At least, he said, the Soviets didn\u2019t have the manpower to do it on a grand scale.But the internet now means influence can come from anyone, anywhere; it can be visible or invisible, paid for by any power, approaching you any of myriad ways. Influence used to be understood as a top-down phenomenon, with governments, advertisers, donors or other powerful figures holding sway over the masses. These days we understand that the most powerful influences aren\u2019t the distant ones but the most immediate and social \u2014 so the powerful tend to exert their influence by pretending to be ordinary people. Marketers, for instance, work harder and harder to obscure the distinction between ads and real life. The last decade featured the rise of the professional \u201cinfluencer\u201d \u2014 someone paid to use their personal magnetism to promote specific agendas online. Instead of the top-down influence of a commercial or a billboard, these ads are embedded, shared by someone who seems, on some aspirational level, like a peer. The companies paying teenagers to hawk diet tea on Instagram are using the same tactics the Chinese government did when it recruited commenters to post hundreds of millions of pro-Communist Party messages online.The power of these campaigns still comes, of course, from the top down: The forces behind them are merely pretending to speak for the public. It\u2019s an act made feasible mostly by social media, where communication can be aimed, quietly and privately, at carefully selected subjects. When Cambridge Analytica, the political-consulting firm tied to Stephen K. Bannon and funded by conservative donors, wanted to maximize its impact on the 2016 election, it exploited social media data to target users with a precision impossible to Cold War brain warriors. \u201cWe just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape,\u201d said Mark Turnbull, a former Cambridge Analytica executive, in a secretly taped recording. \u201cAnd so this stuff infiltrates the online community and expands, but with no branding, so it\u2019s unattributable, untrackable.\u201dWhat\u2019s unclear is how effective any of these campaigns actually are. Russian disinformation reached 126 million people on Facebook, but were any of them really swayed? One recent book \u2014 \u201cNetwork Propaganda,\u201d by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts \u2014 uses data to show convincingly that most of the disinformation circulating during the 2016 campaign was actually spread by the good old-fashioned right-wing American media: Breitbart and Fox News. Why should Russia seem more ominous than Sean Hannity? It might have to do with the sheer obviousness of our domestic pundits; Hannity, for instance, is so explicit about his biases that he recently participated in a Trump campaign event. It\u2019s the invisible influence that\u2019s more unnerving, even when its effectiveness is still in question. Turnbull\u2019s analogy is a telling one: Influence, as its liquid origins suggest, seeps and saturates, intoxicates and inspires. The remote control, at least, gives us the illusion of choice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuban Doctors Accuse International Agency of Profiting From Their Work", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a member of Cuba\u2019s international medical mission, Dr. Ramona Matos Rodr\u00edguez received $400 a month while posted in Brazil, a small fortune in her home country.It was not long before she figured out that physicians from other countries also working in Brazil\u2019s \u201cMore Doctors\u201d program were taking home 20 times as much. Even the Pan American Health Organization, an international agency affiliated with the United Nations that brokered the arrangement, received a percentage for the doctors\u2019 work.\u201cWe realized that they fooled us Cuban doctors,\u201d said Dr. Matos, 56, who now lives in Miami. \u201cThey tricked us.\u201dPAHO, a division of the World Health Organization, made about $75 million off the work of up to 10,000 Cuban doctors who earned substandard wages in Brazil, according to the allegations in a lawsuit filed on Friday in the United States District Court in Miami.Dr. Matos and three other doctors who defected from Cuba\u2019s contentious medical diplomacy program in Brazil accuse PAHO in the lawsuit of aiding in human trafficking.The suit is the first against an international agency over compensation from Cuba\u2019s medical mission. Cuba sends tens of thousands of doctors to countries around the world in what it bills as humanitarian missions. Its economically struggling government is paid for the services, sharing only a small fraction with the doctors who perform the work.Brazil is the only country in which a United Nations-affiliated agency plays a key role in Cuba\u2019s mission.Although novel, the suit faces an uphill battle: International organizations like the World Health Organization have broad immunity from civil actions. Attempts to hold the United Nations liable for bringing cholera to Haiti, which killed thousands of people, have been rebuffed by courts in the United States.The Cuban doctors are not allowed to hold onto their passports, go out for a night on the town or live with their children, the doctors have said. A state security agent keeps a close eye on their activities.More than half of their small salaries are held for them in a bank in Cuba, and is forfeited if the doctors defect.At least 7,000 of them did so under a Bush administration program that gave the Cuban doctors working abroad residency in the United States.President Obama ended the residency program in one of his last acts as president. With that escape valve cut off, hundreds of Cuban medical professionals have begun to sue in Brazilian courts.After Brazil\u2019s president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, criticized the program as modern-day slavery, the Cuban government last week began to repatriate hundreds of its doctors. Cuba has defended the program, noting that the doctors\u2019 education was free, and they are paid more than they would get if they stayed home.In a statement, a spokesman for PAHO, Lu\u00eds Felipe Sardenberg, said the agency\u2019s role did not involve \u201ccontractual arrangements with individual physicians.\u201d He said the doctors had benefited by \u201cimproving their skills by participating in specialization courses and learning, research and extension activities.\u201dSam Dubbin, a Miami lawyer representing the doctors, argued that PAHO had acted too far outside its mission in administering the medical program. Immunity for organizations like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund applies only for work done within the scope of an international agency\u2019s mission, he said.Last month, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in a case against another international agency over the immunity issue. That case stems from fishermen in India who sought damages from the International Finance Corporation, which financed a dam that did not comply with local laws.Brian Concannon, a human rights lawyer at the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti, said similar arguments failed when his organization sought restitution for cholera victims in Haiti.\u201cMy guess is that the court is not even going to listen to that,\u201d he said.James F. Haggerty, who is handling another case against the United Nations over the cholera outbreak, said the lawsuits will eventually lead to reforms.\u201cThe immunity of the U.N. and its agencies leads to all sorts of negligent or even criminal behavior since, without the fear of liability, shortcuts are taken, mistakes made, and the innocent suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cBit by bit, piece by piece, lawsuits attacking U.N. immunity will eventually lead to reform \u2014 putting an end to the kind of damage that results from reckless acts driven by a belief that there will never be consequences.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Widows Are Faring Better Financially. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlthough they became widows 20 years apart and at opposite end of the age spectrum, Kayla Murdoch and Mary Thomas are strikingly similar in their approaches to their financial lives.Ms. Murdoch of Manchester, N.H., is a 28-year-old paramedic whose husband died suddenly in 2016.Ms. Thomas of Cincinnati is a retired schoolteacher in her 80s who lost her husband in 1996.Both managed to steer quickly past the familiar story of the widow left financially vulnerable when her husband dies, though, by setting their intentions on not only staying afloat independently, but also prospering.And now, the number of widows like them appears to be on the rise.Alice Zulkarnain, one of three researchers behind the center\u2019s study, said the financial climb was rooted in advances in women\u2019s work histories and education levels.But widows still have a way to go before they catch up to women whose spouses are still alive, only 2.6 percent of whom are poor, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s figures.Kathleen M. Rehl, a financial adviser who travels the country offering money workshops to the demographic she refers to as \u201cthe sisterhood,\u201d said attitudes like Ms. Murdoch\u2019s and Ms. Thomas\u2019s may be helping.\u201cWidows are becoming more confident financially,\u201d said Dr. Rehl, 71, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes training fellow advisers to work with widows. Her interest in widows is personal: She became one 12 years ago. \u201cEven though I had my own business, I felt like a bag lady,\u201d she said.Among her goals is to encourage gains in financial literacy through helping advisers understand widowhood\u2019s side effects. \u201cYou get Jell-O brain,\u201d she said. \u201cIt affects you cognitively. You need to work with someone who knows how to talk to you.\u201dAs Ms. Murdoch and Ms. Thomas found, though, options for avoiding the feeling of helplessness are not limited to holding the hand of a sensitive, expensive financial adviser.Local investment clubs are a third.Eve Lewis, a 64-year-old widow in Milford, Ohio, needed no convincing to join a nearby nine-woman investment club just after she lost her husband to cancer in 2008.She had nurtured a flair for finance throughout her 25-year marriage. \u201cI would tell my husband about all the different stocks I was interested in, and he would listen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was really my interest.\u201dTeaming up with other like-minded women nearby helped her further her investment skills.\u201cI figured, I have more time now, I\u2019d better join a club,\u201d she said.The experience has paid dividends beyond the $50 each throws in at every gathering.\u201cWe meet once a month to discuss our portfolio, and everybody has a stock they study, so we have brief reports,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the things we try to avoid is having too many stocks and too little invested in each.\u201d\u201cBecause the market is up, we\u2019re doing well,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. But as with the famous Beardstown Ladies, a group of mostly widowed women in Illinois who started an investment club in the 1980s and went on to inspire women across the country with folksy books about smart investing, the goal isn\u2019t just making money.So it is with Ms Lewis\u2019s group. \u201cA lot of people think they can\u2019t do this, that investing is too complicated,\u201d said Ms. Lewis, whose goal is to maintain what she called her middle-class lifestyle through her investments. \u201cBut if you join an investment club, you can learn for as little as $20 a month.\u201dMs. Thomas credits her family\u2019s multigenerational financial know-how for what she learned at a similar group. Just after her husband died in 1996, a friend from church suggested that she take a class in personal finance at a local university or join an investment club. She decided to join a club.\u201cThe president was a taskmaster. I had to learn fast,\u201d she said. Her willingness to study eventually led to what she called better than average financial gains, and she is now financially secure through investing.When the group disbanded in the mid-2000s, Ms. Thomas wasn\u2019t finished sharing her self-made stock-picking skills. She started a new club. But instead of recruiting acquaintances, she enlisted her four grandchildren, now 22 to 35. Five years ago, they paid for a family cruise to Alaska with club earnings.\u201cThat\u2019s when we really appreciated it,\u201d she said.Ms. Zulkarnain said the average age of widows in 2014, the year on which she and her colleagues based their study, was 67.\u201cIt\u2019s a very accessible education in investment,\u201d she said.Her goal is to retire in her late 30s through a combination of investments and working overtime. \u201cSo far, everything I\u2019ve learned through websites has worked,\u201d she said.She credits a simple strategy \u2014 one recommended by lots of investment advisers. \u201cI invest in funds, instead of individual stocks, which means less risk.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing complicated and nothing intimidating about it.\u201dPat Steele Nielsen, 60, of Portland, Ore., also was equipped to handle herself financially when both of her husbands died.\u201cI had always taken care of the bills,\u201d she said. But when her second husband died last year, the financial terrain was more difficult to navigate than when her first husband died in 1997.\u201cWe had a lot more assets, pension accounts and other accounts that had to be dealt with,\u201d she said.\u201cWild Money,\u201d one such course, \u201cmade me face reality in terms of how I\u2019m going to live,\u201d Ms. Steele Nielsen said. \u201cIt made me look at my priorities, like do I want to travel, or do I want to move, in conjunction with what my income is going to be.\u201dDespite what may be an upswing in widows\u2019 actively lifting themselves out of financial straits, Ms. Hounsell said most were still struggling. \u201cThe ones we see don\u2019t want to be doing investments or anything like that,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of them are in bad shape.\u201dBarbara Shapiro, a financial adviser in Dedham, Mass., who started attracting a local following among widows after she became one herself two years ago, is familiar with that type. But she is hopeful.\u201cMany of the women I see abdicated their financial responsibilities during their marriage and they\u2019re really at a loss,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make mistakes. But are they helpless little old ladies? No. They\u2019re asking questions. They want to learn.\u201d\u25a0 Don\u2019t rush. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018Must I decide today, or can it wait until I\u2019m thinking more clearly?\u2019\u201d Dr. Rehl said. \u201cFor example, pay monthly bills, but delay investing life insurance money. Don\u2019t make hasty decisions about your house.\u201d\u25a0 Beware of financial predators. Often, unscrupulous types to try to sell financial products and services to the recently bereaved. Be wary.\u25a0 Take stock. Those emerging from early grief should analyze what they own versus what they owe. \u201cCompare income and expenses, and include bank accounts, savings, retirement plans, other investments and your house. Debts include credit cards, education, car and mortgage loans. Are changes needed now that you\u2019re single?\u201d\u25a0 Don\u2019t be a purse. \u201cFamily members and others may ask for money. Explain you\u2019re still figuring out new goals.\u201d\u25a0 Consider working with a financial planner to build confidence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cindy Hyde-Smith Is Teaching Us What Segregation Academies Taught Her ", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe campaign gaffes of Mississippi\u2019s newly elected senator reveal the way that the past is always present.Dr. Rooks writes about education, American history and African-American culture. On Tuesday, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith won a hard-fought runoff election over her Democratic opponent, Mike Espy. That Mississippi is sending a Republican back to Washington is hardly a surprise, but Ms. Hyde-Smith gave the opposition hope in the closing weeks of the campaign as she careened from one gaffe to the next \u2014 each one emphasizing both that she was tone deaf and that she found humor in her state\u2019s history of racial violence and voter suppression.Barely a week later, the candidate again found herself facing a round of questioning when during a visit to Mississippi State University she remarked that laws that make it just a little more difficult for some college students to vote are great because \u201cthey remind me that there\u2019s a lot of liberal folks in those other schools who maybe we don\u2019t want to vote. Maybe we want to make it just a little more difficult. And I think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d That was a joke too, she said. But who exactly is laughing with her?Racist violence, segregation and voter suppression are not shared historical jokes. They are our present. Unless we change course, they will define our future. Ms. Hyde-Smith claims not to have realized there was anything wrong with what she said. She has steadfastly refused to apologize. Perhaps most important, since her comments came to light, she has yet to publicly engage in conversation with constituents of hers for whom hanging is not a joke and voting is a hard-fought, continually challenged right. During the campaign, she did not acknowledge there was even a dialogue worth having. Perhaps this is because for much of her life she has been hearing only one side of an argument and doesn\u2019t know or care that there is a larger conversation to be had. If this is the case, it may have something to do with where Ms. Hyde-Smith went to school and where she chose to send her daughter to school.The most notable thing about the South\u2019s segregation academies isn\u2019t that they were racially segregated. Racially and economically segregated schools remain across all parts of the United States. What is notable is that taxpayer dollars financed these all-white schools at the cost of simultaneously creating poorly funded all-black public-school systems in the South. To put it simply, as the financial drain of taxpayer dollars from whites attending segregation academies decimated school systems educating black children, black communities, students and teachers paid a terribly high price to ensure that whites were educated with other whites.Unsurprisingly, then, when schools in Mississippi were finally forced to integrate, the black children who did so often faced violence at the hands of their white classmates. That is part of the educational history of the defeated Democratic candidate in the race for the Senate in Mississippi, Mike Espy, who integrated Yazoo City High School in 1969. \u201cSo, that\u2019s a Mississippi I want to be a part of \u2014 one of diversity, one of inclusion, one of different experiences,\u201d he added. \u201cI decided to use that very difficult time to learn from and try to reach out to people of all races. So, if you compare me and that experience to Cindy Hyde and her experience, I\u2019d rather have my experience.\u201dMr. Espy knows that racist violence is no joking matter. We know that his opponent cannot say the same.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alas, the Blockchain Won\u2019t Save Journalism After All", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHype around the technology has led to incomprehensible applications of it.Civil Media Company was introduced earlier this year as both a media platform and a network, to be owned and operated by journalists and concerned citizens in tandem. It was an exciting proposal. Its technology (powered by the blockchain!) would churn under dozens of independent newsrooms, its machinery creating a new, utopian model, free from the clutches of miserly businessmen or politically compromised publishers threatening to gum up the works.Civil\u2019s representatives said they could help fix two crises that afflict the media: one of trust and another of financial sustainability. Both, they posited, were within the power of the blockchain to heal.\u201cDo we think that by launching Civil, somebody that thinks that the press is the enemy of the people, are those people suddenly going to go, \u2018Oh, I see the light\u2019? Of course not,\u201d Ms. Schiller said before the token sale began. \u201cBut here\u2019s what we can do: If Civil is successful, it will allow people who are interested in trustworthy journalism, it will be a signal to them for what news organizations meet the criteria.\u201dSo it would be like Facebook, but journalism, but on the blockchain?\u201cAll cryptoeconomic public blockchains are effectively social applications,\u201d Mr. Iles said. \u201cYou need a crowd of people to agree to run it.\u201dWait. What?People who are in a strong position to understand what Civil is doing \u2014 either because they are experts on blockchain technology or because they work for one of its newsrooms \u2014 have openly admitted that they don\u2019t understand how the organization works. The rate of such statements only increased as Civil\u2019s token sale got underway in September.The collective confusion might have something to do with how the Civil token (called a CVL) is meant to work. In essence, that means: Buying CVL isn\u2019t meant to make you money.Or, as Mr. Iles put it: \u201cWe even think that we are going to be able to show people that it\u2019s more fun, it\u2019s more rewarding, to pay for the news using CVL tokens as opposed to cash.\u201d\u201cLook, we sometimes get asked, are we too early?\u201d Mr. Iles said. \u201cAnd the answer is absolutely yes. But you only are ever going to be too early or too late.\u201dCatherine Tucker, an MIT economist who has paid close attention to the rise of blockchain, said that she thought Civil had a targeting issue.\u201cIt is fundamentally a locked box,\u201d he said. \u201cThe token\u2019s not worth anything. The simple fact is, the token isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d\u201cTo me this is a big so what, frankly,\u201d he said of the sale\u2019s then-imminent failure. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve potentially set a price that was higher than the market was willing to bear right now is not a referendum on whether or not we\u2019re ever going to reach critical mass. It just means we potentially overshot now.\u201dIt is still unclear how Civil plans to alleviate people\u2019s confusion in order to achieve its mission. But the company is retrenching, thanks to an additional $3.5 million in funding from its original investor, the blockchain software company ConsenSys. (Civil will also offer refunds to frustrated individuals who want to return their tokens.) A new token sale is in the works, though details have not yet been released.Still, a problem remains: People don\u2019t buy into blockchain applications unless they can make money.

{"Headline": "Voting in New York and New Jersey? Let Us Help ", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York Times endorsements for the 2018 midterm elections.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Elections on Tuesday will be the most sharply contested and consequential midterms in years. New York and Connecticut will also select governors and other state officials.Here are the races in which the Times editorial board made endorsements.When focused, Gov. Andrew Cuomo can be a nearly unstoppable force for progress. After two terms in office, his list of accomplishments is substantial \u2014 stricter gun safety regulations, a statewide pre-K program, a higher minimum wage and paid family leave.Ms. James, a Democrat, has had a lengthy record of defending New Yorkers from special interests, as an attorney for the Legal Aid Society, as chief of the state attorney general\u2019s Brooklyn office and as a City Council member, before her election as New York City\u2019s public advocate in 2013. Mr. Malinowski, a former Washington director for Human Rights Watch and assistant secretary of state for President Barack Obama, is running against the incumbent Republican, Leonard Lance. For decades, in and out of government, Mr. Malinowski has fought against torture and lobbied for protections for women, L.G.B.T.Q. people and vulnerable minorities around the world. The contribution limit for citywide candidates in the city\u2019s campaign finance system would be lowered to $2,000 from $5,100. Matching funds would increase under the proposal, to an 8-1 match from a 6-1 match now. Its goal is to boost the impact of smaller donations, to pave the way for more competition in the city\u2019s elections. Some measures proposed for this panel controlled by the mayor, particularly on budgeting, could tread on the authority of the City Council. In a city with ample mayoral influence already, it is best that the powers afforded to the Council be carefully guarded.This could weaken community boards by stripping them of their most seasoned members.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mad Dash to Find a Cybersecurity Force", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt would certainly cause mass destruction if our power grid went down or our water pumps started going haywire or our dams decided to open all their sluices,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually something that could happen.\u201dIn response to the sheer number of new digital gates that might be left open, employers and educators have had to become more creative in finding people to guard them.They need penetration testers to simulate attacks to find and fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a real attacker.They need malware analysts to find out what malicious programs do so they can protect from the attacks.They need security researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in applications and other products \u2014 before the thieves do \u2014 so they can be fixed. They need security architects to make sure all the best practices are being followed.According to the chief economist for LinkedIn, Guy Berger, there was a shortage as of September of 11,000 people with cybersecurity skills in the San Francisco Bay Area, 5,000 in New York and almost 4,000 in Seattle, the areas with the largest concentration of need. LinkedIn regularly issues work-force reports based on its analysis of jobs data in the United States.The competition, which began in 2005, is held at colleges across the country and designed to test student teams\u2019 abilities to detect and respond to outside threats and to protect services such as mail servers and web servers. The sponsors include high-tech companies like the defense contractor Raytheon and IBM, but also retailers like Walmart and transportation companies like Uber.Recalling the difference between theoretical learning in college and hands-on experience, Ms. Weidman said she could do a lot of math about computer networking, \u201cbut could I actually manage a network at a company? Absolutely not.\u201dThe people who were in community colleges would \u201cwipe the floor with those of us at universities, because community colleges really were focused on how to do these things,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that people at the university level are starting to realize that we need more hands-on skills in cybersecurity, as well as just the theory.\u201dStudents in cybersecurity get a 75 percent discount, so the master\u2019s degree costs about $15,000, compared with about $60,000 for the traditional on-campus program. The online program enrolled 125 students in September and hopes to have 1,000 students annually within three or four years.\u201cNationally, we graduate twice the number of psychology majors as opposed to engineers,\u201d said Nasir Memon, professor and associate dean for online learning at the N.Y.U. Tandon School of Engineering. \u201cWe graduate as many park rangers as compared to computer scientists.\u201dStudents frequently graduate in fields that lack opportunity for long-term careers, he said. If they want to switch to computer science in traditional programs, they can face daunting barriers, like multiple semesters of catch-up courses and a requirement to take the Graduate Record Examination.\u201cSo one of the things we did is start a bridge program, where we say, we don\u2019t care what you did in your undergrad; you could have done physics, anthropology, anything, just come on in,\u201d Professor Memon said.The welcome the school extends is in the form of an intense, four-month online program of computer science courses with a price of $1,500. If students pass, they are eligible for the full program.Shamla Naidoo, global chief information security officer for IBM, has had success reaching out to mothers returning to work, as well as to veterans, to find potential cybersecurity workers.\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this for the last few years,\u201d Ms. Naidoo said. \u201cThe first year, I spent a lot of time worrying about it. After that I thought, there\u2019s no point in worrying about it, I\u2019m going to have to go act, and I\u2019m going to have to act in a nontraditional way. Posting a job description and hoping people are going to show up and apply to the job wasn\u2019t working because the people just didn\u2019t exist. So rather than trying to hire the skills and knowing they\u2019re not as easily available, let\u2019s create the skills internally.\u201dShe created a system open to hiring people who have little or no experience, and, in many cases, even skills, in cybersecurity, with the understanding that they will come in, join a more experienced team and learn on the job. They are formed into teams of five to seven people solving one problem at a time, with the new employees teaming with more experienced security experts to watch.Many skills from other industries are transferable to the cybersecurity field. Cybersecurity experts need to be able to communicate policies to, as Ms. Naidoo put it, \u201cincrease the cybersecurity I.Q.\u201d of an entire organization. For example, people from a finance background might be able to educate their co-workers in accounting about cyberrisk.She\u2019s grown her team by about 25 percent over the last year with developers, consultants and research professionals. She said being more flexible in hiring, and hiring outside of the normal pipeline, had evened out some of the inequities in the field \u2014 like a relative dearth of minorities and women.\u201cTo solve the skills shortage, we have to hire people who have the right aptitude, who have the right attitude, people who are curious, are willing to learn,\u201d Ms. Naidoo said. \u201cOutside of that, I have very few other criteria. I\u2019m opening the aperture for where we look. I\u2019m trying to hire in nontraditional places, nontraditional groups of people, and so I don\u2019t expect them to have the skills or the experience that we need. I will hire people wherever I can find them.\u201dMichael Doran, 38, was a police officer in St. Louis for almost 10 years before going into cybersecurity.\u201cI quickly found out a lot of the older detectives were not doing a lot of the computer crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw my opening there to make a niche for myself.\u201dHe went to the cybercrimes unit as a forensic digital examiner within the St. Louis police department\u2019s cybercrime unit. But it didn\u2019t take long for the private industry to scoop him up.\u201cIt was an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse,\u201d he said, speaking of more than doubling his salary to near six figures. \u201cI took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\u201dMore C-suite executives are filling their own skills gaps when it comes to cybersecurity, said Eric Rosenbach, co-director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School and former chief of staff at the Defense Department.He runs an online class for working, senior-level executives \u201cwho are only now seeing how seriously they need to take it because they\u2019ve seen so many other C.E.O.s get fired for major breaches,\u201d said Mr. Rosenbach.Offered at least six times a year, the classes educate 300 to 400 people each term. He says executives need to know how to minimize the legal, financial and public relations risks before an attack occurs.Beyond the particular needs of firms in the cybersecurity arena, there is also a skills gap in the larger population that needs to be addressed, Mr. Rosenbach said.\u201cI\u2019m surprised, even at Harvard, how few of the students here know very basic stuff about cyberhygiene, two-factor authentication, things like that, that people should be doing to protect themselves,\u201d he said.\u201cOne thing I don\u2019t think people appreciate as much is that cyber is about human issues, it\u2019s about training people not to do dumb things like click on spear-phishing links, holding people accountable. There\u2019s a lot of human leadership involved in trying to improve cybersecurity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real China Challenge: Managing Its Decline", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThose whom the gods wish to destroy, they first tout as countries of the future.Opinion ColumnistIn 2009, The Economist wrote about an up-and-coming global power: Brazil. Its economy, the magazine suggested, would soon overtake that of France or the U.K. as the world\u2019s fifth largest. S\u00e3o Paulo would be the world\u2019s fifth-richest city. Vast new reserves of offshore oil would provide an added boost, complemented by the country\u2019s robust and sophisticated manufacturing sector.The rocket never reached orbit. Brazil\u2019s economy is now limping its way out of the worst recession in its history. The murder rate \u2014 175 people per day in 2017 \u2014 is at a record high. One former president is in jail, another was impeached. The incoming president is an admirer of the country\u2019s old military dictatorship, only he thinks it should have killed the people it tortured.Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first tout as countries of the future.Why should current clich\u00e9s regarding China\u2019s supposed rise be any different?One answer suggested by The Times\u2019s series is that Beijing has ignored orthodox economic nostrums about the need for ever-greater market liberalization and fewer state controls while still managing to thrive. There\u2019s something to that. Quantity has a quality all its own, goes the saying, and Beijing can supply quantity like no other country save for India.Tyrannies do not work in the long run. But they do know how to make people work in the short term.Maybe that\u2019s because individual rights, democratic choices, rule of law, competitive markets, high levels of transparency, low levels of government corruption, independent news sources, and freedoms of thought, conscience and speech are assets beyond price \u2014ones that Westerners tend to value too lightly while foolishly assuming others do as well. If you define power as the power to attract and not simply compel, then Beijing \u2014 with its dystopian vision to fully surveil and rate all citizens by 2020 \u2014 isn\u2019t a rising power at all. It\u2019s a collapsing one.All this may seem an excessively glum take. What about the skyscrapers of Guangzhou? What about the world-beating test scores of students in Shanghai? What about the hundreds of millions brought out of subsistence living and raised to, or above, the middle class?China\u2019s rise is not some kind of mirage. But what matters is the future, not the past, and whether a nation built on constraining the freedoms granted to ordinary people can outpace, outsmart, and outlast another nation built on defending and broadening those freedoms. On current evidence, that seems utterly doubtful.American policymakers and pundits often talk about the challenge of managing China\u2019s rise. They had better start thinking instead of the challenge of managing its decline, beginning at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires this weekend. Japan and Europe went gently into eclipse, and the Soviet Union surrendered without a fight (at least until its current revanchist phase).Will China\u2019s current leadership accept the possibility of their own decline so philosophically, after having convinced themselves of their rapid rise to primacy? Nobody should bet on it. A wounded tiger is rarely a placid one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Parents Teach Smart Spending With Apps, Not Cash", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJonathan and Erin Kraftchick started out by paying their two children\u2019s allowance the old-fashioned way, using paper money.\u201cI tried the cash thing,\u201d said Mr. Kraftchick, an accountant and financial-literacy advocate in Raleigh, N.C. First, they used glass jars, then switched to a system that involved slipping money for different purposes into separate paper envelopes, for each child.But keeping up with multiple envelopes became unwieldy.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hassle,\u201d Ms. Kraftchick, an artist, said with a laugh.Now, the children \u2014 Reece, 8, and Caris, 7 \u2014 each have a card, which their parents manage using an app on their phones. They have $1 for each year of age, per week, automatically transferred each week to the cards, which the children can use to buy items like snacks at their neighborhood swimming pool. They can also get more money transferred by going above and beyond \u2014 like extra time spent practicing the piano. They can check their balances on an iPad. Ms. Kraftchick said they were even learning to round up prices to include tax.\u201cIt takes the pressure off me,\u201d said Ms. Kraftchick, who typically keeps the cards in her wallet and hands them out when it\u2019s time to make a purchase.The Kraftchicks are part of a growing group of busy parents who are trying out app-controlled debit cards to give their offspring allowance, manage chores and teach them about money. Despite talk of a cashless society, physical cash is still widely preferred for small purchases, according to the Federal Reserve. But children may lose cash, or parents may not have it on hand when it\u2019s time to pay up.\u201cWe got tired of having a drawer full of dollars,\u201d said Brandi Tzonev, a sales manager and personal trainer in Lawrenceville, Ga., who uses goHenry with her 15-year-old son, Alex, and 10-year-old daughter, Gabriella.Some banks have long had accounts aimed at children and teenagers, and many families use prepaid debit cards \u2014 rather than traditional debit cards, linked to a checking account \u2014 as a way to help children manage money. But the newest generation of \u201csmart\u201d debit cards are managed by advanced mobile apps that give parents detailed control over how much the young people spend \u2014 and even where they spend \u2014 with a few taps on a phone.Details vary slightly by card, but in general a parent establishes an account or \u201cwallet,\u201d linked to their traditional checking account. The app draws money from the bank account, and the parent transfers funds electronically to the child\u2019s card. The child can spend only what is available on the card. Parents can set spending limits and restrict where cards can be used.Parents can set up regular transfers of cash as a weekly allowance, or respond to requests for one-time cash approvals on short notice \u2014 if, say, a child is out with friends and needs more money. And children can also save money in F.D.I.C.-insured accounts, held at the traditional banks that issue the debit cards on behalf of the start-ups.The cards charge monthly or annual fees. But they generally do not charge extra fees for loading the card with cash, as some other prepaid debit cards do.The cards are reviving debates about whether it\u2019s best to teach children about money using actual cash and coins, and whether children\u2019s allowances should be tied to completion of household chores. The cards also raise concerns about the potential of plastic to encourage overspending.\u201cParting with actual physical cash is harder,\u201d said Philip Fernbach, assistant professor of marketing at the Center for Research on Consumer Financial Decision Making at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado in Boulder.Still, he said, the new digital tools offer ways to help children learn important financial concepts, like compound interest. Greenlight, for instance, allows parents to pay children a custom \u201cparent\u201d rate \u2014 say, matching each dollar saved with another dollar or two \u2014 to encourage saving, at a time when rates on traditional savings accounts are quite low.Some say that since the use of cash is waning, at least for larger purchases, children need to learn about money in that context. \u201cThat\u2019s the world they\u2019re in,\u201d said J. Michael Collins, faculty director of the Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.If parents find that the apps work well for them, then they should use them, rather than stress that they are \u201cdoing it wrong\u201d when teaching their children about money, said Beth Kobliner, author of \u201cMake Your Kid a Money Genius (Even if You\u2019re Not).\u201d But she worries that automating so much about finances means sacrificing the chance to have important conversations about spending and saving. \u201cI\u2019m a real believer in cash,\u201d she said.Michelle Ibbetson, a middle school teacher in Westminster, Calif., said she saw firsthand that children could be careless about cash. At the end of a week, her classroom is often littered with change that students have left behind.Determined to help her own children be savvy about money, she signed up more than a year ago for an early version of Greenlight. Her children \u2014 Dallin, 10, and Adelle, 12 \u2014 review their balances themselves, on cellphones that they can check out from their parents periodically. \u201cEvery Monday, they get a deposit if they did their chores the week before,\u201d she said.If their list of chores \u2014 picking up after the dog, sorting laundry or cleaning their bathroom \u2014 isn\u2019t done by Friday, she said, \u201cthey start to panic.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s nice, because I\u2019m not nagging them.\u201dWhen the children buy something, Ms. Ibbetson gets an alert about how much was spent and where. (They still use cash occasionally.)\u201cThe parent ultimately has total control,\u201d she said. Parents can divide money into a \u201cspend anywhere\u201d account, or designate funds that can be spent only at certain stores. Greenlight says it is the first to offer store-level \u201cauthorization control,\u201d which allows parents to block spending at specific merchants, and it has several patents pending for its technology.Recently, Adelle, a sixth grader, went on a field trip to Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, an amusement park. Ms. Ibbetson wanted her daughter to be able to buy lunch and snacks inside the park, but didn\u2019t want her splurging at stores outside its borders. So she set the Greenlight app to work only inside the park.Ms. Ibbetson was amused when, later that day, she was notified that the card had been declined at a fast-food location outside the park \u2014 twice.Adelle said she liked that the card helped her and her brother save for two months, to afford new pets. \u201cI just got a guinea pig!\u201d she said. She\u2019s now using the app to save toward a bigger goal: a Disney annual pass.Parents should pay particularly close attention until they are fully familiar with their smart cards, said Dee Pachlhofer, who, along with her mother, is raising two nephews, Jason Pachlhofer, 15, and Chris Wright, 10, in Springfield, Mo. Ms. Pachlhofer said she worried about Jason\u2019s having enough cash when he was on outings to places like Silver Dollar City, a local amusement park. So she signed up for the Current card.There was one initial snag, she said. At first, Jason used the card to sign up for subscription items, like audiobook apps, that offered free trials but then began charging fees. She had to help him cancel the services, and ultimately had a new card issued and started over.Current\u2019s website says there can be gaps in its spending restrictions, particularly when the card is used on sites like iTunes, Xbox and Amazon. In some cases, blocked purchases may still go through because of the payment systems those sites use.(In an email, Current said it recommended canceling recurring subscriptions directly with the merchant.)Since then, however, using the card has \u201cbeen a breeze,\u201d Ms. Pachlhofer said.Advertisement"}

Alarmingly, we are experimenting again with a monopolized economy.Mr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust.In the aftermath of the Second World War, an urgent question presented itself: How can we prevent the rise of fascism from happening again? If over the years that question became one of mostly historical interest, it has again become pressing, with the growing success of populist, nationalist and even neofascist movements all around the world.Common answers to the question stress the importance of a free press, the rule of law, stable government, robust civic institutions and common decency. But as undoubtedly important as these factors are, we too often overlook something else: the threat to democracy posed by monopoly and excessive corporate concentration \u2014 what the Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201d We must not forget the economic origins of fascism, lest we risk repeating the most calamitous error of the 20th century.It is a story that should sound uncomfortably familiar: An economic crisis yields widespread economic suffering, feeding an appetite for a nationalistic and extremist leader. The leader rides to power promising a return to national greatness, deliverance from economic suffering and the defeat of enemies foreign and domestic (including big business). Yet in reality, the leader seeks alliances with large enterprises and the great monopolies, so long as they obey him, for each has something the other wants: He gets their loyalty, and they avoid democratic accountability.There are many differences between the situation in 1930s and our predicament today. But given what we know, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that we are conducting a dangerous economic and political experiment: We have chosen to weaken the laws \u2014 the antitrust laws \u2014 that are meant to resist the concentration of economic power in the United States and around the world.From a political perspective, we have recklessly chosen to tolerate global monopolies and oligopolies in finance, media, airlines, telecommunications and elsewhere, to say nothing of the growing size and power of the major technology platforms. In doing so, we have cast aside the safeguards that were supposed to protect democracy against a dangerous marriage of private and public power.Unfortunately, there are abundant signs that we are suffering the consequences, both in the United States and elsewhere. There is a reason that extremist, populist leaders like Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Xi Jinping of China and Viktor Orban of Hungary have taken center stage, all following some version of the same script. And here in the United States, we have witnessed the anger borne of ordinary citizens who have lost almost any influence over economic policy \u2014 and by extension, their lives. The middle class has no political influence over their stagnant wages, tax policy, the price of essential goods or health care. This powerlessness is brewing a powerful feeling of outrage.After the fall of the Third Reich, the Allies broke up the major Nazi monopolies specifically so that they could not be \u201cused by Germany as instruments of political or economic aggression,\u201d in the words of the law used to do so. The United States took its medicine, too: In 1950, Congress passed the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 to curb politically and economically dangerous concentrations. It empowered the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to block or undo mergers when the effect was \u201csubstantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly.\u201dIt would be understandable if you assumed that the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 had been repealed. But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary. Consequently, over the last two decades we have allowed successive waves of mergers that make a mockery of the 1950 law, and have concentrated economic power in ways that are dangerous to the polity.We need to figure out how the classic antidote to bigness \u2014 the antitrust and other antimonopoly laws \u2014 might be recovered and updated to address the specific challenges of our time. For a start, Congress should pass a new Anti-Merger Act reasserting that it meant what it said in 1950, and create new levels of scrutiny for mega-mergers like the proposed union of T-Mobile and Sprint.But we also need judges who better understand the political as well as economic goals of antitrust. We need prosecutors willing to bring big cases with the courage of trustbusters like Theodore Roosevelt, who brought to heel the empires of J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, and with the economic sophistication of the men and women who challenged AT&T and Microsoft in the 1980s and 1990s. Europe needs to do its part as well, blocking more mergers, especially those like Bayer\u2019s recent acquisition of Monsanto that threaten to put entire global industries in just a few hands.The United States seems to constantly forget its own traditions, to forget what this country at its best stands for. We forget that America pioneered a kind of law \u2014 antitrust \u2014 that in the words of Roosevelt would \u201cteach the masters of the biggest corporations in the land that they were not, and would not be permitted to regard themselves as, above the law.\u201d We have forgotten that antitrust law had more than an economic goal, that it was meant fundamentally as a kind of constitutional safeguard, a check against the political dangers of unaccountable private power.As the lawyer and consumer advocate Robert Pitofsky warned in 1979, we must not forget the economic origins of totalitarianism, that \u201cmassively concentrated economic power, or state intervention induced by that level of concentration, is incompatible with liberal, constitutional democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president is the living embodiment of a spiraling crisis of American corruption, but the problem is far bigger than just him.Mr. Wilkinson is a contributing opinion writer and the vice president for research at the Niskanen Center.Democrats are now preparing to assume control of the House. This offers many possibilities for oversight and investigation. For one, the House Ways and Means Committee has the right to inspect the president\u2019s tax returns, and Democrats are sure to swiftly call on the Treasury to hand over President Trump\u2019s tax records.Newly empowered Democrats need to be ready to hit back, and not just at the president. Mr. Trump is the living embodiment of a spiraling crisis of American corruption, but the problem is far bigger than this one rotten guy and his family.When it\u2019s easy for a class of people to cheat and get away with it, over time, lots of them will. When their ranks and resources hit a critical mass, their desire for political cover can get traction. Their pooled wealth, much of which has been illicitly withheld from the system, can be deployed to incrementally change the system \u2014 to rig the tax code and its enforcement \u2014 to keep themselves in the money (and out of jail).This happens the world over, again and again, and it happened to us. Mr. Trump is using the presidency to cover up his crimes, feather his nest and protect the interests of dictators who funnel money to his family. And it started with the tax-evasion tricks he learned at his father\u2019s knee.The continued survival of the American system may turn on shutting down would-be Trumps. In the near term that means limiting the opportunity to use public office for private gain. House Democrats can address that when they take over the chamber. In the longer term, it means cracking down on tax cheats who grow powerful by leeching our polity of its fiscal lifeblood.If selling off assets and rigorous financial transparency requirements dissuade the unscrupulous rich from pursuing political careers, clearing a path for citizens who never owned a shell company, that\u2019s not a problem. That\u2019s a victory for democratic equality and clean government.Passing strong anti-corruption legislation through the House would make an important statement and lay the groundwork for a more ambitious anti-corruption agenda \u2014 even if Senate Republicans kill it.In the longer term, Congress must choke off the growth of the crooked class by throwing more resources at tax enforcement and making enforcement easier by making the tax code simpler. Close loopholes, seal off asset-concealment escape routes and reverse the proliferation of micro-exemptions, credits and carve-outs.Real estate merits special attention. Much of Mr. Trump\u2019s ill-gotten empire is based on the manipulation of the assessed values of his properties through an easily gamed system of valuation by local authorities. If commercial real estate search companies like Zillow can create algorithms that reliably estimate the market value of properties, the government can do the same. The taxable value of real property should be fixed through a general, rule-bound, politically independent method, with political discretion reserved for transparent legislative rate-setting. Determining the value of taxable assets through an opaque process of bureaucratic whimsy invites corruption. Tolerance of fiscal corruption means more than lost revenue, underfunded schools, straitened social insurance programs and mountains of government debt held by America\u2019s geopolitical rivals. It is the corruption of the body politic and an incentive to get rich, or richer, by cheating the system \u2014 which is, in effect, an incentive to slowly destroy it.Free and prosperous democracies run on social trust: the mutual expectation of non-exploitation. Rampant corruption is the bane of trust, the Kryptonite of republican self-rule. Failure to guard against it has delivered us into the hands of a grievously compromised tax cheat who saw a chance to cover his decadent backside by winning power as a tribune of the people. But it was our lack of vigilance, not his peerless mendacity, that allowed Donald Trump the bogus reputation and stolen resources he needed to seize it.Will Wilkinson is a contributing opinion writer and the vice president for research at the Niskanen Center.Advertisement"}

People\u2019s interests, inclinations and sources of information are so divergent that they are diametrically opposed.Not all of that can be healed, but some of it must be. We can\u2019t continue with half the nation viewing the other half as enemies.Yes, we need someone to restore truth, decency and decorum to the presidency, but we also need someone who can lead a post-Trump reconstruction of civil society in which those who are willing can walk away from Trumpism and back into a more normal political reality.Welcoming back prodigal partisans, those who have excused or forgiven or even cheered hatred, misogyny, racism and division, is easier said than done, and requires a special caliber of leader. The natural inclination of many, somewhat understandably, is simply to be a tougher Trump than Trump, but that inevitably reduces the candidate and the country.America doesn\u2019t need a liberal Trump; it needs precisely the opposite of that. Before we in our parlor games settle on who has the best shot of winning, let\u2019s examine our lists for the candidates who represent our best hope for restoration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another N.F.L. Owner Is Gone in a Year That Has Diminished the Old Guard", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro FootballEvery professional sports league is filled with owners who are doers, those who are followers and some silent types who speak up only when they must. In a relatively short period, the N.F.L. has lost a collection of all three types of owners.The five belonged to a fast-diminishing group of owners who were self-made business owners and more often than not came from humble beginnings. They made their fortunes in industries that boomed in the 1960s and 1970s, when they built their empires \u2014 in energy (McNair), car dealerships (Benson), fast-food franchises (Richardson) and home building (Spanos). Only Allen, who started Microsoft with Bill Gates, staked his claim in what might be considered a cutting edge industry.Given how much it costs to buy a team (the Panthers sold for $2.3 billion), it\u2019s hard to imagine many car dealers or fast-food franchisees being able to purchase an N.F.L. team in the future. The league now is increasingly dominated by billionaires capable of paying nine- and even 10-digit sums for teams, not the start-from-scratch entrepreneurs who cobbled together ownership groups.Maybe this is inevitable. In decades past, sporting events were analog affairs. Tickets were printed and sold, sponsors were asked to pay for signs in stadiums and fans turned on their televisions on Sunday afternoons to see their teams play.As the price of sports franchises has skyrocketed, so too have the challenges of running them. Owners these days need to be familiar with concepts like streaming, mobile ticketing and virtual reality, or at least have smart people around them, to understand how the league can continue growing.And to get an adequate return on their huge investments, they need to look for ways to wring money out of their franchises in increasingly complex and controversial ways, like ripping teams out of their communities and taking them to more profitable locations.Yet in varying ways, the departed owners made an imprint on the financial and social behemoth that the N.F.L. has become.Richardson and McNair did more than just bring teams to the Carolinas and to Houston (which lost its Oilers to Tennessee before the Texans were assembled as an expansion team). They were heavyweights in a group that included more than its share of powerful men.McNair was the chairman of the influential finance committee, and Richardson was the only owner to have played in the N.F.L. As veteran owners, they were trusted confidants of Commissioner Roger Goodell. Both played key roles in helping the N.F.L. return to Los Angeles, and at various times were on the compensation committee, which determines how much the commissioner and other top league executives were paid.Benson, an accountant by trade, was another stalwart on the finance committee.Each went about his business differently. McNair rarely shied away from a reporter\u2019s notebook or microphone, using folksy language that was both blunt and charming. Richardson avoided the media spotlight, but spoke with conviction in smaller settings.Allen almost never attended league meetings, but when he did, everyone took note, such as the time he flew to a special session in Houston in 2016 and threw his weight behind the Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who had ambitious plans to build a stadium in Los Angeles.Some of the changes have been subtle. Spanos\u2019s son, Dean, has run the Chargers for years. Gayle Benson, Tom\u2019s widow, has grabbed the reins of the Saints. McNair\u2019s son, Cal, is the Texans\u2019 chairman and chief operating officer, and likely to stay atop the franchise. Allen\u2019s sister, Jody, is in charge of the Seahawks, at least for now.In other ways, real turnover is afoot. Richardson\u2019s departure, amid a league investigation into the accusations against him, reflected a changing environment. So did his replacement. He sold to David Tepper, a hedge fund mogul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Call to Modernize American Philanthropy ", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesThe giving practices of rich magnates and foundations still suggest a colonial mind-set, the author of a new book argues, as he offers ideas for change. \u201cWriting this book, I started from a place of pain,\u201d Mr. Villanueva said. \u201cI was angry. But there\u2019s plenty of books that criticize. What would I do differently? I felt like I had to push through to a place where I\u2019m offering a different way of thinking.\u201dI sat down with Mr. Villanueva recently to discuss his book \u2014 a compassionate call for change and healing. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.The best thing you can do is go and sit in a community. Participate in a feast day. If you feel a tug of the heart that there\u2019s something special there, fund it. By funding, you\u2019re opening yourself up to receive, so it becomes reciprocal. I say this as a critique. But it\u2019s more of a sadness for me that we\u2019re not opening our hearts and minds to receive and learn and be in relationship with communities.Funding rules are also often decided without an analysis of race and place. I was working in a foundation that decided only to fund organizations with a budget of $500,000 or more. In foundations\u2019 defense, they often have small staffs and processes exist to be able to move money quickly, but sometimes the rules end up pushing people out instead of letting people in.In philanthropy, everyone\u2019s kind of looking at diversity, but we\u2019re still behind the curve. The culture is so mainstream white dominated that it\u2019s hard for people of color to be successful. I\u2019ve heard stories: black women asked not to wear their hair a certain way, a Native woman who was asked not to wear Native jewelry to work because it made other people uncomfortable. For me, I\u2019ve been sort of accused: \u201cWhich side are you on? Do you work here or do you work for the community?\u201dOne: Where did this money come from? We\u2019re operating in the charity space and it feels pure. But we need to know the history and the role that people of color played in helping to amass the wealth. Then we\u2019ll feel more compelled to give some back to those communities.Second: Who gets to allocate, manage and spend it? Who are the gatekeepers to the wealth? That representation matters.Third: Look at your giving, look at the data. If we are a funder that is only supporting organizations led by white people and pursuing mainstream ways of doing change, then we should ask: How can we rise above the processes we\u2019ve created to reach folks who may have different solutions?We\u2019re never going to get there only moving 5 percent of foundation assets, and then of that amount, investing only 7 or 8 percent in communities of color.Coming from a Southern faith tradition, I was taught to pay tithes. Ever since I had a job when I was 14, I\u2019ve given away at least 10 percent of my income. I was taught that the money belongs to God and I was fortunate to keep 90 percent. I think everyone should consider giving 10 percent of their income to support causes they care about. And one way to begin to chip away at the race-wealth gap would be for foundations to take 10 percent of their assets and invest them in communities of color.In my book, I talk about a woman named Hilary who wrote a letter of apology to me. She\u2019s a white woman and her family had a foundation and she started looking into her ancestry. She realized that her family had owned slaves in North Carolina adjacent to the town where my tribe, the Lumbee, is situated. In understanding that, she went through a process of grieving and soul-searching. She wrote letters of apology to a number of people of color. After we got connected she wrote one to me.When I read her letter \u2014 I carry it with me \u2014 I broke down and cried. It was beautiful to me that this person was taking ownership of years of things that happened against my community, and it made me love her. And it wasn\u2019t her fault; she was just born into that family. But her acknowledging that she now has this wealth and privilege and that it came about by some wrongdoing \u2014 that created a deep relationship between the two of us.We can\u2019t undo colonization, but to acknowledge it is a major step. That\u2019s what many folks are fighting for. Because we\u2019re still colonizing. We\u2019re still putting children in cages. People are not aware of our history and there\u2019s not been enough grief about it. We\u2019re in a vicious cycle of continuing to dehumanize folks.

The realization of how much the social media giant has screwed up has dropped slowly, but now we know.In addition to showing how Facebook\u2019s leaders failed to deal forthrightly with the situation, the piece has numerous examples of what I can only call dirty tricks to hurt rival companies and deflect public attention. And that is on Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chief operating officer, as well as a panoply of top executives.One is Facebook\u2019s man in Washington, Joel Kaplan, who could not seem to make any decision that was not a perplexing misjudgment. This was a practice he continued by sitting behind Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearings as his chief cheerleader. Conflict of interest much? Very much.The overall sense of this year is that the brilliant digital minds who told us they were changing the world for the better might have miscalculated.Actually no one wonders that anymore, which is why it\u2019s probably time to think about where the industry goes from here. While I can be hard on tech, I still have hope that it can regain its innovation, inspiration and sunny approach to the future.To do this, I have five suggestions:The fact that no one seems to get fired for anything at these companies is really quite breathtaking. Techies are fond of the obviously false bromide that failure is O.K. If it is so fine, one wonders why no one is being held publicly responsible for anything, aside from the tiresome apology tours that are on replay in Silicon Valley. Privacy breaches at Yahoo and Facebook and Google and everywhere? So sorry. Payoffs to alleged sexual harassers all over the system? So sorry. Questionable financing? So sorry. Yeah, I am sorry that they are so sorry, too, but actions should follow words.After trying several times to get an answer from him, I got frustrated: \u201cWhat kind of responsibility do you feel?\u201d I said I would feel sick to my stomach to know that people died possibly \u201cbecause of something I invented. What does that make you feel like? What do you do when you see that? What do you do yourself? What\u2019s your emotion?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s answer left me cold. And also more than a little worried for the future of his company. It\u2019s bad enough not to be able to anticipate disaster; it\u2019s worse, after disaster strikes, to not be able to reflect on how it happened. \u201cI mean, my emotion is feeling a deep sense of responsibility to try to fix the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a \u2026 that\u2019s the most productive stance.\u201dBut it\u2019s not the most productive stance. As with those California fires, putting out the flames is important. But understanding how they got started in the first place, to stop it from happening again, is what actually keeps us from hurtling over the edge.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside El Chapo\u2019s Vast Network: What We Know After the Trial\u2019s First Week", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis is the first time American prosecutors have had the chance to publicly lay out what they know about a major Mexican cartel, as they have done with other criminal organizations like Al Qaeda and the Mafia.The trial finally began with a bang in Federal District Court in Brooklyn as a cartel insider took the stand.When he takes the stand again this week, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers have said, Mr. Zambada is expected to confess to a remarkable act of corruption: paying $6 million to Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.*Mr. Zambada also identified the cartel\u2019s other principal leaders \u2014 among them, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as The Lord of the Skies because he owned a large fleet of smuggling planes; and Juan Jos\u00e9 Esparragoza, known as El Azul (Spanish for blue.)Mr. Esparragoza, one of the group\u2019s oldest and most respected members, served as Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s mentor.\u201cAzul was the one who basically supported Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera to be a great drug trafficker,\u201d Mr. Zambada said.Sinaloa was also a premier plaza because most of the cartel\u2019s leaders came from there.\u201cTheir families are there,\u201d Mr. Zambada said. \u201cTheir businesses, their life.\u201dGiven the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s penchant for violence, security at the trial has been exceedingly tight. The United States Marshals worked hard last week to accommodate the public, but should you decide to attend the proceedings, which could last as long as four months, prepare for the following:Arrive early for a 9:30 a.m. start. During the first week, those wanting a seat arrived by 6:45 a.m. Drink coffee beforehand because you will be asked to dump any remaining beverages before you enter.As you pass through the first level of security, you\u2019ll be asked to put your belongings through a scanner and to walk through a metal detector. Here, you will be told to relinquish your cellphone, laptop and other electronic devices. (This is normal for the federal courts.)Then, you\u2019ll take the elevator to the 8th floor, find a second line of people outside the courtroom and wait for the next few hours.Say hello to the bomb-sniffing dog lying beside another metal detector.You\u2019ll pass through a second layer of security, putting your remaining belongings back through the scanner. This time, be sure to remove your shoes.Depending on your place in line, you\u2019ll join one of the following courtrooms: The first approximately 50 people are allowed in the main courtroom. Another 50 are allowed in the overflow room. All remaining people will be asked to leave.But when the group first came together in the early 1990s, it was less organized. Mr. Zambada said they were a band of traffickers from the western state of Sinaloa \u2014 some old comrades, some related by blood \u2014 who gradually joined forces based on \u201cbonds of friendship.\u201dAccording to Mr. Zambada, the Sinaloa cartel operated in at least a dozen plazas across Mexico \u2014 from ones on the west coast, like Guerrero and Jalisco, to those along the northern border, like Sonora and Chihuahua. The coastal plazas, he explained, were essential because they were access points for cocaine shipments arriving by sea from Colombia. The border plazas were used to smuggle drugs into the United States.The jury \u2014 consisting of 12 seated jurors and six alternates \u2014 has not only received lessons in the inner workings of the prominent Mexican cartel, but also a crash course in Spanish slang.On the Mexican side, the entrance was hidden under a pool table that ascended from the floor by a hydraulic lift. The tunnel was located only two blocks from the local Customs and Border Protection office in Arizona.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How and When to Talk to Your Children About Money", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersJennifer and David Buckwald, who live in Colts Neck, N.J., struggled with how to impart their financial values to their two children.Both wanted to ensure that their children, ages 14 and 12, were motivated to succeed in their own right. Mr. Buckwald, in particular, was concerned that their children would think that the affluent town where they live, an area of horses and golf clubs, was reflective of the wider world.But even though they both work in finance and hold degrees in psychology, they didn\u2019t know exactly how to approach a conversation about money and more broadly about financial and family values. This year, they decided to change that.\u201cWe know the importance of planning, and we have every insurance under the sun,\u201d Ms. Buckwald said. \u201cBut we never sat down and talked about our values \u2014 what\u2019s important about making money and saving money?\u201dMr. Buckwald conceded that it was not easy: \u201cIt was a chore, at first. The kids didn\u2019t want to do this.\u201dGathering the family around the Thanksgiving dinner table is a great opportunity to impart family values and lessons around money. Not only is the family beholden to come together, but this is the time of year when many people make their annual charitable gifts. Money is on their minds.But holidays can be fraught with emotion, so experts say it might be better to take smaller steps, like setting a later date to talk to children and grandchildren.Regardless of when the talk is done, experts say families need to approach these conversations with a plan and a willingness to listen as much as talk.The first step for parents is to overcome their reluctance to talk about financial matters with their children, a discussion perhaps second only to the birds and the bees in terms of the discomfort it generates.\u201cTalking about family money is similar to talking to kids about sex,\u201d said Jeff Savlov, founder of Blum & Savlov, a family business consulting firm. \u201cThere is such a thing as too much, too soon.\u201dOnce past that hurdle, a good place to start is family stories. \u201cOur family stories helped shape us into what we are today,\u201d said Donna Skeels Cygan, president of Sage Future Financial, an advisory firm. \u201cIt is important to acknowledge which family members had a very positive impact on our childhood.\u201dThese stories work better, though, when they\u2019re not just focused on joy or success. Mr. Buckwald said he told stories about his financially challenging childhood. But as part of an exercise with Mr. Savlov, Mr. Buckwald also told his children about a relative who ran a speakeasy during Prohibition.Being explicit with the lessons works well. Stephanie Eras, an engineer in New Mexico, said she used the benefits package offered by her daughter\u2019s part-time job at Panera Bread as an opportunity to discuss savings.As an inducement for her daughter to save the maximum amount allowed in the company\u2019s 401(k) plan, Ms. Eras matched her daughter\u2019s contribution. She also shared stories about her father and mother, who lived frugally.\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t tell us, \u2018You must go to college and get a good job.\u2019 She said, \u2018You need to get a job with benefits,\u2019\u201d Ms. Eras said. \u201cThose lessons taught me to live within my means.\u201dWhen her daughter announced that money wouldn\u2019t buy them happiness, Ms. Eras pointed out that although that was true, money bought the things that they needed and wanted. \u201cI listed them,\u201d she said.Lisa Bealhen, who lives in Albuquerque, said she was always ready and willing to talk to her three stepdaughters about financial decisions. But she would wait for the right moment.\u201cI learned a long time ago that if they ask you for advice, give it a gentle way,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t ask, wrap your head in duct tape if you have to, but say nothing.\u201dYet she and her husband, Scott, who died this year, led by example. They had owned a booming custom home business in the Southwest, developing entire subdivisions. He had been the president of the homebuilders association.\u201cWe created a lot of wealth,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t spend beyond our means. We drove nice Toyotas, but we didn\u2019t drive Mercedes. We could have afforded the Mercedes. But it wasn\u2019t something we cared about.\u201dYour children will almost invariably figure out how much your home and cars cost \u2014 thank the internet for that \u2014 and they may also view those assets in comparison with what their friends have. But deciding when to tell them how much you make is up to you, and it may be years before they have the maturity to understand what that number means.Mr. Buckwald said his teenage son often asked him how much he earned, but he is not ready to tell him. Yet as a family, they have started to talk about expenses, including their grocery bill.\u201cWe use concrete numbers,\u201d Ms. Buckwald said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost empowering to them.\u201dAny of these talks will require intentionality. Mr. Savlov plays a game with families where he lines up 100 pieces of licorice on a table. He then leads a discussion about all the people in the world who have less and more than they do. At the end, he asks them to remove licorice sticks to show where their family stands financially in the world.\u201cInvariably, they leave between five and 10 pieces of licorice on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whatever is left, I\u2019ll take them away, until I get it down to one, and then I take out a pair of scissors and cut one in half and half again and half again. It comes down to this little speck and then I say, \u2018How does this strike you?\u2019\u201dThe exercise allows a logical entry into a conversation about wants and needs.Despite the benefits of talking to children about money, people put off these talks. The risk is that at a certain point, parents feel they cannot have those conversations once their children become adults.Janet and Bob Serier, a New Mexico couple both married for the second time, said they fell into that category with their three sons from their first marriages. The couple were able to stop working in their 50s, and they are living comfortably in their early 70s.But they have started trying to impart the financial lessons they wished they had shared with their children to their grandchildren.Mrs. Serier said that when her children were young, she was divorced and focused on her career to provide for them. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I ever said anything to them directly,\u201d she said.But her grandsons have given her a second chance. \u201cThey listen to you,\u201d she said. \u201cGrandchildren look up to their grandparents. We find we\u2019re less inhibited.\u201dSometimes, though, children have to start the talk with their aging parents. These are not conversations about family values so much as they are pragmatic assessments of a parent\u2019s need for care and support \u2014 and who is going to provide it.It might be best to focus on a series of planning behaviors, like making sure financial and health care documents and passwords are organized, and having discussions about who will manage their affairs, said Ronald Long, head of regulatory affairs and elder client initiatives at Wells Fargo Advisors.\u201cSkip the Black Friday shopping and spend a half an hour talking to each other,\u201d Mr. Long said.That\u2019s good advice at any age.An earlier version of this column misstated the surname of an Albuquerque woman who owned a custom home business with her husband. She is Lisa Bealhen, not Bealhan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Offices Are Searched in Money Laundering Investigation", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeutsche Bank\u2019s efforts to escape a history of scandal, wrongdoing and mismanagement suffered a serious setback Thursday after the German police raided its headquarters in Frankfurt as part of an investigation into whether the lender helped criminals launder money through offshore tax havens.Arriving in a fleet of blue-and-white police vans, 170 prosecutors, federal agents, police officers and tax authorities searched the headquarters and five other sites in the area, prosecutors in Frankfurt said. The officers seized paper documents and electronic records related to the case, which involved hundreds of millions of euros, and were still at the bank late Thursday.Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest lender, said in a statement it was \u201ccooperating fully\u201d with investigators and expressed surprise at the raid. \u201cWe have already provided the authorities with all the relevant information regarding Panama Papers,\u201d J\u00f6rg Eigendorf, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, said on Twitter.\u201cThis says they are not genuine and sincere about changing this culture of noncompliance and changing this culture of impunity,\u201d said Jimmy Gurul\u00e9, a former United States assistant attorney general who is a professor of criminal law at Notre Dame Law School and has written several books on terrorism financing.Such regulatory and enforcement action, combined with management mistakes, have taken a toll on profits. Deutsche Bank reported net earnings of 750 million euros, or $854 million, during the third quarter on revenue of \u20ac19.7 billion. That is considered a paltry return for a bank, and was less than half the earnings a year earlier.Deutsche Bank has also been drawn into scandal at Denmark\u2019s Danske Bank, which faces criminal investigations over suspected money laundering in its Estonian branch. Deutsche, among other banks, handled certain transactions for Danske. Deutsche Bank says it stopped doing work for the Danske Bank Estonian branch in 2015.Police raids are nothing new at the bank, either. The authorities conducted large-scale searches in 2015 and 2012 in cases involving alleged tax fraud.The latest investigation focuses on two employees, who were not publicly identified but whose ages were given as 50 and 46, as well as other people whom investigators have not yet identified. In 2016 alone, prosecutors said, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands served 900 customers with transactions worth 311 million, or more than $350 million.Deutsche Bank employees are accused of neglecting their duty to report suspicious transactions \u201calthough ample grounds existed,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement.\u201cDeutsche Bank helped customers found offshore organizations in tax havens by transferring illegally acquired money without alerting authorities to suspected money laundering,\u201d prosecutors said. Nadja Niesen, a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutors, declined to comment beyond information given in the written statement.The raids were the latest example of how the Panama Papers have, over the past two years, shed light on the methods that people and companies use to hide their wealth and avoid taxes.The documents were obtained by the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared with news organizations around the world through the nonprofit International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The result was a series of expos\u00e9s in 2016 on how rich and well-connected individuals and companies were able to skirt tax laws.The revelations spurred enforcement action and unveiled routine corruption in the global financial system. They also exposed how offshore banking \u2014 meant to help ease cross-border business \u2014 had become a tool, in some cases, for excessive tax avoidance.Thursday\u2019s raid marked a new low for Deutsche Bank, which has never quite recovered from the turmoil of the 2008 financial crisis. This year, the bank\u2019s arm in the United States failed a Federal Reserve stress test, which found that it had \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in its operations. Deutsche Bank has also faced special scrutiny by European regulators because of concerns about its holdings of risky derivatives and other assets.The bank is in the middle of a restructuring plan that is expected cut more than 7,000 jobs by the end of 2019.Although an earnings preview suggested there would be some good news after years of restructuring, the report of the raid sent shares down more than 3 percent Thursday. The shares have lost half of their value since the start of the year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Starving Children, a Bite of Hope", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesMalnutrition kills a million of the world\u2019s children a year. To stem that, United Nations agencies and charities are testing a new system for distributing high-nutrition foods more efficiently. As Americans gather for our most food-centric holiday, there\u2019s some potentially great news about food \u2014 especially for people who have very little to eat. It\u2019s a new strategy that could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of hungry children every year.Fifty million children under 5 suffer from acute malnutrition. It\u2019s one of the biggest contributors to the nearly one million deaths each year of children under 5. Malnutrition wears down the immune system, so a child can die from a cold. It also can cause permanent physical and cognitive damage to children who survive.But another factor is war. It\u2019s especially hard to work in those war and chaos zones where malnutrition is common. Today the most severely malnourished places are Yemen and South Sudan \u2014 both entirely man-made crises. The disruption of war means families can\u2019t work, can\u2019t reach crops and livestock or bring them to market. Health and sanitation systems shut down and workers flee.And the system requires desperate mothers to come to the food every week \u2014 which can mean walking for miles through perilous terrain, and then waiting for hours \u2014 rather than getting the food to them.The way we save hungry children needs an efficiency overhaul.O.K., successful pilot experiments happen all the time in the social sector. They almost never lead to widespread change. Even when bureaucracies endorse a new idea, officials often fear change and jealously guard their turf. Many a good idea has been studied to death.But this time might be different. The World Food Program and Unicef are enthusiastic, to the point of running joint pilot programs to test the idea in West Africa. \u201cWe are tremendously supportive,\u201d said Lauren Landis, the director of nutrition of the World Food Program. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s time for a revolution in the way we address acute malnutrition.\u201dHere\u2019s how malnourished children have been treated until now: If the child has a complication, such as pneumonia or fever, he or she goes to the hospital. Uncomplicated cases are separated into two categories, severe or moderate. (The test can be a weight/height ratio, the presence of marked water retention in the feet or the circumference of the mid upper arm.)Unicef treats severe cases, usually giving children Plumpy\u2019Nut packets to take home. The child must come back every week for a checkup and more packets. Children with moderate malnutrition go to a World Food Program feeding center, where they can get food on site and take-home food, often a corn-soy blend, to supplement the family diet.What could possibly go wrong? You name it.A large majority of malnourished children can\u2019t reach either program. \u201cMothers have to walk for hours, and even if they get there, the service might not be available,\u201d said Mesfin Teklu Tessema, senior director of health for the I.R.C.When programs do exist, a mother has no idea which one to go to. \u201cThe referral between programs doesn\u2019t always work,\u201d Ms. Landis said. And it\u2019s hard to make a weekly trip. \u201cIt\u2019s common to relapse if the mother is not able to bring the child every week to get the Plumpy\u2019Nut,\u201d said Grace Funnell, associate director of nutrition and health at Action Against Hunger.Since money is short, it is focused on treating severe cases. That means many children get no treatment for malnutrition until they deteriorate to the point where it is severe. This endangers children and creates extra costs, because they might need hospitalization. It also leads to a lot of relapses, because children can, in effect, be cut off treatment once they are only moderately malnourished.Even this flawed system, though, is far better than what came before, when hospitalization was the only treatment for severe malnutrition. In the past decade or so, the number of children treated each year has more than tripled.Much of the increase can be attributed to Plumpy\u2019Nut. The product was developed by the French company Nutriset 22 years ago but took about 10 years to reach widespread use. (It must get each government\u2019s approval, because technically it\u2019s a medicine.)With Plumpy\u2019Nut, or other similar high-nutrition blends developed since it emerged, a parent can easily treat a child at home. There\u2019s nothing to measure or prepare, and it doesn\u2019t have to be mixed with water, which is often unsafe to drink.The other factor is the growing numbers of community health workers, who fight diseases like malaria and tuberculosis effectively and cheaply. But they are still not widespread in every country, and few of them deal with malnutrition \u2014 in part because the system is so complex.The Food Program and Unicef have long been aware of the system\u2019s flaws. In 2011, they signed an agreement laying out a division of their labor. \u201cWe thought at that time we were clarifying roles and responsibilities,\u201d Ms. Landis said. \u201cBut as we\u2019ve gone on, we felt it wasn\u2019t a problem of clarifying. It was more a need to combine more closely, so children don\u2019t fall through the cracks.\u201dThe dual system arose because the Food Program historically has run feeding centers for people of all ages, and one of Unicef\u2019s missions is to train health care workers. So hospitalized children fell under Unicef\u2019s umbrella.Ms. Landis said the cost savings would come largely from switching to a single therapeutic food. \u201cSince that\u2019s the largest component of the cost of treatment, we could really save money,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we have one pipeline to buy everything, we can optimize the supply chain. And if there\u2019s one thing we know, it\u2019s a supply chain.\u201d\u201cIn principle, they are broadly sympathetic,\u201d he said.Only that?\u201cThat might be typical British understatement,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a matter of turning good will into action.\u201d\u201cEverything we see is promising,\u201d Unicef\u2019s Dr. Aguayo said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying to go as fast as possible, but not faster, in the greatest interest of children\u2019s rights.\u201dOne reason for further testing, Dr. Aguayo said, was to find out how best to ensure that the most severely ill children get help in a system that treats severe and moderate alike. \u201cWe will still have limited resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to prioritize the children with the greatest risk. I\u2019m sure that we can.\u201dJeanette Bailey, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s senior technical adviser for nutrition and the leader of the just-concluded study, agreed that more pilots can test different ways to solve operational problems. But don\u2019t take too long, she cautioned. \u201cIf millions of adults were dying of Ebola, there would be outrage,\u201d she said. \u201cMalnutrition kills the youngest among us in a very slow way. It\u2019s been about a decade that we\u2019re not getting past 20 percent coverage. We can\u2019t keep letting generations of children slip through our fingers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Because it may just answer the question: \u201cWhat if a country was run by women?\u201d\u201cAruba gives us opportunity,\u201d said Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes, who last year became the first woman to ascend to the post in the country after a complicated election in which she was charged with forming its first coalition government in 16 years.Although women have risen to such leadership positions in much larger nations \u2014 like Margaret Thatcher of Britain or Angela Merkel of Germany or Michelle Bachelet of Chile to name just a few \u2014 Mrs. Wever-Croes\u2019s election is significant, coming at a time when women\u2019s ascent into top decision-making roles globally has sputtered.Unlike some of her counterparts, she is not just a woman in a top leadership position overseeing a government mostly run by men. Many women hold top jobs in the Aruban government, and Mrs. Wever-Croes wants to find more.Her job is more challenging than it might seem. Despite the island\u2019s year-round sunny weather and pristine beaches, it has a long, complex history and is facing challenging financial issues \u2014 it has both a budget deficit and a rising national debt and is under financial supervision of the Dutch government in The Hague. Aruba left the group of Caribbean islands known as the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 but remained part of the Netherlands.Failure to meet the terms of financial supervision would result in direct intervention by the Dutch in Aruba\u2019s domestic financial affairs, even though the island has autonomy in local matters.Mrs. Wever-Croes, who was born into a family of politicians, said she had not intended to seek elected office until she found herself running out of excuses not to. \u201cSomeone has to do it\u201d she says, and adds, \u201cyou can\u2019t just look at a situation and complain.\u201dHer first job was in Aruba\u2019s tax department after she graduated from Universiteit Leiden in the Netherlands. Thirteen years later, after rising to lead the office of the Tax Inspectorate, she left for private practice as a tax attorney while raising her family. She returned to politics when she was elected to Parliament in 2009.She is now 52 and a grandmother.Getting more women to run for political office is a priority for her, as is refusing to accept the first \u201cno\u201d she hears from those she asks. Women often list the same reasons she initially gave for not wanting to enter politics \u2014 private sector career, family, personal life \u2014 so initially she accepted it.Now, she responds with an additional push. \u201cStaying in our comfort zone won\u2019t bring us the change we need for our families and in Aruba,\u201d she said.One-third of the seats in the 21-seat Parliament are held by women, as are two of eight cabinet positions (including Mrs. Wever-Croes\u2019s). While men far outnumber women in elected positions, women are leading in policy and influential industry posts.Xiomara J. Ruiz-Maduro, the minister of finance, economic affairs and culture, is a woman. She also entered politics in 2009 and was appointed to Mrs. Wever-Croes\u2019s cabinet shortly after the prime minister took office. Her first order of business was a challenging one: To come up with budget and debt proposals that would satisfy the Netherlands.With a growing national debt estimated at about 91 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), it was agreed that the 2018 budget deficit would not exceed the one in 2017. Aruba has seen modest economic growth in 2017 and 2018 but it is fragile in the short-term because it relies so heavily on one sector \u2014 tourism.Mrs. Wever-Croes\u2019s own duties include energy, integrity and innovation. Integrity is a new addition to the prime minister\u2019s job, added by Mrs. Wever-Croes to address the decline in public trust in elected officials.She has had to diplomatically lower expectations on the country\u2019s sustainable energy transition during meetings at the United Nations in September, navigate the erosion of public trust in elected officials at home after a bribery scandal involving a former minister of labor, and address the sustainability of the country\u2019s economic growth.As these pressing issues are discussed, Mrs. Wever-Croes and Mrs. Ruiz-Maduro look across the boardroom table and, more often than not, see other women. Tourism accounts for up to 92 percent of Aruba\u2019s GDP. The two organizations responsible for destination management and representation of travel industry interests (Aruba Tourism Authority and the Aruba Hotel and Tourism Association) have women chief executive officers. The country\u2019s director of Economic Development is a woman, as are the five sector heads reporting directly to her.The Central Bank of Aruba has been under the leadership and direction of the economist Jane Figaroa-Semeleer since 2008.Then there is the country\u2019s first chief innovation officer, the minister plenipotentiary for Aruba (representing the government\u2019s interests in the United States) as well as the country\u2019s appointee to the state council in the Netherlands. The council is an advisory body in the Netherlands composed of members of the royal family and other members appointed by the crown \u2014 once again, roles occupied by women. The state council has significant legislative oversight and judicial authority.Mrs. Wever-Croes\u2019s path to career prominence is mirrored in those of her female peers. These are women who, immediately upon graduating from high school in the 1980s, went to university before entering the work force.They proceeded to work hard, have children and get promoted. Not working did not appeal as an option for any of these women. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do with my life if I wasn\u2019t working,\u201d said Maria Diijkhoff-Pita, director of the Department of Economic Affairs, Commerce and Industry.How have they achieved uninterrupted career progression, a goal that has eluded so many women? Part of the answer lies with the country\u2019s former oil refinery. From its opening in 1928 until it closed in 1985, it was the country\u2019s major private employer.Automation of the refinery\u2019s operations in 1956 ushered in a first wave of dislocation and reinvention for Aruba. Men left to work in other Caribbean countries, while the women stayed home. Many started home-based businesses to supplement family incomes, while others took positions in government or stepped into roles in the nascent tourism industry.The next wave of economic reinvention started with the refinery\u2019s closure and Aruba\u2019s withdrawal from the Dutch Antilles, which led to the closure of the University of the Dutch Antilles, the only university then on the island.Girls and boys now had to leave the island for college.For many reasons, including service to country, family responsibility and personal choice, Mrs. Wever-Croes and most of her female peers returned home upon graduation to pursue their careers rather than remaining abroad.As the country\u2019s economic prospects began to improve, the women were \u2014 to borrow a line from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright \u2014 \u201cthere when the country came looking for them.\u201dMrs. Wever-Croes recognizes there are still inequities in Aruba, which is why she is pushing a human-centered \u201cHunto Pa Aruba\u201d (\u201cTogether For Aruba\u201d) socio-economic plan. \u201cMen and women, everyone needs to contribute,\u201d she said.The state of the country\u2019s financial affairs is an ongoing challenge.\u201cI have to be frank, we\u2019re still in crisis,\u201d Mrs. Wever-Croes said, in a manner reminiscent of someone who has had to make difficult decisions before.1.

{"Headline": "Writing Postcards Brings Voters Back From the Edge: \u2018It\u2019s Sharpie Therapy\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARIETTA, Ga. \u2014 In the big data era of politics, where campaigns are betting millions on software that can harvest hundreds of pieces of information about a single voter, Tony McMullin is making a decidedly different wager.He is trying to show that elections can be won through the persuasive power of a plaintive handwritten postcard.It is a battle of quaint vs. quant.An army of almost 40,000 volunteers, seeking catharsis in the Trump era, have answered Mr. McMullin\u2019s call to do more than wring hands, and instead, start writing, producing more than 1.5 million postcards since September to try to swing close races in the midterm election. This week, the group aims to send postcards to every registered Democrat in North Dakota to try to win the re-election of Senator Heidi Heitkamp.\u201cWe called it Sharpie therapy,\u201d said Ellen Bender, who has convened multiple postcard-writing sessions at a Le Pain Quotidien on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. \u201cInstead of throwing the remote at the TV, we would write postcards.\u201dUndeterred, Mr. McMullin, 52, quit his job at SunTrust Bank to oversee the postcard group full time. The midterms have created such demand that he needs dozens of volunteers to keep up with administrative tasks alone.Still, there is clearly an allure to the volunteers. Postcard writing is more personal than phone banking, more tactile, and in many cases, more social.\u201cI think that as you are writing, there\u2019s something going on that\u2019s a connection between your hand and your head, your brain,\u201d Mr. McMullin said. \u201cYou are envisioning that voter going to the mailbox and getting your postcard. Each time you are writing one, you picture a positive outcome.\u201dIn Zanesville, Ohio, last August, supporters of Mr. O\u2019Connor brought their postcards to a fund-raiser to show to friends. With so much campaign information flooding their televisions and mailboxes, they were confident a handwritten gesture would make a deeper connection.\u201cIn the postcard, you know you are creating something that stands a good chance of being held, or being put on a bulletin board or a fridge,\u201d Mr. McMullin said.The midterm elections next week are the latest test. Along with Ms. Heitkamp, his group is writing cards to support Phil Bredesen, the Democratic Senate candidate in Tennessee, governor candidates Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida, and Democratic candidates in more than a dozen competitive House races. They also are writing for the Senate campaign of Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas, a Democrat so popular nationally that as soon as Mr. McMullin announced the effort, postcard writers on the first day requested more than 33,000 addresses to target.From his home in this rambling Atlanta suburb, Mr. McMullin sat at his command center this week \u2014 his dining room table \u2014 along with two volunteers, to monitor incoming emails requesting more voter addresses. He provides a script for the writers, then users sometimes add their own flourish, with words or artistic renderings.Mr. McMullin has also put his own digital experience to use with an automated computer program \u2014 or \u201cbot\u201d \u2014 named Abby that issues the addresses. Analytics software tracks the progress of postcard writing in real time.The rules are simple. Volunteers have to prepare and submit a picture of a sample postcard so their handwriting can be approved. Those who try to use computers to write the cards are rejected.Initially, Mr. McMullin said he thought the effort would attract introverts who would take on a solitary task. Instead, postcard parties are taking place from New York to California.He used to scour the internet for elections where he thought the postcards would be helpful. Now, campaigns are asking for him.\u201cI would not be doing this, taking my own time, if I didn\u2019t think there was a real benefit,\u201d said Mr. McMullin, who was weaned on grass-roots politics during Howard Dean\u2019s presidential campaign in 2004.He said that lawyers have assured him the postcard effort does not run afoul of campaign finance regulations. The cards are mailed to \u201cValued Voter\u201d or some variation of that, and not to an individual. But the people who write the card usually sign their names. The focus is on infrequent or newly registered voters.He said he does not make money on the venture, though the group does sell postcards on Amazon. The senders pay for their own postage.\u201cWe will definitely write every Democratic voter in Mississippi at least once,\u201d Mr. McMullin said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s always an election going on somewhere in the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adani to Proceed With Scaled-Back Version of Contentious Australian Coal Mine", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Carmichael mine had been projected to produce 60 million tons a year from the coal-rich Galilee Basin; now the output will start at 10 million tons and rise to 27.5 million, the company said, putting it more in line with other mines in the area.\u201cThe project stacks up both environmentally and financially,\u201d said Lucas Dow, Adani Australia\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe will now deliver the jobs and business opportunities we have promised for North Queensland and Central Queensland, all without requiring a cent of Australian taxpayer dollars.\u201d The company had previously asked for a taxpayer-financed loan of a billion Australian dollars, about $730 million.Critics of the plan \u2014 and they are legion \u2014 said the company was trying to rush ahead and break ground because of polls indicating that the next federal election could be won by the Labor Party, which is likely to oppose the mine. There are still obstacles in place, involving water and other issues, but the company maintains that they are procedural and will soon be resolved.Resistance to the mine remains strong. It has become an environmental cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre across Australia, with legal challenges, protests and celebrities painting \u201cStop Adani\u201d on their cheeks.The concerns have focused on potential damage to the Great Barrier Reef, because of a port connected to the mine along Australia\u2019s North Queensland coast, and more broadly on coal\u2019s damaging contribution to climate change.Opposition to the project does not appear to be diminishing along with its scale.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford a coal mine of any size,\u201d said Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation.\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d she added. \u201cMany on both sides of politics understand burning the coal from the Adani mine and the broader Galilee Basin will be terribly damaging for our climate.\u201dAustralia is especially vulnerable to climate change as the world\u2019s driest inhabited continent, and its effects are becoming abundantly clear.Indeed, Matthew Canavan, a Queensland senator and Australia\u2019s minister for resources and Northern Australia, praised Adani for its persistence even as he noted the spread of wildfires.Frustration with the government\u2019s position on climate change has been building ever since conservatives in the governing Liberal Party toppled Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in August over an energy plan that included moderate measures for controlling emissions.On Friday, hundreds of students from all over Australia are planning to leave school and protest what they describe as politicians\u2019 failure to recognize climate change as an emergency.Some argued on Thursday that the government still had a chance to stop the mine from going forward.\u201cThe federal and Queensland governments must resist Adani\u2019s pressure to rubber-stamp water approvals and extinguish native title rights,\u201d said Imogen Zethoven, a spokeswoman for the Australian Marine Conservation Society.But Adani and the state and federal governments do not seem likely to give in. Company officials insist that they have everything they need to show they comply with the final rules and requirements, which they described as routine.The company argues that the demand for coal, primarily in India, is there, and that reducing the mine\u2019s footprint has made the costs manageable.\u201cToday\u2019s announcement removes any doubt as to the project stacking up financially,\u201d Mr. Dow said.Advertisement"}

Horticulture and red wine were served up the other night at the Sill, a boutique on Hester Street, as Christopher Satch, a botanist wearing a T-shirt that read, \u201cPlants Make People Happy,\u201d the company motto, led a workshop on carnivorous plants. It was plant stand-up \u2014 slightly blue patter with quick takes on Linnaeus and Darwin; binomial nomenclature (note the shape of the Venus fly trap for cues to how it got its name); detailed care instructions (carnivorous plants evolved in acidic bogs, which means they need distilled water, not tap, and lots of it); and a show-and-tell of Mr. Satch\u2019s collection of butterworts and sundews. Among the rapt attendees were Madison Steinberg and Lindsay Reisman, both 23 and working in public relations, and Brayan Poma, also 23, who works in construction; afterward they each took home an attractive tropical pitcher plant. \u201cI like plants, but I kill so many of them,\u201d said Mr. Poma, who wore a green hoodie and a goatee. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I find them so alluring.\u201d Ms. Oakes may be the original plant influencer: In 2012, the makers of the Toyota Prius designed the subcompact Prius C with Ms. Oakes in mind (the company described her as an \u201cactive eco-optimist\u201d) and created a paint color in her name.This past summer, the company\u2019s revenues reached $5 million. Seventy percent of its sales are online purchases, though Ms. Blank\u2019s ambitions include more bricks-and-mortar; two additional stores will open in Los Angeles in late January. The Sill sells stylish ceramic planters in millennial colors (mint green and pale pink); watering cans; misters with upbeat messages; fertilizer and soil mixes; totes and T-shirts; and hosts community building events like movie nights and \u201csip and shop\u201d cocktail parties. An ambassador program encourages \u201cbrand evangelists\u201d to host their own. It is Ms. Blank\u2019s aim to reinvent the garden center \u2014 and your local horticultural society. It is also important to note \u201chow well a glossy green houseplant goes with millennial pink,\u201d as Ingrid Abramovitch, the features director of Elle Decor said.If plants are \u201can affordable way to fill the void,\u201d as Ms. Blakeney, the designer behind Thejungalow put it recently, the Sill\u2019s ambition is to be the go-to source. But it has competition.A couple of years ago, three friends practiced a form of extreme horticulture in their apartment in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, kitting it out with plants instead of furniture. At its peak, there were 500 plants in there, said Ryan Lee, now 29, who has worked in finance and technology. He and his roommates, Jonathan Wu, a software engineer, and Kay Kim, a former creative director at an ad agency, both 27, held plant pop-up sales \u2014 their friends nicknamed them the Plantboys \u2014 and refined the idea for what Mr. Lee, echoing Ms. Blank, calls a modern plant company. The Plantboys also plan to sell branded gear like apparel and gardening products. \u201cWe want to be the pre-eminent green brand,\u201d Mr. Lee said, adding that Patagonia is an inspiration. \u201cWe want to create a company our generation will trust that we can leverage to enact positive change for the environment.\u201dLast summer they were parked in SoHo in front of Patagonia, offering plant care demonstrations, seasonal collections of pottery by local artists and T-shirts and postcards with \u201cenvironmental-action-oriented tasks,\u201d Ms. Summers said. \u201cWe started scrappy,\u201d she said. But the business has been successful enough that next week, they, too, are opening a storefront in a Greenpoint warehouse, to offer \u201ccarefully curated\u201d desert, tropical and subtropical plants, along with ceramics, clothing, books and space for workshops and events. If Martha Stewart was the domestic and horticultural avatar of the previous generation, the new plant purveyors offer a corrective to that costly abundance \u2014 an ideal that fetishized an English trowel or leather gardening gloves \u2014 and a counter to humorless, daunting expertise. \u201cWe all have dreams of the big house in the country,\u201d she added, \u201cbut right now we\u2019re living in a basement on the Lower East Side and how do we connect to nature there? I think my generation just wants to be happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just One Seat: The High-Octane Fight to Flip New York\u2019s Senate", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats are one seat away from retaking the State Senate, a shake-up that could have huge implications for New York\u2019s political and economic future.There is just one day left until an election that could decide New York\u2019s future on universal health care, rent regulation, charter schools, bail reform and more.No, it\u2019s not the race for the United States Senate or House of Representatives. It\u2019s the contest happening further down the ballot, for the State Senate.Contrary to the popular image of New York as an impenetrable wall of blue, Republicans have controlled the State Senate virtually uninterrupted for decades, frustrating attempts by progressives to pass a long wish list of legislation. But if Democrats flip just one seat, they can change that.The stakes have rarely been higher, according to both parties\u2019 rhetoric. Democrats say they need the blue wave to help them make Albany a bulwark against Washington and President Trump. Republicans say they need to fend off one-party rule in an increasingly liberal state, before conservative and upstate voters are forgotten forever. In the last frenzied, money-soaked days before Tuesday\u2019s election, here is where things stand.Campaign finance filings give a pretty clear indication of which districts to watch.Eight candidates in four districts have been spending lavishly this year, with their campaigns funneling more than $6.3 million combined into the races. They are:Jeff Pravato, a Republican, and John Brooks, the Democratic incumbent, in Nassau and Suffolk CountiesTom Basile, a Republican, and James Skoufis, a Democrat, vying for an open seat in Orange CountyBob Antonacci, a Republican, and John Mannion, a Democrat, competing for an open seat in the Syracuse areaMore than $11.6 million has arrived for state races in New York this cycle from PACs and other outside groups \u2014 in addition to the candidates\u2019 money and contributions from the Democratic and Republican Senate campaign committees. More than $5.3 million of that outside money went to those four hotly contested races.Michael Malbin, the executive director of the Washington-based Campaign Finance Institute and a political-science professor at the University at Albany, said the tight focus suggests that the Democrats believe they have a very narrow path to victory, through very specific districts.\u201cThe election\u2019s on a knife\u2019s edge,\u201d Professor Malbin said.The two Long Island districts went for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016, but by just 3 points in both. The Syracuse district voted for Ms. Clinton by 5 points; the Orange County district chose Mr. Trump by 4.Republicans, backed by moneyed interests such as real estate, have for years consistently out-raised the Democrats. They still lead the Democrats in campaign funds this year \u2014 but the gap could have been larger, had it not been for some outside groups that seem to be sitting this year out.New Yorkers for a Balanced Albany, a well-funded PAC that supports charter schools, donated close to $7 million to Republicans in 2016, with nearly $6.6 million already infused by the end of October. But this year, as of the same time, the group had spent only $1.2 million.Some traditional Republican donors have also started giving to Democrats, perhaps to make sure they are in the good graces of the party that comes out on top.For example, the Real Estate Board PAC, which gave more than $260,000 to the Senate Republican Campaign Committee in 2016, had given them only $120,000 this year, as of the most recent filing. And it has donated $95,000 to the Democrats\u2019 committee, after giving nothing in 2016.Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, dismissed the lower spending totals, pointing to other groups that have ramped up their spending, such as Balance New York, a PAC funded by real estate, that had spent $1.8 million as of Nov. 1. The flood of campaign cash has meant that voters in competitive districts are seeing a torrent of television and digital advertisements, mailers and paid canvassers. Mr. Gaughran said he had opened four campaign offices across the district, hired twice as many staff members and was flush enough to be able to reimburse the expenses of a squadron of volunteers 20 to 25 times larger than in his last unsuccessful run in 2016.In Nassau County, where Anna Kaplan, a Democrat, is challenging the Republican incumbent, Elaine Phillips, cellphones light up with texts from the campaigns, and social media is awash with ads. Steve Tutino, who was eating lunch at a cafe near the Mineola train station, said he had been surprised to see that canvassers for Ms. Phillips had come to his door. \u201cThey left fliers, which hasn\u2019t happened in years,\u201d Mr. Tutino, 57, said.Amid much national conversation about the need for more civility in politics, candidates on both sides have accused their opponents of dirty tricks.On a lighter note, Mr. Gaughran was also on the end of some unflattering Photoshop attention: His head was pasted onto that of Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s satirical Borat character.In a Republican-held district in the Hudson Valley, the incumbent, Senator Terrence Murphy, accused his Democratic opponent, Peter Harckham, of sending paid protesters to his office and installing a camera to spy on the office. Mr. Harckham said the camera was pointed at a sign for his own campaign to make sure that no supporters of Mr. Murphy vandalized it.The short answer: a lot.\u201cIf it goes Democratic, all three branches would be Democratic,\u201d Professor Malbin said of the Senate. \u201cIt would have major consequences.\u201dIndeed, the Senate is the Republicans\u2019 last stronghold in state government, as New York City Democrats dominate the Assembly and voters have recently elected a string of Democratic governors. If the Senate also lands in Democratic hands, the Republicans will be virtually powerless to stop legislation that progressives have been demanding for years.The potential implications have energized Democrats not only in New York but across the country, as liberal states have sought to counteract some of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on the federal level. Mr. Gaughran\u2019s campaign has received more than 4,600 individual contributions since September, compared to fewer than 50 for Mr. Marcellino. Only about a fourth of Mr. Gaughran\u2019s contributions came from New York.\u201cWhat it\u2019s telling you is that there are people out there who recognize that this is potentially of national significance,\u201d Professor Malbin said.Advertisement"}

Think Again", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWithout a smarter approach to rural America, liberals will be stuck in the minority for a long time.Contributing Opinion WriterAs expected, the reality produced by Tuesday\u2019s results will be a split Congress, with Democrats running the House of Representatives and Republicans in charge of the Senate. Republicans will expand their Senate majority from the current 51-49 to as much as 54-46, pending the outcomes of a few races that as I write are still too close to call, but in which Republicans hold slim leads.Elected officials of both bodies will pay lip service to the idea of working together, and some of the more Panglossian pundits will express the hope that even this divided Congress will produce a deal on infrastructure spending or prescription drug prices. I guess maybe, but let\u2019s be realistic. What seems more likely is not only lack of cooperation but also active warfare between the two bodies.House Democrats will pass some progressive legislation, as they should, to show the nation their priorities heading into the next presidential election. But of course these bills will go nowhere in the Senate. If by some miracle the two chambers do manage to pass similar versions of a bill, the conference committee deliberations will be a food fight.So this is what we can expect. Two more years of continuing resolutions and possible government shutdowns. And if the Republicans do increase their majority to 54, it seems entirely possible that the Democrats might not recapture the majority there for a very long time indeed.From that list, I trust you can see the problem. If Democrats are having to count on North Carolina (where the party last elected a senator in 2008) and Georgia (2000) and Arizona (1988), they\u2019re barking up an awfully tall tree.In the nearer term, Democrats simply must find, field and finance candidates who can win statewide in purple states. I don\u2019t mean centrists \u2014 look at Phil Bredesen in Tennessee, who got clobbered. I mean candidates who can first excite base voters, because they must do that to be competitive, but who can also go out and get some votes in parts of these states where Democrats normally get crushed.I\u2019m tired of watching election-night returns and seeing dots of blue in oceans of red. Democrats won\u2019t make huge dents in those oceans, even with a solid rural strategy, but remember \u2014 they don\u2019t need to. As close as many elections are these days, small dents will do just fine. But unless Democrats make them, they may not hold the gavels in the Senate for quite some time.Advertisement"}

Many of those likely to run will try to straddle the party\u2019s ideological, geographical and generational divides, even as Mr. Trump continues to face challenges that could reshape the political landscape before Election Day.But at the recent donor conferences, centrist groups and think tanks affiliated with the moderate wing of the Democratic Party mostly took a back seat to organizations promoting more liberal ground organizing efforts focused on expanding the electoral map.At the annual winter meeting of the Democracy Alliance at a downtown Washington hotel this past week, the agenda featured groups focused on registering and mobilizing voters in Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas.The description for a session moderated by Ms. Gavito on \u201cbuilding progressive power in red states\u201d declared that \u201cone clear message of 2018 is that the progressive electoral map is widening,\u201d and could include Sun Belt states, and even deep-red states like Alaska, thanks to long-term investments in ground organizing.Conference leaders credited such efforts with helping progressive Democrats such as Mr. O\u2019Rourke, Ms. Abrams and Andrew Gillum, who narrowly lost the governor\u2019s race in Florida, run more competitive races than they otherwise might have.The leaders of several groups that worked to mobilize minority voters \u2014 including Black Voters Matter, BlackPAC, New Florida Majority and Color of Change \u2014 were granted coveted spots at the conference, allowing them to develop potentially lucrative relationships with the major donors in attendance.At the conference, which was closed to journalists, hundreds of donors and operatives kibitzed and debated the lessons of the midterms and the party\u2019s options for 2020 in formal sessions and sideline gaggles. A New York Times reporter was escorted by an alliance staff member away from a second-floor banquet hall that hosted catered meals and a Thursday evening reception with an open bar and passed hors d\u2019oeuvres, including tuna poke in waffle cones, and prosciutto and mozzarella skewers with a balsamic glaze.In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, most donors seemed bullish on the emerging strategy, which amounts to a shift of sorts. In the weeks after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, some in the group had warned of dire consequences if the party did not win back the white suburban and Rust Belt voters who had voted Democratic in recent presidential elections before swinging to Mr. Trump.\u201cThe data bears out that there is in fact a new American majority of people of color and progressive white voters,\u201d said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance donor who participated in a Thursday panel about winning elections in the age of Trump. Mr. Phillips, who was solicited afterward by a succession of activists seeking support for groups targeting minority voters, said in an interview that \u201ca lot of the donors are stepping up\u201d to support such groups.Gara LaMarche, the president of the Democracy Alliance, did not dispute the club\u2019s heightened focus on progressive organizing, but he said that it was not mutually exclusive with policy work and efforts to appeal to Rust Belt voters.\u201cIt\u2019s not about abandoning white working-class voters,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s about expanding the electorate and giving people reason to vote.\u201dIn a speech to the assembled donors on Thursday, he praised \u201cunapologetically progressive candidates who excite and inspire core progressive voters,\u201d according to his prepared remarks. And he singled out the efforts of other groups and donor coalitions that steered funds to help such candidates, including Way to Win.Way to Win is funded in large part by more than 120 female donors, including Susan Pritzker, a member of the family whose fortune stems from Hyatt Hotels. She traced her involvement in the coalition to the 2016 election, which she called \u201ca brutal wake-up call, throwing into sharp relief how broken our democratic processes had become.\u201d Way to Win consists of a political action committee called Way to Lead that donated money this year directly to candidates and a pair of nonprofit groups that donated millions more to groups organizing in those candidates\u2019 states, with a particular focus on Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Virginia and Texas.The goal is \u201cto shift the way political giving happens\u201d away from advertising and other outreach done by national groups, and toward ground organizing controlled by local groups, according to one of the group\u2019s founders, Leah Hunt-Hendrix.A granddaughter of the Texas oil billionaire H. L. Hunt, Ms. Hunt-Hendrix, who is also a Democracy Alliance member, is among the most influential young donors on the left.\u201cOne of the problems with political giving on the right and the left is when it\u2019s used to move a donor\u2019s agenda, whether it\u2019s Wall Street, tech or oil,\u201d Ms. Hunt-Hendrix said in an interview. Way to Win was created to counter factions of the Democratic donor class that she said were \u201csocially liberal but unwilling to challenge corporate power and the accumulation and concentration of wealth.\u201dBut Mr. Brock and his groups still garner significant support from the party\u2019s major donor class, including from Democracy Alliance members. One of his groups hosted a dinner presentation on Wednesday night highlighting its 2018 efforts, which drew more than 40 top donors.And Matt Bennett, an executive at Third Way, said it would be \u201cinsane\u201d to minimize efforts to win back traditional \u201cblue wall\u201d states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that Mr. Trump won in 2016.\u201cBy all means, let\u2019s try to engage more voters in these emerging places like the South,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to try to extend ourselves into tough states while neglecting to rebuild in the states where we traditionally won presidential races would be political malpractice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As the debt level has risen, so has the number of borrowers who have fallen behind or defaulted on what they owe.Mr. Frotman, the new group\u2019s executive director, will be joined by two other former employees of the consumer bureau, Bonnie Latreille and Mike Pierce, and a group of fellows and advisers that also draws heavily on former bureau staff members.The project is funded by the Sandler Foundation, a San Francisco-based charity that financed the creation of public policy groups like the Center for Responsible Lending and the Center for American Progress.Mr. Frotman said his group\u2019s goal would be to aid policymakers and litigators working to strengthen borrower protections. In particular, it will focus on efforts by state lawmakers and attorneys general to increase their oversight of student loan lenders and servicers.In Albany on Tuesday, Mr. Frotman urged the State Assembly to act more aggressively to protect borrowers in New York.\u201cThere is no cavalry on the horizon \u2014 certainly not in this administration,\u201d he said at a committee hearing about student debt.Advertisement"}

Why Would Tencent Music Do One?", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTencent Music\u2019s initial public offering will test out global I.P.O. markets.China\u2019s answer to Spotify may push on with a $2 billion listing in New York this December, according to several media reports that cite unidentified sources. It is a bad time of the year to sell new equity and Tencent has already pared back its plans. A subdued deal would confirm fears that the window for sizable offerings is closing fast.A global stock sell-off has already hit Tencent\u2019s plan to spin off its majority-owned streaming arm, which owns the QQ Music app. In May, the $354 billion gaming and social media company hoped to raise as much as $4 billion in a deal that would have valued Tencent Music Entertainment at $25 billion, sources told International Financing Review. The Chinese company delayed its October plan to go public after halving the size of its planned offer, according to Reuters.Large investors in the United States prefer to shy away from big deals during the festive period. Just three companies have launched December New York offerings of more than $1 billion in the past decade, according to data from Refinitiv. Tencent would stretch the precedent: The Financial Times says shares of the music unit will start trading on Dec. 12, later than any of these earlier year-end offerings.Other Chinese technology outfits rushing to market have had to lower their valuations. The Alibaba-backed parenting site, Babytree, has just priced its Hong Kong debut at the bottom of the marketed range, valuing it at $1.5 billion, compared to the $2 billion it was pegged at earlier this year. The online travel agent Tongcheng-Elong, which counts Tencent as its largest shareholder, set its I.P.O. valuation almost 30 percent lower than in a May funding round.The execution risk hardly seems worthwhile. Tencent Music doesn\u2019t obviously need fresh funds: The unit is already profitable and had roughly 9.5 billion yuan, or around $1.4 billion, in cash as of June, according to its I.P.O. prospectus.Anything less than a strong and compelling deal before New Year\u2019s will signal a gloomy year ahead for others waiting to I.P.O.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Fashion Star is Crowned, and He\u2019s Not Afraid of Controversy", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss wins the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund prize. The evening before Americans went to the polls to cast their votes in the midterm elections, some of the most powerful gatekeepers in American fashion cast a vote of their own. For change.\u201cAt a time when our world faces so many challenges, I\u2019m impressed by this year\u2019s winners,\u201d said Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue and artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast. \u201cTheir work highlights a high degree of creativity and a deep-rooted commitment to the notion of community,\u201d she added, calling it an expression of \u201cthe optimism and inclusivity of the very best American fashion.\u201dThe two runners-up were Emily Adams Bode, whose men\u2019s wear brand Bode focuses on sustainability and craft, and Jonathan Cohen, whose namesake women\u2019s line has its roots in painterliness and print.The award may have been a surprise for the designer, but it wasn\u2019t for most of the audience, which gave him a standing ovation.Mr. Jean-Raymond founded his label in 2013 as a men\u2019s wear brand, and first started using the runway as a means to explore activism in 2015 with a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d collection (never sold and currently in the archive of the National Museum of African-American History and Culture). That was followed by a show that juxtaposed the ideas of Bernie Madoff and Bernie Sanders. But it wasn\u2019t until late last year, when he bought his company back from his financers and became the sole owner, that he truly found a unique and multilayered voice \u2014 as well as a deal with Reebok that provided a certain amount of security.He has since shied away from calling his company a fashion brand, saying he thinks of it more as an art project or a social experiment, though it also involves very good clothes. He uses it almost as a freewheeling exploration of various aspects of black history, from the Negro Motorist Green Book (a travel guide used by African-Americans to navigate the Jim Crow South) to once-defining brands like Cross Colours and FUBU.\u201cI\u2019m a designer \u2014 I don\u2019t need another designer around me,\u201d he said. \u201cI need different perspectives. I need an architect! They all love fashion, but none of them are jaded about fashion.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to be jaded about the fashion fund itself, which was celebrating its 15th anniversary (fashion loves an anniversary). Established to support the American fashion industry in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, it has unquestionably nurtured some designer names that have become full-fledged brands core to the New York Fashion identity: Proenza Schouler, Thom Browne, Prabal Gurung, Joseph Altuzarra. But as a booklet left on every plate listing all winners, runners-up and finalists since 2004 perhaps inadvertently demonstrated, several previously celebrated names have also dropped away: Behnaz Sarafpour, Trovata, Doo.Ri, Rogan and Sophie Theallet, to name a few.It\u2019s not an award\u2019s job to guarantee success, of course. The $400,000 prize and a yearlong mentorship with an established fashion executive does not a secure business make, though it helps. (Runners-up each get $150,000 and mentorship.) But it does reveal that talent and a moment in the spotlight isn\u2019t enough. Most of all, a designer needs a unique point of view and the patience to break through. Mr. Jean-Raymond has that.He also other qualities that help with success: a sense of humor, and some perspective on it all. Accepting his award, he noted of the famously intimidating Ms. Wintour, \u201cI\u2019m going to say something that Anna probably doesn\u2019t want me to say: She\u2019s a really nice person.\u201dIt was a striking sentiment to hear from a podium in the current political climate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ethics Committee Rebukes Mark Meadows Over Aide\u2019s Sexual Misconduct", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House Ethics Committee issued a rare letter of reproval on Friday to Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, for mishandling sexual harassment allegations against a top aide, after complaints from six female staff members that his former chief of staff frequently engaged in unwanted touching and stared down their blouses.The committee faulted Mr. Meadows for failing \u201cto take prompt and decisive action to deal with the alleged sexual harassment\u201d by the aide, Kenny West, who was dismissed from the office in 2015. Although Mr. Meadows banned Mr. West from his Washington office, curtailed his responsibilities and forbade him to contact female employees, he improperly continued to compensate Mr. West for four months until firing him, committee investigators found.\u201cRepresentative Meadows could have and should have done more to ensure that his congressional office was free from discrimination or the perception of discrimination,\u201d the committee wrote in its bipartisan report. It ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the United States Treasury approximately $40,000 that he paid Mr. West in salary that the committee said was not commensurate with his work.The report continued a year of reckoning on sexual misconduct that swept out lawmakers and staff members accused of improprieties and cast an unwelcome and unflattering spotlight on Mr. Meadows, an influential conservative. His office did not respond to a request for comment.In an extensive report released on Friday, the committee detailed that several female staff members complained to Mr. Meadows that Mr. West routinely put his hands on their backs and shoulders, pulled their hair, and stared down their blouses and up their skirts. He also made inappropriate comments about their physical appearances, witnesses said, telling one woman that he could not believe \u201cyour husband lets you out\u201d looking \u201cthat way.\u201dFrustration in the office came to a head in October 2014 when a group of employees met with Mr. Meadows\u2019s deputy chief of staff at the time to discuss the inappropriate conduct. The congressman held a meeting with his staff in January and said he would \u201ctake care of it,\u201d multiple witnesses told investigators. He then removed Mr. West from his Washington office and changed his title to \u201csenior adviser.\u201dProblems continued when Mr. West unexpectedly showed up at Mr. Meadows\u2019s district office in North Carolina and was asked by staff members not to return. Mr. Meadows later announced that Mr. West would leave the office entirely.But Mr. West continued to be compensated at the same rate, a decision Mr. Meadows made \u201cfor the sake of a smooth transition,\u201d he wrote in a 2015 letter submitted to the Office of Congressional Ethics, noting that \u201cKenny did continue to perform some services and was paid through August 2015.\u201dBoth Mr. Meadows and Mr. West refused to cooperate with the office\u2019s review.A year ago, both chambers passed resolutions that would require all members and their staffs to attend annual sexual harassment awareness training seminars. Incoming freshmen members received training on how to prevent and respond to harassment and discrimination this week as part of their new-member orientation.Legislation that would hold lawmakers accountable for harassment and reform the procedures on Capitol Hill, however, has yet to reach the president\u2019s desk. While both chambers have passed their own versions, discrepancies have not been resolved.\u201cThe committee is conscious of the current climate, as the nation seeks a more full-throated societal condemnation of sexual harassment than what has been the norm of past generations,\u201d the report said. \u201cAs representatives of the people, the House should be a leader in this national conversation.\u201dEmily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The comment stirred up the painful history of lynchings in Mississippi and elsewhere.Since then, several large corporations, including Walmart, AT&T and Pfizer, have also asked for their contributions to be returned.An earlier version of this article misstated the manner in which a Giants owner, Charles Johnson, and his wife donated to Cindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign. The donation was made directly to the campaign, not through a super PAC. An earlier version also published statements from Johnson and the Giants in error. They referred to a different donation by Johnson, not his contribution of Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign. The article also misstated the timing of M.L.B.\u2019s donation to Hyde-Smith.

She was 64.Her husband, Michael Riesman, said the cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease.Ms. Riesman had done some acting, sold designer clothes, worked for a German film distributor and served as an associate producer on a movie when she became intrigued by the idea of covering the film industry in a realm known as the World Wide Web.Film Scouts, which started on AOL in 1994 and shifted to its own website two years later, took an entertaining approach to storytelling that earned it high rankings among the growing selection of movie sites by Yahoo and Netscape. Visitors to the site were guided by an animated character, Jerry the usher, to the site\u2019s \u201ctheaters\u201d to read or watch its content.As the self-proclaimed Chief Film Scout, Ms. Riesman toted a camcorder to festivals to record interviews with dozens of actors, including Andy Garcia, Kenneth Branagh and Rosanna Arquette, and directors like Robert Altman and Mike Leigh. She also wrote diary posts about her festival experiences and, with Kathleen Carroll, a former film critic for The Daily News in New York, irreverent guides to the Cannes Film Festival.\u201cShe was elegant and quite bright and just loved movies,\u201d Ms. Carroll said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd she loved being in places like Cannes.

{"Headline": "Democrats Have Two Paths for 2020: Daring or Defensive. Can They Settle on Either?", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For Democrats, the victories, near wins and stinging losses on Tuesday have intensified a debate in the party about how to retake the White House, with moderates arguing they must find a candidate who can appeal to President Trump\u2019s supporters and historically Republican suburbanites, and progressives claiming they need someone with the raw authenticity to electrify the grass roots.The schism reflects the party\u2019s longstanding internecine tensions, which flared again this year when insurgents on the left challenged establishment-aligned candidates while voicing urgent calls for change and a more confrontational approach to the president.And it raises questions about whether Democrats can deliver a consistent message to voters and unite behind one nominee from a slate of candidates who could range from socialists to pragmatic centrists.\u201cWe need a candidate who has the ability to mobilize the entirety of the base, people of color, millennials and also folks in the suburbs,\u201d said Adrianne Shropshire, who runs BlackPAC, an African-American political organizing group.Already auditioning for that role is an eclectic group of ambitious Democrats, including three senators who appear all but certain to run: Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey. All three have moved well past the point of simply weighing a candidacy, and are assembling the infrastructure for a campaign as they prepare to make their final decisions.Two potentially formidable entrants, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles acknowledged this week that they are considering campaigns. And Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana was in New York in the days after the election meeting with wealthy party donors, introducing himself as a dark horse from a red state with the ability to reach out to rural America.Mr. Bullock is not alone in viewing rural outreach as a priority. Pragmatic Democrats hold up the party\u2019s defeat in the Ohio governor\u2019s race and red-state Senate races \u2014 and a handful of closer-than-expected Senate victories in the Midwest \u2014 to argue that Democrats must get serious about devising a message that can appeal to rural, largely white voters.They point as well to the middle-of-the-road ideology of many of the Democrats who prevailed in difficult congressional races. While numerous young people, women and minority candidates were elected to the House, few advocated far-left policy ideas.\u201cPeople need to realize my problem wasn\u2019t getting Democrats to vote for me,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, who was defeated Tuesday in Missouri. \u201cI hope that no one thinks that because some of the red-state Democrat moderates lost that means we have to nominate a progressive.\u201dThe more sensible answer, Ms. McCaskill said, would be to find Mr. Trump\u2019s political and stylistic opposite, perhaps \u201ceven a boring candidate.\u201d She mentioned a handful of little-known senators and governors who exude vanilla.\u201cThe way Democrats win is to run for every seat unashamed, to leave it all on the field and to show up every time,\u201d said Gina Hinojosa, a Texas state legislator, arguing that Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s approach must become \u201cthe new normal.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke would be the party\u2019s best nominee because he offers \u201cthe sort of authentic voice that people are so thirsty for,\u201d Ms. Hinojosa said.But while Mr. O\u2019Rourke has quickly become a beloved figure among many grass-roots activists, some elders in the party argue that Democrats should be careful about swooning too soon.\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for rock stars but I don\u2019t think the country is looking for rock stars,\u201d said Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa and agriculture secretary for President Barack Obama.Asked specifically about Mr. O\u2019Rourke, Mr. Vilsack suggested it would be odd to nominate a candidate who was just defeated. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good idea to win the first race you were interested in,\u201d he said, adding, tongue-in-cheek, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s the new Abe Lincoln, you lose a race and then run for president and win.\u201dOne of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s advisers, asked how the Congressman could go from losing a Senate race to running for president, responded by noting that the country had elected a celebrity president in 2016.There is broad agreement among Democrats that the most encouraging election returns came from a handful of rust belt states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 three states vital to Mr. Trump\u2019s Electoral College victory in 2016 and where Democrats won Senate and governors\u2019 races on Tuesday \u2014 as well as Minnesota, where Mr. Trump nearly pulled off a fourth blue-state upset over Hillary Clinton.If those states continue to tilt back toward Democrats, Mr. Trump would have only a narrow path to 270 electoral votes.But in an ominous result for Democrats, two swing states \u2014 Iowa and Ohio \u2014 appeared to move decisively away from them, and Florida, the country\u2019s largest swing state and another state Mr. Trump won in 2016, remained agonizingly elusive. Should those three states tilt toward Mr. Trump in 2020, it would leave Democrats squeezed across the rest of the map.\u201cTo win the upper Midwest and Florida we have to do two things Obama was able to do: get exceptionally strong African-American turnout and also get a higher proportion of noncollege whites,\u201d said Robby Mook, who ran Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, adding that Mr. Obama\u2019s success was a reminder that there doesn\u2019t have to be an either-or solution to the party\u2019s goal of defeating Mr. Trump.\u201cBarack Obama was not an old white guy but he checked these boxes,\u201d Mr. Mook said.Because of the m\u00e9lange of results Tuesday, there was little to deter ambitious Democrats from moving ahead with preparations for 2020, most of them eyeing early announcements to avoid letting any competitors catch fire.Ms. Harris, the senator from California, is seen by allies as likely to announce a campaign early in next year, after the release of a book due out in January. Her sister, Maya Harris, a former top adviser to Mrs. Clinton, has already been quietly gauging the intentions of some influential Democrats in order to have an early roster of supporters ready.The Harris camp has also been reaching out to potential campaign staff members who could manage fund-raising operations and a strategy for amassing convention delegates over a long primary while the senator herself has been courting Democrats in the states that begin the nominating process, such as Mr. Vilsack and former Gov. James Hodge of South Carolina.Allies of Mr. Booker, the senator from New Jersey, spent this week highlighting his efforts to help candidates in states crucial to the presidential nominating process, while he began considering staffing decisions.Multiple Democrats said that Addisu Demissie, who just ran the campaign of Gavin Newsom, the governor-elect of California, could potentially serve as a top official in either Mr. Booker\u2019s campaign or a super PAC that allies of the senator may launch.Ms. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, is moving just as swiftly. Among scores of congratulatory phone calls she placed this week, Ms. Warren spoke with a list of influential Democrats in early presidential primary states. They included Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, two newly elected members of Congress from Iowa, as well as Molly Kelly, the Democrat who lost a race for governor of New Hampshire.Ms. Warren also called Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader who remains Nevada\u2019s most influential Democrat, to congratulate him on the party\u2019s clean sweep there, people familiar with the phone call said.And in a sign that Ms. Warren\u2019s deliberations have proceeded to an advanced stage, one of her closest and longest-serving aides, Dan Geldon, has left his position as her chief of staff in the Senate to manage the operation that is planning her likely campaign, which may get underway as soon as next month.Perhaps the two best-known figures in the 2020 field, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, and Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, have indicated they are still deciding whether to run. Mr. Biden has consistently said he would make up his mind by the end of the year, though some supporters fear that deadline could slip.Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers see him as a natural fit for a presidential race that hinges on Midwestern swing states where he has long been popular. But Mr. Biden, 75, has also stressed that he is concerned about the impact of a campaign on his family, and his close associates have privately acknowledged that the midterm campaign was intensely taxing for him.He called one victorious candidate this week, who said he was eager to know Mr. Biden\u2019s own plans \u2014 but the former vice president did not sound overly enthused, responding that he was in no rush to have that discussion, according to a Democrat briefed on the conversation.Mr. Biden\u2019s generational peer, Mr. Sanders, faces some similar considerations, and has said that he is most preoccupied with assessing whether he is the best candidate to win back the Midwest. Many of the candidates he and his progressive allies had supported lost on Tuesday.With few exceptions, the major contenders largely overlap in their stated policy views but differ in revealing ways in their political priorities and rhetorical framing: Ms. Warren campaigns chiefly as an opponent of corporate power and her signature proposal so far is a sweeping anti-corruption bill. Ms. Harris has offered an ambitious tax bill, and presents herself as a champion of racial justice and social inclusion.Several underdog candidates have claimed signature issues, like dark money in politics for Mr. Bullock.There is near-unanimity across the field on matters like expanding government-backed health care and campaign finance regulation \u2014 and opposition to every major component of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.For many in the party, though, the question at hand is not whether to veer toward Sanders-style liberalism or pivot back to careful moderation \u2014 it\u2019s how to find a nominee, of whatever ideological bearing, who can tangle with a ruthless adversary like President Trump.Todd Rutherford, a Democratic state legislator in South Carolina, said the party needed a candidate \u201cwho understands battling Trump.\u2019\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s not about who has the best policy or the best story,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Rutherford said. \u201cIt\u2019s about who can sell the best story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nick Ayers Is Rising Fast in Trump\u2019s Washington. How Far Will He Go?", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 To a president who likes his aides to have a certain kind of central-casting mien, Nick Ayers definitely looks the part.A floppy-haired, dimple-chinned political operative with a disarming Southern drawl, Mr. Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, resembles an ambitious \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d character who wandered onto the set of the Trump reality show.It is no accident that his name keeps resurfacing as a possible twist in the plotline.And that twist is the belief among many Republicans in Washington that Mr. Ayers, 36, is simply biding his time working for Mr. Pence until the day he moves up to work for Mr. Trump himself, and replaces John F. Kelly, the permanently endangered retired general, as White House chief of staff.With the president noncommittal about Mr. Kelly\u2019s future and quizzing his aides and even Mr. Pence about their loyalty, Mr. Ayers\u2019s rapid ascent, lucrative business ventures and golden boy reputation are again under the microscope as speculation over a White House staff shake-up is rekindled.\u201cHe\u2019s a winner,\u201d said Alec Poitevint, who worked with Mr. Ayers when Mr. Ayers dropped out of Kennesaw State University to help lead Sonny Perdue\u2019s successful 2002 bid for Georgia governor. \u201cI think there are probably some people that are jealous of that.\u201dIndeed, even the possibility of Mr. Ayers being tapped as Mr. Trump\u2019s top aide has prompted grumbling from within the White House and Washington\u2019s Republican professional class, where critics have long cast him as more focused on expanding his reputation and bank account than effective management.His wealth, accumulated partly through a complicated web of political and consulting companies in which he held ownership stakes, evoked to some the swamp that Mr. Trump has pledged to drain, though Mr. Ayers also holds significant investments in other sectors, including farmland in his native Georgia worth $2.5 million to $11 million.By contrast, Mr. Kelly and his predecessor as chief of staff, Reince Priebus, came to the job with little in the way of wealth and far fewer financial ties to Washington\u2019s political industrial complex. Both men also had far more experience as administrators, but neither had much luck taming the chaos created by Mr. Trump and his factions of feuding aides.Still, in interviews with nearly a dozen of Mr. Ayers\u2019s confidants, White House officials and former administration officials, Mr. Ayers was invariably described as someone who could bring to the White House the political skills that Mr. Kelly lacks. And, they say, he has been effective in protecting and elevating Mr. Pence while also forging alliances with influential members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter Ivanka Trump.But the president tends to keep staffing decisions close to his chest, often announcing his choices after lengthy cliffhangers. One senior administration official said Mr. Ayers is not the only possible replacement Mr. Trump has considered.Mr. Ayers did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor did the White House or the vice president\u2019s office.Privately, Mr. Ayers has done little to stop the speculation. According to a former senior administration official, he has openly discussed with his allies the possibility of succeeding Mr. Kelly, something that has not gone unnoticed in the West Wing.Even if he does not end up next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, it has been a rapid and lucrative rise for Mr. Ayers since his start as a 20-year-old personal aide in Mr. Perdue\u2019s come-from-behind-victory as Georgia\u2019s first Republican governor since Reconstruction.Less than two years later, Mr. Ayers was named campaign manager for Mr. Perdue\u2019s successful re-election campaign, and after that, he took a job running the Republican Governors Association. At the time, the group was something of an afterthought in the Republican big-money landscape. But Mr. Ayers grew it into a political juggernaut that corralled six- and seven-figure donations from some of the biggest donors on the right.In the process, he built connections with elite donors, vendors and political figures that would form the basis for his own private consulting business. When he left the governors association, he accepted a partnership in an ad-buying firm called Target Enterprises that was paid millions of dollars by the group for ad buys.\u201cI know other folks would love to make a big issue out of this,\u201d Mr. Ayers was shown saying on the video. \u201cAnd I just ask for your consideration on that.\u201dHenry Barbour, a lobbyist and a Republican National Committee member, said in an interview that Mr. Ayers \u201cprobably was too absorbed in his work early on\u201d and has learned to balance his ambition with his family and faith. Like his current boss, Mr. Ayers is deeply religious.\u201cNick\u2019s not perfect,\u201d Mr. Barbour said. \u201cBut he realizes that. I think he\u2019s really grown as an individual and as a man.\u201dThe venture that perhaps best epitomized Mr. Ayers\u2019s ambition \u2014 and the backlash to it \u2014 was a company called Advance Media Capital. Mr. Ayers and his associates created it in July 2015 mostly to purchase large chunks of television airtime in swing states months before the 2016 election. The company planned to package the airtime with targeting data and sell it to deep-pocketed political committees, including \u201csuper PACs,\u201d at higher rates closer to Election Day, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and interviews with people involved in the effort.When Mr. Trump tapped Mr. Pence as his running mate, Mr. Ayers became an adviser to the campaign, and, when Mr. Trump won, Mr. Ayers joined the transition team. Shortly after Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence took office, Mr. Ayers helped start a nonprofit group and a super PAC to support the new administration. Before joining Mr. Pence\u2019s staff, Mr. Ayers divested from Media Group of America, the company said. Not long after, he and his family divested from C5 Creative Consulting as well, according to the vice president\u2019s office.Mr. Ayers has openly toyed with his own political ambitions, including the possibility of running for governor of Georgia. And he has told people close to him that he does not intend to work in Washington for long, leading some to question whether he would accept the job as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff.Either way, there will be opportunities awaiting Mr. Ayers when he leaves public service, said Toby Neugebauer, a major Republican donor who was one of the lead investors in Advance Media Capital.Mr. Neugebauer said he introduced Mr. Ayers to several of the other investors, and has told Mr. Ayers that they would be ready to finance his efforts on another project.\u201cI don\u2019t even care about his political connections. I would back him just based on business acumen, and I know other members of the Forbes 400 who would, as well,\u201d said Mr. Neugebauer, referring to Forbes magazine\u2019s list of the richest Americans. \u201cHe is that smart.\u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "El Chapo\u2019s Narco Spoils: A Beach House, a Zoo and a Fleet of Cash-Filled Jets", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis $10 million beach house sat along the coast in Acapulco. Moored offshore was the Chapito \u2014 the yacht he named after himself.One of his ranches, in rural Guadalajara, Mexico, had tennis courts and pools around the residence. There was even a zoo where guests could board a train to ride among crocodiles and panthers.In the early 1990s, as Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the Mexican crime lord known as El Chapo, began succeeding as a drug-world entrepreneur, he started making money \u2014 tons of it, one of his first employees testified on Tuesday. There was so much cash that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n used an expensive method to repatriate his profits: He flew the money back from the United States to Mexico in a fleet of private jets.By his account, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n would on a whim go to Macau to gamble or fly to Switzerland for a rejuvenation cure. He not only gave diamond-studded watches to his workers, but also once paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to commission a folk song about one of his slain friends.\u201cWhen I met Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, he didn\u2019t have a jet,\u201d Mr. Mart\u00ednez told a spellbound jury in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. \u201cBut in the \u201890s, he already had four jets. He had houses at every single beach. He had a ranch in every single state.\u201dSome of the millions he made were hidden in stashes, one of which sat underneath a bed that could be raised off the floor on a hydraulic-powered lift. Mr. Mart\u00ednez testified that once a month, he personally wheeled a Samsonite suitcase, stuffed with at least $10 million, into a Mexico City bank to place in Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s account.Such high living slowly took its toll on Mr. Mart\u00ednez, who said that he began to snort as much as four grams of cocaine a day \u2014 often, he admitted, from a gold spoon dipped into a little gold canister. He financed his habit with the $1 million that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n gave him every year. His addiction was destructive enough that eventually the drugs burned through his septum.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, in contrast, emerged in court on Tuesday as much less of a sybarite. He enjoyed his whiskey, beer and cognac, Mr. Mart\u00ednez said, and seemed to have a particular fondness for women. But while Mr. Guzm\u00e1n kept four or five mistresses throughout the 1990s, Mr. Mart\u00ednez suggested he was not so much in love as he was jealous \u2014 often spying on his girlfriends with a wiretap.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was not the only one who reveled in extravagance. Mr. Mart\u00ednez recounted, for example, how he and his boss once went to visit Juan Jos\u00e9 Esparragoza, a veteran trafficker who was serving time in prison. When the two men arrived, they discovered their colleague at a jailhouse party, surrounded by waiters, cooks and a mariachi band. Dinner was being served and the guests had a menu to choose from: lobster, steak or pheasant.But as was often the case in Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s orbit, luxury was never far from bloodshed. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had paid the visit to the respected older trafficker to ask for his permission to assassinate a rival, Mr. Mart\u00ednez said.At that time, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n and his crew were waging war with the Tijuana drug cartel in a gothic, gruesome conflict. The wife of one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s allies had already had her throat slit. The ally\u2019s two young children were also victims of the fighting: They had been tossed off a bridge by an assassin.In his testimony Tuesday, Mr. Mart\u00ednez offered a startling account of the cardinal\u2019s death, saying that his killers had slain him accidentally while gunning for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n. The hit took place in the middle of the Guadalajara airport, he recalled. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n escaped the hail of bullets by fleeing past a baggage carousel and out onto the street \u2014 all while toting a suitcase filled with $600,000 in cash.Despite these grisly stories, Mr. Mart\u00ednez claimed in court that he was not a violent man. In fact, he said, the only time he ever owned a gun, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n told him to get rid of it. The kingpin was worried he might hurt himself.But once, he said, he asked his boss why he was so enamored of hostility.\u201cI said to him, \u2018Why kill people?\u2019\u201d Mr. Mart\u00ednez told the jury. \u201cAnd he answered me: \u2018Either your mom\u2019s going to cry or their mom\u2019s going to cry.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Costly Raising of Argentine Submarine May Not Yield Answers or Bodies, Experts Say", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExperts say the salvage operation appears to be feasible. But the financially struggling administration of President Mauricio Macri is not eager to pay for it despite pressure from families who want to recover the bodies of their loved ones.For now, the only official in a position to order the vessel to be lifted quickly does not seem in a hurry to do so.Marta Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, the federal judge who is in charge of the investigation into the sinking of the submarine, the San Juan, is working with experts to review 67,000 photographs and videos of the submarine and its surroundings to determine what exactly happened to the vessel.But it is unclear how long the review could take, she said.Those images are to be provided by the end of the month by Ocean Infinity, the Houston-based company that found the San Juan a week ago. If they don\u2019t provide a clear explanation and if it appears her investigation would be helped by studying the sub itself, Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez could order a feasibility study to find if the San Juan could be lifted from the seabed.The judge has made clear she would order it pulled up only if it helped the investigation, not for any other reason.\u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to be patient,\u201d said Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez in a phone interview from her courthouse in Caleta Olivia in the southern province of Santa Cruz.Among the relatives of the submarine\u2019s crew members, who have been waiting more than a year for news of their loved ones, patience is in short supply.\u201cThe judge is very slow,\u201d complained Natalia Tocon\u00e1s, 33, whose brother, Mario Armando Tocon\u00e1s, was aboard the San Juan. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to us to pressure her to act.\u201dThe demand for the vessel\u2019s salvage is a new chapter in the families\u2019 long battle with officials for answers.Many family members believe the Argentine government would have never hired Ocean Infinity, promising a $7.5 million payout if the submarine was found, if it had not been for the pressure they exerted, including camping outside the presidential palace in Buenos Aires for almost two months.\u201cIf you don\u2019t fight, no one does anything for you,\u201d explained Alejandra Aguilera, 43, who is also a sister of Mr. Tocon\u00e1s. \u201cNow we are going after the judge.\u201dSome family members have filmed a video calling on Judge Y\u00e1\u00f1ez to order the lifting of the San Juan, which they plan to release once she receives the images from Ocean Infinity.Mirta Laz, 70, the mother of another crew member, Alberto S\u00e1nchez, was one of approximately two dozen family members who gathered this past week outside the naval base in Mar del Plata, a coastal city that was the base of the San Juan, to demand that the submarine be lifted.\u201cThis is just getting started,\u201d she said. \u201cWe finally know where it is. We need to go get it.\u201dNot all family members agree.Luis Tagliapietra, who is the father of Alejandro Tagliapietra, was aboard the Ocean Infinity-operated search vessel as one of four auditors representing family members when the San Juan was found.Running such a huge operation to pull up the submarine made no sense to him, he said.\u201cHe was a sailor, he loved the sea,\u201d Mr. Tagliapietra said of his son.Experts, however, disagree.A salvage operation would not be simple or cheap, but there\u2019s no reason to believe it couldn\u2019t be done. Whether it is worthwhile though is another matter, they said.\u201cThere are many operations that were perceived to be close to impossible\u201d before they were carried out successfully, said Richard Janssen, managing director of SMIT Salvage, a subsidiary of the Dutch company Boskalis.That submarine was 380 feet below the surface of the water, compared with almost 3,000 feet for the San Juan, but it was also eight times larger.While the Kursk\u2019s raising is often mentioned as an example of what a San Juan salvage operation might resemble, efforts to salvage wrecks from deeper depths give a better sense of the chances of the Argentine submarine\u2019s recovery.Considering how much technology has improved since then, going an additional 1,000 feet down to reach the San Juan should not be seen as prohibitive, as that depth is nothing out of the ordinary in oil and gas exploration, Mr. Janssen said.Stewart Little, who runs the Submarine Rescue Consultancy and worked with submarines for more than 30 years in the British Royal Navy, said technical issues were not the problem.\u201cIs it feasible?\u201d Mr. Little said. \u201cYes. Is it too deep? No. It\u2019s just the financing that would be an issue.\u201dAlthough the operation\u2019s potential cost is difficult to assess without detailed information about the seabed and the state of the submarine, Mr. Little estimated that any salvage effort would have to start with a budget of about $100 million.The real question that must be answered before an operation is begun, experts said, is why.\u201cConsidering the San Juan imploded, there may not be much in the way of remains inside and even if there are, it likely won\u2019t be all of them,\u201d said Neil Hopkins, who worked at the British Defense Ministry for 30 years as a civil engineer specializing in submarine design and construction. He now runs Sonistics, a company that specializes in submarine rescues.If the submarine is raised, he said, \u201cDo you say to 44 families, we can identify 14 of them but not the other 30?\u201dOne reason to spend money salvaging the vessel would be to get information to prevent future accidents, but considering the age of the San Juan, within five years that information would not be relevant to any other submarine in operation, and the whole effort would be \u201can academic exercise with no practical value,\u201d Mr. Little said.As an alternative to salvaging, the Argentine Navy could designate the submarine a grave and come up with a plan to take the families to the site once a year so they could pay their respects, Mr. Hopkins suggested.Advertisement"}

She came out swinging against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, discussed the challenges of being a single mother and promoted indigenous sovereignty as a professed \u201c35th-generation New Mexican.\u201d In a relatively liberal district encompassing Albuquerque, that messaging worked.\u201cI\u2019ve been organizing in New Mexico for close to 20 years, so it\u2019s not like people weren\u2019t familiar with me or what I stand for,\u201d Ms. Haaland, 57, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe have an extremely divisive president who disparages so many people. I felt like it was just time to stand up with a positive campaign.\u201dAnother congressional race in New Mexico involving a Native American candidate was decided on Wednesday night, with the Republican, Yvette Herrell, a member of the Cherokee Nation, losing to Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat and water rights lawyer, after absentee ballots were counted. Unlike many Native American politicians in other races, Ms. Herrell did not promote her indigenous heritage while campaigning.\u201cIt\u2019s 2018 and women, Native Americans, gay people, the unemployed and underemployed have to fight like hell to survive,\u201d Ms. Davids, 38, said in one of her campaign ads. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Trump and the Republicans in Washington don\u2019t give a damn about anyone like me or anyone who doesn\u2019t think like them.\u201dJean Schroedel, a professor of political science at Claremont Graduate University in California, who studies Native American voting rights, said Ms. Davids\u2019s campaign offered a blueprint for other candidates seeking to frame issues from a Native American perspective.\u201cSharice not only won but just took out a rising star of the Republican Party,\u201d Professor Schroedel said, referring to Ms. Davids\u2019s opponent, Representative Kevin Yoder, a four-term incumbent who championed conservative causes. \u201cDemocrats have been targeting that seat for several cycles and she showed them how to get it done.\u201dThe election of Ms. Haaland and Ms. Davids will double the number of Native Americans in Congress. They will join two Republicans from Oklahoma, Tom Cole, a member of the Chickasaw Nation, and Markwayne Mullin, of the Cherokee Nation.Congressional victories in the midterms drew the most attention, but Native American political organizers say that advances at the state and local levels were just as crucial. They cited continuing battles to enfranchise voters across the country who have long been marginalized.States including New Mexico and Arizona effectively barred many Native Americans from voting for decades after they were given the right in the 1920s. Elsewhere, districts were gerrymandered to bolster white candidates.In San Juan County in southeastern Utah, where Native Americans have long outnumbered white people, Navajo Democrats waged a protracted legal battle to realign voting districts to better reflect the county\u2019s population. A federal judge in 2017 ordered the county to redraw boundaries to give Navajos a majority in two of three county commission districts.The battle did not end there: Republicans in the county tried to prevent a Navajo candidate, Willie Grayeyes, from running for county commission this year, saying he lived across the Utah border in Arizona. Officials removed Mr. Grayeyes from the ballot before a federal court determined that a county clerk had falsified documentation in the case.Mr. Grayeyes appeared on the ballot on Tuesday. And he won.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gun-Safety Issue Is Actually Helping Democrats", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMidterm election results suggest that the power of the N.R.A. may be diminishing.Mr. Spitzer has written five books on gun policy.It is an unsettling coincidence that mass shootings bookended the 2018 election, from a Pittsburgh synagogue on Oct. 27 to a bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Nov. 7. The election that took place in between, though, demonstrated that Democrats and even some Republicans found gun-safety advocacy a boon to their campaigns in a way not seen in a long time. In comparison with previous elections, the gun-rights forces\u2019 customary blaring megaphone seemed nowhere near as loud as usual \u2014 or as effective. This is borne out by an examination of public attitudes, candidate positions, money and exposure.Consider first the public environment. According to Pew Research Center analysis, more Americans now favor gun regulation (52 percent) over gun rights (44 percent), a reversal from 2016. And 57 percent say gun laws should be stricter, compared with 52 percent in 2017. A recent Kaiser Foundation poll found gun policy to be the third most important concern of voters, behind health care and the economy. Similarly, Election Day exit polling found the same rank order, except that gun policy was bumped to fourth by immigration \u2014 a position it probably would not have lost but for President Trump\u2019s strenuous efforts to exploit immigration anxiety. An NBC News exit poll reported that 60 percent of voters favored stronger gun laws, including 42 percent of gun owners.Candidates embraced the gun-safety agenda this cycle to a degree not seen since at least the 2000 elections, when Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, made it key to his campaign messaging. According to Mark Kelly, who founded the gun-safety organization Americans for Responsible Solutions with his wife, the former House member Gabrielle Giffords, only four of 36 candidates listed on the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cred to blue\u201d list in 2016 included the gun issue in their platforms. (The \u201cred to blue\u201d list refers to Republican-held seats Democrats hope to gain.) This year, 38 of 59 candidates on the list included the issue. Candidates for Congress and other offices around the country aggressively touted their support for stronger gun measures, in races in Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia and elsewhere. Consider it no coincidence that many of these states suffered recent mass shootings.Members of Congress, including ambitious ones like Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who ran against Nancy Pelosi to be party leader in 2016, and Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, both had A ratings from the National Rifle Association. But both reversed course, trading their A for an N.R.A. F after recent mass shootings. In Pennsylvania\u2019s First Congressional District, representing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, both the Democratic and Republican candidates for Congress advertised their support for stronger gun laws, leading gun-safety forces to split their endorsements between the two (Brian Fitzpatrick, the incumbent Republican, won narrowly).Part of the appeal of the gun-safety issue arises from its resonance with women, for whom gun violence is a top concern, and who constituted a key swing constituency. According to a survey conducted by the Y.W.C.A., a top tier of personal concerns among women includes \u201ckeeping their families safe from gun violence.\u201dIn the money race, gun-safety groups apparently topped the N.R.A., which has spent about $11 million in the midterms. Combined gun-safety group spending was about $12 million \u2014 a first at the national level. If the amount of N.R.A. spending seems low, it is: The organization spent twice that in 2014 and five times that amount in 2016. By its own admission, the N.R.A. has money problems. It has also suffered political black eyes from corporate boycotts, allegations of improper ties with Russian agents seeking to influence the 2016 elections and relentless political attacks by the student-led movement that arose from the Parkland school shooting.In five targeted congressional races \u2014 Colorado Sixth, Georgia Sixth, Minnesota Second, Texas Seventh and Virginia Seventh \u2014 gun-safety groups spent major money on behalf of gun-safety supporters, and all won. Especially notable is Georgia\u2019s Sixth District, where Lucy McBath, a Democrat whose son was killed in a racially motivated shooting, defeated a recently elected Republican in a district once represented by Newt Gingrich. Jason Crow, a Democratic military veteran, defeated an incumbent Republican in Colorado\u2019s Sixth District, which includes the site of a 2012 movie theater shooting. He also embraced the gun-safety issue, with a boost from Vote Vets (they allied themselves with the Giffords-Kelly group). In at least three House races \u2014 Florida Twenty-fifth, Minnesota Eighth and North Carolina Thirteenth \u2014 the N.R.A. spent significantly on pro-gun-rights candidates who won.The Senate tally was roughly a draw. N.RA. money helped bring down Democrats in Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee, but it fell short against Democrats re-elected in Montana and West Virginia. In the one Senate race where the opposing sides spent heavily, the Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, edged out her opponent in Arizona. And in Florida, the Republican Rick Scott left the N.R.A. with no one to back in this traditionally gun-friendly state after he broke with the organization to sign several new gun measures into law as governor. Among governor\u2019s races, N.R.A. efforts helped the vote leaders in Florida and Georgia (both are subject to recounts as of this writing) and the Oklahoma winner, but they fell short in Nevada, Oregon and Wisconsin.Even more telling has been the explosion of political ads supporting stronger gun laws. According to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal, pro-gun-law ads aired more than 100,000 times as of September 2018 \u2014 an increase by a factor of 22 over 2014. The ratio of gun-control to gun-rights ads this year also favors the control side much more. For example, the swing states of Florida and Nevada aired no pro-control ads four years ago. This year, they aired more than 45,000. For tossup races as defined by the Cook Political Report, gun ads were more likely to support stronger laws. In tossup House races, 93 percent of the gun-related ads supported stronger gun laws.So why the sea change in public attitudes and emboldened candidates running squarely on gun safety? The answer begins 18 years ago. After Al Gore\u2019s 2000 defeat, Democrats decided, rightly or wrongly, that the gun issue was a poison pill for them, so they all but abandoned it. This left the national gun debate mostly in the hands of the gun-friendly Bush administration and gun-rights supporters. That one-sided national debate turned public attitudes more strongly in favor of gun rights. Democratic silence ended with the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting and President Obama\u2019s decision to promote stronger gun measures in Congress. The effort failed, but it began a new kind of political momentum as new and well-funded gun-safety groups formed, grass-roots mobilization and fund-raising dedicated to gun safety increased, mass shootings continued and candidates began to speak about the issue.Robert Spitzer is a political scientist at SUNY Cortland and the author of five books on gun policy, including \u201cGuns Across America\u201d and \u201cThe Politics of Gun Control.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018It\u2019s a Long Story\u2019: Justice John Paul Stevens, 98, Is Publishing a Memoir", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Four years after Justice John Paul Stevens retired from the Supreme Court in 2010, his wife, Maryan, threw a surprise party for his 94th birthday. The gathering of old friends summoned vivid memories of a long and eventful life, and it gave him an idea. He should write a memoir.\u201cI just started writing after that party,\u201d Justice Stevens said by phone the other day from his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u201cIt kind of set me off.\u201dThe book, \u201cThe Making of a Justice: My First 94 Years,\u201d will be published in May, not long after Justice Stevens\u2019s 99th birthday.\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Justice Stevens said.He was born to a prominent Chicago family that operated what was then the largest hotel in the world, the Stevens Hotel, with 3,000 rooms. He met celebrities like Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh, and he was at Wrigley Field for Game 3 of the 1932 World Series to see Babe Ruth\u2019s fabled called-shot home run.He was a Navy cryptographer, an accomplished lawyer and a respected appeals court judge. When President Gerald R. Ford nominated him to the Supreme Court in 1975, he was confirmed by a unanimous vote. Three decades later, Ford expressed satisfaction with his choice, who had by then emerged as the leader of the court\u2019s liberal wing.Justice Stevens\u2019s memoir also considers many scores of Supreme Court decisions in which he participated. \u201cIt almost seems I was writing two separate books,\u201d he said, \u201cthe first one about the time before I went on the court and the second one about the many, many terms I was on the court.\u201d\u201cThe combination of its actual practical impact by increasing the use of guns in the country and also the legal reasoning, which I thought was totally unpersuasive,\u201d he said, \u201cpersuaded me that the case is just about as bad as any in my tenure.\u201dHe said he had taken an extraordinary step in trying to head off the decision. Five weeks before Justice Antonin Scalia circulated his draft opinion for the majority, Justice Stevens sent around a draft of what he called his probable dissent. He said he could not recall ever having done anything like that.\u201cI thought I should give it every effort to switch the case before it was too late,\u201d he said.Justice Stevens said he had kept up with recent controversies over Supreme Court vacancies, and he expressed disappointment at Republican senators\u2019 refusal in 2016 to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland.\u201cI certainly think Garland should have gotten a confirmation hearing,\u201d Justice Stevens said. \u201cThat was really a most unfortunate thing, because he is so very well qualified. He is not a member of one party or the other. He is just a good judge. Of course, actually Kavanaugh is also a good judge.\u201d\u201cI have been opposed to ceremonies at the White House,\u201d Justice Stevens said. \u201cIt gives the impression that the court is subordinate to the executive, which I think is quite wrong.\u201dJustice Stevens decided to step down on the day he delivered his dissent from the bench in the Citizens United case. He had stumbled over and mispronounced several words. \u201cUnbeknownst to me,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI apparently had suffered a mini-stroke.\u201d\u201cThat was it,\u201d he said on the phone. \u201cI made the decision that day. After I went to see the doctor, I sent a letter to the president right away.\u201dThe experience did not cause him to rethink his position on term limits for Supreme Court justices, he said.\u201cI\u2019ve never been in favor of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt presents an arbitrary termination point for a justice\u2019s service. I know I, of course, would have served a substantially shorter time if there had been term limits.\u201d\u201cI play duplicate bridge and I play golf and I go swimming once in a while,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not quite as active as I used to be.\u201dAsked what he hoped readers would take away from his memoir, he said, \u201cI\u2019d like them to think it\u2019s an interesting read.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Visits Philippines to Celebrate \u2018Rainbow After the Rain\u2019 With Duterte", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 As President Xi Jinping of China begins a state visit to Manila on Tuesday, he can count on few counterparts more eager than President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.\u201cI simply love Xi Jinping,\u201d Mr. Duterte said in April. \u201cHe understands my problem and is willing to help, so I would say, \u2018Thank you, China.\u2019\u201dYet even if Mr. Xi\u2019s two-day visit to the Philippines is wrapped in adulatory language, hard questions are being asked in Manila whether Mr. Duterte\u2019s rapprochement with China has actually helped the country.Mr. Xi\u2019s trip, the first to the Philippines by a Chinese leader in 13 years, will most likely result in multibillion dollar pledges. But some economists wonder whether the money will actually materialize.Yet China\u2019s investment in the Philippines remains more promise than reality. Only a fraction of the $24 billion in Chinese projects and financing that were agreed on two years ago has been approved for implementation.\u201cRodrigo Duterte\u2019s policy since 2016 has fallen short on expectations and has not convinced people of its effectiveness,\u201d said Jay Batongbacal, an associate professor at the University of the Philippines College of Law.In 2016, an international tribunal handed the Philippines an unexpected victory when it dismissed Beijing\u2019s expansive claims to the South China Sea, based on a suit brought by the government of Mr. Duterte\u2019s predecessor, Benigno S. Aquino III.Since then, Mr. Duterte, who took office days before the tribunal ruling, has declined to push Beijing to honor the judgment, even though international legal precedent is on the Philippines\u2019 side.Last week, at a regional summit meeting in Singapore, Mr. Duterte appeared to minimize the Philippines\u2019 own claims in the South China Sea, stating that \u201cChina is already in possession\u201d of the contested waterway. The United States, which has sent warships to the South China Sea to draw attention to the territorial claims of five other governments, should avoid \u201ccreating friction,\u201d Mr. Duterte said.Nearly 85 percent of Filipinos canvassed for a survey by Social Weather Stations, a respected local polling firm, said they opposed the Philippine government\u2019s inaction on China\u2019s movements in the South China Sea. In recent months, Beijing has landed military jets and stationed surface-to-air missiles on bits of turf claimed by the Philippines and other states.\u201cDuterte\u2019s statement on the South China Sea, while it smacks of utter pragmatism, has been viewed by many as capitulation bordering on treason,\u201d said Clarita Carlos, the former president of the National Defense College of the Philippines.Philippine fishermen have pushed back against Mr. Duterte for advocating a scheme in which the Philippines and China jointly explore for oil and gas in contested parts of the South China Sea. Such a plan, for which a framework could be signed during Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, is \u201ctantamount to the complete surrender of the country\u2019s claim and control in the resource-rich marine territory,\u201d said Fernando Hicap, the head of a fishing union called Pamalakaya that protested in front of the Chinese Embassy in Manila on Tuesday morning. About 150 protesters had gathered, holding up signs like, \u201cThe Philippines is ours, China leave.\u201dMr. Duterte\u2019s allies say that joint exploration is the only way to take advantage of the South China Sea\u2019s untapped resources. Mr. Xi\u2019s visit to the Philippines will catalyze further investment, they say.\u201cChina is now considered a top trading partner of the Philippines, a leading export market for the Philippines and one of the largest tourist origins to the Philippines,\u201d the presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said.Mr. Duterte\u2019s \u201cvisionary leadership\u201d has transformed the bilateral economic relationship, Mr. Panelo added.Last month, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, traveled to the city of Davao, Mr. Duterte\u2019s hometown, to inaugurate a new Chinese consulate. \u201cPresident Duterte is the most respected and the most important friend for President Xi Jinping and the Chinese people,\u201d Mr. Wang said.But others caution that even as Mr. Duterte courts China, Japan and the United States continue to invest far more in the Philippines.\u201cWhere\u2019s the money from all those earlier big-ticket projects with China?\u201d asked Richard Javad Heydarian, a professor of political science at De La Salle University in Manila, who calculated that of 10 major deals signed two years ago, only a $62 million loan for a dam has been processed so far.\u201cMy concern is a China chimera,\u201d Mr. Heydarian said. \u201cChina makes huge pledges but those investments force governments to make deep political concessions and the few billions that do come will have questions of transparency and accountability attached to them.\u201dMr. Duterte\u2019s overtures to China have often come at the rhetorical expense of the United States, which is bound to the Philippines through a mutual defense treaty. \u201cAmericans are loud, sometimes rowdy,\u201d he said in Beijing two years ago. \u201cTheir larynx is not adjusted to civility.\u201dBut few countries\u2019 citizens are as pro-American as Filipinos are. And influential members of the Philippine defense establishment are worried that Mr. Duterte\u2019s conciliatory approach to the South China Sea will only encourage Beijing\u2019s assertiveness, analysts say.The Armed Forces of the Philippines has quietly expanded the number of exercises it will conduct with the United States military next year, even as Mr. Duterte warns that the United States is destabilizing the regional geopolitical order.\u201cA slavish policy that ignores Chinese transgressions holds back the Philippine military and surrenders to Beijing\u2019s wishes,\u201d said Jose Antonio Custodio, a Philippine military historian. \u201cSuffice it to say, elements in the military are demoralized at this turn of events.\u201dHannah Beech reported from Bangkok, and Jason Gutierrez from Manila.Hannah Beech reported from Bangkok, and Jason Gutierrez from Manila.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Business With No End", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "Where does this strange empire start or stop?Part I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InPart I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InWhere does this strange empire start or stop? Recently, one of my students at Stanford told me a strange story. His parents, who live in Palo Alto, Calif., had been receiving mysterious packages at their house. The packages were all different shapes and sizes but each was addressed to \u201cReturns Department, Valley Fountain LLC.\u201dI looked into it and found that a company called Valley Fountain LLC was indeed listed at his parents\u2019 address. But it also appeared to be listed at 235 Montgomery Street, Suite 350, in downtown San Francisco.There was little pattern or theme to what these Amazon shops sold. They had everything from hemorrhoid cream to desk lamps, and there were varying levels of inventory. On sale at DeepOceanStoreuk (a storefront on Amazon.uk associated with Bropastures LLC), I found a book on industrial electricity, a set of fake facial wounds and a \u201cNo Stress Tech Guide to Microsoft Works 8 & 8.5.\u201d Another storefront called Kingdom Kber, this one on Amazon.de and associated with Agapao LLC, advertised a miniature whale, nail gel and a copy of \u201cUndocumented Immigrants and Higher Education.\u201d When I clicked on these items, though, none of them were currently available. A good number of the storefronts were completely empty.One thing these LLCs had in common was that their registered agent was named Jonathan Park.Even though the packages being sent to my student\u2019s parents\u2019 home were addressed to Valley Fountain LLC, one of the packages had a return label taped to it that indicated it came from an Amazon store called Sendai Book Store. I looked it up and found that it was on several cautionary lists of unauthorized resellers, and had more than 400,000 things for sale. But once again, the offerings seemed chosen at random.I decided to order something: L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick (3 pcs) for $25.63. (I pretended not to see that the same item was listed at $10.74 by another reseller.)  Amazon informed me that the lipstick would come in two weeks; there was no tracking information. In this case, it seemed that Valley Fountain LLC and other companies were posing as traditional retailers \u2014 usually by setting up Amazon storefronts like Sendai Book Store \u2014 and were just reselling items from other Amazon storefronts at inflated prices. It sounds confusing, but ultimately, it\u2019s pretty similar to scalping concert tickets: A middleman makes money by ratcheting up the price.The items in many of the storefronts associated with 235 Montgomery, Suite 350 had an unusually long shipping time and consistently low stock, so it made sense that items purchased from them might be coming from elsewhere.While I waited for my lipstick, I returned to the list of LLCs, and noticed that there was something else that the companies had in common. According to LinkedIn and Facebook, at least a handful of the listed agents were alumni of Olivet University, a Bible college based in California.If Olivet University sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it has been in the news lately. Earlier this year its offices were raided as part of a fraud investigation being conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. As it also happens, here is where the story converged with another of my interests. My boyfriend had worked at Newsweek as an editor for a year. He was let go in April 2017.Newsweek\u2019s journalists also found that their company had offered about $149,000 worth of free advertising in the print magazine to New York\u2019s Dutchess County, where Olivet was turning an abandoned psychiatric hospital into a satellite campus of Olivet University. The deal \u2014 which resulted in 10 full-page ads promoting local tourism and the Hudson Valley Regional Airport \u2014 was facilitated by Marian Rebro, the president of the company overseeing the construction.\u201cOlivet University was not the subject of the visit,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything from the campus.\u201dSeveral of the Newsweek journalists who had worked on the investigation of their company and its relationship with Olivet University were fired earlier this year. A spokesperson for Newsweek Media Group declined to comment. I went to 235 Montgomery Street to check it out, and found a set of locked double doors outfitted with a camera, a blinking light and a card reader. On the building\u2019s directory, Suite 350 was listed as IBPort, Inc.Who could this cosmopolitan shopper be? It\u2019s hard to say.Until recently, Marian Rebro, the president of the Olivet-affiliated management company that is developing the abandoned psychiatric facility in New York, was listed on business websites as the manager of Everymarket Inc. But Mr. Rebro said, in a statement: \u201cI am not the founder of Everymarket.com. I may have advised the company at one point many years ago, but have never been an employee there.\u201d He also said: \u201cI am not, nor have I ever been, a manager or employee of Everymarket.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to see the oddly overpriced Essy Beauty peel-off mask or Asavea hair straightener as a kind of product version of clickbait. After all, what is the experience of clickbait other than realizing we have vastly overpaid, even if only with our attention?News, information and products are simply someone\u2019s inventory.This is what I thought a countless number of times!This has gotten some of the companies listed at 235 Montgomery in trouble.In another legal dispute, from February of this year, Adult Printed Diapers LLC sued Faithfulness LLC, another one of Mr. Park\u2019s companies, for selling \u201cAww So Cute\u201d diapers, which are an Adult Printed Diapers trademark. It\u2019s not clear where Faithfulness LLC got the Adult Printed Diapers diapers, but the lawsuit alleges that Faithfulness LLC\u2019s co-defendant in the lawsuit, Rearz, Inc., made an unauthorized purchase of diaper inventory directly from Adult Printed Diapers\u2019 supplier in Shandong, China.  On a recent visit to Leez, recognizable brands were mixed in with disconcerting objects, like a $59 hat that said \u201cOslo Iceland\u201d on it and something called \u201cGranny Attic Bubble Foam.\u201d Both items appeared to be made by JNG Korea Co. Ltd.Products from Little Martin\u2019s Drawer and Asavea were prominently displayed.A sorry assortment of wooden furniture haunted the second floor, while the third floor remained dark, empty and forbidding; visitors were informed that it is now an event rental space.Business cards displayed at Leez named Chris Liu as the Chief Operation Officer there. Chris Liu\u2019s Linkedin profile lists a previous position in Business Development at IBTimes Australia.Amid all of this, my lipstick arrived! Inside the package was an invoice for $10.75 from \u201cCrispy Beauty,\u201d an unfortunately named Amazon seller that was decidedly not Sendai Book Store, the store on Amazon I paid $25.63 for the lipstick. When I went back to Amazon and generated a return label, the address was for Valley Fountain LLC. I was not prepared for the way a simple question about some mysterious packages would spiral into a dizzying network of Amazon storefronts, web domains and badly written \u201cAbout us\u201d pages. But the more I looked into it, the more it seemed they were being run by a handful of people, each operating in different capacities depending on the needs of the moment. More surreal was how these websites were linked to the physical world. Chris L. also made sure to throw in a plug for the third floor: \u201cThe 3rd floor of the store is open for rent. It\u2019s quite spacious and bright. Good for all kinds of event.\u201d I decided I had to go to the San Francisco store.In what sounds like a thick Eastern European accent, he says that \u201cStevens\u201d is the last name of a man who was in the bookstore business for 60 years. \u201cThis gentleman is actually my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to work a couple years together, and this is in memory of him.\u201d There\u2019s a cut in the video, and then: \u201cHe\u2019s still alive, but this is like a tribute to him. That\u2019s why it is called Stevens Books.\u201d\u201cDo you want to check out those books?\u201d the guy asked. No, I said. I wanted to buy them. \u201cOh!\u201d he said, and then laughed to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2026 we\u2019re not a library.\u201d In an email in response to request for comment, Mr. Volansky wrote \u201cP&J Health anti-snoring devices and Piero Lorenzo wallets are not sold in Stevens Books.\u201d He said he was not the owner, and that the store and the brand were owned by the Stevens Books Group. \u201cI go by my own name, Stevens is a nickname because of Stevens Books,\u201d he wrote.Trying to map the connections between all these entities opens a gaping wormhole. I couldn\u2019t get over the idea that a church might be behind a network of used business books, hair straighteners, and suspiciously priced compression stockings \u2014 sold on Amazon storefronts with names like GiGling EyE, ShopperDooperEU and DAMP store \u2014 all while running a once-venerable American news publication into the ground.Indeed, at some point I began to feel like I was in a dream. Or that I was half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real, the local from the global, a product from a Photoshop image, the sincere from the insincere.Still harder for me to grasp was the total interpenetration of e-commerce and physical space. Standing inside Stevens Books was like being on a stage set for Stevens Books, Stevens Book, Stevens Book Shop, and Stevensbook \u2014 all at the same time. It wasn\u2019t that the bookstore wasn\u2019t real, but rather that it felt reverse-engineered by an online business, or a series of them. Being a human who resides in physical space, my perceptual abilities were overwhelmed. But in some way, even if it was impossible to articulate, I knew that some kind of intersection of Olivet University, Gratia Community Church, IBPort, the Newsweek Media Group, and someone named Stevens was right there with me, among the fidget spinners, in an otherwise unremarkable store in San Francisco.Speaking with Jonathan Park, and reaching out to Olivet, provided some kind of clarification. Mr. Park said: \u201cI currently own and operate several businesses that I started while I was at Olivet,\u201d but added that he does not operate many of the entities that he helped incorporate, and that some entities have been spun off and are not related to him anymore.He said he mentored students, including interns and graduates of Olivet, and helped them set up businesses from time to time: \u201cMy collaboration with Olivet was one of my life\u2019s best experiences because the University and its students have an entrepreneurial spirit and great aspirations. It is truly a privilege to work together with these bright and gifted individuals.\u201d The school and students, he said, \u201cpartnered and envisioned an incubating program similar to those of the leading research universities; including Stanford and Cornell. While Olivet and my businesses are of a different scale than that of Stanford\u2019s and Google\u2019s, this type of collaboration is commonplace today and has proven to be very successful and rewarding for the economy at large. Our results and volumes are not odd, but, I believe, are rather impressive and something to be proud of.\u201dOlivet was more vague in its statement, made through its spokesperson Ronn Torossian. He wrote, in full:\u201cFollowing the legacy of our (late) Honorary Chairman Dr. Ralph D. Winter, Olivet University has always looked for ways to encourage growth in mission frontiers. This influence shaped the founding vision from Dr. Jang, who, as a devout Christian, believes a Biblical worldview can be applied across all varieties of fields. In that same spirit, the University has always been happy to help evangelical business owners, and we\u2019ve had a good working relationship with IBTimes over the years. We are also proud of our business-as-mission network with various entrepreneurs going into the marketplace as part of our ongoing exploration into models about how to best plant churches and expand mission frontiers. We will continue to explore this paradigm. These are challenging times for Christian and secular higher education institutions alike. Olivet is continually learning the best ways to provide high quality education to raise leaders while developing sound and diversified income sources. One model is Stanford University, which derives 85% of its revenues from non-tuition sources including sponsored research. Olivet similarly recognizes the importance of finding new models for supporting education, and therefore the school encourages innovation and entrepreneurship for its student and alumni base. Many of our alumni are successful entrepreneurs in the U.S. and other countries and contribute to and partner with the University by donating, partnering on research projects, providing internship/training opportunities, and in other ways. We will continue promoting these values that have made America into the great country it has become. And we are proud of all our successful alumni and are thankful to all the friends, benefactors and partners of Olivet University.\u201d In the end, I decided to return the lipstick.The alleged schemes include fictitious auditors (named \u201cKaren Smith\u201d and \u201cLynn Chen\u201d) who came complete with their own fictitious emails, phone numbers and websites; networks of corporate bank accounts; and the computer server company, Oikos Networks, that is listed at 22 Cortlandt Street, which also happens to be the address where Olivet Institute, Stevens Books and Christian Media Corporation are all registered.The indictments include charges against Etienne Uzac, a co-owner of IBT (and one of the original founders of International Business Times); William Anderson, an Olivet trustee, former chief executive of Christian Media Corporation (and husband of Yen-Yi Anderson); and John Xiao, Olivet\u2019s finance director and dean of Olivet Business School. The general manager of Oikos is named only as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator.\u201dI wondered about the fate of my overpriced L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick and who, at the New Jersey warehouse, would be there to receive it. I imagined a person sitting surrounded by rejected dinosaur costumes, butane fuel canisters and butt-enhancing creams. Soon they would receive my lipstick, neither a return nor quite a gift, purchased, at one point, from a faraway place called Crispy Beauty.

{"Headline": "U.S. and China Square Off on Trade, and APEC Nations Duck for Cover", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The United States and China turned a Pacific Rim trade summit this weekend into a stage where the world could do little more than stand by and watch as two great powers aggravated their battle over trade.President Xi Jinping and Vice President Mike Pence both made their cases to the global leaders assembled in Papua New Guinea \u2014 then they dug in and refused to compromise. That left the group of 21 nations in disarray, unable to agree on even a routine joint statement like those that had closed every other Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit since 1989.Countries caught in the trade-war crossfire between China and the United States are becoming increasingly exasperated.\u201cThe entire world is worried,\u201d said Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill of Papua New Guinea.The disagreement over the final statement reflects a hardening of the conflict between China and the United States, with each side deploying aggressive, uncompromising rhetoric reminiscent of that heard during the Cold War.During a weekend of diplomacy in China\u2019s backyard that had been meant to defuse trade tensions, Mr. Xi and Mr. Pence instead chose escalation, attacking each other\u2019s positions and battling for loyalty within a trade group that represents 60 percent of the global economy.Experts said the stalemate at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, known as APEC, would set up a high-stakes showdown at the Group of 20 conference in Argentina this month, which Mr. Xi and President Trump are expected to attend.The core issues in the clash were familiar and have shaped the trade dispute between the United States and China for months.Mr. Trump has made a combative stance on trade a signature element of his administration\u2019s foreign policy. So draft versions of an APEC communiqu\u00e9 showed that the United States wanted strong language condemning Chinese trade practices it calls coercive and predatory. Among them: restricting market access and pushing foreign companies to hand over valuable technology.The Chinese delegation sought to reaffirm its opposition to what it says are protectionism and unilateralism by the United States, especially the tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods as part of an unprecedented effort to force China to change its policies.Mr. Trump\u2019s trade offensive has stoked fears of an economic Cold War between the world\u2019s two largest economies. While the president has sought to preserve cordial personal relations with Mr. Xi, the broader relationship between the United States and China has deteriorated steadily, not just in the commercial sphere but also in security issues like the South China Sea.Mr. Xi seemed eager to shore up ties with an important trading partner, North Korea. He told President Moon Jae-in of South Korea on the sidelines of the trade forum that he was considering accepting an invitation from the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit, a spokesman for Mr. Moon said.But at the APEC conference in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, the tensions centered on economics.For years, American foreign policy has sought to balance the economic benefits of cooperating with China with the risks of treating the country as an adversary.Now, the scales have tipped.From Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets to defense position papers and a major speech by Mr. Pence on Oct. 4, the United States has made clear that it sees China as a strategic threat.\u201cIt\u2019s a new level of Cold War rhetoric,\u201d said Hugh White, a prominent regional analyst at the Australian National University.Economic cooperation, he said, is being sidelined.\u201cThe Trump administration, for the first time since Nixon in 1972, has sought to distance America from China\u2019s economic opportunities,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge shift.\u201dMr. Pence has played an especially prominent role in the confrontation.He urged Asian nations to work with the United States. If they do, he said, they will not be saddled with debt, a problem some countries are facing as a result of their partnerships with Beijing.Mr. Xi, who spoke before Mr. Pence, insisted that such criticism was misguided. China\u2019s infrastructure plan, he said, is inclusive and beneficial.\u201cIt will not close a door and create a small circle,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cIt is not the so-called trap, as some people say. It is the sunshine avenue where China shares opportunities with the world to seek common development.\u201dExperts said the two countries\u2019 positions have become more entrenched.\u201cIt boils down to mutual intransigence between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University.Jonathan Pryke, a Pacific Rim expert at the Lowy Institute, agreed, describing the result as raw \u201cstubbornness.\u201dEarlier on Sunday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia tried to sound upbeat. \u201cI think there is a lot more progress being made here than I think is probably being acknowledged,\u201d he said.He and many other national leaders seemed eager to return to a time when the world\u2019s strongest powers got along, or at least worked together on building the world economy.What the leaders of many countries fear, especially in Asia, is a cleavage into two camps.No one \u201cwants to be forced to make a choice,\u201d said Mr. White, the analyst.For now, the world beyond the United States and China seems to have been given the task of maintaining calm \u2014 and of trying to steer the world away from economic divisions and greater clashes.By Sunday night, it was increasingly difficult to see the summit meeting as anything but a continuation of hostilities.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada was among the first to make that clear. The joint statement, he said, was a lost cause.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will come as a huge surprise that there are differing visions,\u201d he said.Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington, and Jamie Tarabay from Sydney.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Natural Pearls Are One Man\u2019s Passion", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdi al-Fardan loves pearls. It\u2019s a family passion, he said, that began two generations ago with his grandfather Ibrahim, an Emirati pearl merchant from Dubai who was known far and wide as \u201cthe pearl doctor.\u201dRemoving a pearl from an oyster requires deftness and a keen eye, both of which Mr. Fardan\u2019s grandfather was reputed to have in abundance. People, Mr. Fardan said, would \u201cbring pearls to him and ask him, \u2018Hajji Fardan, can you please help us?\u2019 He had an eye into the pearl.\u201dNow, more than a century later, Mr. Fardan\u2019s family owns what they believe to be one of the world\u2019s largest collections of natural pearls, totaling more than 50,000 carats. And some of their jewelry once was owned by maharajahs, including Shah Jahan, who commissioned construction of the Taj Mahal in 1631.Mr. Fardan, 26, is a banker by day, but his real passion lies in jewelry. He plays a large role in Alfardan Jewellery, one of the family\u2019s several businesses, and is the owner of the Adi Al Fardan Jewellery Company, which focuses on high-end jewelry for an elite clientele and which Mr. Fardan sees as being the future of the family legacy.Although diamonds account for a big part of both jewelry businesses, he said, pearls continue to captivate the Emirati because they are embedded in the culture of the whole region. \u201cAnd so we travel the world, me and my father,\u201d and \u201csearch for these pearls,\u201d he said, adding that they regularly are consulted by brands and museums for advice and invited to events; Mr. Fardan, for example, addressed the Arab Luxury World conference in May in Dubai.Those travels have helped the family learn regional preferences, like the gulf\u2019s \u201ctaste for perfectly rounded pearls,\u201d Mr. Fardan said.But then, natural pearls, he said, are \u201cthe queen of gems and the gem of all queens.\u201d (Consider the $36 million price of a natural pearl and diamond pendant auctioned by Sotheby\u2019s on Nov. 14. Although arguably the amount, said to be a record for a pearl at auction, was heavily influenced by the fact that Queen Marie Antoinette of France once owned it.)Natural pearls weren\u2019t always so valued. In the early 20th century, after the development and popularization of cultured pearls, the value of natural pearls dropped. Supplies also declined shortly afterward, mainly from overharvesting \u2014 and, in today\u2019s world, they \u201csimply do not exist,\u201d Mr. Fardan said.\u201cThey\u2019re a diminishing gem because of overfishing and ocean pollution,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd, of course, natural pearls are an organic substance. They\u2019re not like diamonds; they\u2019re actually very delicate.\u201dMr. Fardan said: \u201cMy father tells me that in every oyster we used to get four to five natural pearls and it was simply a good day.\u201d But that was before 1962, when the region began exporting oil, before climate change and pollution began taking a toll. \u201cToday, on average, they say in every 12,000 oysters if you get one pearl you would be lucky.\u201dIt is why, he added, the Fardan family has committed to using \u201call of our resources to follow this passion.\u201dThe family is fiercely protective of its collection. When museums ask to show some of the jewelry, the answer is always the same, Mr. Fardan said: \u201cOur family\u2019s response is simply \u2018no.\u2019\u201dHowever, some items are showcased at certain events, like a large freshwater natural pearl that was displayed through a collaboration with Mr. Fardan\u2019s own company when Rolls-Royce introduced its luxury sport-utility vehicle Cullinan earlier this year in Dubai. And some gems are sold from time to time to Mr. Fardan\u2019s select clients, one of whom bought a $10 million pearl and diamond parure (matching necklace, earrings, bracelet and ring). The buyer? \u201cI\u2019d rather keep that personal,\u201d he said with a laugh.But of the family\u2019s collection of natural pearls, less than 10 percent has ever been used for commercial purposes, he said.Selling natural pearls is not easy for the man whose life is so intertwined with them. When a diamond is sold, Mr. Fardan said, \u201cno matter how rare,\u201d it can be replaced. But natural pearls are different. \u201cIt is,\u201d he said, \u201clike losing an arm when we sell a piece. Let\u2019s say I sell you this piece; I make the wonderful margin of profit on top of it. Well, good job. Come and replace that piece. It\u2019s next to impossible.\u201dMr. Fardan recalled finding a natural pearl drop earring for sale when he and his father, Hasan, were on a trip to Mumbai, India, in October 2017.Today, Mr. Fardan continues to push the family business \u2014 and his own \u2014 forward, but he also hopes that one day he can learn to handle and care for natural pearls with the same level of skill employed by his grandfather and father.\u201cI\u2019m getting into the process, too,\u201d he said. But \u201cwith today\u2019s world, with the availability of natural pearls, it\u2019s very difficult. But we are getting there. I hope I get it one day, to have the knowledge of treating natural pearls, to have the patience of building a necklace over a span of 30 to 40 years, buying bits and pieces one at a time.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere are lots of wealthy people. There are lots of families with exceptional wealth. But what about the knowledge? What about the culture? What about the legacy? If this dies, then what\u2019s left for the future?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s on the Back of N.Y.C.\u2019s Ballot? 3 Ways to Tweak Democracy", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVoters will be asked to consider three ballot questions, one of which would change how political campaigns raise money.New Yorkers will be asked to approve or reject three revisions to the City Charter. The questions will be on the back of the city\u2019s paper ballots \u2014 hence, the slogan \u2014 and are the result of six months of public hearings about possible changes to the charter. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the proposals, if passed, would enhance the way democracy works in the city. Not everyone agrees.Proposal No. 1This proposal would sharply reduce the maximum contribution that donors could make to many political campaigns, and increase the city\u2019s matching-funds program for candidates. The goal is to reduce the influence of large donors. Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday that many people interested in running for office, particularly first-time candidates, don\u2019t know wealthy people who can contribute to their campaigns. He said a stronger matching-funds program would create an electoral system in which candidates could focus instead on small donors, rather than courting the wealthy and special interests. If the measure passes, donors could give a maximum of $ 2,000 to a candidate for mayor or other citywide office, down from $5,100 currently; maximum donations to City Council candidates would be set at $1,000, down from $2,850. Higher limits would apply to candidates who do not accept matching funds.The dollar match of public funds would be increased to eight-to-one, up from the current six-to-one. That would apply to the first $250 donated by a contributor (the match currently applies to the first $175 donated). That means that if someone gives $250, the candidate would receive an additional $2,000 in public matching funds \u2014 increasing the importance of small donations.The amount of public matching funds varies from election to election, largely depending on the number of candidates running. In 2013, the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board paid out $38.2 million to all candidates, according to Matthew Sollars, the board\u2019s spokesman. In 2017, it distributed $16.9 million.If the proposal passes, the charter revision commission estimated that the cost of the matching funds program would increase by about 47 percent.Some have criticized the proposal because it includes a trap door for the next big city election, in 2021, that gives candidates running that year the ability to choose between the new rules and the current system. Critics said the provision was included to avoid potential opposition from the large number of elected officials who are term-limited and looking to run for a different office in 2021 \u2014 and may prefer to operate with the higher donation limits. Proposal No. 2Everybody loves a mayoral commission! No? Well, here\u2019s your chance to decide.This proposal would create a Civic Engagement Commission that would work to increase participation in the democratic process and civic life, provide resources to community boards, and place translators at voting sites, among other tasks. The mayor would appoint a majority of the board\u2019s 15 members and be able to assign it new duties.One of the commission\u2019s tasks would be to expand the participatory budgeting system, which allows residents to vote on how to spend small amounts of city money in their neighborhoods. Brad Lander, a Brooklyn city councilman, said the proposal would \u201cturbocharge civic participation in New York City.\u201d But others said the commission was unnecessary. \u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d said Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, who argued that the commission would duplicate the functions of other governmental entities, including the borough presidents\u2019 offices. Borough presidents appoint community board members and also provide them with many of the services that the new commission would offer, Ms. Brewer said. She suggested that the proposal was a way for the mayor to exert more control over the community boards, which sometimes push back against mayoral initiatives, like zoning changes and development projects. Proposal No. 3Thanks for your service. Now leave.The last proposal would require community board members to step down after eight years. There is currently no limit on the amount of time that board members can serve. The stated goal of this change is to make the boards more diverse and to create space for fresh leadership. \u201cI just want to say, why would you want to term-limit volunteers?\u201d Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, said. Mr. Stringer served on a Manhattan community board as a teenager in the 1970s. He later served as Manhattan borough president, when he appointed hundreds of new community board members, and said that he increased the representation of African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans and members of the gay community. He said it was a \u201cbogus argument\u201d that the change was needed to diversify the boards. Ms. Brewer also opposes the proposal, suggesting that many long-serving board members accumulate needed expertise on subjects like land use, zoning and parks, which gives the boards the ability to evaluate proposals and stand up to well-financed developers. \u201cThe land-use attorneys don\u2019t have term limits,\u201d Ms. Brewer said. The mayor disagrees. \u201cIf you don\u2019t allow for some natural turnover, a lot of people are going to feel there is no chance for them to participate,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s not healthy in a democracy.\u201dMr. de Blasio acknowledged that he was slow to get the word out. \u201cI would have liked to have seen some of this start earlier,\u201d he said on Thursday, adding that he has been too busy to do so. The city\u2019s Law Department has instructed elected officials that they cannot use any city resources to campaign for or against the ballot proposals, and cannot do so on city time \u2014 although they were free to do so on their own time. That is why the city-financed ad campaign asks people only to vote on the proposals and does not advocate a yes-or-no vote. But on Thursday, Mr. de Blasio held a rally at the Manhattan headquarters of Local 32BJ, of the Service Employees International Union, to gain support for the proposals. The rally was scheduled as part of his weekly mayoral news conference, announced by his City Hall office, attended by City Hall staff, and included on his public schedule (his campaign events are typically not on his official schedule). Mr. de Blasio, who urged New Yorkers to \u201cvote yes, yes, yes,\u201d said he was not violating the Law Department\u2019s instructions. \u201cI am not breaking the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, I understand where that limit is but I also understand how important it is, in my own time \u2014 and a lot of other people here are on their own time \u2014 to get the word out about what this will mean about changing our city.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " Searching for the Next Bobby Fischer, the U.S. Finds Fabi", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "Fabiano Caruana, 26, has dedicated much of his young life to chess. This month\u2019s world championships could be the moment all those games pay off.Supported byThe last American to win the world chess championship was a Brooklyn-bred grandmaster who stunned the world champion and took his title.The next one may be, too.Beginning this week, Fabiano Caruana, a 26-year-old grandmaster who has spent the last two decades fighting his way up the ranks to reach No. 2 in the world, is expected to lay serious claim to a title that has not been held by an American since Bobby Fischer won it from Boris Spassky in 1972.Caruana will challenge the world\u2019s best player, Magnus Carlsen of Norway, at the World Chess Championships in London. They will play 12 matches over the course of three weeks beginning Friday.\u201cI\u2019ve had mediocre years, I\u2019ve had good years,\u201d Caruana said. \u201cThis year has been the best by far.\u201dA lot of people in the world of chess agree, and they are awaiting a Caruana-Carlsen showdown that could affirm a resurgence of American strength in international chess competitions.Russia and Eastern European countries have a history of dominance in the game, which in many cases is embedded in their culture, and some European governments have invested in developing players. Still, Jennifer Shahade, two-time United States women\u2019s champion, said European dominance in chess was being threatened in part by technology.\u201cThe fact that anyone can study online or get coaching via Skype is a bit of an equalizer,\u201d she said.A lot of would-be American contenders in the generations since Fischer have come and gone, but now the United States has a stronger presence than in past decades, and Caruana is at the vanguard.Since that victory and others, Caruana has had to hire a manager \u2014 two, in fact \u2014 to handle the increased news media attention his success in major tournaments has brought.His matchup with Carlsen, 27, seems inevitable, but victory is far from assured; it will be Caruana\u2019s first world championship match but Carlsen\u2019s fourth.\u201cHe was destined to play for the world championship; whether he wins or not is another question, \u201d said Frank Brady, the president emeritus of New York\u2019s renowned Marshall Chess Club. \u201cSomeone at the club the other night said: \u2018Oh yeah, I played Fabiano once. I beat him.\u2019 I asked, Well how old was he? \u2018Oh, about 6 years old.\u2019\u201dThis time, Brady added, referring to the epic Bobby Fischer victory over a Russian, Boris Spassky, in 1972, \u201cIt\u2019s not one kid from Brooklyn against the entire Soviet hegemony.\u201dCaruana and Carlsen are two of only 1,600 grandmasters in the world, and part of the elite handful of players with a chess rating better than 2,800 from the World Chess Federation.The sport, as chess enthusiasts insist it is, has changed over the last 40 years. Today, smart boards and smart pieces are equipped with digital technology that livestreams the pieces\u2019 location on the board at every moment, and tournament announcers use computer algorithms to analyze the moves as they are made.Even at 26, Caruana might be aging out of the elite game. But he has projected an air of calm about the coming matches, and about the pressure on him to win. \u201cI was surprised when I met him how nice, how mellow he is, how not crazy, in a way,\u201d said Ilya Merenzon, the chief executive of World Chess and the organizer of the match. \u201cHe is great to the media, he doesn\u2019t act weirdly and he is a very pleasant person to talk to. But he also seems extremely calm, which helps phenomenally during a championship match.\u201dFabi, as Caruana is known on the chess circuit, spends most of his time these days within a few blocks of the St. Louis Chess Club.It is bright, with large storefront windows and a small section of books for sale with titles like \u201cBologan\u2019s Black Weapons\u201d and \u201cSacking the Citadel.\u201d T-shirts for sale include one that reads \u201cFABI WINS\u201d in red, white and blue.Those who remember the Fischer boom of the 1970s hope Caruana will bring increased interest in the game in the United States. It helps that chess has been having a modest renaissance. This boomlet the past decade was made possible by apps and other technology that have made the game more accessible. Fans can now follow their favorite players on streaming platforms like Twitch, where viewership (based on minutes watched) has grown by more than 250 percent in the last year. And the YouTube channel for the World Chess Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE, is full of videos with titles like \u201c25 minutes of Sergey Karjakin thinking.\u201d The clip has thousands of views.He said he joined an after-school chess program to address problems paying attention in school. But despite catching his chess teacher\u2019s eye as a promising student and going on to win tournaments in local clubs, the Caruanas were discouraged from seriously pursuing chess by Garry Kasparov himself, said Fabiano\u2019s father, Lou.Kasparov warned that Caruana\u2019s devoting his life to chess at a young age was too risky, Lou Caruana said. (Kasparov confirmed the account through a representative.)Very few make a living playing chess, and even many top-level players have to teach, coach or take other jobs to make ends meet.Yet the Caruanas were determined. Schoolteachers told Santina, Fabiano\u2019s mother, \u201cYou can either go for chess or you can go for school,\u201d she said.\u201cAnd so, we went for chess.\u201dCaruana and his family moved to Europe when he was 12 in search of more opportunities to compete and train. He achieved grandmaster status in 2007, at age 14, while he was playing for the Italian Chess Federation.\u201cWe knew he was extremely intelligent, so we did have a degree of confidence that with or without formal education, he would be O.K.,\u201d Lou Caruana said. \u201cHe spent a tremendous amount of time reading, and so he is somewhat self-educated.\u201dHis parents estimated that they spent as much as $50,000 a year paying for coaches and training before Fabiano started making money around the time he turned 17. His father gave up a career in data processing and focused on growing income from real estate holdings in New York and Miami as well as managing his son; in those days, Caruana and his father traveled across Europe to events and training sessions listening to Elton John on the car radio (his taste leans more to Kendrick Lamar these days).\u201cLooking back,\u201d Fabiano Caruana said, \u201cI didn\u2019t really have any friends. I would just play chess all the time.\u201dHe still maintains an aggressive schedule of training and playing that means about 100 classical games a year, and another few hundred blitz or bullet games.When he plays online, he said, it might be 50 games in one night. \u201cYou could easily do 70 hours of chess a week for a few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd during tournaments, it\u2019s like 12 hours a day. \u201cHe supplements those challenges by playing tennis, doing yoga and spending time in the gym; he runs with a trainer, too, to build stamina. It is not enough to be mentally strong, most of the new generation of grandmasters agree; players now believe they stand the best shot at winning if they are physically fit as well. He is taking this year off from dating to focus on chess, out of the fear that a breakup would throw off his game.The Caruanas moved back to the United States three years ago, in large part because of the support of the St. Louis Chess Club and the interest Sinquefield had in Caruana\u2019s joining the American team.Norway\u2019s hopes need no such reinforcement. At 27, Carlsen is the undisputed king of chess, renowned for a swaggering, bad-boy demeanor; he has developed his own popular chess app and supplements his income with big-dollar endorsement contracts. \u201cIt was actually interesting to see how quickly the whole country became enamored with chess, because they had a chess hero,\u201d Fabiano said of Carlsen, and Norway. He wondered if he could do the same for the United States.But Caruana said Carlsen did not intimidate him.\u201cI think that most players at the top are confident,,\u201d Caruana said. \u201cSome are even arrogant.\u201d\u201cEspecially for Magnus,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s kind of hard for it not to get to his head because he\u2019s had an enormous amount of success, more than anyone in the history of chess, especially considering his age right now.\u201dWin or lose, Caruana is likely to go down as one of the best players of his generation. And, he said, he is ready for the next generation, too.\u201cI welcome the challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Activist Who Used Humor to Highlight War Is Gunned Down in Syria", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 A prominent anti-government activist in Syria who used biting wit to draw international attention to his country\u2019s plight was shot dead by unidentified gunmen in his hometown on Friday, his friends said.The activist, Raed Fares, used videos, skits and protest placards that referenced American culture and often went viral on social media to criticize the Syrian military, jihadists and Western leaders he felt had failed to stop the violence that tore his country apart.The killing of Mr. Fares, 46, comes as the war in Syria is winding down. President Bashar al-Assad has retaken most of the country with the help of Russia and Iran, although armed rebels and Kurdish militias backed by the United States still hold significant territory.But for those like Mr. Fares who saw the uprising against Mr. Assad as a revolution and hoped it would bring democracy, his killing was a bitter sign of how remote that dream has become.\u201cThe last flame of a once very proud and aspirational revolution by civilians is snuffed out,\u201d said John Jaeger, a former State Department official and friend of Mr. Fares\u2019s. \u201cI hate thinking about it like that, but there it is.\u201dOther activists seeking political change in Syria are still working, Mr. Jaeger said, but the dangers have driven most of them abroad.\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many people with his visibility and his status who are still inside the country, so it\u2019s a huge blow,\u201d he said.Like many Syrians who were inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings to protest against Mr. Assad in 2011, Mr. Fares had no background in politics or activism but plenty of reasons to revolt against the Syrian government, which had been dominated by Mr. Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, for more than four decades.The Assads had always handled dissent brutally, and Mr. Fares recalled watching as a child as security agents killed his neighbor. He also remembered terrified people fleeing to Kafr Nubul, his hometown in northern Syria, in 1982 after a massacre by government forces seeking to root out Islamist militants in the city of Hama.When the uprising broke out in 2011, Mr. Fares, who had dropped out of medical school to study English and was working as a real estate agent, joined enthusiastically.He shot videos in the aftermath of government attacks to post online, organized protests and helped design English-language banners to catch the attention of Americans.

Your role in Syria will never be accepted as a mistake like Clinton\u2019s Rwanda,\u201d read one placard, criticizing the Obama administration\u2019s reluctance to intervene militarily against Mr. Assad. \u201cIt will be a premeditated crime.\u201dOthers expressed sympathy for the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and offered condolences on the death of the actor Robin Williams, quoting a line of his from the film \u201cAladdin\u201d: \u201cTo be free. Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world.\u201dWith financing from the State Department, Mr. Fares started a local radio station, Radio Fresh, that broadcast music, news and warnings about incoming airstrikes.But civilian activists like Mr. Fares came under increasing pressure as extremist groups like the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State gained power in rebel-held areas. They opposed broadcasting music and stormed the radio station to stop it, as well as objecting to the promotion of what they saw as Western ideas like democracy.In 2014, two gunmen from the Islamic State attacked Mr. Fares outside his house, shooting him in the chest, one of the many efforts by extremists to stop his work.Mr. Fares was keenly aware of the risks and told a reporter for The New York Times in an online chat that he was working \u201cin a minefield,\u201d but did not want to leave Syria.\u201cThis is our revolution and we will continue,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe managed to confront them through our media, so the only choice they have is to kill us.\u201dLast year, Mr. Fares spoke at the Oslo Freedom Forum about his efforts early in the war to document the attacks that often killed his friends.\u201cThey weren\u2019t numbers, they were people, my relatives, people I know, my friends,\u201d he said. \u201cAssad is still killing, but we are continuing with our revolution until we achieve our dream of Syria as a democracy for everyone.\u201dBut the trajectory of the war had made activists like Mr. Fares increasingly rare. The State Department had cut support, so the radio station was off the air, and Mr. Fares was scrambling for support for other projects supporting students and women.A tenuous deal between Turkey and Russia was the only barrier to a Syrian government assault on Idlib Province, where he lived. And extremist militants were still active in the area.On Friday, he was driving home from a mosque with a friend, Hammoud al-Juneid, when gunmen opened fire on their car, killing both men. Mr. Fares\u2019s friends assumed the killers were from an extremist group linked to Al Qaeda.Mr. Fares was buried Friday afternoon, and a friend who attended his funeral was shocked at how subdued it was, in contrast to the boisterous protests that Mr. Fares had once organized in the town.\u201cHe was the spirit of the revolution, and today I really felt that we lost the last spirit,\u201d the friend said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear that he, too, would become a target. \u201cAll those who started the revolution of Raed\u2019s age either died or fled, so who will mourn Raed the way that he used to mourn the martyrs in the past?\u201dHwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut and Karam Shoumali from Berlin.Advertisement"}

He wasn\u2019t dead, just wounded. The gunshot sliced a deep, red groove into his head.Ambushed by his attackers at a Mexico City store, Mr. Zambada stumbled to his feet and came up shooting. With a panicked spray of gunfire, he hit one of them. The other ran away.\u201cI\u2019m alive,\u201d he told a jury on Thursday, \u201cbecause the bullet did not penetrate my skull.\u201dFor nearly five hours, he told the jury frontline stories from Mexico\u2019s brutal drug wars \u2014 among them, his own close brush with death in 1994, when he was hunted down by gunmen from the Arellano-Fel\u00edx gang, one of his cartel\u2019s most bitter rivals.His account was delivered in a gritty style that might be described as narco-Gothic. He gave the jury an insider\u2019s view of well-known crimes in Mexico, including the murder of a Roman Catholic cardinal, a blood bath in a Puerto Vallarta nightclub and the assassination of a competing trafficker, who was shot in the neck.\u201cThey always end up with deaths,\u201d Mr. Zambada said about the battles he had been through. \u201cThere are a lot of deaths.\u201dIt was the first time during Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s drug-conspiracy trial, which is being held under extremely tight security at the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, that the testimony turned grisly. But the violent nature of the tales was undercut by the teller\u2019s blas\u00e9 manner. Even as he spoke about his favorite type of pistol (a .38 caliber) and the killing of one of his brothers, Mr. Zambada seemed relaxed, stroking his chin and casually spinning in his chair.His narrative began in the early 1990s when Mr. Guzm\u00e1n and his Sinaloan partners \u2014 including Mr. Zambada and his brother, Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda \u2014 went to war with another pair of brothers, Benjam\u00edn and Ram\u00f3n Arellano Fel\u00edx, who ran a cartel in Tijuana. The hostilities broke out after Ismael Zambada parted ways with the Arellano Fel\u00edx brothers and instead joined one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s allies.After the split, Mr. Zambada told the jury, the Arellano Fel\u00edx brothers closed the Tijuana border to the Sinaloan traffickers, an order that the stubborn Mr. Guzm\u00e1n ignored. The Arellano Fel\u00edxes were outraged. And in 1992, Mr. Zambada said, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n tried to take revenge.Mr. Zambada said that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n had planned that night to murder Ram\u00f3n Arellano-Fel\u00edx. While the intended target survived the attack, some of his gunmen and several bystanders did not.It took another decade for the bloody circle to finally be closed. In Feb. 2002, Mr. Arellano Fel\u00edx was stopped by the authorities in the Pacific Coast resort of Mazatl\u00e1n. A firefight ensued, and the Tijuana drug lord fled toward a hotel. But before he got there, someone put a bullet in his neck.Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was thrilled by the death of his antagonist, he said.\u201cIf anything had really given him pleasure,\u201d Mr. Zambada told the jury, \u201cit was to have killed Ram\u00f3n Arellano.\u201dBefore he offered up this litany of gore, Mr. Zambada confessed to yet another crime. Every month, he said, for more than a decade, he had personally paid $300,000 in bribes to Mexican officials.Acting as a cartel bagman, Mr. Zambada said he bribed military officers, the municipal and federal police, authorities at airports and seaports, officials in the attorney general\u2019s office, even representatives from Interpol.These illicit handouts were particularly useful, he said, when Mr. Guzm\u00e1n escaped from prison \u2014 for the first time \u2014 in 2001, hidden in a laundry cart. Working with his brother, Mr. Zambada said he helped the kingpin flee from his pursuers by arranging for a helicopter to ferry him to safety.Once Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was finally in the clear, Mr. Zambada said, he and his brother drove the boss to the heart of Mexico City, the territory that Mr. Zambada ran for the cartel. He had arranged in advance for the police to escort them. But Mr. Guzm\u00e1n suddenly got nervous when a squad car and a motorcycle unexpectedly pulled up.Mr. Zambada put his friend at ease.\u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019\u201d he recounted to the jury. \u201c\u2018These are our people.

Says, and Weighs Penalty", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWith what the Italian government has put on the table, we see a risk of the country sleepwalking into instability,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission vice president.The country, which is led by populist and anti-establishment forces, was a case of \u201cparticularly serious noncompliance,\u201d he added.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive branch, will now turn its negative assessment of the budget over to eurozone countries. In two weeks, they could give the commission the green light to start an \u201cexcessive deficit procedure\u201d against Italy, which could lead to steep fines.But both are happy to fight the European Union, and both have a history of skepticism when it comes to membership of the euro. Ahead of European Parliament elections in May, both parties need an enemy to run against, and with migrant landings down, bureaucrats in Brussels fit the bill nicely.Brussels had rejected a previous version of the budget, but the Italian government responded this month with only small amendments. The new round of budget rejection and Italian defiance on Wednesday, when the commission made its annual review of eurozone spending plans, was completely expected.\u201cWe are still committed to our budget,\u201d Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters, adding that the Italian government was sure of its position but that he would \u201cbe very willing\u201d to discuss it with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, when they met to discuss next steps at a dinner in Brussels on Saturday.\u201cA letter arrived from Brussels? I was expecting one from Santa Claus,\u201d said Mr. Salvini, the deputy prime minister and the most powerful force in the Italian government, who has suggested that Mr. Juncker has a drinking problem.He added that he would be polite in discussing the budget with European Union officials but would not be persuaded to reinstate the previous government\u2019s pension reductions. \u201cItaly has a need to grow,\u201d he told reporters.A report in the Turin-based newspaper La Stampa, citing anonymous sources, suggested that Mr. Salvini could be willing to significantly soften his position. That appeared to mute the market reaction, but a spokeswoman for Mr. Salvini disputed the report on Wednesday.\u201cTo the citizens we say have no fear because we will not retreat,\u201d said Francesco D\u2019Uva, a member of Parliament with the Five Star Movement. \u201cWe weren\u2019t elected to enact the same destructive policies of the old governments.\u201dThe Italians say that austerity measures imposed by Brussels and the powerful northern European countries that have sway there have suffocated the Italian economy.They argue that only through spending \u2014 on a citizens\u2019 income, generous pensions, and reduced taxes \u2014 can they stimulate the stuck Italian economy, and that they will then bring down their deficit \u2014 currently at 132 percent of output, more than twice the European Union limit \u2014 through growth.But the European Union, and other international institutions and ratings services, have deemed Italian growth projections to be fanciful and overly optimistic. The reality, critics and opponents of the government said, was that Wednesday marked a decline in the country\u2019s standing.\u201cToday a very sad thing happened to our country,\u201d said Pier Carlo Padoan, the finance minister in the previous Democratic Party administration.\u201cI am very worried,\u201d said Antonio Tajani, the president of European Parliament and a top official in Forza Italia, the center-right party of the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.He pointed to the risk premium on Italian government bonds that consistently hovers in dangerous territory, to the poor performance of the Italian stock market and to rising investor anxiety.\u201cThe Italian citizens don\u2019t deserve this disaster due to an irresponsible government that, instead of resolving the problems of Italians, everyday invents new enemies,\u201d Mr. Tajani said.Despite the posturing of both sides, the process leading to sanctions is lengthy, and leaves plenty of time for Brussels and Rome to find a compromise and avoid a confrontation that would further destabilize the European Union when it is already struggling with slower economic growth and Britain\u2019s planned departure.The Italian Parliament has to approve a budget by Dec. 31, which leaves time to change proposals. And some members of European Parliament have suggested that Brussels should bend.Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament from the Green Party, said that, while the excessive deficit procedure against Italy was unavoidable under European Union rules, the commission should be willing to compromise.\u201cMore spending could be sensible if it revives Italy\u2019s economy,\u201d Mr. Giegold said in a statement. \u201cBoth sides should give ground.\u201dThe question is whether Brussels will stand firm and whether there is any pressure \u2014 outside of crippling market reactions \u2014 large enough to change the political calculus that appears to be motivating Italy\u2019s coalition partners to refuse to budge. Both the League and Five Star are looking to increase their domestic popularity, and leverage, ahead of May\u2019s elections.\u201cWe are convinced of the numbers we put in our budget,\u201d Mr. Salvini said on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll go forward.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the first name of Italy\u2019s prime minister.

{"Headline": "The World Needs to Quit Coal. Why Is It So Hard?", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 Coal, the fuel that powered the industrial age, has led the planet to the brink of catastrophic climate change.Central to that transformation: Getting out of coal, and fast.So, why is coal so hard to quit?Because coal is a powerful incumbent. It\u2019s there by the millions of tons under the ground. Powerful companies, backed by powerful governments, often in the form of subsidies, are in a rush to grow their markets before it is too late. Banks still profit from it. Big national electricity grids were designed for it. Coal plants can be a surefire way for politicians to deliver cheap electricity \u2014 and retain their own power. In some countries, it has been a glistening source of graft.\u201cThe main reason why coal sticks around is, we built it already,\u201d said Rohit Chandra, who earned a doctoral degree in energy policy at Harvard, specializing in coal in India. The battle over the future of coal is being waged in Asia. That contest is particularly stark in Southeast Asia, one of the world\u2019s last frontiers of coal expansion.Nguy Thi Khanh has seen the contest close-up in Vietnam. Born in 1976, a year after the end of the war, she remembers doing homework by the light of a kerosene lamp. In her northern village, the electricity failed several hours a day. When it rained, there was no power at all. When it came, it came from a coal plant not far away. When her mother hung laundry to dry, ash settled on the clothes.Today, pretty much every household in Vietnam, population 95 million, has electricity. Hanoi, the capital, where Ms. Nguy now lives, is in a frenzy of new construction, with soaring demand for cement and steel \u2014 both energy guzzlers. The economy is galloping. And, up and down the coast, 1,600 kilometers in length, foreign companies, mainly from Japan and China, are building coal plants.A second coal-fired power plant, far bigger, is under construction next door. Marubeni is building that too, along with a Korean company. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation, an export credit agency meant to lower financial risk for private lenders, is helping to fund it.In the shadow of the smokestack, Nguyen Thi Thu Thien was drying shrimp on the side of the road and complaining bitterly. She had moved out of her house after the power plant built an ash pond right in front. \u201cThe coal dust has blackened my house,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the trees are dying. We can\u2019t live there.\u201dShe and the others drying shrimp on the road were doubly angry that the new plant would need a new port, and that would displace their husbands, who tie up their fishing boats there.Trucks rumbled by, throwing up dust, as the women emptied their baskets of shrimp. They kept every bit of themselves covered: wide brimmed hats, face masks, gloves. Coal accounts for 36 percent of the country\u2019s power generation capacity now; it is projected to grow to 42 percent by 2030, according to the government. To feed those plants, Vietnam will need to import 90 million tons of coal by 2030.Vietnam says it is on track to meet its emissions reductions targets under the Paris accord. So, too, China and India, with far bigger carbon footprints. But those targets were set by the countries themselves, and they will not be enough to keep global temperatures from rising to calamitous levels. The United States has said it will exit the Paris climate pact.The economics, and the political calculus, are very different in the world\u2019s biggest democracy: India, population 1.3 billion. Ajay Mishra, the career civil servant in charge of energy in the central Indian state of Telangana, knows firsthand.Five years ago, he said, daily power cuts cursed his state. Ceiling fans cut out on stifling summer afternoons. Factories ran on diesel-guzzling generators. The people of Telangana were furious.State officials had to do something to fix the electricity problem. They harnessed the sun, briefly making Telangana a leading solar power producer in India. They also turned to what government officials have relied on for over a century: the vast vein of coal that sat underground, stretching across the hills and forests of central India. Telangana now has round-the-clock electricity. Its farmers get it free to pump water. It sweetens the re-election bid of Telangana\u2019s top elected official, K. Chandrashekar Rao, in state polls later this year. \u201cWe have coal,\u201d Mr. Mishra said. \u201cWe are producing more every year. For the next 100 years we have it.\u201d A simple pulley drew them in, a bit like a ski lift, except here, it took them deeper and deeper down a shaft. The creak of the pulley was all you could hear, and water, drip-dripping inside the earth. Here and there, off to the side, stood miners, their forms barely visible in the darkness, except for the belted flashlights that snaked across their bodies.So deeply is India invested in coal, this, like other mines, is state owned. So are most power plants. Coal subsidizes the country\u2019s vast rail network. That person at the top of that system, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has sought to cast himself as a champion of clean energy. In an interview in the capital, New Delhi, India\u2019s energy secretary, Ajay Bhalla, said some 50 gigawatts of additional coal capacity were under construction. That\u2019s a fraction of what was under development even a decade ago, when India\u2019s energy demand was projected to soar. Many of those plants are meant to replace older, more polluting ones. But coal would not sunset anytime soon, he predicted, not until there\u2019s a cheap and efficient way to store energy from solar and wind energy.For now, though, coal accounts for 58 percent of India\u2019s energy mix. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m using the coal very willingly,\u201d Mr. Bhalla said. \u201cBut I have to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poor Disaster Oversight Imperiled Nursing Homes, Senate Report Finds", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Senate inquiry faulted state and federal oversight for fatal heat strokes and chaotic evacuations at nursing homes after last year\u2019s hurricanes, calling for tougher disaster preparedness standards on Friday.While the report noted that most nursing homes fared adequately after hurricanes in Florida and Texas last year, it concluded that tragic exceptions \u201cresulted from inadequate regulation and oversight, ineffective planning and communications protocols, and questionable decision-making by facility administrators.\u201dThose events prompted the federal rule, completed in 2016, that mandated minimum standards in emergency preparedness for health care providers participating in Medicare or Medicaid. Officials said nearly a quarter of nursing homes surveyed under the new requirements have been cited for shortcomings, including failures to test emergency plans and train staff members. Nursing homes had to submit plans to correct the problems. \u201cThese are very thorough reviews,\u201d said Kim Brandt, the agency\u2019s principal deputy administrator for operations.The new rule requires nursing homes to work with local and state authorities and other community organizations to help safeguard residents in emergencies. But the Senate report argues that the regulations, which began development under the George W. Bush administration and were completed in the last days of the Obama White House, leave gaps that endanger lives.After they were questioned last year by the Finance Committee, which oversees Medicare, agency officials said they would issue guidance to clarify \u201cexpectations for safeguarding temperature controls\u201d during emergencies, including the use of portable generators. They have not yet done so.Florida quickly moved to require nursing homes to have backup generators and enough fuel to maintain safe temperatures during power outages, but there are no similar national requirements.Prescribing generators \u201cprobably made a lot of sense for Florida, but it might not make a lot of sense for Montana,\u201d said Dr. Kate Goodrich, chief medical officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, adding that other sources of energy could be more cost-effective and reliable.When the air-conditioning failed, the center in Hollywood Hills used spot coolers, which paradoxically increased the temperature through the improper venting of exhaust heat, according to expert testimony in a case that has been brought by Florida\u2019s Agency for Health Care Administration. Representatives of the home have defended its actions, saying it requested help restoring power from officials including Gov. Rick Scott. The state said the home should have evacuated residents when conditions became unsafe.The Senate report calls for federal, state and local officials to warn nursing homes about the dangers of incorrectly installed spot coolers, and recommends that officials work with utility companies to prioritize the homes for power restoration.Older and chronically ill adults are particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme heat and cold. Nursing homes residents in Puerto Rico also suffered in the heat after Hurricane Maria last year.The report\u2019s top recommendation is for the government to modernize its standards for \u201csafe and comfortable\u201d temperatures in nursing homes by accounting for research showing that the stressful effects of heat on the body are closely tied to the heat index, which adjusts for humidity.For nearly three decades, most long-term care facilities have been required to maintain a temperature range between 71 and 81 degrees.While outside temperatures were as low as 82 degrees in the hours before residents began dying at Hollywood Hills, the high humidity made it feel closer to 90 degrees outdoors, according to data presented in the Senate report.Medicare officials said the existing temperature range requirement had proved sufficient and applied in times of disaster, even though that is not stated explicitly in the emergency preparedness rule. \u201cWe\u2019ve now had a few go-rounds of emergencies, and that seems to be an appropriate range based on our experience,\u201d Ms. Brandt said.The Senate investigation noted a host of other problems. Licensing agencies received complaints about 38 skilled nursing facilities in Texas and 42 in Florida after last year\u2019s storms. Nearly all the homes were inspected, and more than a quarter were found to be deficient or noncompliant with federal requirements.The investigators called for emergency plans to be informed by senior medical staff at nursing homes and reviewed and approved by knowledgeable regulators, a step not required in all states.Senior Care Centers, the owner of two nursing homes in Port Arthur, Tex., that flooded and required help evacuating last year, had plans that called for residents to be moved to other facilities owned by the company. But the other centers were much farther away than the 200 miles specified in its contract with an ambulance transportation company, according to the Senate report. Emergency plans also defined the meaning of a hurricane watch and warning incorrectly. The company, whose facilities received citations for substandard care from Texas health care regulators, did not respond to a message requesting comment.Nursing home administrators also need better guidance in making the difficult decision of whether to evacuate or shelter in place before a predicted hurricane or flood event, the report said. It recommended that regulators require that those decisions \u201cbe made by qualified personnel in a methodical way.\u201dIn a sign of the politically divisive times, the nursing home report was released by the Finance Committee\u2019s minority staff, although the investigation began with letters to regulatory agencies that were signed by Mr. Wyden and the Republican committee chair, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, and were sent at the request of Florida\u2019s Republican and Democratic senators.Advertisement"}

For the quarter that ended in September, revenue came in at $12.4 billion, a 54 percent increase from a year earlier but less than analysts had expected.\u201cThe global economy is in a state of uncertainty,\u201d Daniel Zhang, Alibaba\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cThe U.S.-China trade tensions create increased risk of instability.\u201dThe decision to lower sales expectations was made only recently, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said. Economic conditions deteriorated noticeably in just the past month, she said. \u201cMerchants are facing challenging times,\u201d she said.There is mounting evidence that China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second-largest after the United States\u2019, is slowing. But Alibaba\u2019s trimming of its sales outlook suggests the downturn is starting to affect more parts of the economy, including China\u2019s growing middle class.Shawn Yang, 27, works in finance in Shanghai. He said that distress being felt in his industry had him thinking twice about buying nonessential items like gadgets and video games.This year? He plans to spend less than half that amount, on jeans from Zara, two shirts for work and a bottle of moisturizer.The other dark cloud hovering over the Chinese economy has drifted in from overseas.The quarter that ended in September was the first since the Trump administration began its trade war with China. Alibaba executives have sought to reassure investors by pointing out that even if tariffs on imports make American goods more expensive, Chinese customers can still use Alibaba\u2019s platforms to buy more products made domestically or in other countries.But the effects of the tariffs are only beginning to be felt across China\u2019s $12 trillion economy. Factory activity is slowing, which could eventually result in job losses and a drop in retail spending. Washington and Beijing seem to be hunkering down for a protracted conflict, one in which disagreements about trade seem inextricable from broader questions involving geopolitical and technological dominance.For Alibaba, the timing is inopportune.Alibaba has long enjoyed an unmatched grip on how Chinese consumers shop on their phones and computers. Lately, the company has said its future depends on extending its consumer empire into the wider, nondigital world.Expanding its operations offline has helped raise Alibaba\u2019s sales growth. Revenue from retail experiments like Hema jumped 151 percent in the latest quarter from a year earlier. Sales in the company\u2019s cloud-computing division, the market leader in China, soared 90 percent.But spending on developing the new ventures has squeezed the company\u2019s bottom line. Asked on Friday whether the more pessimistic outlook for this year might lead Alibaba to scale back on such projects, Ms. Wu, the chief financial officer, said the company evaluated them not on their financial return, but according to other metrics, such as the number of users they attract.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

The closed-door deal to avoid local review has angered many Council members and state legislators, some of whom appeared at Wednesday\u2019s rally.\u201cWhy did they usurp the ability of the Council to do its job?\u201d asked a newly elected assemblywoman, Catalina Cruz, who represents the nearby Queens neighborhoods of Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not good for our community.\u201dBut what can opponents actually do to stop it? The City Council could try to alter or eliminate the tax breaks promised Amazon by the city, public policy experts said, but those are not unique to Amazon, and any changes would similarly affect other companies\u2019 tax packages.Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, said in a statement that if the state\u2019s economic projections are correct, \u201cthis deal has the potential to more than pay for itself.\u201d The Bronx Democrat added, \u201cOf course we take our role in approving aspects of this deal very seriously and we will be closely reviewing it.\u201dThere will likely be a state-run environmental review to examine the impact of the Amazon development. But the input from local officials is only advisory. Opponents would not be able to block the deal \u2014 something they could have done if it went through the City Council. One or more government boards must also review elements of the plan and the incentive package before it goes into effect. One of those, the Empire State Development board, is controlled by Mr. Cuomo\u2019s executive branch and is an unlikely avenue for opponents.Detractors may find that they have the most leverage at the obscure, five-member Public Authorities Control Board, which reviews and approves certain financing deals by state authorities. Some aspects of the Amazon deal, such as a $500 million state grant, are likely to go before that board, experts said. \u201cThe Public Authority Control Board will likely have to approve the agreement,\u201d said David J. Friedfel, director of state studies at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission.The board is led by an appointee of the governor, but gives veto power to the Assembly speaker and the Senate leader, through their representatives, said E.J. McMahon, research director for the Empire Center for Public Policy, a research organization in Albany. \u201cIt\u2019s the main choke point,\u201d he said. But some critics believe that, too, could be an uphill battle. The board\u2019s chairman, Robert F. Mujica Jr., said it would not necessarily review the state\u2019s incentive package.\u201cThe capital grant does not have to go through P.A.C.B.,\u201d Mr. Mujica, who was appointed by Mr. Cuomo, said in an interview on Wednesday. The prime option is to continue to publicly pressure Amazon.Hearings, even if they are nonbinding, could increase negative attention on the company, as could a court fight. Opponents of the Atlantic Yards development spent years in court and successfully trained negative attention on that plan. But they ultimately failed to stop the project, which includes the Barclays Center arena.\u201cAll of these battles are uphill battles.\u201d Others simply want Amazon to stay out of New York City.\u201cThe leverage point, I think we saw it today: The outpouring of opposition to this proposal,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, whose union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, took part in Wednesday\u2019s protest in Queens. He spoke by phone from a meeting in Geneva of international unions opposed to Amazon.\u201cTheir business model depends on low taxes and low wages and a reduction of workers rights,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this the behavior that New York wants to reward?\u201dBy the end of Wednesday, at least one possible presidential contender had begun criticizing the deal: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.Nate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York State\u2019s Lawsuit Against Trump Foundation Can Proceed, Judge Rules", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers had argued that the court did not have jurisdiction over Mr. Trump, as president, and that the statutes of limitations had expired in the case of some of the actions at issue. They also contended the attorney general\u2019s office suffered from a \u201cpervasive bias\u201d against Mr. Trump.In her 27-page ruling, Justice Saliann Scarpulla disagreed. \u201cI find I have jurisdiction over Mr. Trump,\u201d she wrote.Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for the Trump Foundation, said in a prepared statement: \u201cThe decision means only that the case goes forward. As we have maintained throughout, all of the money raised by the Foundation went to charitable causes to assist those most in need. As a result, we remain confident in the ultimate outcome of these proceedings.\u201dThe White House directed questions to the Trump Organization; a company representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.It was the second time this year that a New York State judge in Manhattan had decided that Mr. Trump, just because he is president, is not immune from civil court cases that involve his unofficial activities or actions that took place before he was in office.Justice Schecter wrote in her ruling: \u201cThere is absolutely no authority for dismissing or staying a civil action related purely to unofficial conduct because the defendant is the President of the United States.\u201d Justice Scarpulla quoted the passage in her own ruling.Justice Scarpulla also cited the decision to allow a sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Jones against Bill Clinton to proceed during his time as president.The suit names Mr. Trump as well as two of his children, Ivanka and Eric.\u201cThe Trump Foundation functioned as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump\u2019s business and political interests,\u201d Ms. Underwood wrote in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe welcome Justice Scarpulla\u2019s decision, which allows our suit to move forward.\u201dThe foundation and Trump family could face millions of dollars in penalties from the suit.The attorney general is seeking to make the foundation pay $2.8 million in restitution, the amount raised for the foundation at the Iowa fund-raiser; the office is also seeking to prevent the president from running another nonprofit for 10 years.One argument Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers made as they sought to have the law suit dismissed was that the attorney general\u2019s office was politically biased against the president.In her decision, Justice Scarpulla wrote that \u201cgiven the very serious allegations\u201d set forth in the suit, there was \u201cno basis\u201d for finding that animus and bias were the sole motivation for the investigation.Justice Scarpulla did rule in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor on one point. She denied the attorney general\u2019s request that the Trump Foundation be prevented from operating until the lawsuit is resolved.But that was a moot point, she noted, because the family was already \u201ctrying voluntarily to dissolve the Foundation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Rechnitz, was not among them.Mayor Bill de Blasio and his staff are required to keep records that are connected to his government work. That includes emails about public activities that are sent to private email accounts. If someone requests the mayor to do something in his capacity as an elected official, those emails would be subject to public review.\u201cIt\u2019s an occasion for the new leadership of D.O.I. to demonstrate independence in the clearest possible terms,\u201d Mr. Torres said in an interview. \u201cIt strikes at the core of D.O.I.\u2019s function, which is good government.\u201dUnder the City Charter, both the mayor and the Council have the power to direct the Investigation Department to conduct an inquiry. \u201cThe Council takes its oversight role seriously and believes an investigation into the matter is warranted,\u201d said Jennifer Fermino, a spokeswoman for the Council speaker, Corey Johnson.In one email that emerged Wednesday as Mr. Rechnitz testified in the police trial, the donor pleaded with the mayor to persuade Philip Banks III, a high-ranking Police Department official who had received gifts from Mr. Rechnitz, to rescind his planned resignation.\u201cWhat can we do for you to refuse Banks\u2019s resignation?\u201d Mr. Rechnitz wrote.Months earlier, Mr. Rechnitz had invited the mayor to share courtside Knicks tickets with him.\u201cFor the two percent chance your schedule permits and you\u2019re in the mood, care to join me in my courtside seats tomorrow?\u201d Mr. Rechnitz wrote to the mayor in a February 2014 email, with the subject, \u201cKnicks tomorrow.\u201dThe mayor, just over a month into his first term, responded within five minutes to Mr. Rechnitz.

Phillips, the mayor\u2019s press secretary, said that the reason the correspondence unveiled at the trial was not given to reporters last year was that City Hall did not find the emails during their search.\u201cThe email isn\u2019t in our possession,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he wasn\u2019t required to retain it.\u201dAnother mayoral spokeswoman, Natalie Grybauskas, said in a written response on Thursday that \u201cCity Hall only retains emails when they are certain types of public records, like audits, personnel actions, policy memos, final reports or emails that are subject to ongoing information requests or litigation.\u201cThis is a Bloomberg-era email retention policy that has not changed. City Hall employees are under no requirement to retain every email ever written or received.\u201dThe explanation suggested that untold other emails had not been kept \u2014 in other words, deleted \u2014 well beyond the two that came to light at the trial. City Hall maintains this is legal and appropriate.John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, a government watchdog group, disagreed, saying that the mayor\u2019s nondisclosure of the emails was a clear violation of the public information law.\u201cThere is no doubt the mayor should have disclosed these emails,\u201d Mr. Kaehny said.\u201cThe question is, was the mayor contacted as Bill de Blasio the person or Bill de Blasio the mayor? There is no doubt that he was contacted as the mayor,\u201d Mr. Kaehny said, adding that the mayor should be sanctioned for his failure to do so.The current bribery trial is focused on the actions of two defendants: Jeremiah Reichberg, a friend of Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s, and a former Police Department deputy inspector, James Grant. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Reichberg, who once hosted Mr. de Blasio at his Brooklyn home for a fund-raiser, and Mr. Rechnitz of paying top officials and police leaders for special treatment.

{"Headline": "Time to Make the Donates!", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn these turbulent times, charitable clicks are a form of self-soothing as well as generosity.Before the 2016 election, Tess Malone, 28, rarely engaged in charitable giving outside of disaster relief funds or individual GoFundMe fund-raising campaigns. But now, donating \u2014 often in the form of a late-night, anxiety-fueled frenzy \u2014 is as standard an expenditure for her as groceries and dining out.Ms. Malone, who lives in Atlanta and works in communications at Georgia Tech, siphons about $50 from her budget each month toward recurring donations to progressive causes and candidates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Network of Abortion Funds and Planned Parenthood. Ms. Malone wryly describes it as \u201cself-medicating with money,\u201d and for her it started the day after Donald Trump was elected to the presidency.Feeling powerless and unsure of how to help without meddling, Ms. Malone set up another recurring monthly donation, this time to the American Civil Liberties Union. The contribution felt productive, if microscopically so, and helped to assuage an otherwise overwhelming sense of despair. \u201cJust doing one thing, even if it\u2019s donating, feels like at least I did some of my part,\u201d said Ms. Malone, who also canvassed for Stacey Abrams\u2019s campaign for governor in Georgia and regularly volunteers as a patient escort at Planned Parenthood.For Ms. Malone and others reeling from a news cycle that feels like constant crisis mode, flinging money at political and social causes as a knee-jerk response to the headlines has become tantamount to self-care. Anger or fear as motivation for donating isn\u2019t a new phenomenon: Civil and human rights organizations immediately witnessed a so-called Trump bump after the 2016 election, with people like Ms. Malone channeling their shock and frustration by funneling money to political and social causes they felt were in jeopardy under the new administration.Immediately after the announcement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy\u2019s retirement from the Supreme Court, the National Network of Abortion Funds saw more than 400 people collectively donate nearly $30,000, according Lindsay Rodriguez, the communications director. \u201cAfter news stories that threaten abortion, like the Kennedy retirement, the Kavanaugh hearings and election results recently in Alabama and West Virginia, we see a big surge in people posting on social media that folks should donate to abortion funds and tagging us, and local funds, in those posts,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said.Perhaps the strongest proof of the power of the panic donation transpired in July, when the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (R.A.I.C.ES.), a Texas-based nonprofit, scooped up three times its annual operating budget in a matter of days after a Facebook fund-raiser, days after news of the government\u2019s border separation policy broke.For many, it\u2019s a familiar cycle. News breaks \u2014 a mass shooting, a rolling back of civil rights, a vulnerable minority group in the cross hairs of legislation. Anger and panic ensue. In the face of that mass collective anxiety, social and political activists steer people toward the organizations already working to directly combat the issue at hand. Those panicking, eager to help and perhaps more so to feel slightly less terrible about the world if only for an instant, pull out their credit cards or PayPal passwords and attempt to reclaim their sense of agency by handing over a small sum of cash. Repeat as needed.For those who have the privilege to do so, dispatching 20 bucks to an organization is now as simple as Venmo-ing a friend for brunch, and it\u2019s a small price to pay for alleviating existential despair, if only briefly. \u201cIt\u2019s something I can do late at night from my phone when I\u2019m freaking out,\u201d Ms. Malone said. Unlike marching or volunteering, sending money can be done instantly and at any hour of the day or night, no matter when bad news strikes.\u201cI don\u2019t have enough money to have made any kind of giant difference, but the panic donation is a new reality for our budget,\u201d said Christina Rentz, 39, who lives in Durham, N.C., and works as a label manager at Merge Records. \u201cEvery time something horrible happens, I text my husband and say, \u2018I donated $50 more to the A.C.L.U., because everything is terrible,\u2019 or \u2018I donated to RAICES, because I cried on the way to work today.\u2019\u201d Gun control is an issue that makes Ms. Rentz, a mother of two young boys, feel especially hopeless. Consequently, she donates fairly regularly to Everytown for Gun Safety, though she can\u2019t remember which mass shooting spurred her first donation. \u201cI think it was Parkland, but \u2026 isn\u2019t it terrible that you\u2019re like, \u2018Which school shooting was it?\u2019 Isn\u2019t that horrible?\u201dSending money, Ms. Rentz said, temporarily alleviates that sense of helplessness and overwhelm. \u201cIt sucks to feel like you don\u2019t have any answers, and I think that\u2019s what leads to the panic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, surely someone must know, and maybe it\u2019s these people. \u2018Go forth and find the answers because I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u2019\u201dA similar sentiment has inspired Laurel Snyder and her husband, Chris, to donate to organizations like the A.C.L.U. and the Southern Poverty Law Center. \u201cWe had to support the institutions that could stand up for those beyond the government,\u201d said Ms. Snyder, 44, who writes children\u2019s books and lives in Atlanta. Ms. Snyder, who grew up canvassing and demonstrating, said she prefers to engage with activism by getting out in the streets, but her husband has become a habitual giver. The couple sees their donations not as a coping mechanism but as a responsibility, to the extent that they have become an unofficial line item on the family\u2019s operating budget. \u201cI feel like, we all didn\u2019t do enough for a really long time, and so we\u2019re sort of trying to pull back that ground,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my head, I have to do this budgeting, like, \u2018All right, I guess we won\u2019t get pizza this week.\u2019\u201dMs. Rentz, who has also donated to KIND Inc., You Can Vote and the N.A.A.C.P. in the last year, said, \u201cI think about it like, what could I spend this money on that\u2019s more important than this? And in that moment, there isn\u2019t anything. What, I\u2019m going to go to the movies another night? What is more important than safety and democracy? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s helping, but just that feeling is worth it to me.\u201dOne of those donors was Sam Swanson of College Park, Md., who had never contributed to the N.R.A. or actively engaged in gun culture until this year. Mr. Swanson, 22, who works in cybersecurity, closely followed the events of Parkland on conservative Reddit boards and was struck by the calls for gun control that ensued in the wake of the shooting. After watching the town hall on gun violence hosted by CNN, he said, he was galvanized to act. He described feeling \u201cdisgusted and angered\u201d by the way the N.R.A. staff was treated at the event, and fearful of potential legislation in response to the shooting. \u201cBut perhaps most of all,\u201d Mr. Swanson said, \u201cI felt a sense of resolve \u2014 a resolve to do something to ensure that my rights are protected and that the rights of millions of others like me are protected.\u201d He gave $30 for a basic N.R.A. membership (and bought his first pistol, a 9 millimeter, shortly thereafter).Mr. Swanson has since continued contributing to various Second Amendment organizations. In May, Maryland passed legislation banning bump stocks; Mr. Swanson reacted by giving $50 to Maryland Shall Issue, which planned to file a suit against the state. Donating to these organizations, he said, makes him feel helpful and hopeful \u2014 and, he added, \u201ca bit more safe, knowing that I\u2019m not alone in fighting for these rights.\u201dIt\u2019s telling that the same event spurred an identical response in people on different ends of the political spectrum with irreconcilable perspectives but twinned motivations \u2014 fear, anger, helplessness. Though their political positions are opposite, the cognitive mechanisms are strikingly similar. Ulrich Mayr, a researcher and professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, is the co-author of a study of the neuroeconomics of altruism in 2009, which used brain imaging to track cognitive responses to giving money.\u201cWe basically tracked the reward centers while people see other people being helped, and when that happens, the reward area activity increased,\u201d Dr. Mayr said. That reward center in the brain is the same one that is activated by cocaine or, say, getting a bonus at work. \u201cThe short story is that we found pretty hard evidence that to a considerable degree, people do give because they really want to help other people.\u201d Seeing people better off \u2014 whether your personal definition of \u201cbetter off\u201d involves more or fewer guns, or immigrants, or abortion clinics \u2014 genuinely does make us feel better, and our brains respond by bookmarking it as something it wants to repeat. And thus the cycle continues, as the world spins madly on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Top 12 Questions About the Midterms", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur political reporter Alex Burns answers readers\u2019 most common questions. There is so much coverage out there. So many races and candidates. But these midterm elections could be a turning point: a reaffirmation of President Trump\u2019s leadership of the Republican Party or a protest against the G.O.P. that doubles as an expression of support for the Democrats. That\u2019s where our national political correspondent Alex Burns and The Campaign Reporter come in. The Campaign Reporter is a messenger project in which readers regularly receive Alex\u2019s dispatches as he covers some of the most important elections across the United States, from the suburbs of Dallas to Concord, N.H.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.It is also a place where readers can weigh in on our coverage. For example, readers of The Campaign Reporter recently voted to send Alex to Georgia for the first debate between the state\u2019s candidates for governor, Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp (in lieu of attending the debate between Florida\u2019s candidates for governor or events featuring potential presidential candidates). A bunch of you are asking about these early voting numbers. ...I\u2019m going to be honest, this is a traumatic subject for me because of 2016.A lot of tea leaves in the early voting \u2014 in Florida especially \u2014 looked as if Hillary Clinton were headed for a clear win.More than other polling, that\u2019s what I feel led me astray two years ago. So I\u2019m very suspicious of early-voting analysis.Having said that, here are some things you should keep in mind when you read about early voting.It can definitely be a gauge of enthusiasm. But massive early voting for one party or the other doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more voting over all.And Republicans and Democrats tend to cast their early votes differently. Republicans like voting by mail, Democrats like voting early in person.Here\u2019s how super PACs flex their muscles.Meredith from Oregon and Andrea from Boca Raton both wanted to know more about super PACs.The main thing they do is paid advertising, though some also fund get-out-the-vote organizing on the ground.At this point in the election, you see these hugely well-funded groups shifting money all over the map to drive their side\u2019s message on TV. In most cases, the ads are negative.That\u2019s because Democratic and Republican strategists believe candidates have to tell their own positive stories. If you see a candidate talking into the camera, that\u2019s almost never a super PAC ad.So when Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC, announced that it would spend millions to boost Bob Menendez, a vulnerable New Jersey senator, you could have guessed it would be for attack ads against his Republican opponent, Bob Hugin.And sure enough, that\u2019s what it has been \u2014 ads attacking Hugin as a pro-Trump pharma executive.Katey from Illinois asked how important TV ads are and whether they sway people. My unsatisfying answer is: It depends on the ads!When you watch them, think about what NEW information viewers are learning \u2014 and whether it seems believable.If an ad just says, \u201cCandidate X is great/bad,\u201d it probably matters less. But if you\u2019d never heard of a candidate and the first thing you learn is that they\u2019re a veteran or a teacher, that probably leaves a good impression.If you\u2019ve heard of a candidate who sounds vaguely nice and then you see an ad that they\u2019ve endorsed cutting Social Security, or they\u2019ve been accused of sexual harassment \u2014 well, that changes things.Most voters do not follow elections nearly as closely as all of you. So general impressions of candidates and political parties really do matter.Good question from Kira in Cornwall (in Britain!) about why the fund-raising numbers are so important. She asked: \u201cIs it not more important to focus on polls?\u201d For starters, we can do both!But seriously, the money tells us things that polls can\u2019t. Over the course of the election, you\u2019ve seen G.O.P. super PACs apply enormous, focused pressure with an onslaught of TV ads in districts with close races.Had Democrats not amassed these huge war chests with small-donor money, that super PAC onslaught could have overwhelmed them.One thing to know about TV advertising in the United States is that candidates can buy airtime more cheaply than super PACs can. They get preferential rates.So candidate fund-raising numbers are especially important because candidate money goes further than outside money.A bunch of you have asked about polling and what to trust after 2016.The short answer is: Trust the big picture. When you see really consistent trends, like women swinging against the G.O.P. or Trump being very popular with Republicans, you can assume that\u2019s reliable.The polls I trust most, personally, are the ones that line up with actual election results we\u2019ve seen recently. When a poll shows Democrats doing very well in the suburbs of D.C. and Richmond, that makes sense \u2014 it\u2019s exactly what happened in Virginia\u2019s 2017 off-year elections.But you shouldn\u2019t take any one poll as authoritative.One thing to remember is that political parties and campaigns have a LOT more polling information and other data than we do.So their strategic choices are backed by a lot more information than the media polling you and I see.As a campaign reporter, part of what I try to do is get a sense of the private (and very expensive) polling the parties are using. In many cases, private Democratic and Republican polling is pretty similar \u2014 though the two sides can draw really different conclusions from the same numbers.So let\u2019s talk about Taylor Swift!She endorsed a couple of Democrats, including Phil Bredesen for Senate in Tennessee. Eron from Dallas was wondering if celebrity involvement might make a difference with young people.I\u2019d be skeptical that it will help Bredesen, who seems to be falling behind and wasn\u2019t really counting on young voters in the first place.But engagement in the midterms is pretty low over all, especially among young people. In 2014, just 13 percent of voters were under 30.So if Taylor Swift talking at the A.M.A.s about voting makes people aware that the elections are even happening ... that could matter for some people. And it\u2019s probably good for democracy.I should really say \u201crelatively moderate\u201d Republicans. Allison from Syracuse asked about Representative John Katko from central New York, who seems to be in pretty good shape for re-election.Not many Republicans in the House can be described as moderate, and almost all of them are facing tough re-election fights in their purple suburban districts.A couple of Republicans have pointed out to me that this is one of the ironies of the election: If Democrats take the House, they\u2019ll do it by beating many Republicans who have been willing, from time to time, to break with Trump.So the Republican caucus could get Trumpier as it gets smaller and members like Mike Coffman in Colorado and Jeff Denham in California lose.But Katko\u2019s also a good example, along with Will Hurd of Texas, of where even a decent-size Democratic wave could fall short.These Republicans have never been able to take re-election for granted, and they\u2019ve worked hard to project an image different from the national G.O.P.\u2019s. Republicans in light-red districts mostly haven\u2019t done that, and they\u2019re more endangered this year as a result.Interesting questions today! Ed from Rochester, Minn., asked about House seats Democrats could lose.Not a coincidence that this question comes from a Minnesotan: The two Democratic-held seats that are most at risk are both in Minnesota. They are the First and Eighth Districts, where incumbents aren\u2019t running for re-election.If one of those two flips, it\u2019s probably the Eighth. The First, in southern Minnesota, has a weaker Republican candidate, and the current Democratic member of Congress there, Tim Walz, is running a strong race for governor and will probably lift the whole ticket.But the G.O.P. is trying to take both of those seats and a couple of others, including Representative Matt Cartwright\u2019s seat in Pennsylvania. But these areas held by Democrats voted for Trump in 2016.The map is mostly Republicans playing defense, thanks to Trump\u2019s unpopularity. But it\u2019s worth remembering that Democrats need to NET a 23-seat gain, not just win 23 G.O.P.-held seats. So if Republicans win one or both Minnesota districts, Democrats need to make up for it elsewhere.Shosh from Chicago asked if the climate will matter in the election. Conventional wisdom and polls say it won\u2019t, but I actually disagree with that.I think the climate is part of a cluster of issues \u2014 including gun control and gun rights \u2014 that send a strong cultural signal about what kind of person a candidate is.You see advertising on climate and the environment in places like California and Minnesota, where voters may not be focused on climate science as such, but where the environment is important to people.One thing I\u2019m watching is whether the climate becomes an important issue to voters in places stricken by extreme weather, like Florida.Not all the elections are just about Trump.I would point to a couple of urgent state and local issues, which aren\u2019t as obvious as national themes and are a factor even in some federal elections.Most of these campaigns are dominated by national issues \u2014 Trump, health care, the Supreme Court \u2014 but there are exceptions.One is education funding in states where schools and teachers are in bad shape. I\u2019m sure you remember the teacher strikes and walkouts this year in a number of red states, like West Virginia and Oklahoma.There are also some environmental issues that resonate more locally than nationally: toxic algae, most importantly in Florida but also in states like Ohio.And this is kind of a national issue, but there are states where infrastructure \u2014 roads and bridges \u2014 is just a more urgent concern. I\u2019ve heard a lot of that in the Midwest, and I\u2019m sure many folks have seen candidates talking about that in ads.Hello from New Hampshire! I did not dress warmly enough (sorry, Mom).Bob from Iowa wanted to know who\u2019s testing the presidential waters here. I\u2019m glad you asked!In a little bit, I\u2019m going to see Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York senator, campaign with Molly Kelly, the Democratic candidate for governor in New Hampshire.Kelly\u2019s an underdog, but she\u2019s gotten help from a bunch of national Democrats who want to run for president, including Cory Booker.That\u2019s happening in other early presidential states, too. Joe Biden\u2019s going to South Carolina for James Smith, the Democratic candidate for governor there, even though Smith\u2019s unlikely to win.But it helps to make friends in these states even if they don\u2019t win. They still have local credibility and networks of supporters to lend out.So I\u2019m headed to South Carolina.Kamala Harris is campaigning for Democrats there. It\u2019s another moment of 2018 melting into 2020.The point of these trips isn\u2019t just to check out the early stages of the presidential race. (The idea of covering another election season makes me \ud83d\ude2b just thinking about it.)They\u2019re also where you can see a party searching for and trying to define its identity.I spent a lot of time watching the G.O.P. go through this when Obama was president. You see competing themes and visions emerge in the midterms, well before they get sorted out in presidential primaries.Advertisement"}

As of Wednesday, the party had gained 39 congressional seats, easily giving it control of the House.But all that winning came at a cost: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the arm of the party focused on House races, ended the campaign cycle with $18 million in debt, according to a Democratic strategist briefed on the group\u2019s finances.They include Florida\u2019s 26th Congressional District, where Debbie Mucarsel-Powell beat the Republican incumbent, Carlos Curbelo; and New York\u2019s 19th Congressional District, where Antonio Delgado defeated the Republican representative, John J.

{"Headline": "The Best TV Shows and Movies New to Netflix Canada in December", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for December, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice.What if \u201cSave the Last Dance\u201d were Norwegian? That\u2019s the gist of this teen romance, which sparks the friction between a prim, formal dance student and the hip-hop specialist whose unconventional moves re-energize her on and off the dance floor. As \u201cBattle\u201d opens, the affluent heroine (Lisa Teige) is reeling from her father\u2019s bankruptcy, which has had a devastating effect on her confidence. After she meets a hip-hop dancer (Fabian Svegaard Tapia), their star-crossed collaboration opens her up to the liberating, improvisational world of battle dancing.The choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher (\u201c27 Dresses,\u201d \u201cThe Proposal\u201d) specializes in the sort of lightweight rom-coms and crowd pleasers that Hollywood no longer has much interest in financing. So Fletcher has taken her latest comedy to Netflix, casting Jennifer Aniston as a former beauty queen whose plus-sized daughter, Willowdean, doesn\u2019t seem likely to extend her mother\u2019s pageant dominance. Played by Danielle Macdonald, who had a breakout role in the 2017 Sundance buzz magnet \u201cPatti Cake$,\u201d Willowdean\u2019s confidence wavers when she enters a local pageant to impress a guy she likes and justify her mother\u2019s faith. Dolly Parton worked heavily on the soundtrack, which features six new songs and a few rerecorded versions of older ones.Just two years after Disney turned \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d into a live-action feature, Netflix is offering its own expensive-looking take on the Rudyard Kipling standard (bought from Warner Bros.), with a big-name voice cast (Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Benedict Cumberbatch and Naomie Harris, among others) and a director, Andy Serkis, who is known as a pioneer in motion-capture acting. The outlines of \u201cMowgli: Legend of the Jungle\u201d are familiar \u2014 an orphaned \u201cman-cub\u201d (Rohan Chand) raised in the jungles of India goes on to confront his humanity \u2014 but the film is more of a straight-up adventure than either Disney version of \u201cThe Jungle Book,\u201d which may bring it closer to the Kipling source.Social media and YouTube accounts have created a generation of D.I.Y. celebrities who pitch their selfies, videos and pop-philosophical musings directly to the fans they have cultivated. With \u201cThe American Meme,\u201d the director Bert Marcus attempts to make sense of this phenomenon by speaking to the stars themselves, including Paris Hilton, Emily Ratajkowski, Kirill Bichutsky and Josh Ostrovsky, better known as \u201cThe Fat Jew.\u201d Although many of these subjects lack evident talent \u2014 Ostrovsky, for one, was exposed as a serial joke-stealer \u2014 they share a common savvy for cultivating an audience online and feeding it all the self-promotional nuggets they can manage.In the lead-up to \u201cPaddington,\u201d the cuddly Peruvian bear, with his floppy hat and his marmalade sandwiches, became a frequent subject of Photoshop memes, most of which emphasized his creepy, anthropomorphic look. Then the film came out and the memes stopped cold. It turns out this live-action adaptation of the popular children\u2019s stories by Michael Bond isn\u2019t a mirthless trip to the uncanny valley but a gentle, adorable family comedy about the virtues of kindness and generosity. The sequel got into more complicated slapstick adventure, but \u201cPaddington\u201d keeps it simple, following the young bear as he adjusts to his new urban environs.For seven years, a young woman has been held against her will \u2014 five of those years with her son, who was born in captivity and whose biological father is the monster keeping them in a shed in his backyard. Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, \u201cRoom\u201d contends with the twin traumas of confinement and release: The boy (Jacob Tremblay) doesn\u2019t know the world that exists beyond this grim space and his mother (Oscar-winner Brie Larson) has trouble adjusting to life once they escape. The limited setting of the first half, combined with the shocking cruelty and stress inherent in the story, made \u201cRoom\u201d a tough sell, despite excellent reviews. But the performances are exceptional, and it builds to an inspiring (if sobering) testament to human resilience.As a stand-alone theatrical experience, the too-muchness of \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d is difficult to withstand, especially for those who haven\u2019t spent the past few years counting all the Infinity Stones spread among various Marvel properties. The expectation is that viewers will remember each previous film as if they saw it yesterday, or else scramble to catch up on the mythology that leads Thanos (Josh Brolin) to amass the Stones in a diabolical plot for universal domination. \u201cInfinity War\u201d feels like binge-reading a stack of superhero comic books for 149 minutes. And it\u2019s only half the story.The popular HBO series \u201cHard Knocks,\u201d which follows a different N.F.L. team through preseason every year, has long been considered a curse to the teams chronicled by it, which tend to have dismal seasons afterward. The eight-episode documentary series \u201cSunderland \u2019Til I Die\u201d makes that same pain an absolute certainty for English soccer fans and players alike. Over two straight abysmal seasons, the professional soccer team Sunderland A.F.C. performed so poorly that they were relegated to lower leagues, plunging the club into chaos. \u201cSunderland \u2019Til I Die\u201d takes a fly-on-the-wall approach to the team\u2019s humbling first year in EFL League One.After John Grisham dominated the best-seller list \u2014 and, later, the box office \u2014 with legal thrillers in the \u201990s, it\u2019s perhaps fitting that he get a share of the true-crime documentary craze currently sweeping through streaming services and podcast networks. Adapted from his nonfiction book \u201cThe Innocent Man,\u201d the film concerns Ron Williamson, a former minor-league baseball player who was sentenced to death for rape and murder in Ada, Okla., in 1988, but exonerated 11 years later by DNA evidence. The series delves into the startling details of the case and how the conviction was reversed.Given Bruce Springsteen\u2019s renown for playing three-hour concerts in the biggest arenas in America, his decision to play five nights a week at the Walter Kerr Theater, a 960-seat venue in New York City, was a tantalizing change of pace. And while \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d has enjoyed an extended run far beyond its original eight-week stint, tickets were hard to come by, especially once word of its intimate mix of music and theatrical storytelling started to spread. This Netflix taping brings unexpected access to the event, as Springsteen leads an audience through his life story and plays solo version of his songs on acoustic guitar and piano.Patrick S\u00fcskind\u2019s novel \u201cPerfume\u201d has been adapted once before, infamously, as \u201cPerfume: The Story of a Murderer,\u201d a curious and lurid historical thriller from the director of \u201cRun Lola Run,\u201d Tom Tykwer. Now it has been revived and updated as a six-episode German-language series that shifts the action to the present day and switches the genre to a serial-killer procedural. The killer\u2019s modus operandi remains the same \u2014 the victims\u2019 bodies are mined for an intoxicating smell \u2014 but here the grisly murders are rooted in a boarding school where boys discover ways to manipulate people through human scent.Marijuana aficionados tend to consider California\u2019s Humboldt County a mellow source of premium weed, but this six-part documentary series seeks to harsh that buzz. In recent years, dozens of people have gone missing in a community that has been seized by the lawlessness, corruption and violence surrounding the lucrative illegal drug business. The title \u201cMurder Mountain\u201d suggests the case for Humboldt\u2019s troubles will be made bluntly, but it\u2019s a healthy reminder to consumers that the drugs that make them feel good are often sourced from places with a darker vibe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Centrist and a Liberal Test Florida, and Democrats Everywhere Watch Closely", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 The senior senator came out first, all drawl and political muscle memory \u2014 the man with the golden-est hair in the room and an entrance song, \u201cEye of the Tiger,\u201d from 1982.And then Mr. Nelson introduced the party\u2019s main attraction on the ballot this year: the midsize-city leader nearly half his age.The people roared.Atop the Democratic ticket are two candidates standing at intraparty poles, two political theories of the moment, poised to help answer two inextricable questions about their party\u2019s future: Which model will prove most effective on Tuesday night? And which should light the way forward on Wednesday morning, when \u2014 like it or not \u2014 the 2020 presidential campaign effectively begins?There is Mr. Gillum, the young, black, uncompromising progressive, who wants to impeach the president and takes the stage to \u201cWalk It Talk It\u201d by Migos.\u201cMy opponent already knows I\u2019m black, y\u2019all,\u201d Mr. Gillum joked in Fort Lauderdale last week, referring to Ron DeSantis, the Republican candidate, as his guests lost themselves in the hip-hop beat for a moment. \u201cTrying to win this race.\u201dAnd there is Mr. Nelson, the septuagenarian, white, unapologetic centrist who revels in incrementalism and joined Congress the year Mr. Gillum was born.\u201cOn Nov. 6, you know what we are going to be singing?\u201d Mr. Nelson has said often on the campaign trail. \u201c\u2018Happy Days Are Here Again\u2019!\u201dBeneath them on the ballot are at least a half-dozen Democratic House candidates whose races \u2014 closely contested in a mix of suburban, immigrant-heavy and once-Trump-leaning districts \u2014 could determine control of the chamber. And so the state has reaffirmed its standing as the center of the political universe, with all the attendant contradictions.It is the place where Mr. Obama won twice, and where doubts persist about whether an African-American can be elected governor.The place where Mr. Trump keeps his second home, and where large sums of voters \u2014 from seething immigrants to students galvanized by the massacre in Parkland \u2014 hope to drive him from his current residence.As ever in Florida, the electoral picture is complicated. It is both a quadrennial presidential tossup, where Mr. Trump won by a point in 2016 and Mr. Obama won by less than that in 2012, and a state under near-total Republican control for a generation. No Democrat has been elected governor since 1994.For years, Mr. Nelson has been the Democrats\u2019 folksy exception in statewide races, his amiable moderation held up as the template for hanging on through persistent political headwinds.Even now, amid wide-scale upheaval in the party, some Democrats believe that this approach remains the surest way to win here, fearing that Mr. Gillum\u2019s left-wing platform risks alienating the kinds of moderates and soft Republicans that Mr. Nelson has made a career out of drawing in.But as Mr. Nelson reaches Election Day against Mr. Scott, an aggressive and self-financed challenger who has all but accused the senator of being a doddering fool, many in the party have been quietly hoping that Mr. Gillum would lift his fellow Democrat through sheer force of personality.\u201cTurnout will be a function of Andrew Gillum\u2019s charisma,\u201d said Bob Buckhorn, the Democratic mayor of Tampa. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get us to the finish line.\u201dNational Democrats have framed the contest as a kind of referendum on the future of the party, reasoning that if an unyielding liberal can win in the South \u2014 in the swingiest swing state, at that \u2014 then why should they ever settle for anything less?\u201cThis is the most important race in the United States,\u201d Tom Steyer, the billionaire progressive who has supported Mr. Gillum, said at a recent fund-raiser in Coral Gables. \u201cWhen we flip this state blue in 2018, we\u2019re going to flip this country blue in 2020.\u201dThe prospective presidential contenders are surely watching, convinced that Tuesday\u2019s verdict will make clear if the ground is more fertile for a hard-charging (and potentially nonwhite) progressive or more of an old-guard Democrat.Though Mr. Nelson has been a reliable Democratic vote in the Senate, he and Mr. Gillum part ways on many defining issues for today\u2019s liberals and younger voters \u2014 and for more moderate Democrats deeply skeptical of what liberals and younger voters are demanding.Mr. Gillum wants Medicare for all; Mr. Nelson is focused on preserving the gains of the Affordable Care Act.Mr. Gillum wants to legalize marijuana; Mr. Nelson is for medicinal marijuana only.Mr. Gillum wants a $15 minimum wage; Mr. Nelson has talked up $12.Mr. Gillum wants to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement in its current form; Mr. Nelson is unwilling to go there.\u201cI am! A revolutionary!\u201d Gillum supporters, exhorted by an introductory speaker, chanted during an event last week at a Miami Dade College campus, where a sign outside asked visitors not to feed the iguanas.Mr. Nelson is not a revolutionary.Yet Mr. Gillum has risked alienating some voters with a platform that many critics consider implausible for a state that prides itself on its low taxes and is likely to remain under Republican rule in the legislature.\u201cWhere is he going to get all this money to do all these things?\u201d asked Edilia Anasagasti, 64, a one-time Democrat now registered without party affiliation.She said she voted for Mr. DeSantis but also for Mr. Nelson, not out of any ideological fealty but because of his reliable constituent services. Mr. Nelson once tried to help Ms. Anasagasti\u2019s cousin get a travel visa from Cuba. \u201cI\u2019m going to be grateful to him always,\u201d she said.Democrats well-versed in Florida\u2019s complex constituencies caution against writing off the Nelson way. \u201cMayor Gillum and Senator Nelson help each other,\u201d said Ashley Walker, who ran Mr. Obama\u2019s Florida campaign in 2012.Mr. Gillum has shrugged this off.The most serious challenge for Democrats is demographic. To replicate Mr. Obama\u2019s success, they need minorities, millennials and white progressives, precisely the groups that \u2014 like elsewhere in the country \u2014 tend to skip midterm elections.\u201cFlorida\u2019s tough,\u201d said Daniel A. Smith, the chairman of political science at the University of Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re not shedding population. Younger voters are not replacing those that are dying off. Younger voters coming of age are being counterbalanced by older voters moving to the state who are more likely to vote.\u201dPerhaps most crucially, Latinos in Florida do not necessarily vote like Latinos nationally. Republican-leaning Cuban-Americans still dominate at the polls. Democratic-leaning non-Cubans, especially Puerto Ricans in central Florida, have started to balance them out, but have yet to match their turnout \u2014 and may not this year. Polls show Mr. Scott has made inroads with Puerto Ricans grateful for his overtures after Hurricane Maria; he spent part of Saturday in Kissimmee, outside of Orlando, in a caravan-style event that featured boricua drummers.Yet while the governor\u2019s race has emerged as a kind of proxy for the parties\u2019 dueling futures nationally, several contests in the House may have a more immediate effect on the country\u2019s political direction.\u201cIt feels different,\u201d Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the Democrat running against Mr. Curbelo, said over a plate of ceviche in a campaign office above a sushi-Thai restaurant at a strip mall. \u201cGillum, maybe, is getting people more excited.\u201dThis much enthusiasm is a departure. In past years, the party has struggled to raise money and field credible candidates in many districts. So thin is the Democratic bench, according to Mr. Buckhorn, the Tampa mayor, that even staffing a Gillum administration could be challenging.\u201cWe\u2019ve been out in the wilderness for so long that many of the folks who normally would step in are too old, out of politics or doing something else,\u201d he said.This is a challenge Democrats would be happy to have. The day after Mr. Obama\u2019s visit, the party\u2019s candidates gathered in West Palm Beach to appear with a more overtly Floridian campaign closer: Jimmy Buffett, summoned to preach peace, love and shakers of salt.But first came the undercard. Mr. Nelson strode onstage, looking out on a lawn of beach towels and avian-casual button-downs, and promised to be quick.\u201cRather than giving a speech,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to introduce Andrew Gillum.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Needing Growth, Uber Returns to Germany. This Time on Best Behavior.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byD\u00dcSSELDORF, Germany \u2014 Guido Goebel stopped driving for Uber three years ago when the company abandoned his hometown, the German city of D\u00fcsseldorf, after a battle with regulators.Several weeks ago, the ride-hailing service reached out to him again. Uber told Mr. Goebel that it was returning to D\u00fcsseldorf and offered him a bonus of 500 euros, or about $560, if he hit certain driving targets.\u201cIt\u2019s good. I\u2019m busy,\u201d Mr. Goebel, who had taken work driving patients to medical appointments, said from behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz C-Class. \u201cPeople are happy Uber is here.\u201dThe old no-holds-barred strategy \u201cclearly didn\u2019t work,\u201d and the product is now \u201ctailor made for the market,\u201d said Christoph Weigler, Uber\u2019s general manager in Germany.But Mr. Khosrowshahi must also show growth ahead of taking Uber public next year, in what would likely be one of the biggest-ever technology offerings. As a result, he is refocusing on Europe, where the company can typically charge higher fares.\u201cThey have identified Continental Europe as one of their major growth areas, but they are realizing once again that going abroad isn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Nils Stieglitz, president and managing director of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, who has tracked Uber\u2019s business.Germany is a particular prize because it is the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy and the biggest in Europe, with several densely populated cities and an affluent, digitally savvy population.Yet the country has a tangle of licensing rules that make it hard to recruit independent drivers. Germany requires drivers to pass health and driving tests, as well as receive a business license that includes a bookkeeping exam. Another rule orders drivers to return to a home base between trips, limiting how many rides can be made. Car-pooling services are banned.Over the past year, Mr. Khosrowshahi has visited Germany twice to apologize for the company\u2019s past behavior and to lobby to change some of the transportation laws. In one encouraging sign for Uber, the government said in March that it would update its transportation policy, though the deliberations could take years.\u201cThere are still aspects of the regulation that we think could be tweaked to make our model slightly more scalable,\u201d said Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the head of Uber\u2019s operations in Europe.While Uber waits for rule changes, it has teamed up with private car services and some taxi operators who already have the required licenses and drivers. It plans to introduce electric bikes in Berlin, the first city outside the United States where the Uber bikes will be available, and to eventually debut its food-delivery service in Germany.Yet as Uber tries to muscle deeper into Germany after a three-year hiatus, it faces more competition. A service owned by BMW, DriveNow, lets people rent a car with an app for short trips around cities such as Berlin. Moia, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, is testing a ride-sharing bus service in Hamburg. MyTaxi, a taxi-dispatch app owned by Daimler, is also widely used. And there are fast-growing rivals such as Taxify, which provides rides in European cities.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for them to compete on so many fronts at once,\u201d Markus Villig, Taxify\u2019s chief executive, said of Uber. Unless Uber can win major changes to German regulations, he said, \u201cthey are in a very tight spot.\u201dUber said it had selected D\u00fcsseldorf as its re-entry point for expanding in Germany after seeing that customers there had logged into its app more than 150,000 times since January, even though no cars were on the road. D\u00fcsseldorf, about 350 miles west of Berlin, is a business hub and home to popular festivals that draw travelers. One boisterous area of town, called \u201cThe Longest Bar,\u201d has more than 260 bars and dance clubs.Uber knew it could not open in D\u00fcsseldorf as it had in 2014, when it first arrived. That year, Uber didn\u2019t bother warning local officials it was coming. One morning, the app simply went live, and anybody was free to transform his or her car into a taxi without a license.\u201cIt was against every rule we had,\u201d said Rainer Matheisen, a member of the City Council at the time and now a member of the state legislature.In July, Uber contacted Mr. Matheisen and other D\u00fcsseldorf officials about trying again. The company vowed to follow all regulations by working with licensed drivers and taxi companies, and to make electric cars part of its fleet as a sign of good will for government efforts to fight air pollution.\u201cI was very skeptical because of what they did do in the past, but I was surprised by the new way of communicating with us,\u201d Mr. Matheisen said.By August, Uber was making final preparations to put cars back on the road. It opened an office in a co-working space in a downtown high-rise, where curious visitors can pop in to speak with staff about starting to drive. It plans to enter another German city, which it hasn\u2019t identified, by the end of the year and several more in 2019.Even after returning to D\u00fcsseldorf, Uber has faced an obstacle: taxi drivers. While the company has tried to work with taxi operators, dozens protested outside Uber\u2019s office last month, blasting their horns and snarling traffic.Dennis Klusmeier, head of the city\u2019s largest taxi dispatch company, Taxi D\u00fcsseldorf, said Uber drivers didn\u2019t comply with the law that requires private-hire drivers to return to a garage between rides. Holding a large law book that outlined German transportation rules, Mr. Klusmeier said he was exploring a legal challenge.\u201cUs Germans like a law book,\u201d he joked.Ufuk Demirel, an Uber driver in D\u00fcsseldorf who has completed more than 300 rides over the past month, said a taxi driver had recently swerved to cut him off. The D\u00fcsseldorf police said six incidents between taxi and Uber drivers had been reported, including one in which an Uber driver was forced to stop by taxi drivers, then verbally abused and harassed.Beyond tensions with taxi drivers, Uber has to deal with customer awareness. About 100 Uber cars are on the road in D\u00fcsseldorf, and waits for a ride can be long. Ask people in the city whether they have ever used the app and you still get mostly shrugs.\u201cIt\u2019s not so popular,\u201d said Dennis Zimney, who works at a downtown hotel. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know Uber.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Instead, the agency\u2019s staff has fought in court to reduce the amount of relief granted to some students and to halt a rule change intended to speed other claims along.\u201cI can\u2019t afford to go back to school,\u201d Ms. Bauer, 27, said. \u201cWill I ever be able to buy a house? Or get married? I spent so much time working on a useless degree, and it could ruin me financially for the rest of my life.\u201dAs of mid-2018, her department had approved only 16,000 claims, and Education Department officials confirmed that about 15,000 of those were granted partial forgiveness. Tens of thousands more still await a decision.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the regulations to stop the secretary from slow-walking the processing of claims,\u201d said Clare McCann, a senior policy adviser at the department during the Obama administration. \u201cI\u2019m positive there will be more litigation from borrowers who have been sitting in the backlog.\u201dThe department\u2019s attempts to reduce the amount of forgiven debt and block a new forgiveness rule have drawn rebukes from federal judges.But even after that court victory, critics of the Education Department are skeptical that there will be much progress.Evaluating those claims \u201cis incredibly complex and takes time,\u201d Ms. Hill said.So far, the program has forgiven nearly $535 million in debt, meaning the government absorbs the loss. That\u2019s one reason Ms. DeVos has said the program should be overhauled.\u201cStudents who have been defrauded and suffered harm should absolutely be made whole,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cThe department also has a duty to safeguard taxpayer dollars. It would be irresponsible to give 100 percent relief to every claimant without first assessing their claim and understanding whether or not harm was suffered.\u201dThe Education Department is the biggest lender to Americans who borrow for college, with more than $1 trillion going to 33 million students. In the fine print of its promissory notes, the agency spells out its terms: Borrowers must repay what they owe even if they drop out, are unhappy with their education or can\u2019t find a job in the field they trained for.But there\u2019s one escape clause. If borrowers were significantly misled by their school, they can ask the government to forgive their loans. Just as a bank appraises a house before it issues a mortgage, the Education Department is supposed to ensure that the programs it effectively funds are legitimate.\u201cYou\u2019d have to be made of stone not to feel for these students,\u201d Arne Duncan, then the education secretary, said in June 2015. \u201cWe will make this process as easy as possible for them.\u201dThe complex work of evaluating the Corinthian claims has taken time. By January 2017, the department had approved nearly 32,000.But when Mr. Obama\u2019s administration ended, about 41,000 complaints still awaited review. The Education Department had granted relief for borrowers who met specific criteria at two other schools, ITT Educational Services and American Career Institute, but it had not delved into thousands of claims involving other institutions.After Mr. Trump took office, the existing claims sat untouched for nearly a year as tens of thousands of new ones arrived, according to agency documents.Joseph White is among the ITT students who say they were cheated. He filed a claim with the Education Department three years ago and has heard little since.Mr. White, 41, of St. Louis, graduated in 2008 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in software engineering. But when he landed a position as a web developer, he quickly discovered that he lacked the skills to do his job.Instead of teaching students to program computers, Mr. White said, instructors had handed out sheets of code and simply had the students retype them. At one final exam, the instructor stood at the front of the classroom and read the answer key aloud, he said.\u201cMy degree,\u201d he said, \u201cwas a sham.\u201dTo finance that degree, Mr. White took out loans totaling more than $80,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Extraordinary Statement, Trump Stands With Saudis Despite Khashoggi Killing", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump defied the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies and a growing body of evidence on Tuesday to declare his unswerving loyalty to Saudi Arabia, asserting that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s culpability for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi might never be known.\u201cWe may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cIn any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\u201dIn 633 words, punctuated by eight exclamation points and written in an impolitic style that sounded like Mr. Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff observations, the statement was a stark distillation of the Trump worldview: remorselessly transactional, heedless of the facts, determined to put America\u2019s interests first, and founded on a theory of moral equivalence.They also drew outrage from members of Congress and human rights activists, for whom the grisly killing has become a test of America\u2019s willingness to overlook the crimes of a strategically valuable ally. Even Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill expressed revulsion.\u201cThe behavior of the crown prince \u2014 in multiple ways \u2014 has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said in a statement.On Tuesday, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee, and the ranking Democrat, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, sent Mr. Trump a letter demanding that the administration determine whether Prince Mohammed was responsible for the death of Mr. Khashoggi.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said he expected Congress to take some kind of action but declined to be more specific. \u201cThere are not only Democrats but Republicans upset,\u201d he said in an interview.Far from criticizing Prince Mohammed or other Saudi leaders, the president came close to embracing the narrative of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s critics in the kingdom: that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d bent on undermining the House of Saud.\u201cMy decision is in no way based on that,\u201d Mr. Trump insisted. \u201cThis is an unacceptable and horrible crime. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.\u201dPunishing Saudi Arabia, Mr. Trump said, would put at risk $110 billion in military sales to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and other military contractors, as well as $340 billion in other investments, which the Saudis have agreed to make since he became president.Economists and military analysts said those numbers were so exaggerated as to be fanciful.\u201cThe world is a very dangerous place!\u201d Mr. Trump began his statement, before seguing into a critique of Iran\u2019s malign behavior in the Middle East. He blamed it for killing Americans, sponsoring terrorist organizations and conducting a \u201cbloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen.\u201dAs if to illustrate his point, the Treasury Department on Tuesday morning announced sanctions against nine targets in what officials said was an Iranian-Russian plot to sell oil to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and use the proceeds to finance Iranian-backed militant groups, like Hamas and Hezbollah.Mr. Trump left open the possibility that Prince Mohammed was aware of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing \u2014 in effect conceding that the prince could have lied to him in multiple phone conversations.In exchanges with aides, Mr. Trump has rolled his eyes when asked whether he believes the prince could not have been aware of the complex operation to kill Mr. Khashoggi. It involved multiple teams of operatives \u2014 some of whom had close ties to the prince \u2014 flying to Istanbul on private jets and turning a diplomatic compound into a slaughterhouse.Yet none of that outweighs what Mr. Trump views as the benefits of an alliance with the Saudis that dates back to Franklin D. Roosevelt.The president denied he was motivated by personal gain. \u201cI don\u2019t make deals with Saudi Arabia,\u201d he told reporters as he left the White House for Palm Beach, Fla., where he is spending Thanksgiving. \u201cI don\u2019t have money from Saudi Arabia.\u201d\u201cI mean, it\u2019s bad, bad stuff,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis one has caught the imagination of the world, unfortunately.\u201dA week later, after the Saudi explanation of the killing shifted yet again, he accused the Saudis of the \u201cworst cover-up ever\u201d and promised that the United States would find out what happened to Mr. Khashoggi, a resident of Virginia.But then the Turkish government shared an audio recording with the United States and other Western countries, which intelligence officials said pointed to a more direct role by Prince Mohammed. Mr. Trump gave up any pretense that he would follow the facts wherever they led.He said he would not listen to the recording because \u201cit\u2019s a suffering tape, it\u2019s a terrible tape.\u201d And he played down the likelihood that a report prepared by his own administration would establish definitively whether Prince Mohammed was responsible for the crime.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the investigation had clarified many details about the crime. But he made clear that the trail ended with 17 Saudis that the administration imposed sanctions against last week \u2014 a list that included some close aides to Prince Mohammed, but not the prince himself.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would continue to assess new information in the case. \u201cFacts will, obviously, still continue to come to light,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s the way the world works.\u201dBut he made clear that Mr. Trump would weigh any further action against the nation\u2019s interests, which the president has said lie with the Saudis, not with Mr. Khashoggi.\u201cAn innocent man, brutally slain, deserves better, as does the cause of truth and justice and human rights,\u201d The Post\u2019s publisher, Fred Ryan, said in a statement.Even before he took office, Mr. Trump singled out Prince Mohammed as his preferred partner in the Middle East. His son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, began cultivating the 33-year-old prince, who was then jockeying to be the designated heir to King Salman.Mr. Kushner saw Prince Mohammed as critical to advancing a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians that has been a major focus of his time in the White House. Mr. Trump\u2019s hawkish aides, encouraged by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, saw the prince as critical in marshaling a coalition to isolate Iran.Iran reacted scornfully to Mr. Trump\u2019s statement. Its foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, alluded to the president\u2019s unfounded assertion that California could have avoided its calamitous wildfires if he had adopted Finland\u2019s practice of clearing debris from the forest floor.\u201cMr. Trump bizarrely devotes the FIRST paragraph of his shameful statement on Saudi atrocities to accuse IRAN of every sort of malfeasance he can think of,\u201d Mr. Zarif said in a tweet. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re also responsible for the California fires, because we didn\u2019t help rake the forests \u2014 just like the Finns do?\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s economic argument for the Saudi alliance is suspect on several grounds. He argued, for example, that if the United States canceled its military contracts, they would be quickly filled by Russia or China.\u201cIt would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!\u201d he said.But military analysts said the Saudi military was so deeply reliant on American equipment \u2014 F-15 fighter jets, armed with air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles \u2014 that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for it to switch to an alternative supplier. That is even truer right now, in the midst of its air campaign in Yemen.Of the $110 billion in weapons sales claimed by Mr. Trump, defense analysts have calculated only $14.5 billion in booked sales, and the real number might actually be lower than that. The Saudis have not concluded a single major new arms deal since Mr. Trump took office.The president also contended that Saudi Arabia was critical to keeping a lid on oil prices.\u201cIf you want to see oil prices go to $150 a barrel,\u201d he told reporters, \u201call you have to do is break up our relationship with Saudi Arabia.\u201dThe Saudis did agree to boost production to offset the loss of oil from Iran after Mr. Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran\u2019s energy industry this month. But now, after the United States eased the pressure on the market by granting waivers to several countries that import Iranian oil, Saudi Arabia is again considering cutting production.Perhaps the biggest consequence of Mr. Trump\u2019s statement is that it complicates the efforts of his own advisers to hasten an end to the war in Yemen.In recent weeks, Mr. Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have called on all parties for a swift end to the fighting, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians and caused a ruinous famine. But Mr. Trump placed the onus entirely on Iran, saying that \u201cSaudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave.\u201dBruce O. Riedel, a longtime expert on Saudi Arabia now at the Brookings Institution, said, \u201cThe adult advisers in the room \u2014 Pompeo and Mattis \u2014 tried to steer this debate so it would move away from Istanbul and toward Yemen.\u201d\u201cBut the president is not really on board. He\u2019s all-in on M.B.S.\u201d he said, referring to Mohammed bin Salman by his initials.\u201cIt\u2019s going to undermine the nascent effort to get a settlement in Yemen,\u201d Mr. Riedel said.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Carl Hulse and Catie Edmondson from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Thwarted Chaos on Election Day. It\u2019s Hardly Clear That Will Last.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftAfter an Election Day largely free of viral social media misinformation, and with little trace of the kind of Russian troll stampede that hit its platform in 2016, executives at Facebook may be tempted to take a victory lap.That would be a mistake.It\u2019s true that Facebook and other social media companies have made strides toward cleaning up their services in the last two years. The relative calm we saw on social media on Tuesday is evidence that, at least for one day, in one country, the forces of chaos on these platforms can be contained.But more than anything, this year\u2019s midterm election cycle has exposed just how fragile Facebook remains.Want a disaster-free Election Day in the social media age? You can have one, but it turns out that it takes constant vigilance from law enforcement agencies, academic researchers and digital security experts for months on end.I\u2019ve experienced Facebook\u2019s fragility firsthand. Every day for the past several months, as I\u2019ve covered the midterms through the lens of social media, I\u2019ve started my day by looking for viral misinformation on the platform. (I\u2019ve paid attention to Twitter, YouTube and other social networks, too, but Facebook is the 800-pound gorilla of internet garbage, so it got most of my focus.)A Facebook spokesman, Tom Reynolds, said that the company had improved since 2016, but there was \u201cstill more work to do.\u201d\u201cOver the last two years, we\u2019ve worked hard to prevent misuse of Facebook during elections,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said. \u201cOur teams worked round the clock during the midterms to reduce the spread of misinformation, thwart efforts to discourage people from voting and deal with issues of hate on our services.\u201dWhen the news on Facebook was not blatantly false, it was often divisive and hyperpartisan \u2014 exactly the kind of thing Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, has said he wants to combat by using Facebook to \u201cbring the world closer together.\u201d Nearly every day, the stories that got the most engagement across the network came from highly partisan sources \u2014 mostly conservative outlets like Fox News, Breitbart and The Daily Caller, with a handful of liberal pages like Occupy Democrats and The Other 98% thrown in \u2014 that skewed heavily toward outrage and resentment.Facebook has framed its struggle as an \u201carms race\u201d between itself and the bad actors trying to exploit its services. But that mischaracterizes the nature of the problem. This is not two sovereign countries locked in battle, or an intelligence agency trying to stop a nefarious foreign plot. This is a rich and successful corporation that built a giant machine to convert attention into advertising revenue, made billions of dollars by letting that machine run with limited oversight, and is now frantically trying to clean up the mess that has resulted.As the votes were being tallied on Tuesday, I talked to experts who have paid close attention to Facebook\u2019s troubles over the past several years. Most agreed that Election Day itself had been a success, but the company still had plenty to worry about.\u201cI give them better marks for being on the case,\u201d said Michael Posner, a professor of ethics and finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cBut it\u2019s yet to be seen how effective it\u2019s going to be. There\u2019s an awful lot of disinformation still out there.\u201d\u201cFor blatantly false news, they\u2019re not even close to getting ahead of it,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cThey\u2019re barely keeping up.\u201dJennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who studies social media, said that Facebook\u2019s pattern of relying on outside researchers and journalists to dig up misinformation and abuse was worrying.\u201cIt\u2019s a bad sign that the war rooms, especially Facebook\u2019s war room, didn\u2019t have this information first,\u201d Professor Grygiel said.In some ways, Facebook has it easy in the United States. Its executives and engineers are primarily English-speaking Americans, as are many of the content moderators doing the work of policing the platform. The country also has a strong independent press, law enforcement agencies and other stable institutions that are capable of filling in some gaps. And Facebook is highly incentivized to behave well in the United States and Europe, where its most important regulators (and the bulk of its advertisers) are.It is hard to imagine Facebook extending the same kind of effort to prevent misinformation and interference in Madagascar, Armenia or El Salvador, all of which have upcoming elections. And if you think Facebook will spin up a 24/7 \u201cwar room\u201d to help stop meddling in Nigeria\u2019s February elections, I have a bridge in Lagos to sell you.It\u2019s worth asking, over the long term, why a single American company is in the position of protecting free and fair elections all over the world. But that is the case now, and we now know that Facebook\u2019s action or inaction can spell the difference between elections going smoothly and democracies straining under a siege of misinformation and propaganda.But Facebook would not have done this on its own. It took sustained pressure from lawmakers, regulators, researchers, journalists, employees, investors and users to force the company to pay more attention to misinformation and threats of election interference.Facebook has shown, time and again, that it behaves responsibly only when placed under a well-lit microscope. So as our collective attention fades from the midterms, it seems certain that outsiders will need to continue to hold the company accountable, and push it to do more to safeguard its users \u2014 in every country, during every election season \u2014 from a flood of lies and manipulation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: A Balanchine Festival, With Masterpieces in Safe Hands", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA sense of momentousness charged the air on Wednesday night when New York City Ballet performed \u201cSymphony in C.\u201d That 1947 masterpiece by George Balanchine is a staple of the company\u2019s repertory, so the big deal wasn\u2019t the performance so much as where it was happening: not at the company\u2019s decades-old Lincoln Center home, but at New York City Center.The occasion was the first program of \u201cBalanchine: The City Center Years,\u201d a major festival, running through Sunday, that the theater has organized as part of a season celebrating its own 75th anniversary as an institution. The historical echoes were large.\u201cSymphony in C\u201d came last, a foolproof finale. It doesn\u2019t just provoke applause, though. It inspires conversion. When Jerome Robbins attended the first performance of City Ballet, at New York City Center in 1948, he was already an in-demand choreographer, in ballet and on Broadway. But \u201cSymphony in C\u201d moved him to put that at risk and offer his services and devotion to the fledging troupe.It\u2019s had a similar effect on many others. It was on a program that inspired Morton Baum, the businessman who was chairman of City Center\u2019s finance committee in 1948, to offer Balanchine a home, leading to the creation of City Ballet.It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of that offer in the history of ballet and of the arts in America. It gave Balanchine, the Russian choreographer who had been brought to America by Lincoln Kirstein in 1933, the security of an official (if not yet well-funded) institution. In 1964, the company would move to a larger theater created for it at Lincoln Center.Yet the City Center years were crucial, not just for the astonishing variety and power of the works Balanchine choreographed, but also for the consolidation and expansion of his American style of classicism and the preservation of what he had accomplished before 1948.To commemorate all this, City Center wanted to throw a big, fancy party of a festival, and to make the party big and fancy it has concentrated on the guest list. Eight companies are participating, an attention-getting representation of the world\u2019s greatest ones, including the Paris Opera Ballet, the Mariinsky from Russia and the Royal Ballet from England. Four companies perform on each of the festival\u2019s six programs, presenting a total of 13 works.That\u2019s a logistical achievement. But scheduling must have determined a lot of the programming, and which pieces to present. Those choices raise questions: What do the guests bring to the party? And is that more important than thematic considerations? Does the starry celebration get in the way of showing what was important about Balanchine\u2019s years at City Center? Opening night provided some clues.The evening began with \u201cSerenade,\u201d the first work that Balanchine choreographed in America, in 1934. A beloved, enduring dance, ingenious in construction, elusive in its hints of story, it establishes so much of the promise of what he would do here. And performing it, Miami City Ballet proved that it belongs in the festival. An offshoot of City Ballet, the Miami company understands what Balanchine discovered and taught: how exactitude needn\u2019t sacrifice warmth; how even in Romanticism, rhythmic accuracy allows momentum to build.As the company in which Balanchine was raised, the Mariinsky arguably belongs in the festival too. \u201cTschaikovsky Pas de Deux,\u201d a 1960 supercharging of Russian tradition, is a show-off vehicle, and Kimin Kim, a Korean star with a modest manner, made the audience gasp with softly powered jumps that hung in the air. His partner, Viktoria Tereshkina, was lovely, correct and coy in a slightly haughty Russian manner, but I couldn\u2019t help but miss the exciting sense of risk that City Ballet dancers bring to this piece.Comparisons of style would seem to be a benefit of the multiple-company approach, but only \u201cTschaikovsky Pas de Deux\u201d will be performed (on Thursday) by members of another troupe, Anna Rose O\u2019Sullivan and Marcelino Samb\u00e9 of the Royal Ballet. On Wednesday, they danced \u201cTarantella,\u201d another workout duet, but in ballet-Neopolitan style, with tambourines. Since it\u2019s the final piece that Balanchine choreographed at City Center, there\u2019s some justification for its inclusion, but the cute, too careful performance of Ms. O\u2019Sullivan and Mr. Samb\u00e9 had me thinking about more works that didn\u2019t make the cut \u2014 ballets harder to stage but more important.\u201cSymphony in C\u201d stirs no such doubts. And City Ballet, dancing it, demonstrated what it means to have Balanchine style in your bones. Tiler Peck, leading the first movement, showed what pouncing on top of the rhythm is all about, and Sara Mearns, gliding through the second, revealed how much tragic emotion can be conveyed through musical dancing.That\u2019s especially apparent at City Center, where the audience is much closer to the dancers than at Lincoln Center. It\u2019s easier to see faces, prompting thoughts about how important they are or aren\u2019t. When the whole huge cast fills the stage at the unbeatable end of \u201cSymphony in C,\u201d they really fill it at City Center, giving a different perspective on how Balanchine\u2019s choreography can activate space.Seeing City Ballet dance \u201cSymphony in C\u201d at City Center does give something you can\u2019t quite get at Lincoln Center. But the main emotional impact is the same as ever, shaded with gratitude. Balanchine made the dance for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1947. It might have inspired France to offer him a home. Instead City Center did. And we got Balanchine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s HQ2 Will Benefit From New York City. But What Does New York Get?", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe innovation myth used to involve the back of a suburban garage or an office park in Silicon Valley. The tech industry was incubated not on the mean streets of the big city, but in sleepy hamlets like Murray Hill, N.J., and Mountain View, Calif.So with Amazon splitting HQ2, its second headquarters, between Crystal City, a part of Arlington, Va., and Long Island City, in Queens, what are we to make of tech\u2019s steady migration to marquee cities?Amazon is hardly alone, after all. Google and Facebook already have headquarters here (established, not incidentally, without state subsidies). Google intends to double its work force in the city to nearly 20,000. Twitter\u2019s second-largest office is in Manhattan. Its largest is in downtown San Francisco.On one level, this all seems inevitable. A handful of the wealthiest American cities today have a magnetic attraction. Today\u2019s biggest tech platforms seek them out to recruit top talent and gain access, at scale, to housing, schools and transit. The process means the rich get richer, the biggest companies, bigger. And the gulf widens between the country\u2019s haves and have-nots.On another level, the tech industry isn\u2019t culturally urban. Its insularity, secrecy, its bedrock libertarianism and algorithmic notions about progress, land use and corporate independence have never easily meshed with the slow, open-society, regulatory-heavy, greater-good mission that defines city living. Disruption is a virtue and instrument of efficiency in tech circles. But it isn\u2019t necessarily welcome where protections and a focus on collective welfare remain abiding democratic ideals.That said, New York City is not Seattle or San Francisco. Here, tech is one sector in a megalopolis, sharing the limelight with finance, media, fashion, advertising and art. It\u2019s absorbed into the immensity.And Mr. Dorsey wasn\u2019t alone. In Seattle, Amazon raised a ruckus when officials proposed a tax on large employers to help pay for services to the homeless. The company threatened to halt construction on a new high-rise.So the city dropped the plan.This is certainly not how New Yorkers like to operate.Silly as it sounds, where bosses live turns out to be as good a predictor as any of where tech companies will settle.For years, suburbia has offered these companies acres of disposable, cheap, anonymous office parks: mostly one- or two-story concrete structures surrounded by loads of surface parking. These sites minimized costs, maximized security and allowed companies to scale up, contract or split into different units quickly \u2014 at the same time they promoted sprawl and traffic jams and transformed once-quaint bedroom communities south of San Francisco into phenomenally expensive places to live.Not that young tech workers, more and more of them immigrants, wanted to live in suburbia, anyway. Increasingly they demanded the diversity and benefits of city life. And so did successful innovation companies, following the lead of workers.Another way to put it is that companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon became attracted to cities like New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington because these cities had already made transformative public investments in assets like culture, parks, universities and transit.The question for city residents is what these companies give back. I\u2019m not saying companies move, or should be expected to move, for any reason other than to make money. Amazon promises tens of thousands of new jobs in New York, with all sorts of ripple effects beyond employing more coders, sales executives, baristas, nannies and yoga instructors. In one fell swoop, it bids to make good on 20 years of the whole post-Manhattan, cool-outer-borough narrative.But that isn\u2019t the only balance sheet. \u201cUrban life is built around a social compact,\u201d said Vishaan Chakrabarti, a Columbia professor and founder of the architecture firm PAU. Economic value creation in superstar cities like New York fuels a feedback loop that companies and cities both want to lean into.What does this mean? For starters, it means that the city and state now have even more reason to funnel money into subways, buses and a new tunnel under the Hudson River, and to pony up for the stalled BQX streetcar project linking Brooklyn and Queens, all of which would serve Amazon.In turn, Amazon, which dominates the book market, could, up front, make self-interested commitments in local school programs and, as Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University, advocates, in public libraries, our most vibrant, multipurpose community hubs.As for housing, the city\u2019s regulatory and zoning policies are more responsible for driving up costs than tech companies. But, in an ideal world, Amazon would reverse what it did in Seattle and commit resources to affordable housing in areas where its workers are moving; and it would pitch in for homeless services, which, by extension, would improve the daily lives of Amazon employees.Mr. Chakrabarti has a modest proposal, as well: The company could extend a hand toward Long Island City neighbors like LaGuardia Community College and Queensbridge, the largest public housing development in North America.There\u2019s no reason to presume Amazon will do any of this, of course.New York\u2019s abundance of resources, talent and ideas derives from its exceptional diversity and social infrastructure \u2014 urban virtues. Amazon could profit from its enhancement of New York as much as New York could profit from Amazon\u2019s presence.

{"Headline": "California Ballot Initiatives Are Powerful. The Powerful Have Noticed. ", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth and stealth have often subverted the goals of measures that have impacted nearly every facet of life in the state.Ms. Pawel, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of \u201cThe Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation.\u201d For years, California state legislators had killed attempts to tax sugary beverages, beholden to an industry that donated millions to political campaigns. The success of the San Francisco soda tax, along with similar ballot measures in three other Bay Area cities, energized a national movement and spurred new drives to tax soda in municipalities around California.Then the soda industry fought back \u2014 using Hiram Johnson\u2019s favorite weapon.The high-stakes trade was the latest escalation in California\u2019s initiative-industrial complex, in which wealth and stealth often subvert the goals of Hiram Johnson\u2019s reforms. With enough money, almost anything can get on the California ballot. Over the last century, particularly the last four decades, initiatives have shaped nearly every facet of life in California. Ballot propositions, which can be amended only by another popular vote, have determined how property taxes are levied, the fate of bilingual education and even the size of chickens\u2019 cages (and thus the price of eggs).Today, those tools are expertly wielded by the moneyed interests whose power they were designed to counteract.Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Baxter, and the political-consultant industry they spawned, fueled a rapid growth in initiatives by the 1970s. Paid signature gatherers driven by financial incentive rather than moral conviction replaced volunteers who had once circulated petitions for their causes. The initiative \u201cis very rapidly becoming a tool of the special interests,\u201d Jerry Brown, then the secretary of state, testified at a 1972 state hearing where signature gatherers detailed a range of deceptive practices.The last initiative that got on the ballot through the effort of volunteers was a 1990 measure to protect mountain lions. Since then, petition gatherers wielding multiple clipboards have become ubiquitous at shopping malls, outside retail stores and at farmers\u2019 markets. They are paid per signature, rates that fluctuate as high as $6 per name, depending on how many initiatives are in circulation, how soon the petitions must be turned in and how difficult the sell. Signature gatherers who handle multiple initiatives have an incentive to push the ones that pay the most. The bidding wars and campaign high jinks can be fierce. They have included attempts to sabotage petitions by flooding them with false or duplicate names.Such campaigns are costly, in part because there are no limits on contributions. This November, in addition to the gas tax, voters will decide measures that affect issues including rent control, bonds for water projects and homeless housing, the size of cages for farm animals and the future of daylight saving time. As of the end of October, the amount raised to pass or defeat the 11 propositions was almost $368 million, about five times the amount raised by this year's two gubernatorial candidates.Figures in millions, as of Saturday.TOTALSPENT INSUPPORTSPENT INOPPOSITIONCalifornia Proposition 8Limits on dialysis clinics' revenue$130$19$111California Proposition 10Local rent control$1002575Nevada Question 3Changes to energy market$973364Arizona Proposition 127Renewable energy standards$552431California Proposition 6Future gas and vehicle taxes50545Florida Amendment 3Casino gambling48462Washington Initiative 1631Carbon emissions fee471631Florida Amendment 6Marsy's law crime victims rights37370Colorado Proposition 112New oil, gas and fracking projects33232Massachusetts Question 1Nurse-patient assignment limits301119TOTALSPENT IN SUPPORTSPENT IN OPPOSITIONCalifornia Proposition 8$130$19$111Limits on dialysis clinics' revenueCalifornia Proposition 10$1002575Local rent controlNevada Question 3$973364Changes to energy marketArizona Proposition 127$552431Renewable energy standardsCalifornia Proposition 6$50545Future gas and vehicle taxesFlorida Amendment 3$48462Casino gamblingWashington Initiative 1631$471631Carbon emissions feeFlorida Amendment 6$37370Marsy's law crime victims rightsColorado Proposition 112$33232New oil, gas and fracking projectsMassachusetts Question 1$301119Nurse-patient assignment limitsBy The New York Times | Source: Ballotpedia; Colorado Proposition 112 figures do not add up to the total because of rounding.Notable ballot initiatives up for a vote in states on Nov. 6.NONPARTISAN REDISTRICTINGMICH.UTAHCOLO.MO.Colorado has two proposals: Creating independent commissions to design districts for its congressional delegation and the State Legislature.VOTER REQUIREMENTS, BALLOT ACCESSExpand accessRestrict accessMICH.MONT.N.D.NEV.MD.N.C.ARK.LA.FLA.Arkansas and North Carolina initiatives would require voter IDs.

{"Headline": "Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Last Battle", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "FeatureAs she prepares to lead the House of Representatives again, the most powerful Democrat in Washington will have to navigate between a rampaging president and her colleagues\u2019 plans for fighting back.Supported by[In a sign of the strength of a new generation, House Democrats chose Hakeem Jeffries for their No. 5 leadership post over Barbara Lee, a hero to the left.]\u201cIn terms of subpoena power, you have to handle it with care,\u201d Pelosi continued. \u201cYes, on the left there is a Pound of Flesh Club, and they just want to do to them what they did to us.\u201d She shook her head emphatically. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are,\u201d she said. \u201cGo get somebody else if that\u2019s who you want.\u201dPelosi is nothing if not purposeful. The following day, rallying with Democratic candidates in a San Francisco park, she would wear an orange pantsuit, explaining to crowds that orange was \u201cthe color of gun-violence protection.\u201d This afternoon she had booked a table at Delancey Street, a restaurant that was famous, she said, for employing ex-convicts: \u201cRedemption,\u201d she added emphatically, in case I might have missed the point.Pelosi told me that she and the House Democrats had every intention of working with President Trump on things like lowering prescription-drug costs, rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure and protecting the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. She reminded me of her long stints on the House Appropriations and Intelligence Committees \u2014 panels on which, \u201cleft to our own devices, we could always find our way in a bipartisan manner.\u201dThis was the question with which Democrats were wrestling, on the eve of their reconquest of the House and Pelosi\u2019s expected return to House speaker, the job she held once before, from 2007 to 2011: Was Pelosi where they were? Was this genius of orderly politics equipped for the daily earthquakes brought on by Trump\u2019s fulminations?Pelosi shrugged wearily. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a contrast between decency and dignity and openness and bipartisanship and oneness, and whatever he decides to wake up to be that day.\u201d But, she went on, what lay ahead was not a contest of manners, nor even of parties. In Pelosi\u2019s view, Trump seemed bent on threatening the institutions of democracy, beginning with his attacks on the free press. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to destroy the collective consciousness of our country.\u201dWhen I half-jokingly protested that in fact Trump loved the press, Pelosi quickly replied: \u201cMay I say something you\u2019re not going to like? I think the press loves him. All day on TV \u2014 and I don\u2019t even watch TV, except sports. But he says somebody had a horse face \u2014 all day we hear about that. We hear about Kanye West, all day. You just give him all day! So I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m making an analogy\u201d \u2014 the descendant of Italian immigrants then laughed, unable to resist \u2014 \u201cbut Mussolini, he didn\u2019t care what they said about him, as long as they were talking about him.\u201dHer torrid October schedule, spanning more than two dozen cities, involved meeting with candidates whose victories on Nov. 6 were mostly all but assured, while taking care to avoid hotly contested races where the presence of one of the least popular and most reliably demonized figures in American politics might cost a Democrat votes. Pelosi had spent the previous day in Arizona, rallying volunteers and donors on behalf of Ann Kirkpatrick \u2014 a candidate who, then seven points ahead of her Republican opponent in internal polls, didn\u2019t really need Pelosi\u2019s help. But Kirkpatrick had publicly stated that she would vote for Pelosi as speaker, and Pelosi was offering a display of gratitude. And no doubt when the time came for Kirkpatrick to ask for a plum committee assignment \u2014 the Appropriations Committee happened to be her first choice \u2014 the speaker would be only too happy to demonstrate what loyalty got you with Nancy Pelosi.\u201cShe is, in my view, the best speaker I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said David Obey, the cantankerous former Democratic congressman from Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, who served under eight different speakers, including Pelosi, over the course of his 42-year congressional career. \u201cShe understands her caucus, and she doesn\u2019t run it like a San Francisco liberal. She runs it by trying to find its center of gravity. She works harder than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen, and I think she has more determination to stand for something than anybody I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201dWhen I asked Obey whether such skills were of any use in negotiating with a president like Trump, he acknowledged with a grunt, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s damn near an impossible task for anybody to work with him. But to the extent that it\u2019s possible, she\u2019s the one who would have the best chance. If Trump plays that game of agreeing to something and then backing off, she has the talent to unify her caucus so that they have a unified message to take to the American people \u2014 because in cases like that, only the American people can set matters straight.\u201dPelosi is something of a paradox in the world of politics. A Gallup poll five months ago found her favorability rating to be at a dismal 29 percent, and yet \u2014 unlike other unpopular political figures such as Trump and Hillary Clinton \u2014 her 31 years in public life have been free of scandal. She has been excoriated from the right as the quintessence of California limousine liberalism. But she is also a practicing Catholic whose first career was as a stay-at-home mother of five children, with little in common with \u2014 and at times little patience for \u2014 the new generation of activists in her party, to whom she sometimes refers as \u201cthe lefties.\u201d Pelosi \u2014 who with her husband, the investor Paul Pelosi, owns a large house in San Francisco\u2019s upper-crust Presidio Heights as well as a Napa Valley vineyard \u2014 is indeed rich. But 29 members of Congress, 18 of them Republicans, are richer.What sets her apart from other legislators of her stature is her gender. Pelosi has been known to say: \u201cNo one gives you power. You have to take it from them.\u201d The leitmotif of her three-decade ascent is that of a woman wresting power away from a male-dominated political machine, until one day the machine discovered she was its master.Pelosi arrived in San Francisco in 1969 at age 29 with an advanced degree in back-room Democratic politics. Her father, Tom D\u2019Alesandro, was a Baltimore congressman and mayor on intimate terms with the leading Democrats of his day; President Franklin Roosevelt fondly addressed him as Tommy. Pelosi moved doggedly up the California Democratic ranks: first as a fund-raiser; then as the chairwoman of the Northern California party; then, in 1982, as the first party chairwoman of a large state; then the host committee chairwoman of the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco; and a year after that, as the finance director of the national Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.Still, when Pelosi, at 46, first ran for Congress in a 1987 special election, she was derided by the campaign of her Democratic primary opponent Harry Britt as a pampered and unserious \u201cparty girl.\u201d And as one of only 26 women in a body of 435 members, Pelosi soon learned that, as her first chief of staff, Judy Lemons, told me: \u201cSexual harassment and sexual overreaching were absolutely institutionalized. It was part of the deal.\u201dPelosi took the system as it was. It was never her way to complain about being called a \u201cgutsy broad\u201d by jowly old bulls like Dan Rostenkowski, a Democratic congressman from Chicago, and stared at like a filet mignon. She established herself as a formidable fund-raiser and made still more friends upon landing a seat in 1993 on the Appropriations Committee \u2014 which, before Congress curtailed the practice, controlled the process of distributing the lucrative earmarks that members sought for their districts, constituents and benefactors.In 2001, Pelosi ran for minority whip. The move, like Pelosi\u2019s determination more generally, was informed by the not-unfounded belief that if she didn\u2019t lead the Democrats, someone else was apt to bungle the job. \u201cWhat she really saw was a leadership that was marking time,\u201d George Miller, Pelosi\u2019s colleague in the California delegation and an ally in the whip campaign, told me. \u201cAnd one thing she doesn\u2019t do is mark time.\u201dPelosi\u2019s two main opponents, the courtly Marylander Steny Hoyer and the celebrated civil rights leader John Lewis of Georgia, proved no match for her shrewd deployment of campaign donations to woo members into her camp. Years later, John Spratt, a South Carolina congressman who voted against her at the time, sheepishly told me, \u201cI couldn\u2019t quite see her as whip, because you need to be kind of tough to be whip, and I estimated her differently. I just didn\u2019t put two and two together.\u201dBy contrast, during Nancy Pelosi\u2019s four years as speaker, there was no confusion as to who was in control. Pelosi used the tools at her disposal \u2014 committee assignments, campaign donations \u2014 to establish a balance among her party\u2019s coalitions while also reminding everyone that her job was not simply to officiate and appease. As one of Pelosi\u2019s former senior staff members, describing Pelosi\u2019s outlook, told me: \u201cWhat do you call a person who\u2019s 99 percent loyal? Disloyal. She has a long memory.\u201d Crossing Pelosi, it was understood, came at a cost.As evidence, Democratic members had only to look at that lion of the House, Michigan\u2019s John Dingell, who did not vote for Pelosi as whip in 2001 \u2014 after which Pelosi backed a Democratic challenger to Dingell\u2019s seat in 2002 and later offered backstage support to her California colleague Henry Waxman when he challenged and defeated Dingell for chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in 2008. In 2006, Pelosi supported her close ally John Murtha of Pennsylvania in his doomed and divisive quest to wrest the majority-leader post away from Steny Hoyer, her chief opponent in the 2001 whip race. Jane Harman, another California representative and a respected foreign-policy specialist, was denied the House Intelligence Committee chairmanship in 2007 owing to some mysterious falling out with Pelosi.But as Newt Gingrich learned the hard way two decades ago, an autocratic speaker is a short-lived one. Pelosi\u2019s reign was successful because she understood the will of her caucus rather than bending it to hers. \u201cThere are two sets of negotiating skills you need as speaker,\u201d said Chris Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat who served as one of Pelosi\u2019s most trusted lieutenants in the House from 2003 until he departed for the Senate in 2017. \u201cThere are the skills you use to bring the caucus together, and then the skills you use when you\u2019re dealing with the other party. Your ability on the latter depends on the former. If you turn around and your troops aren\u2019t with you, you\u2019ve obviously lost your bargaining strength. So one of the things that\u2019s really set Nancy Pelosi apart is her uncanny ability to unite all the different Democratic coalitions around a negotiating position. And whether it was Bush or Boehner or Ryan, they never doubted that she had the votes to back up her position.\u201dUnifying Pelosi\u2019s caucus has meant more than just bridging the predictable racial, geographical and ideological divisions among the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the Progressive Caucus and the moderate Blue Dog Coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in politics: If you don\u2019t know your jewels, know your jeweler,\u201d David Obey told me. \u201cShe understands what each individual member needs.\u201d George Miller said: \u201cWhen we had the tough votes to take, there were times when she\u2019d say, \u2018Just give me the names and then leave me alone.\u2019\u2009\u201dAmong the toughest of tough votes, Miller said, was the Affordable Care Act. As the sweeping health care reform bill took shape in early 2009, Pelosi confronted a landscape peopled with intransigent House Republicans, reluctant Blue Dogs, liberals demanding nothing less than a single-payer system, skittish White House advisers and Senate Democrats willing to waste months in quixotic pursuit of bipartisan cover.Pelosi \u2014 who in her first floor speech in 1987 vowed to fight AIDS and who in 2002 was the most high-profile Democrat to vote against invading Iraq \u2014 fell back on the credibility she had with progressives to persuade them that the \u201cpublic option\u201d hybrid of single-payer and privately managed health care plans was now dead on arrival in the Senate. Then she persuaded Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan, an anti-abortion Democrat, to drop his demand that the health care bill prohibit federal funds being used on abortion. When a host of other backstage deals with Blue Dogs \u2014 like reckoning with disparities among states in Medicare reimbursements \u2014 failed, Pelosi managed the fallout. Obamacare passed in the House by three votes.\u201cI\u2019d remind people: We would not have health care today were it not for Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Obey said. \u201cThere were all kinds of people, both in our caucus and in the White House, who were willing to settle for one-tenth of a loaf. And she said, \u2018To hell with that. We were sent here to do more.\u2019\u2009\u201dPelosi\u2019s speaking style is less tangential than cubist, full of unexpected angles. At times, she seems to be carrying on three or four different conversations at once. Her prodigious memory can prove burdensome \u2014 everything seems to remind her of something else \u2014 and she often seeks to legitimize her assertions with quotations from Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., the Constitution or some other unassailable authority. She often quotes herself too, or party slogans commissioned by her and given a focus group\u2019s seal of approval: Six for \u201906 (in 2006), Reigniting the American Dream (2011), Ladders of Opportunity (2012), A Better Deal (2017), For the People (2018).Still, Pelosi\u2019s foremost liability is the effectiveness of the attacks against her. In 2010, Republicans spent $65 million attacking Pelosi in ads; the Republican National Committee hung a banner from its headquarters that read FIRE PELOSI. The attacks have often borne more than a tinge of sexism; in 2012, when Pelosi, as minority leader, wielded less power than the Senate\u2019s Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, Republicans\u2019 negative television ads were seven times as likely to mention Pelosi as Reid, according to the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising. The 2010 onslaught took its toll on Pelosi\u2019s public standing \u2014 her favorable rating dropped into the 20s \u2014 but otherwise did not faze her. She made clear to her caucus members that they should do whatever it took to win, even if it meant publicly distancing themselves from her. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone in the world with thicker skin, or anyone about whom more callous things have been said, and she just truly doesn\u2019t care,\u201d a former Pelosi staff member told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a small constituency she cares about: her members.\u201dThat November, when the G.O.P. seized 63 House seats and Democrats briefly considered whether new leadership was in order, Republicans cheekily replaced the banner on the R.N.C. building with one that read HIRE PELOSI. For the next eight years as minority leader, though, Pelosi did some of her best work. She managed to keep her caucus unified, while John Boehner\u2019s remained unruly. Some of the Tea Party freshmen who came to power in 2010 railing against the \u201cPelosi liberals\u201d would, when I interviewed them several years later, confide to me that they wished their Republican leaders possessed Pelosi\u2019s spine. Among Pelosi\u2019s proudest feats, she told me, was keeping enough Democrats together to routinely vote against the G.O.P.\u2019s incessant efforts to legislatively chip away at Obamacare. Even if such bills passed the House and the Senate, President Obama could veto them, and Pelosi\u2019s magic number of 146 dissenting Democrats (just over one-third of the House\u2019s overall membership) would be enough to sustain the president\u2019s veto.During budget fights, House conservatives watched in astonished fury as Pelosi obtained one concession after the next \u2014 like increased spending for community health centers and freezing the number of deportation officers \u2014 even after Trump became president. It helped that the minority leader knew, far better than the Republicans, where the votes were. But her negotiating prowess was also a result of understanding legislative substance better than her counterparts did. \u201cYou have to have knowledge of the details,\u201d she told me, casually adding, \u201cThat\u2019s how I was able to beat them on everything.\u201dThe growing unease born of being in the minority was not confined to these members, however. \u201cShe faces more division in her caucus than she ever had before,\u201d the former Pelosi aide told me. After the disastrous 2010 midterms, Heath Shuler, a Blue Dog moderate from North Carolina, decided to run against her for minority leader. Following the devastation of the 2016 election, another centrist, Tim Ryan of Ohio, challenged her as well. Neither Shuler nor Ryan made much pretense of being a Pelosi-caliber legislative tactician. Their candidacies were more based on what they were not: not from San Francisco, not liberal. They were also not skilled vote-counters. Shuler managed to collect just 43 of the Democratic caucus\u2019s 193 votes; six years later, Ryan took 63, to Pelosi\u2019s 134.Many doubted this claim, including former staff members with whom I spoke. Her closest political confidant, George Miller, told me that Pelosi had never made such an indication to him. Further, the minority leader\u2019s recent assertion that it was important for her to stay so that the American public would have \u201ca woman at the table\u201d struck some in her caucus as disingenuous, given that Pelosi\u2019s perceived favorites to succeed her throughout the years \u2014 Chris Van Hollen, Steve Israel of New York, Xavier Becerra and most recently Joe Crowley, who was beaten in a primary upset in New York this year by the Democratic Socialist first-time candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 were all men.But, Pelosi knew, nothing would mollify her caucus like victory. In paving a road back to the majority, she returned to the playbook that worked for her last time. \u201cThe first thing we had to do in 2005 was take the president\u2019s numbers down,\u201d Pelosi told me, referring to Bush\u2019s approval rating. \u201cBush was 57 percent in early 2005.\u201d The moment Bush introduced the idea of partly privatizing Social Security, Pelosi\u2019s Democrats pounced and began attacking the scheme as an assault on senior citizens. \u201cHis numbers came down to 38 in the fall,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand that\u2019s when the retirements started to happen\u201d \u2014 nervous Republican congressmen who decided to vacate their seats.Because Trump began his presidency as a polarizing force even within his own party, Pelosi said, the Democrats were best served by standing back while one fainthearted Republican House member after the next, facing variously a Trump-adoring base or a Trump-inspired anti-Republican backlash, announced their retirements \u2014 39 House and Senate members in all. The new Democratic candidates by and large stuck to the disciplined campaign message prescribed by Pelosi\u2019s rebranding efforts: protecting health care, advocating better jobs and wages through infrastructure improvements, restoring integrity to government. By the fall of 2018, some pundits criticized the Democratic field for not pounding away on Trump. Pelosi\u2019s view, she recalled, was: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what Hillary did, not what we\u2019re doing.\u201dThis year\u2019s Democratic candidate for Nye\u2019s old seat was Elaine Luria, a 43-year-old former Navy commander. An entrepreneur who previously voted Republican, she was well suited to a district populated by conservative-minded veterans, and she carried no personal baggage. In her campaign, Luria emphasized her military service and her commitment to pocketbook issues, while criticizing the G.O.P. incumbent, Scott Taylor, for his vote against Obamacare. She also outraised him in individual contributions.Though Luria had never met Pelosi, she did accept a $17,000 donation from Pelosi\u2019s PAC. A growing number of this year\u2019s Democratic candidates in Republican-leaning districts felt obliged to say publicly that if elected they would support a change in leadership; Luria would not say whether she would vote for Pelosi as speaker. The National Republican Congressional Committee attack ads echoed a familiar theme: \u201cLiberal Nancy Pelosi is pulling Luria\u2019s strings.\u201d \u201cYour vote determines if she becomes speaker again. ... Pelosi says amnesty to illegal immigrants and gun controls. It\u2019s what you get if Elaine Luria gets elected.\u201d Luria had jumped to the lead in August, but a poll in mid-October had her down by seven points.On Election Day, the district was swamped with unusually heavy turnout. About a half-hour before midnight, Taylor called Luria and conceded defeat. Late that night, the congresswoman-elect received another call. It was from Nancy Pelosi. \u201cSo glad to have you join us,\u201d she said.Though Pelosi did not volunteer this to me, the infusion of women into the Democratic caucus carried considerable political significance to her. She lent financial support to many of them during the campaign and had every intention of tying her fate to theirs, as a close Pelosi associate told me shortly before the election: \u201cIf you look at these women who are poised to win, the second generation of Year of the Woman, do you really think they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Let\u2019s not have a woman as speaker?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe day after the election, however, news leaked of a conference call among Pelosi\u2019s detractors in the caucus. The nine or so dissidents \u2014 led by Kathleen Rice of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado \u2014 had begun reaching out to about a dozen successful Democratic candidates to see if they were now willing to make good on their publicly expressed skepticism about Pelosi as leader. Perlmutter, who backed Tim Ryan over Pelosi in 2016, told me, \u201cFor me \u2014 and I\u2019m even more emphatic about it than I was two years ago \u2014 this is about change. You look in the middle of the country, at the districts we picked up \u2014 a lot of the candidates said they wouldn\u2019t support her, or avoided the question. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent demonizing her, and it\u2019s permeated the public\u2019s view of her. That\u2019s not her fault. But what she hasn\u2019t done is have a succession plan. And that\u2019s an element of being a leader.\u201dA new speaker would need to win a total of 218 votes on the House floor. Assuming that the Democrats take 232 seats after the final ballot-counting, and assuming as well that no Republican votes in her favor, Pelosi could afford to lose 14 votes but no more. Perlmutter insists that Pelosi is beneath the 218 threshold \u2014 but the rebels have yet to find anyone in their caucus willing to present themselves as an alternative. Their best hope seems to be to play a game of chicken with the Democratic leader, threatening to withhold votes unless she agrees to certain concessions, like a clearly defined time limit to her tenure as speaker.Pelosi told me a few days before the election that she wouldn\u2019t find it necessary to stay on if a Democrat became president in 2020. \u201cI could walk away from that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d be in good hands.\u201d But she also mentioned that there were things she would like to accomplish that would probably be impossible under Trump, like addressing climate change. As always, Pelosi was preserving her options, assessing her leverage, committing to nothing until she had to.Trump had called to congratulate her on election night, while she and other party leaders were gathered in a ballroom at the Hyatt near the Capitol. She could barely hear him over the cheering, but he said something about a willingness to work on infrastructure. Of course, Pelosi told me, Trump said the same thing to her on the phone just after he was elected. \u201cWe just have to hope,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always have to try.\u201dAt least Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t declare the election illegal,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe had a plan for that\u201d \u2014 though really, she acknowledged, the only workable plan was \u201cto win big. Had it been four or five seats, he would\u2019ve tried to dismantle it.\u201d In his news conference the day after the midterms, Trump spoke respectfully of Pelosi: \u201cI give her a great deal of credit for what she\u2019s done and what she\u2019s accomplished. Hopefully, we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs.\u201dBut Trump also warned darkly that if the House Democrats hounded his administration with investigations, he would urge the Republican-controlled Senate to investigate Pelosi\u2019s caucus \u2014 and, he said, \u201cI think I\u2019m better at that game than they are, actually.\u201d Then, as if to test their resolve, Trump rounded off the day by demanding the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and replacing him with Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, who had been publicly critical of the Mueller investigation into possible Russian involvement in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.In the Trump era, Pelosi told me, it was obvious that the Democrats could not afford to let the president dominate every news cycle. \u201cI do see the role as less work horse and more show horse now,\u201d she said. But she insisted that she would gladly cede the public advocacy to her caucus\u2019s more able communicators, like Adam Schiff, who would most likely be replacing Trump\u2019s ally Devin Nunes as the new House Intelligence Committee chairman. \u201cOh, I prefer it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Adam, compared to Nunes \u2014 what a joke!\u201dIn addition to the daily combat with the White House, the probable speaker had a new caucus to tend to. Members of the Progressive Caucus were claiming that the Democrats had their energy to thank for the election results. \u201cThe majority came from other districts,\u201d Pelosi noted wryly, but \u201ceverybody\u2019s in a leveraging mood right now.\u201d Five days after Pelosi said this, Ocasio-Cortez joined activists staging a sit-in outside the minority leader\u2019s office for congressional action on climate change.Meanwhile, requests for committee assignments were already pouring in, requiring the usual calibrations on her part: who needed a national-security-related credential, which caucuses and state delegations needed more representation where, who had been loyal to Pelosi, who had not. And which newer members should she lift into the ranks of leadership? Despite her debt to the dozens of new women, Pelosi did not appear to see it as her obligation to nurture them in any particular way. \u201cIt\u2019s not a choice of whether I\u2019d hand it to them on a silver platter or not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s, do members want somebody anointed? I don\u2019t think they do. The person has to emerge. People have to emerge. And it\u2019s hard.\u201dBut, she believed, a new leader would materialize. \u201cWe always say when the new ones come: \u2018Here are the freshman recruits. Who among them will be the leaders in this Congress? Or rise in other offices? Or be president of the United States? Let\u2019s see the opportunity.\u2019\u2009\u201dFor a moment I mistook her words as sentimental \u2014 hope springing eternal, opening day, the circle of life or some such. But no. This was Machiavellian. Power had to be seized from someone else.I suggested that there were sometimes surprises you couldn\u2019t predict. The barest trace of a smile crossed Pelosi\u2019s lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody could have predicted it in me,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happened to Lindsey Graham? He\u2019s Become a Conservative \u2018Rock Star\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHESTERFIELD, Mo. \u2014 Senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s bipartisan overtures \u2014 on immigration, foreign policy, even investigations of President Trump \u2014 once made him a darling of Democrats, a Republican dealmaker to be wooed to the center.But when the South Carolina Republican turned up in this St. Louis suburb to campaign against a Democratic colleague, Claire McCaskill, the crowd of Trump-loving women and red-hatted men practically swooned, bathing in the reflected glow of the president they adore \u2014 who now adores Lindsey Graham.Mr. Graham, crisscrossing the country to turn out the Republican vote against the centrist Democratic senators who were once his natural allies, lapped it up. He has been basking in the exaltation of Trump backers ever since his lacerating defense of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. His own transformation from Trump-basher to Trump defender seems complete.\u201cI stepped up,\u201d he boasted in an interview, \u201cand I\u2019m getting rewarded for it by conservatives, and liberals are all upset.\u201dMr. Graham\u2019s latest show of fealty came earlier this week, when he embraced the president\u2019s legally dubious plan to end birthright citizenship for babies born to noncitizens \u2014 a head-spinning turn for a senator who once partnered with Democrats on comprehensive immigration legislation that included a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. (Mr. Graham says he proposed ending birthright citizenship years ago.)Theories abound about what has happened to Mr. Graham.No. 1: He is most comfortable as a sidekick and is looking to the president to fill the void left by the loss of his dear friend and mentor, Senator John McCain. Mr. Graham bristled at the suggestion.\u201cI was nobody\u2019s sidekick on Kavanaugh,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the voice of millions of Americans who thought, enough is enough.\u201dNo. 2: He is auditioning to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is widely expected to lose his job after the elections. Not so, said Mr. Graham: \u201cI will take bets. Ten to one odds. You put $20 on the table, I\u2019ll pay you $200 if I\u2019m Trump\u2019s attorney general.\u201dNo. 3: He is tacking right ahead of his 2020 re-election run in a state where the biggest threat would likely come in a Republican primary \u2014 and where he cannot win without the backing of Mr. Trump.\u201cThere\u2019s a funny meme going around,\u201d Pressley Stutts, a Tea Party leader in Greenville, S.C., noted. \u201cIt says, \u2018President Trump, he\u2019s even made Lindsey Graham great again.\u2019\u201dHis allies say the senator does not want a repeat of his brutal primary election in 2014, when the Tea Party set its sights on him, and he was forced to fend off six challengers.\u201cI saw a fatigue in him at the end of that experience that I had never seen before,\u201d said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, a close friend.Mr. Graham, 63, said he is the same old Lindsey, working with Mr. Trump when he can and disagreeing when he must. But, he added of the president, \u201cbeing in his orbit, I think, has been good for me and good for him.\u201dMr. Graham\u2019s personal story is well known: He grew up in the back of a bar owned by his parents, who died when he was in his 20s, leaving him to care for his 13-year-old sister. In the Senate, where he has served since 2003, he teamed up with Mr. McCain, partly because of their shared interest in military affairs (Mr. Graham is a retired colonel in the Air Force reserve) and they traveled the world together. He wept on the Senate floor when the older man died.\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing he ever had to a father,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said.He has long been known as a kind of happy-go-lucky independent thinker. He voted to confirm two of President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, which was one reason he was so angry at the Democrats\u2019 opposition to Justice Kavanaugh. He also likes being in the middle of things. Whenever there is a Senate \u201cgang\u201d \u2014 a self-appointed caucus of problem-solvers \u2014 Mr. Graham seems to be in it.\u201cI like being relevant,\u201d he said.He has also done an especially artful job of befriending the president, often through flattery \u2014 \u201cI try to start most conversations with a compliment\u201d \u2014 which has won him Mr. Trump\u2019s ear and the rarefied status of presidential golf partner. He views himself as uniquely positioned to guide a president inexperienced on matters of policy.\u201cI enjoy his company,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent more time talking to him than any president \u2014 all of them combined.\u201dMr. Trump then invited Mr. Graham for lunch and sought the senator\u2019s counsel on North Korea and Iran. The Russian investigation wrapped up quietly.But the d\u00e9tente was complicated; Mr. McCain hated Mr. Trump. Mr. Graham, with the help of Mr. Kushner, tried to engineer a rapprochement, persuading the president to host Mr. McCain and his wife, Cindy, at the White House for dinner.The good will didn\u2019t last; Mr. McCain would ultimately bar Mr. Trump from attending his funeral.In the interview, he credited himself with saving (in Mr. Sessions\u2019 case, temporarily) the jobs of both men.\u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand is that I have done my part,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cMueller\u2019s going to do his job. Sessions is going to be orderly transitioned out.\u201dHe said as well that he wants to become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee after the election, if the current chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, grabs the gavel of the Finance Committee. Should that happen, he said, he would initiate an oversight investigation into whether the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. were \u201cin the tank\u201d for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, joining similar efforts in the House.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.But perhaps nothing has cemented Mr. Graham\u2019s standing in Mr. Trump\u2019s world as much as his performance at the divisive Supreme Court confirmation hearing for the future Justice Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford.\u201cWow! Remind me not to make you mad,\u201d the president told Mr. Graham on a private call, the senator said.Mr. Graham became \u201ca national figure for conservatives overnight,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, which is why he was in Missouri on Monday, rallying Republican voters for Josh Hawley, the state attorney general who is trying to unseat Senator McCaskill, with whom he has served for nearly 12 years.It was the seventh stop on a 13-state swing that also took Mr. Graham to Indiana to campaign against another fellow senator, Senator Joe Donnelly, on Thursday.\u201cHe\u2019s a rock star right now,\u201d said Todd Graves, chairman of the Missouri Republican Party. \u201cAside from the president or vice president he\u2019s probably the strongest draw that we could get.\u201dHere in Chesterfield, Mr. Graham warmed up the crowd with self-deprecating jokes about his flop on the 2016 presidential campaign trail \u2014 \u201cIf I had got 99 percent more votes I could have beat him!\u201d he said of Mr. Trump \u2014 and their newfound friendship.Then he hammered Ms. McCaskill: \u201cClaire, quite frankly, on the big stuff is on the wrong team.\u201dAnd: \u201cClaire\u2019s goal is to talk one way and vote another. She clearly did not understand that Trump won this state by 19 points.\u201dAnd: \u201cWhen Obama needed her, Claire was always there. When Trump needs her? AWOL.\u201dWhen he finished, Mr. Graham was mobbed by well-wishers, including a throng of squealing women, who beckoned him to pose with them for selfies. More than a dozen of them gathered around the senator, who looked up at the camera, beaming, as he soaked up his moment in the sun.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a Supreme Court justice. She is Elena Kagan, not Elana Kagan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Special: China Means Business", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Sunday morning, and welcome to a special edition of the DealBook Briefing. Today, we\u2019re taking a look at how China wrote its own playbook to beat the West at its own game of economic growth.The Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, and how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation.China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Not so long ago, three-quarters of its population endured extreme poverty: Now it\u2019s less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished nation has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.In matters of commerce and national security, China is competing with the United States, even in traditional American spheres of influence. From a Chinese perspective, this reordering is merely an overdue reversion to historical reality as Beijing demands consideration commensurate with its stature.China\u2019s challenge to the Western-dominated order is amplified now that order\u2019s primary architect, the United States, is now led by an avowed nationalist.Now, China is using its funds to make foreign investments, particularly in overseas infrastructure, with different terms from those offered by other nations:China is using its power and money to build a vast global network of investments and infrastructure that will reshape global finance and geopolitics.China has financed infrastructure projects in at least 112 countries. Many of those initiatives have focused on neighbors \u2014 Pakistan in particular \u2014 to strengthen geopolitical relationships. Others, in volatile countries like Nigeria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, involve risks that many other nations try to avoid.Some of those countries could become important allies.But its approach has been unconventional:It borrowed some Western ideas while rejecting others. It opened itself to the world when necessary, and put on the brakes when it chose to. It set goals and backed them with government money. It freed its people to make and spend money, but it forbade them to ask for a better deal. Entrepreneurs built modern China, and the Communist Party kept them in line.A prime example is the country\u2019s membership of the World Trade Organization:Now, amid an escalating trade war, tensions are ratcheting up:\u2022 Others, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and the director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, have tried to put the brakes on Mr. Trump\u2019s most belligerent trade moves.How likely is it that trade war turns into real war?\u2022 Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who worked in the Defense Department to reshape relations with former Soviet nations after the end of the Cold War, argues that a rising power like China is likely to come to blows with an established one like the United States.\u2022 But some China experts note that other areas of dispute, like Taiwan, have not become more fraught in recent years. And whatever the issue, they argue, a disastrous miscalculation is more likely without persistent engagement.Thanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Saudis Want a U.S. Nuclear Deal. Can They Be Trusted Not to Build a Bomb?", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 33-year-old heir to the Saudi throne had been overseeing a negotiation with the Energy Department and the State Department to get the United States to sell designs for nuclear power plants to the kingdom. The deal was worth upward of $80 billion, depending on how many plants Saudi Arabia decided to build.But there is a hitch: Saudi Arabia insists on producing its own nuclear fuel, even though it could buy it more cheaply abroad, according to American and Saudi officials familiar with the negotiations. That raised concerns in Washington that the Saudis could divert their fuel into a covert weapons project \u2014 exactly what the United States and its allies feared Iran was doing before it reached the 2015 nuclear accord, which President Trump has since abandoned.Prince Mohammed set off alarms when he declared earlier this year, in the midst of the negotiation, that if Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s fiercest rival, \u201cdeveloped a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.\u201d His negotiators stirred more worries by telling the Trump administration that Saudi Arabia would refuse to sign an agreement that would allow United Nations inspectors to look anywhere in the country for signs that the Saudis might be working on a bomb, American officials said.Asked in Congress last March about his secret negotiations with the Saudis, Energy Secretary Rick Perry dodged a question about whether the Trump administration would insist that the kingdom be banned from producing nuclear fuel.Privately, administration officials argue that if the United States does not sell the nuclear equipment to Saudi Arabia someone else will \u2014 maybe Russia, China or South Korea.They stress that assuring that the Saudis use a reactor designed by Westinghouse, the only American competitor for the deal, fits with Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that jobs, oil and the strategic relationship between Riyadh and Washington are all far more important than the death of a Saudi dissident who was living, and writing newspaper columns, in the United States.Under the rules that govern nuclear accords of this kind, Congress would have the opportunity to reject any agreement with Saudi Arabia, though the House and Senate would each need a veto-proof majority to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s plans.\u201cIt is one thing to sell them planes, but another to sell them nukes, or the capacity to build them,\u2019\u2019 said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Following Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, Mr. Sherman has led the charge to change the law and make it harder for the Trump administration to reach a nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia. He described it as one of the most effective ways to punish Prince Mohammed.Nuclear experts said Prince Mohammed should have been disqualified from receiving nuclear help as soon as he raised the prospect of acquiring atomic weapons to counter Iran.\u201cWe have never before contemplated, let alone concluded, a nuclear cooperation agreement with a country that was threatening to leave the nonproliferation treaty, even provisionally,\u201d said William Tobey, a senior official in the Energy Department during the Bush administration who has testified about the risks of the agreement with Saudi Arabia.He was referring to the crown prince\u2019s threat to match any Iranian nuclear weapon \u2014 a step that would require the Saudis to either publicly abandon their commitments under the nonproliferation treaty or secretly race for the bomb.The Trump administration declined to provide an update on the negotiations, which were intense enough that Mr. Perry went to Riyadh in late 2017. Within the last several months, a senior State Department official engaged in further discussions over the deal in Europe.The Saudi energy ministry said in a statement: \u201cThe Saudi government has repeatedly confirmed that every component of the Saudi atomic energy program is strictly for civil and peaceful uses. The Saudi government has decided to move with this project not only to diversify energy sources but also to contribute to our economy. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly called for a Middle East free from all forms of nuclear weapons.\u201dSaudi Arabia has long displayed interest in acquiring, or helping allies acquire, the building blocks of a program that could make nuclear weapons and protect the kingdom from potential threats from its neighbors \u2014 first Israel, then Iraq and Iran.The Saudi government provided the financing for Pakistan to secretly build its own nuclear arms, the first \u201cSunni bomb,\u201d as the Pakistani creators of the program called it. That financial link has long left American intelligence officials wondering if there was a quid pro quo: that if Saudi Arabia ever needed its own small arsenal, Pakistan could provide it \u2014 perhaps by moving Pakistani troops to Saudi territory.That insistence is what set off the Iranian nuclear crisis. Over the years, several nations have demonstrated that it is possible to turn ostensibly civilian programs into sources of bomb fuel, and thus atomic warheads and military power. Israel recently released an archive of material, stolen from Tehran in January, to prove that the Iranian government deceived the world for years.The Saudis, meanwhile, had no equivalent facilities. They promised to get them.\u201cWhatever the Iranians build, we will also build,\u201d Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former Saudi intelligence chief, warned as the Obama administration sought to negotiate what became the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran.Under that pact, Iran is currently spinning a small number of nuclear centrifuges, though it had to ship 97 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country. The Saudis believe they need to be positioned to match Iran\u2019s every move, though experts say it would take a while. \u201cNo one thinks the Saudis would be able to do this anytime soon,\u201d said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t plausibly build a weapon without outside help.\u201dThe core challenge for the Trump administration is that it has declared that Iran can never be trusted with any weapons-making technology. Now, it must decide whether to draw the same line for the Saudis.The United States\u2019 own actions may be helping to drive the Saudis\u2019 nuclear thinking. Now that the Iran agreement, brokered with world powers, is on the edge of collapse after Mr. Trump withdrew the United States, analysts are worried that the Saudis may be positioning themselves to create their own nuclear program in response.Saudi leaders saw a political opening when Mr. Trump was elected.In late 2017, Mr. Perry, the energy secretary, picked up the nuclear cooperation issue. Excluding Russia, he began negotiating with Riyadh over the terms. Whether the Saudis would be banned from fuel production quickly became a flash point in Congress.The Saudi delegation was led by the energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, who resisted the proposal.The crown prince made headlines in March by shifting the public discussion over Riyadh\u2019s intentions from reactors to atomic bombs. In a CBS News interview, he said that if Iran acquired nuclear arms, Saudi Arabia would quickly follow suit.A few days later, Mr. Falih, the energy minister, raised concerns about the outcome of negotiations with Washington by insisting publicly that Riyadh would make its own atomic fuel.\u201cIt will be natural,\u201d he said, \u201cfor the United States to be with us and to provide us not only with technology, but to help us with the fuel cycle and the monitoring, and make sure we do it to the highest standard.\u201dBut Mr. Falih emphasized that the kingdom had its own uranium deposits and wanted to develop them rather than relying on an overseas supplier.\u201cIt\u2019s not natural,\u201d he said, \u201cfor us to bring enriched uranium from a foreign country.\u201dMark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, and David Kirkpatrick from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Money and Muscle Pave China\u2019s Way to Global Power", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "They didn\u2019t like the West\u2019s playbook. So they wrote their own.Beijing is leveraging its commercial and military might to redraw the terms of trade, diplomacy and security, challenging the liberal democratic order.Under a merciless sun, a dozen Chinese construction workers survey an empty expanse of desert, preparing to transform it into the heart of a new Egyptian capital.The workers are employed by China\u2019s largest construction conglomerate through a $3 billion contract from an Egyptian company, with financing from Chinese banks. They are erecting a thicket of 21 skyscrapers, one as tall as the Empire State Building.The presence of Chinese labor and largess on the sands of Egypt is a testament to China\u2019s global aspirations. After centuries of weakness and isolation, China is reclaiming what its leaders regard as its natural destiny \u2014 supremacy in Asia, and respect around the planet. Through the ventures in Egypt and elsewhere, China is exploiting its formidable economic clout to expand its geopolitical influence, directing investment to woo governments that control vital assets.A traditional ally of the United States, Egypt controls the Suez Canal, a vital shipping passage where a threat to access could impede China\u2019s movement around the globe. In constructing a central piece of the futuristic capital, China is ingratiating itself with the canal\u2019s ultimate gatekeeper, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while rendering his grandest visions dependent on friendly relations with Beijing.How China became a superpowerChina\u2019s reach for commercial expansion along with diplomatic influence guides an array of Chinese undertakings, from rail networks and highways taking shape across Africa and Latin America to ports and power stations being constructed in Eastern Europe and South Asia. In Southeast Asia, Chinese entrepreneurs are engineering a crop of web companies just as China projects growing military power in the South China Sea.Little more than a decade ago, China\u2019s forays beyond its borders were mainly about bringing home energy, minerals and other resources, often from countries forsaken by the West as pariah states like Iran, Sudan and Myanmar. In foreign policy, China pursued a sole obsession \u2014 peeling off diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory. Even as China skirmished with neighbors over contested islands, it accepted the dominance of the United States Navy.Those days are over.Under the muscular leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has cast off previous restraints, rejecting deference to an American-dominated global order as an impediment to national revival. In matters of commerce and national security, China is competing with the United States, even in traditional American spheres of influence.From a Chinese perspective, this reordering is merely an overdue reversion to historical reality as Beijing demands consideration commensurate with its stature.In the telling of the ruling Communist Party, China\u2019s modern history is the story of Chinese mastery degraded by colonial depravity. China is the land that invented the compass, gunpowder, paper and printing, amassing stupendous wealth while Europe was still backward. Then came centuries of humiliation \u2014 Britain\u2019s profiting from forcing opium on the populace, Japanese brutality, demeaning lectures about human rights from hypocritical Americans. Now, China is intent on securing its own fate.\u201cChina wants to be a great power in the world,\u201d says Paul Heer, a former chief national intelligence officer in East Asia for the United States, who now teaches at George Washington University. \u201cThey think the rest of the world owes them recognition, and a return to what the Chinese see as their rightful place.\u201dNowhere are China\u2019s designs clearer than in Asia. China has overtaken the United States as the leading trading partner with Asian nations while pushing back against American naval primacy in the South China Sea. China is disrupting American alliances in the region, from Japan to Singapore to Australia.Beyond its backyard, China\u2019s ambitions are boundless. It celebrates its Belt and Road Initiative, a vast collection of infrastructure projects around the world, as the means of recreating the Silk Road, the trails navigated in ancient times by merchants carrying goods between Asia and Europe.\u201cXi Jinping is leading a China that has influences in all corners of the globe,\u201d says Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cThe 2008 financial crisis in the West was the turning point for China. Beijing started to embrace a triumphal mind-set, and pursued global leadership with new confidence on the back of the West\u2019s perceived flaws.\u201dChina\u2019s assertive role in world affairs is grounded in its domestic needs. It is at once spreading into new markets, generating fresh demand for its factory wares just as growth slows at home. It is projecting military strength and influence when the legitimacy of the Communist Party rests on bolstering economic fortunes and international esteem.Among its neighbors, China\u2019s rise provokes fears that an unwanted piece of history is being resurrected \u2014 the old tribute system that cemented China\u2019s status as the Middle Kingdom. For centuries, other nations bowed in recognition of China\u2019s imperial might, bestowing gifts on the emperor and accepting vassal status to secure trade and peace.For the Western powers whose order has prevailed since the end of World War II, China poses a foundational challenge. The United States and its victorious allies erected institutions that were \u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014 designed to keep the peace by promoting trade and fair competition. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have dispensed aid with conditions, though frequently drawing accusations that they have failed to comply with their standards on protecting human rights and the rule of law.China\u2019s investments come with no such strictures. China bankrolls autocrats who control geopolitically valuable real estate. China demands only that its companies gain a piece of the action while recipients eschew criticizing Beijing.China\u2019s challenge to the Western-dominated order is amplified by the reality that its primary architect, the United States, is now led by an avowed nationalist. As President Trump wages a trade war and derides international cooperation, he has generated doubts about the perseverance of the liberal democratic philosophy the United States has long championed.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the United States gives China this golden opportunity to portray itself as the defender of the international order,\u201d says Jessica Chen Weiss, a China expert at Cornell University.If the new Silk Road is in part about moving goods from Chinese factories to customers in the rest of the world, the trail seems certain to pass through Central and Eastern Europe.This reality frames the proceedings of the \u201c16-plus-1\u201d group, an economic bloc that China has forged with 16 Central and Eastern European nations. Its latest summit meeting convenes on a drizzly day in July in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Officials from the 16 governments \u2014 among them the newest, least-affluent members of the European Union \u2014 pose for photos with the delegation from China, the one nation wealthy and ambitious enough to finance their visions.Leaders in the rest of the European Union construe the group as a stealth assault on the rules and cohesion of their bloc. In offering financing for infrastructure projects, China has positioned itself as an alternative to European Union development funds.Europe\u2019s money comes with rules protecting labor and the environment, while requiring that projects be awarded to companies on the basis of competitive bidding to ensure fair competition. China tends to distribute its funds with far simpler demands: Chinese companies must gain work, free of competition, while Beijing secures an international ally.European Union officials are especially worried that Chinese money could weaken the pressure Europe is applying on members that have been breaching democratic norms. Europe has threatened to withhold development funds from Poland and Hungary as punishment for their turns toward authoritarianism. Both have packed courts with government-friendly judges and menaced the press.\u201cIt\u2019s a mutually beneficial cooperation based on mutual trust without any kind of attempts to interfere into domestic issues,\u201d Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, says in an interview before the summit meeting in Sofia.\u201cWe are talking about different conversations, concrete conversations related to infrastructure, and other conversations related to the level of democracy and human rights in China,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev of Bulgaria says in an interview the day before the event. \u201cIt would not be polite and constructive if we try to merge them into one.\u201dThe summit meeting convenes in a hulking convention center that harks back to era of Soviet domination. At a news conference, the Chinese and Bulgarian prime ministers offer assurances that the 16-plus-1 bloc does not aim to divide Europe.Mr. Li seeks to allay European worries that China poses a challenge to its rules. He promises that Chinese-financed projects will be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding.\u201cThere needs to be open and transparent tendering,\u201d the Chinese premier declares.But the Serbian prime minister, Ana Brnabic, has just undercut that assertion. Asked moments earlier about the high-speed rail from Belgrade to Budapest, she says Chinese companies have been promised construction work.\u201cChina is a strategic partner,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not putting out tenders.\u201dAs a currency crisis ravaged Indonesia two decades ago, angry mobs tore through West Jakarta, killing hundreds of ethnically Chinese merchants. Yet Cheng Tao, a Chinese software engineer turned venture capitalist, can look down from his high-rise office on the same neighborhood and see a tranquil center of Chinese life \u2014 grocery shops, restaurants and his own son\u2019s school.Mr. Cheng, 34, is part of an influx of young Chinese financiers, engineers and web designers who rent space in an area full of technology companies. He first came to Indonesia a decade ago with the Chinese telecom company Huawei. He and other veterans of large Chinese conglomerates are increasingly unleashing their own start-ups.\u201cTen years ago, there were no mainland Chinese here,\u201d Mr. Cheng says as he sips tea imported from China. \u201cWe see opportunities here that no longer exist in China.\u201dThe thriving Chinese start-up scene in a neighborhood once devastated by anti-Chinese terrorism illustrates China\u2019s deepening engagement in Southeast Asia. Only a few years ago, Chinese companies in the region were mainly focused on purchasing natural resources. Today, China is investing for the future, seeding innovative industries with money and brainpower.Last year, Chinese investors participated in funding rounds for Indonesian start-ups that accounted for 95 percent of the value of those companies, according to a survey by Google and A. T. Kearney, a global management company.\u201cChina is Indonesia\u2019s Silicon Valley,\u201d says Adrian Li, a venture capitalist who has a Stanford M.B.A. and moved to Jakarta from Beijing in 2014.China\u2019s place in Southeast Asia has proceeded deliberately, and just as the United States has ceded ground.While heads of state forge ties amid pageantry, Chinese businesses have been quietly yet persistently making inroads in Indonesia, guided by bottom-line concerns. At home, Chinese web companies are running out of new customers. Indonesia, a land of 260 million people, is adding more internet users than anywhere else on Earth.Jack Ma, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, was early to appreciate this reality, pouring major investments into local shopping start-ups, including $1.1 billion last year into Tokopedia, a thriving online marketplace. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this spring, the Tokopedia site drew 78 million people, a 70 percent increase from the previous month.Such potential fortifies Mr. Ma\u2019s determination to stay ahead of his biggest global competitor \u2014 Amazon. The American e-commerce company operates in Singapore but has yet to significantly penetrate Southeast Asia.Alibaba has put more than $3 billion into a former regional competitor, Lazada. Its Alipay digital payment system operates across Southeast Asia. Mr. Ma sits on advisory boards in the region that will help set standards and shape consumer perceptions, expanding China\u2019s traditional reach.Beyond money and clicks, China projects its power through a more traditional display of strength \u2014 military might.Alex Pama has watched it unfold from uncomfortable proximity. In the 1990s, when he was a junior officer in the Philippine Navy, he saw Chinese boats landing on Mischief Reef, a glorified collection of rocks claimed by the Philippines in the South China Sea. Chinese crews erected shelters to mark the territory, then began pouring concrete for larger buildings.The Philippines sought help from its former colonial overseer, the United States. But the Clinton administration demurred. The American Navy was still smarting over losing access to Subic Bay, its longtime base in the Philippines.That decision was a historic turning point, says Mr. Pama, who would rise to become admiral of the Philippine Navy. From then on, the United States shrank from the region, relinquishing the seas to China.\u201cThat\u2019s when the appeasement started,\u201d Mr. Pama says.Two decades later, President Xi ordered the buildup of Mischief Reef and other outcroppings in the Spratly archipelago into islands bristling with reconnaissance gear, aircraft hangars, runways, deepwater harbors and, most recently, short-range missiles. Those bases and China\u2019s maritime buildup have given Beijing effective control over one of the most heavily trafficked waterways on the planet.\u201cThe U.S. should have been more assertive back then and now,\u201d says Mr. Pama, now retired.Dominating the South China Sea and unseating the United States have become central objectives in Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to return China to glory. Last year, China for the first time staged aircraft carrier drills using advanced fighter jets in the South China Sea.China has presented these moves as defensive. But the United States and its Asian allies warn that Beijing has positioned itself to hold global trade hostage while diminishing the American presence. China\u2019s emergence as the region\u2019s dominant commercial power combined with its moves toward maritime supremacy has heightened the sense that a changing of the guard is underway.\u201cOver the long term, China\u2019s power and influence will undoubtedly weaken and ultimately abolish U.S. dominance in the region,\u201d says Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, who advises the government.The perspective gained momentum during the 2012 standoff at Scarborough Shoal, a horseshoe-shaped chain of reefs that is much closer to the Philippines than to China.As the Philippine Navy challenged Chinese fishing boats, the Obama administration brokered a deal in which both sides would withdraw. The Philippine vessels departed, but some of the Chinese boats stayed.China has controlled the shoal ever since. Emboldened, China began construction of seven artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago.China appears reluctant to build a full-fledged military base on the shoal, lest it stoke nationalist anger in the Philippines, damaging relations with its pro-China president, Rodrigo Duterte.\u201cAny reclamation will outrage the Duterte government,\u201d says Zhu Feng, the executive director of the Center for the South China Sea at Nanjing University. \u201cChina can\u2019t afford to lose a good friend like that.\u201dBut many Philippine officials fear that this is merely a pause before an inevitable Chinese expansion.Two large maps of the South China Sea cover the walls of the office of Gary Alejano, a Philippine congressman and former marine. He shows visitors how the Scarborough Shoal sits on the edge of the Bashi Channel, the Chinese Navy\u2019s entryway into the western Pacific. He points out the artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago. He notes Mischief Reef, where Chinese fighter jets have landed.Unless someone confronts them, those jets will remain there, using the hangars China built, Mr. Alejano says. Philippine Navy vessels rarely patrol the area, he laments.\u201cRight now, you can feel that China controls the South China Sea,\u201d Mr. Alejano says. \u201cAnd the U.S. comes in and out.\u201dAs China charts its global reach, six zones demand special attention: the maritime choke points.The entryway to the Black Sea from the Mediterranean. The passageway from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean via the Strait of Malacca. The corridor separating Europe from Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar. Bab el Mandeb, off Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. The Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Access to the Mediterranean from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal.At any one, an outbreak of hostilities could imperil China\u2019s free movement around the globe, jeopardizing its exports and access to resources.These zones have historically been policed by American naval power, which has made China\u2019s access dependent on peaceful relations with the United States. To liberate itself, China has been lavishing investment on governments that control the choke points.Which is how China became financier and developer for the grandiose capital being constructed by President Sisi in the reddish-brown desert east of Cairo. Mr. Sisi craves investment and allies at a time when much of the world has recoiled from his brutal crackdown on dissent.In an interview, Gen. Ahmed Zaki Abdeen, who heads the Egyptian state-owned company overseeing the new capital, railed against American reluctance to invest in his country.\u201cStop talking to us about human rights,\u201d he says. \u201cCome and do business with us. The Chinese are coming \u2014 they are seeking win-win situations. Welcome to the Chinese.\u201dIn backing the new capital, China has furthered an age-old aspiration for the Egyptian powers that be: taming the desert. The project aims to construct a city of 6.5 million people, replacing crumbling Cairo with a technological metropolis engineered to rival Dubai. Construction is expected to take 15 years while costing 200 billion Egyptian pounds, more than $11 billion.Under a master agreement signed in October 2017, China Construction is building the capital\u2019s central business district. A consortium of Chinese state-owned banks is lending $3 billion to finance a first phase expected to be completed in three years. Egypt is obligated to spend the money by hiring the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. A second phase is expected to run $3.2 billion.Yu Wenchuan dons a yellow safety vest as he works security at the China Construction site. Born and raised in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, Mr. Yu, 24, complains about the 100-degree heat and the conspicuous absence of spicy noodles. But he is resigned to spending the next eight years in Egypt.\u201cThis is a good way to get experience,\u201d he says.Under the contract, 35 percent of construction materials can be brought from China. Even some of the 65 percent procured from domestic sources stands to enrich China, given the presence of entrepreneurs like Xin Zhu.Seventeen years have passed since Mr. Xin landed in Cairo from his native Hubei Province. There, he oversaw a factory that processed slabs of granite and marble into flooring and countertops. He had heard that Egypt was rich with quarries full of high-quality, low-priced rock.He took control of a lot in an industrial area outside Cairo. He endured terrible roads and power failures. \u201cI was like a pioneer,\u201d he says.Today, Mr. Xin\u2019s company employs more than 100 people, mostly migrants from China. He ships most of his production to China. But he aims to sell into the new capital, profiting as Beijing erects a veritable Pharaonic monument for Egypt\u2019s authoritarian leader.\u201cI was looking for new opportunities outside China,\u201d Mr. Xin says. \u201cMore development is good for our business.\u201dDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaMore China RulesDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arizona Election Results: 6 Key Takeaways on Sinema Victory", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepresentative Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s upset victory in Arizona on Monday night marked the first time a Democrat has been elected to the Senate from that state since 1988. Here are six takeaways about the race and the changing nature of Arizona politics.With Republican politics in Arizona looking less like the brand practiced by senators like John McCain and Jeff Flake \u2014 independent-minded, relatively bipartisan at times \u2014 many centrist voters in the state\u2019s G.O.P. are increasingly politically homeless.That has had an impact in suburban areas like vote-rich Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. Mr. McCain and President Trump both carried the county in 2016, but Ms. Sinema was ahead there by nearly four percentage points over the Republican candidate, Representative Martha McSally.Ms. Sinema\u2019s win signals that a political realignment in Arizona is possible for federal offices. Hillary Clinton lost the state in 2016 by about 3.5 percentage points; Ms. Sinema was a different kind of candidate, with a different message, and she won statewide by about 1.7 points.Although Ms. McSally tried to paint Ms. Sinema as a far-left candidate by drawing on her history in the Arizona legislature and past antiwar activities, Ms. Sinema had a voting record in the House that demonstrated a more independent agenda and moderate positions.In contrast, while Ms. McSally insisted that she supported health care coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions, her voting record on health care bills in the House told a different story. She voted repeatedly to repeal the health care law that covered such patients.Women have been credited with helping Democrats this year, but the story in Arizona has as much to do with the shift toward blue in places that were shaded purple.Democrats picked up statehouse seats in suburban areas where such a switch would have been nearly impossible four or perhaps even two years ago, and they look set to gain other seats in state government. They now have a 5-4 advantage in the congressional delegation, furthering the representation of younger, more educated and in many cases tech-employed voters who do not support President Trump\u2019s politics.\u201cRight now, there are 181,000 voters who voted for Democrat Kyrsten Sinema for United States Senate and Republican Doug Ducey for governor,\u201d said Paul Bentz, a polling expert in the state. \u201cUltimately, Sinema\u2019s ability to appeal to female, unaffiliated and independent voters who surged at the election put her over the top.\u201dMs. McSally was saddled with a divisive Republican primary race in which she ran to the right on immigration and alienated some moderate voters. The fight left her battle-worn and sliding toward Mr. Trump for support, while Ms. Sinema spent the primary season painting herself as a cheerful, independent-minded leader. Ms. Sinema stuck to that message through the general election with a disciplined and well-financed campaign.Ms. McSally tried to unify Republicans around her candidacy, appearing with relative moderates like Mitt Romney and Susan Collins. But there was little question that she also tied her campaign closely to Mr. Trump, appearing with the president at a mid-October rally. Some Republicans in the border state saw that event as a major misstep, pointing to her sagging numbers in the weeks following the visit.Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on a hard-line immigration policy in the final weeks turned off both Latino voters and independents, who make up Arizona\u2019s largest voting block. That has not gone unnoticed by Democrats, who will certainly keep a close eye on the Sun Belt as they turn their focus to 2020.\u201cMcSally\u2019s embracing of Trump sealed her G.O.P. primary victory although it alienated key swing voters \u2014 suburban women and moderate independents \u2014 which lost her the general election,\u201d said Mike Noble, a Republican pollster who leads OH Predictive Insights based in Phoenix.Ms. McSally gave up her congressional seat representing the greater Tucson area to risk a Senate run, leaving a vulnerable swing district up for grabs down south. Ann Kirkpatrick, a former representative, harnessed national progressive energy to flip the seat back to Democratic control, increasing the party\u2019s majority in the House.Lisa Lerer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Despite efforts by President Trump and congressional Republicans to hobble the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance marketplace it created is still standing. Open enrollment started Thursday \u2014 in most places it runs through Dec. 15 \u2014 and people in at least a dozen states who want to buy or renew policies have more choices than they did last year. That\u2019s why simply renewing an existing policy could cost you plenty, and spending time comparison-shopping and digging into plan details will most likely yield more savings.Those differences and a series of moves by the Trump administration have made what was already a complicated process even trickier to navigate. Here are some tips to help guide you.But they come with big risks and little financial protection. (Some states, including California, have banned them.) \u201cOne way to make insurance cheap is to not cover things \u2014 and some of them don\u2019t cover drugs or things like physical therapy or they may have a cap on benefits,\u201d said Mr. Sloan of Avalere Health. \u201cThey can deny you coverage if you have pre-existing conditions, but they are very cheap if you are healthy and young.\u201dWhether you decide to seek outside help or compare what\u2019s available on your own, taking time to shop around is likely to pay dividends, even if your first instinct is to simply renew an existing policy.

{"Headline": "Nissan\u2019s Board Removes Carlos Ghosn as Chairman After His Arrest", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe board met for four hours and issued a short statement that sought to telegraph stability even amid the sudden leadership upheaval. It emphasized that its alliance with Renault, Nissan\u2019s largest shareholder, was a priority, and that it would consider having an outside adviser review its corporate governance and its director compensation system.The board said it acted to confirm \u201cthat the longstanding Alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged and that the mission is to minimize the potential impact and confusion on the day-to-day cooperation\u201d with alliance partners.Greg Kelly, a onetime Nissan human resources manager and a member of the company\u2019s board, was also removed as a representative director, along with Mr. Ghosn.In a separate statement, Nissan said it had uncovered misconduct committed by Mr. Ghosn that included underreporting his compensation and using company funds for personal expenses. It added that Mr. Kelly \u201chas been determined to be the mastermind of this matter, together with Carlos Ghosn.\u201dMr. Ghosn was the architect of the alliance with Renault \u2014 Mitsubishi joined in 2016 \u2014 and he is credited with the growth and expansion of what is effectively the world\u2019s largest carmaker. Renault, which owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, has been the dominant partner in the three-company alliance. This week, there have been signs of strain as the saga of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest has played out.Nissan was swift \u2014 followed by Mitsubishi \u2014 to call for the ouster of Mr. Ghosn after the car company this week announced its investigation of financial misconduct. Mitsubishi\u2019s board will meet on Monday.Renault, which employs 47,000 people in France, has been more cautious than its allies.The French carmaker said that Mr. Ghosn remained its chairman and chief executive, even as prosecutors have questioned him in a Tokyo detention center. The company named an interim leadership team to handle his duties as that investigation continues.Bruno LeMaire, the French economy minister, and his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshige Seko, met Thursday in Paris and \u201cexchanged views and shared information about the latest situation,\u201d the French ministry said. They reaffirmed the support of the French and Japanese governments for the Renault-Nissan alliance and said they wanted to maintain it.Neither Mr. Ghosn nor Mr. Kelly has been charged with a crime. Japanese prosecutors boarded Mr. Ghosn\u2019s corporate jet shortly after it landed Monday night at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. That night, both Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly were facing prosecutors asking about Nissan\u2019s internal probe and whether they had hidden a large amount of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation from Japanese authorities.According to the Tokyo prosecutors\u2019 office, Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly underreported Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation from 2011 to 2015 by more than 5 billion yen ($44.5 million) \u2014 understating his true earnings by half \u2014 in filings with a bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance.On Wednesday, a Tokyo court approved the prosecutors\u2019 request to hold Mr. Ghosn at a detention center in east Tokyo for another 10 days. Under Japanese law, prosecutors can detain suspects for up to 22 days without filing charges, and can legally question them without a lawyer present.\u201cDoctoring a securities report is a grave violation,\u201d Mr. Kukimoto said. \u201cIt is also important to maintain corporate governance and that is the point investors should pay attention to.\u201dMr. Kukimoto gave no further details about the investigation, which could go on for weeks, and could expand to include other allegations of wrongdoing so that prosecutors could detain the suspects even longer.Suspects are not permitted to have lawyers present while being questioned by prosecutors in Japan. Prosecutors also have wide latitude to question suspects without charging them.NHK, the public broadcaster, reported that Jo\u00e3o de Mendonca Lima Neto, Brazil\u2019s consul general to Japan, visited Mr. Ghosn in detention on Thursday afternoon. Mr. Ghosn, now a French citizen, was born in Brazil. Mr. Lima told reporters that Mr. Ghosn \u201clooks in good health, and I felt he is treated respectfully.\u201dThe directors\u2019 statement on Thursday indicated that board members had reviewed \u201ca detailed report of the internal investigation\u201d and were even considering their own role in the scandal. The statement offered a carefully-worded promise: They had voted unanimously \u201cto study the creation of a special committee to take advice from an independent third party regarding the governance management system and better governance of director compensation.\u201dThree independent directors were named \u201cto lead on the matter.\u201dCorporate governance experts noted that Nissan\u2019s board had few independent members. Of Nissan\u2019s seven board members other than Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly, three have worked at Nissan for at least four decades and two are longtime veterans of Renault.The remaining board members are a racecar driver and a retired economic and trade ministry bureaucrat.\u201cI have always found it interesting that Nissan\u2019s board has always been stacked with insiders,\u201d said Christina Ahmadjian, a professor of business at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo.\u201cThe auto companies in general have been slower in governance reform,\u201d she said. \u201cNissan was a company run by a non-Japanese so it\u2019s always puzzled me why their governance was not more independent.\u201dAnalysts said that Japan\u2019s corporate culture is still quite hierarchical and that clubby boards often have trouble questioning leaders, especially someone as charismatic and forceful as Mr. Ghosn.\u201cA powerful management should want people who would challenge them,\u201d said Jun Okamura, visiting researcher at Musashino University Institute of Global Affairs. \u201cThe board should not be afraid of these disagreements.\u201dMr. Ghosn won\u2019t yet be gone from Nissan completely. Although he is no longer chairman, under Japanese corporate law, a full shareholder vote still must be held to eliminate him from the board.Makiko Inoue, Liz Alderman and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Godfather of Brexit\u2019 Arron Banks Investigated Over Campaign Financing", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEver since Britons voted to quit the European Union in 2016, questions have been asked about Arron Banks, a pugnacious entrepreneur with wide-ranging international contacts, who bankrolled a pro-withdrawal campaign and is thought to be the biggest political donor in British political history.On Thursday, the police were investigating if Mr. Banks broke the law while promoting Britain\u2019s departure, known as Brexit.The election law watchdog, the Electoral Commission, said it had referred the matter to the National Crime Agency, the police who tackle organized crime, because it had reasonable grounds to think that \u201ca number of criminal offenses may have been committed.\u201dInstead, it focused on suspicions that some loans to the pro-Brexit campaign came from outside Britain \u2014 making them illegal \u2014 from a company of which Mr. Banks is the majority shareholder.The commission said it suspects that Mr. Banks was \u201cnot the true source\u201d of a total of eight million pounds in loans made to Better for the Country, an organization that ran the \u201cLeave.EU\u201d campaign.That raised the question of who was behind the loans. One opponent of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, David Lammy, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, said the allegations were so serious that \u201cBrexit must be put on hold until we know the extent of these crimes against our democracy.\u201dThat is highly unlikely to happen, but the investigation comes at a sensitive moment in the Brexit negotiations, and against the backdrop of growing calls for a referendum on the terms of any deal that the government of Prime Minister Theresa May can negotiate.Mrs. May is hoping to conclude a deal on Brexit within the next few weeks. But if she succeeds, she may struggle to get support for it in Parliament, and her Conservative Party has been inflamed by the debate.Mr. Banks was a co-founder of \u201cLeave.EU.,\u201d one of the high-profile groups advocating Britain to exit the bloc during the campaign before the referendum.The Electoral Commission believes that one of the loans to \u201cLeave.EU\u201d may have come from Rock Holdings, a company incorporated in the Isle of Mann, which is not part of the United Kingdom but a self-governing possession of the British Crown. It is known as a center for international financial services and a low-tax jurisdiction.It said it suspects that Mr. Banks and Elizabeth Bilney, one of his associates, had \u201cconcealed the true details of these financial transactions.\u201dMs. Bilney denied any wrongdoing in an interview with the BBC.\u201cWhile electoral law offenses would not routinely fall within the N.C.A.\u2019s remit, the nature of the necessary inquiries and the potential for offenses to have been committed other than under electoral law lead us to consider an N.C.A. investigation appropriate in this instance,\u201d the statement added.Apparently unperturbed, Mr. Banks posted a picture on Twitter of himself fishing, saying that he was in Bermuda.He also argued in a statement that there was \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing from the companies I own.\u201dHe characterized the allegations as politically motivated, arguing that the Electoral Commission is \u201cunder intense political pressure from anti-Brexit supporters.\u201dDuncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, a group that campaigns against corruption, said, \u201cThe fact that the National Crime Agency are taking on this investigation makes clear just how serious these allegations are.\u201d\u201cWe have previously called for a full and thorough investigation into the source of these funds, and for action to be taken where a breach of law is found,\u201d Mr. Hames added. \u201cAny criminal activity must be prosecuted and individuals held to account.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "M.L.B., Once Averse to Gambling, Strikes a Deal With MGM Resorts", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor generations, baseball\u2019s leadership has viewed gambling as the sport\u2019s boogeyman, a threat to the integrity of the game that must be stamped out. If the lifetime bans meted out after the Black Sox scandal in 1919 and to Pete Rose in 1989 were not reminders enough, then there are the warnings posted in every major league clubhouse.So, when Major League Baseball announced an agreement on Tuesday with MGM Resorts as the sport\u2019s first gambling industry partner, it signaled again just how furiously sports are rushing to embrace the industry since the Supreme Court effectively struck down a federal law earlier this year that had served to ban sports betting in most states.Baseball\u2019s agreement comes after the N.B.A. and the N.H.L. also reached deals with MGM since July. It allows MGM to promote its gambling options on platforms like MLB Network, MLB.com and the MLB At Bat app.Commissioner Rob Manfred viewed the arrangement as a long-term partnership that he hoped would reverse a troubling trend: declining attendance.Attendance dropped by 4 percent last season \u2014 the fifth time in six seasons it had declined \u2014 and dropped below 70 million for the first time since 2003.\u201cOur research is really strong on the idea that sports gaming can be an important source of fan engagement,\u201d Manfred said during a news conference. \u201cWe operate in a really competitive environment and we have to take advantage of every opportunity to drive engagement by our fans.\u201dIn some ways, baseball seems better positioned than other sports to draw in gamblers because of the deliberate pace, with its built-in breaks between pitches. Those pauses, far less frequent in other sports, could allow fans additional opportunities to place bets during a game. For example, a fan could bet on whether Boston\u2019s Mookie Betts hits a single, double, home run, a groundout or a strikeout in his next at-bat.Those types of betting opportunities might put more people in seats \u2014 and keep them there whether the game itself is compelling or not.\u201cBaseball is perfectly suited for this,\u201d said Jim Murren, the MGM Resorts chairman and chief executive. \u201cIt will increase social networks. People will be talking about the next pitch, the next out, the next inning. It will extend the viewership of games throughout multiple innings, regardless of the outcome or the score in that given period.\u201dTerms of the deal were not announced, but if MGM\u2019s reported three-year, $25 million deal with the N.B.A. is a guideline, this is not anywhere near the cash cow that television and other sponsorships bring in. The N.B.A. last year began an eight-year deal with Nike for close to $1 billion, according to ESPN.What may carry more appeal to both partners is having access to each other\u2019s data. MGM will have access to certain proprietary data that baseball has available, such as exit velocity and spin rate. Meanwhile, M.L.B. will have access to the 31 million people Murren said were in MGM\u2019s database.Not surprisingly, Manfred and Murren repeatedly came back to a talking point \u2014 integrity.Manfred said that his office had been studying how it wanted to plunge into gambling for 18 months. While M.L.B. has lobbied persistently in New York and Washington, it has also been updating its policies about how players and team employees can participate as it develops guidelines for teams to strike deals with gambling businesses. Manfred said those policies would be decided soon.But the specter of baseball\u2019s past, of why Rose and Shoeless Joe Jackson are not in the Hall of Fame, is still apparent.\u201cIt\u2019s more than just making a business deal,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cIt\u2019s having in place a set of policies for the industry that give us comfort on what is always our most important issue \u2014 that is integrity.\u201dMajor League Baseball will put in place new procedures for vetting political contributions after giving $5,000 to Cindy Hyde-Smith, a Republican senator from Mississippi, and then asking for the money back after her controversial remarks.M.L.B.\u2019s political action committee donated $472,500 from the start of 2017 through this Oct. 17, according to Federal Election Commission records. Among the distributions were two $2,500 contributions to Hyde-Smith\u2019s Senate campaign on June 26 and Sept. 24 this year.\u201cOur lobbyists had a lot of discretion as to what they were doing, particularly with contributions of that size, and there\u2019s just going to be additional oversight here in New York,\u201d Rob Manfred said Tuesday. \u201cWe did not review in advance contributions of that size.\u201dM.L.B. intends to have its legislative affairs committee discuss new procedures before making any decisions.A video showed Hyde-Smith praising a supporter this month by saying, \u201cIf he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201dOpponents characterized the comment as insensitive given Mississippi\u2019s history of racially motivated lynching. Hyde-Smith, competing against Mike Espy, a Democrat, in Tuesday\u2019s runoff election, said her remark was \u201can exaggerated expression of regard.\u201d More than a week after the video\u2019s release, she said she apologized to \u201canyone that was offended\u201d but also said the remark was used as a \u201cweapon\u201d against her.Hyde-Smith was seen in another video talking about making voting difficult for \u201cliberal folks,\u201d and a photograph circulated of her wearing a replica Confederate military hat during a 2014 visit to Beauvoir, a beachside museum in Biloxi, Miss., that was the last home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.Manfred did not want to comment on Charles Johnson, one of the San Francisco Giants\u2019 principal owners, and his wife Ann each making a contribution to Hyde-Smith for $2,700, the individual maximum.\u201cThe Giants have more than 30 owners,\u201d the team president, Larry Baer, said in a statement Monday. \u201cJust like our fans, they come from different backgrounds and have their own political views. Many give to Democratic causes, many to Republican causes, and some refrain from politics altogether. Neither I nor anyone else at the Giants can control who any of our owners support politically, just as we cannot and should not control whom any of our employees support politically.\u201d (AP)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What I Learned From Tracking My Spending for a Month", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryone knows to watch their spending: A mistake can mean the difference between making or bouncing the rent check. I tracked my spending meticulously for a month. Here\u2019s what I learned.Earlier this year, I vowed to track my spending for a month, the same way you might track your food intake if you\u2019re trying to change your diet. Tracking your spending is nothing new, and money advice you\u2019ve probably heard before. Maybe, like me, you\u2019ve ignored this advice because you didn\u2019t see the point. I figured I already had a pretty good idea of what my spending looked like. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m some shopaholic who can\u2019t walk past a J. Crew without whipping out a credit card, and I know enough about my expenses to know when I have enough to pay the bills, and when I\u2019m in trouble.I decided to finally heed that basic money advice and start writing down my purchases, as an experiment if nothing else. It was a simple exercise, but a powerful one. And it taught me a few lessons about the way many of us spend money.Spending is often the default for most of us \u2014 the first solution to any given problem. Need to get in shape? Buy a treadmill you\u2019ll never use. Want to feel better about the way you look? Head into Bloomingdale\u2019s and buy some self-confidence in the form of a new wardrobe. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with spending, but it can become so second-nature that we often don\u2019t even realize we\u2019re doing it, and it\u2019s especially easy when you shop online.The simple chore of writing down every purchase, physically, with pen and paper, forced me to think before buying. This short pause made me more aware of how I use money, which is often as a knee-jerk solution. For example, I wanted to learn more about Ecuador before I visited, so I found a travel guide on Amazon and hit the buy button. Problem solved. Again, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, really, but it didn\u2019t even occur to me to perhaps borrow the book or buy it used. Spending was the easy solution.But when I paid attention to the purchases I was tempted to make, I soon realized half the things I buy are mindless, impulsive items. Sure, I budget and pay myself first, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m spending my money in the best way possible. I could be saving more for retirement. I could be saving more for travel. When you\u2019re more conscious with your spending, you might be surprised at how much more room you can create in your budget. It almost makes budgeting unnecessary because you spend less by design, and no longer need guidelines.\u201cAfter the month is up, figure out what you spent on a daily, weekly and monthly basis and determine if that felt high, low or just right,\u201d Ms. McLay suggested.From there, challenge yourself to spend less in the following month. It\u2019s not an exercise you have to keep up with forever, but tracking is a good way to reset your spending habits and make sure you\u2019re aware of how you spend. And that\u2019s really the goal of the exercise: awareness. It\u2019s to simply spend your hard-earned money with a little more thought. It isn\u2019t to say you\u2019ll never give into another impulsive purchase again. For that, Ms. McLay suggested giving yourself a small cushion for surprises. Again, budgeting isn\u2019t foolproof, but balance is important. Plan for your impulsive spending in advance to keep it tame, but track your purchases every now and then to reset your habits. You might be surprised at the things you\u2019re tempted to buy when you start keeping track.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Website That Shows How a Free Press Can Die", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUDAPEST \u2014 Hungary\u2019s leading news website, Origo, had a juicy scoop: A top aide to the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, had used state money to pay for sizable but unexplained expenses during secret foreign trips. The story embarrassed Mr. Orban and was a reminder that his country still had an independent press.But that was in 2014. Today, Origo is one of the prime minister\u2019s most dutiful media boosters, parroting his attacks on migrants and on George Soros, the Hungarian-American philanthropist demonized by the far right on both sides of the Atlantic.And if Origo once dug into Mr. Orban\u2019s government, it now pounces on his political opponents.\u201cLet\u2019s look at the affairs of Laszlo Botka!\u201d a headline blared this month in a salacious take on the only mayor of a major Hungarian city not aligned with Mr. Orban\u2019s party, Fidesz. \u201cSerious scandals, mysteries surround the socialist mayor of Szeged.\u201dIf little known outside Hungary, Origo is now a cautionary tale for an age in which democratic norms and freedom of expression are being challenged globally \u2014 and President Trump and other leaders have intensified attacks on the free press.The story of Origo\u2019s transformation from independent news source to government cheerleader offers a blueprint of how Mr. Orban and his allies pulled this off. Rather than a sudden and blatant power grab, the effort was subtle but determined, using a quiet pressure campaign.Origo\u2019s editors were never imprisoned and its reporters were never beaten up. But in secret meetings \u2014 including a pivotal one in Vienna \u2014 the website\u2019s original owner, a German-owned telecommunications company, relented. The company, Magyar Telekom, first tried self-censorship. Then it sought a nonpartisan buyer.But, ultimately, Origo went to the family of Mr. Orban\u2019s former finance minister.\u201cWhen Orban came to power in 2010, his aim was to eliminate the media\u2019s role as a check on government,\u201d said Attila Mong, a former public radio anchor and a critic of Mr. Orban. \u201cOrban wanted to introduce a regime which keeps the facade of democratic institutions but is not operated in a democratic manner \u2014 and a free press doesn\u2019t fit into that picture.\u201dOn the surface, Hungary\u2019s democratic institutions seem to be operating normally. The judiciary is nominally independent. Elections are held. Newsstands are stacked with dozens of private publications.But below the surface, the system has been degraded. The Constitutional Court is stacked with judges appointed by Fidesz. The judiciary and the prosecution service are headed by two of Mr. Orban\u2019s oldest supporters. Both the electoral system and the electoral map have been altered to favor Mr. Orban\u2019s party.Other than a handful of mainly online outlets, the Hungarian media has been either silent about or supportive of these moves.The index now labels Hungarian media as only \u201cpartly free,\u201d while Hungary\u2019s wider political system, once classified as a \u201cconsolidated democracy,\u201d has been downgraded to \u201csemi-consolidated democracy.\u201dAnd the fate of Origo, Mr. Mong said, is \u201cvery symbolic\u201d of that transition.In 2013, Origo was Hungary\u2019s most-read news website, renowned for its hard-nosed investigations into the likes of Lajos Simicska, a friend of Mr. Orban who had long financed his party.By then, Mr. Orban\u2019s appointees controlled the state media, as well as Hungary\u2019s two main media regulators. He had given regulators more power to fine and punish independent news outlets, or to drive them off air, yet Origo did not seem cowed.The site had been created in the late 1990s by Magyar Telekom, the country\u2019s leading telecoms company, to lure subscribers to its fledgling internet service. Over time, though, Origo evolved into a journalistic force with its own identity.But as Origo thrived, its parent company faced challenges.Since the start of the cellphone era, Magyar Telekom had been Hungary\u2019s leading telecommunications company. When Deutsche Telekom, the German telecoms giant that also owns T-Mobile, bought a majority stake in the company in 2005, Magyar Telekom was considered a marquee purchase.But things changed with Mr. Orban\u2019s election in 2010. He levied an \u201cemergency\u201d tax on the telecoms sector, in a bid to reduce government debt after the global financial crisis. The tax was also seen as part of a wider backlash against foreign firms that had bought up large sections of the Hungarian economy after the fall of communism.For Magyar Telekom, it meant an additional $100 million tax bill. Company executives feared more bad news in 2013, when Mr. Orban\u2019s government was due to renew its frequency licenses. Ahead of a September deadline, negotiations would determine how much of the market would be assigned to Telekom, and at what price.The talks were not going well. Months before the deadline, Ren\u00e9 Obermann, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s chief executive, became embroiled in a shouting match with Mr. Orban at a private meeting in Germany, two people briefed on the exchange said.Throughout the year, Magyar Telekom executives met with Janos Lazar, Mr. Orban\u2019s second-in-command, to negotiate the license renewal and a multimillion-dollar contract to install broadband internet throughout rural Hungary. Initially, Origo was not a topic of discussion.But that changed in the early summer at a secret meeting in Vienna between Mr. Lazar and two senior company executives, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Lazar said that Origo\u2019s journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government\u2019s perspective on certain matters and proposed a remedy: a secret line of communication between Origo\u2019s editors and the highest levels of government.Mr. Lazar was careful not to frame the request as a quid pro quo for new licenses, or as a form of censorship. But the Magyar Telekom executives took it seriously.By autumn, Origo had signed a contract with a media consultancy run by Attila Varhegyi, the former director of Mr. Orban\u2019s party. As a consultant, Mr. Varhegyi had played a major role in turning Hungarian state media into a mouthpiece for Mr. Orban and now his attention had pivoted to the private sector.Under the deal, Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm could call Origo\u2019s editor with suggestions about coverage.That same month, the government extended its license agreements with the country\u2019s three mobile telephone operators.Magyar Telekom was awarded the biggest share.Both Magyar Telekom and its parent company declined to comment on the Vienna meeting and Mr. Varhegyi. But in a general statement, Magyar Telekom said: \u201cDialogue between the government in office and the management of Magyar Telekom is a matter of fact, but its aim has never been to limit publicity or the freedom of press.\u201dMr. Varhegyi and Mr. Lazar turned down several interview requests and ignored requests for comment.Outraged, Origo\u2019s editor in chief resigned, refusing to participate in the deal. But his replacement, Gergo Saling, appeared undaunted.By January 2014, one member of Mr. Saling\u2019s team had even begun an investigation into Mr. Lazar\u2019s foreign travel expenses. Requests by Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm to slow the project down were ignored.But Mr. Saling was living on borrowed time.The investigation was embarrassing to Magyar Telekom: Mr. Lazar had overseen the company\u2019s license renewal and discussions were still underway over the contract to install broadband in the countryside.Mr. Lazar complained about the story in a meeting with two Magyar Telekom executives in February 2014, according to two people with knowledge of the discussion, and his disapproval was quickly relayed to Origo\u2019s management. It was one of several attempts by Magyar Telekom management, and Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm, to sway the investigation, both before and after the broadband deal was announced later that month, according to four people familiar with the controversy.Undeterred, Origo continued to scrutinize Mr. Lazar\u2019s travel. Origo eventually began court proceedings to request specific travel records, and published several embarrassing stories about the minister\u2019s movements.But by the start of summer, Mr. Saling\u2019s superiors had run out of patience. Mr. Orban had won re-election in April. Mr. Saling was fired in early June, nominally by mutual agreement.The decision was ultimately made by Miklos Vaszily, Origo\u2019s chief executive. But it came only after months of pressure on Mr. Vaszily from Magyar Telekom\u2019s management and Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm, according to three people at the company.In protest, several of Origo\u2019s best reporters resigned.For Magyar Telekom, Origo had become a public relations liability and a political hindrance, and executives wanted to sell.Throughout 2014, Magyar Telekom held talks with prospective buyers but decided against a private sale. The Lazar scandal had caused a public outcry, as critics accused the company of bending to political pressure. Executives wanted the deal to be beyond reproach, so an open bidding process was announced in June 2015 and overseen by Ernst and Young, an international accountancy firm.The winner was named in November 2015: a firm called New Wave Media, which outbid two rival companies.New Wave\u2019s profile immediately raised eyebrows. Their bid was financed by funds controlled by two banks, one owned by Mr. Orban\u2019s government, and another owned by Tamas Szemerey, a cousin of one of Mr. Orban\u2019s former ministers. In addition, New Wave was part-owned by Mr. Szemerey\u2019s longtime business partner, company records show.Mr. Szemerey had made earlier attempts to buy Origo directly. But by his own telling, Magyar Telekom executives had discouraged such a direct attempt, on the grounds that he would be perceived as too close to the government.Yet Mr. Szemerey ended up helping to pay for Origo all the same.There was no evidence of favoritism: New Wave had simply made the highest bid. But bolstered by money from the state, New Wave could afford to pay whatever it took to avoid the outlet being sold to businesses not aligned with the government.\u201cWe did not want it in the hands of Soros, or in the hands of people outside Hungary, or people who wanted to influence Hungarian politics against the Hungarian government,\u201d Mr. Szemerey said in an interview.Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on Mr. Szemerey\u2019s contacts with Telekom officials, but said the deal had been conducted transparently.Though nominally still private, Origo now became a vessel for the government. Bought in part with government money, Origo now published news that echoed the government\u2019s stance \u2014 in particular on migration, Mr. Soros and the European Union, whose officials have frequently criticized Mr. Orban.Before, Origo had struggled financially. Now it was flush with government advertising revenue, which more than tripled after the sale. In 2017, the son of Mr. Orban\u2019s former finance minister became New Wave\u2019s chief executive, and government advertising revenues kept rising, even as Origo\u2019s coverage became even more aggressively pro-Orban.Today, there are more than 500.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Defends Facebook as Furor Over Its Tactics Grows", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, held a conference call with reporters to discuss how the social network manages problematic posts and its community standards.The call quickly went sideways. For more than an hour, the 34-year-old billionaire instead fielded questions about how he and his No. 2, Sheryl Sandberg, obfuscated problems such as Russian interference on Facebook and how the company had gone on the attack against rivals and critics. In response, Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 at times defiant and at times conciliatory \u2014 defended the social network, Ms. Sandberg and his own record.\u201cThe reality of running a company of more than 10,000 people is that you\u2019re not going to know everything that\u2019s going on,\u201d he said at one point.Yet even as Mr. Zuckerberg was making his case, a furor against his company was gathering momentum.In Washington, Republicans and Democrats threatened to restrain Facebook through competition laws and to open investigations into possible campaign finance violations. Shareholders ramped up calls to oust Mr. Zuckerberg as Facebook\u2019s chairman. And activists filed a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission about the social network\u2019s privacy policies and condemned Ms. Sandberg, the chief operating officer, for overseeing a campaign to secretly attack opponents.\u201cFacebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the House antitrust subcommittee. \u201cThis staggering report makes clear that Facebook executives will always put their massive profits ahead of the interests of their customers.\u201dBut while previous scrutiny of Facebook largely focused on its business model and how its platform promotes viral posts and ads, the latest fallout was directed specifically at Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg.That has raised questions about the accountability of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg. Mr. Zuckerberg exercises near total control of the social network because he owns 60 percent of its voting shares and is the head of the board. Ms. Sandberg is his handpicked No. 2.On Thursday, Facebook\u2019s board said it supported Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg. While the board acknowledged that the two executives responded slowly to Russian interference on Facebook and that directors had pushed them to act faster, it said in a statement that \u201cto suggest they knew about Russian interference and either tried to ignore it or prevent investigations into what had happened was grossly unfair.\u201dIn his conference call, Mr. Zuckerberg echoed similar sentiments. \u201cTo suggest that we weren\u2019t interested in knowing the truth, or to hide what we knew, is simply untrue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a much stronger place today than we were in 2016.\u201d\u201cIn general, we need to go through all of our relationships and evaluate what might be more typical D.C. relationships and decide if we want to continue with them,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.He declined to answer questions about personnel changes, but said Ms. Sandberg was \u201cdoing great work for the company.\u201d\u201cI did not know we hired them or about the work they were doing, but I should have,\u201d Ms. Sandberg wrote. \u201cI have great respect for George Soros \u2014 and the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories against him are abhorrent.\u201dShareholders said they were concerned about Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s concentration of power at Facebook. Last month, several shareholders filed a joint resolution to remove him as board chairman.On Thursday, one of those shareholders, Scott M. Stringer, the comptroller of New York City, who administers the city\u2019s public pension fund, said Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grip over Facebook protected him from being answerable for the company\u2019s mistakes.\u201cRenegade executives who are focused only on growth regardless of the risks \u2014 and withhold information from the board \u2014 put their company, shareholders and, in Facebook\u2019s case, our democracy in jeopardy,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. The New York City pension fund owns 4.5 million shares of Facebook.Mr. Zuckerberg said on the conference call that he was not willing to step down as chairman.\u201cI don\u2019t particularly think that that specific proposal is the right way to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am quite focused on ways to get more independence around our systems in different ways.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg may have other trouble on his hands. Facebook, which has grown tremendously as a business in recent years, is dealing with a slowdown. And advertisers, the lifeblood of the company\u2019s $40 billion business, are increasingly criticizing its tactics.\u201cUp to now, whatever you said about Facebook, you couldn\u2019t say it was a two-faced company,\u201d said Rishad Tobaccowala, chief growth officer for the Publicis Groupe, one of the world\u2019s biggest advertising groups.But now it is clear that \u201cit says one thing to you and does something completely different,\u201d Mr. Tobaccowala said. \u201cThis is very hard if you are a marketer.\u201dIn Washington, Republicans and Democrats alike blasted Facebook. Senator Rand Paul, Republican from Kentucky, said in an interview on CNN that he was concerned over Facebook\u2019s power as a \u201cmonopoly.\u201dSenator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, said at a hearing on Capitol Hill that she planned to ask the Justice Department to investigate whether Facebook\u2019s hiring of opposition research firms to influence politicians violated campaign finance rules.A coalition called Freedom From Facebook, which represents public interest groups like Demand Progress and Public Citizen, also filed a complaint on Thursday with the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook\u2019s violations of users\u2019 privacy. And Color of Change, a civil-rights group that has been critical of the company, blasted it for hiring Definers to discredit the group.\u201cFacebook is violating its most fundamental mission of building human connection, as well as the trust placed in it by billions of people, by advancing extremist far-right conspiracy theories that are aimed at denigrating Jews and belittling people of color,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change.Damian Collins, the British lawmaker leading the effort, said in an interview on Thursday that The Times\u2019s article appeared to contradict Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s previous statements to regulators about his knowledge of Russia\u2019s interference on the site.\u201cPeople at the top of the company were aware of what the Russians were doing and sought to keep it to themselves for commercial reasons, and that\u2019s a betrayal of trust,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cThey now need to fully account for what they knew about Russian activity on Facebook, when they knew it and why they did not report it to authorities much sooner.\u201dCecilia Kang and Matthew Rosenberg reported from Washington, and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.

That included Senate contests in Florida and Arizona, the closely watched governor\u2019s race in Georgia, and House races in California, New York, Utah and elsewhere.As election workers count provisional and absentee ballots, and in some cases prepare for recounts, it could be weeks before some results are known. Here is a look at the state of play in some of the races that have yet to be decided.We\u2019re tracking results as they are tallied in Florida, Georgia and Arizona.State law requires a recount when two candidates are separated by half a percentage point or less, and on Saturday, three of the state\u2019s races \u2014 agriculture secretary, the governorship and a U.S. Senate seat \u2014 were within that margin.Read the latest on Florida here. Vote counting continued on Friday in Arizona, where the Senate race between Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, and Martha McSally, a Republican, has yet to be called.Read the latest from Arizona here.Two races have yet to be called in Georgia: the governor\u2019s race between the Democrat Stacey Abrams and the Republican Brian Kemp and the House race in the Seventh District, between the Democrat, Carolyn Bourdeaux, and the Republican incumbent, Rob Woodall.In the governor\u2019s race, Mr. Kemp leads Ms. Abrams, but she believes enough votes remain outstanding to put a runoff or recount within reach. \u201cWe will continue to advocate for every ballot to be counted and take the appropriate legal measures to ensure the legitimacy of this election,\u201d said Lauren Groh-Wargo, her campaign manager.The Abrams campaign said there are a few types of votes yet to be counted: provisional ballots, which are filled out if there are questions about identification or a person\u2019s registration, and ballots from military servicemembers and Americans living overseas that were not due until Friday. A federal judge ruled Friday that regular absentee ballots in one southwest Georgia county, delayed because of Hurricane Michael and other circumstances, could be counted if they arrived by Friday.Results aren\u2019t expected in the Seventh District, which covers part of Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs, until early next week. Election officials are counting provisional ballots from Forsyth and Gwinnett counties and will announce their findings either Monday or Tuesday. The campaigns can request a recount if the race is decided by less than one percent, and on Friday the two candidates were 0.32 percent apart. \u201cThis race is as close as it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Jake Best, Ms. Bourdeaux\u2019s spokesman.Read more about the state of play in Georgia here.There are two House races in upstate New York that have yet to be called. Election officials said the final results may not be available until Dec. 3.He also asked his supporters for donations.There were several House races in California whose results were too close to call on Friday, all of them for longtime Republican seats.Not only are there votes that have not been counted, including provisional and mail-in ballots, but there are also votes that haven\u2019t even arrived yet. In Texas, ballots from voters living overseas can arrive up to five days after an election, Nov. 11, and those from military servicemembers can arrive up to six days after, or Nov. 12. Local authorities don\u2019t have to submit the results to the secretary of state until Nov. 20.Bruce Poliquin, the Republican incumbent, led his opponent, the Democrat Jared Golden, in the Second District, but the race remained too close to call.

Today, Google employs 7,000 people in the city, and more than half are engineers and technical staff.[Do you live or work near Amazon\u2019s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]\u201cThis solidifies New York\u2019s importance and significance in tech,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the dean of New York\u2019s venture capital community and co-founder of Union Square Ventures.Amazon, like most big tech companies, is no stranger to New York. It already has over 2,000 workers in New York, from e-commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers.Facebook has over 2,000 New York employees, including Yann LeCun, its chief artificial intelligence scientist and a pioneer in the field. Salesforce employs more than 1,000 at its new offices in New York. And tech stalwart IBM chose the city as the headquarters for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Most technology work in New York has traditionally been in service of other industries. That market, too, is growing briskly as banks, retailers, advertising and consulting firms \u2014 major employers in New York \u2014 are all getting digital makeovers and hiring. Goldman Sachs, for example, employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including data analysts, app developers, digital security and blockchain experts.

But the broad picture is a growing labor market for well-paying jobs. From 2010 to 2017, according to government statistics, tech sector employment grew by 53,000 in the city, or 65 percent, to an estimated 134,700.

New York is growing impressively, but its tech work force, according to most analyses, is less than half and perhaps one-third that of the Bay Area.But the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Silicon Valley, took in $12.8 billion. Start-ups in the Washington, D.C. region, where Amazon plans to put another large headquarters, received $575 million in the third quarter.In the past, New York start-ups typically sold out to larger tech companies. That, too, is changing. Mr. Wilson, the venture capitalist, pointed to MongoDB, a database supplier, and Etsy, an e-commerce seller, as examples of start-ups that held out and went public in recent years.MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share.\u201cNew York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.The rise of New York\u2019s tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education \u2014 a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city\u2019s work force, whose progress enhanced New York\u2019s appeal to Amazon.After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition.The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazon\u2019s board.For technologists who have recently come to New York, part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked: New York\u2019s huge and diverse economy, and its culture.\u201cEverything is tech-driven on the West Coast,\u201d said Jeannette Wing, who left Microsoft Research last year to become the director of Columbia\u2019s Data Science Institute. \u201cBut the East Coast is more well rounded.

{"Headline": "A Tulip Planned to Rise Above a Gherkin on London\u2019s Skyline", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe British architect Norman Foster\u2019s studio has announced plans to raise a skyscraper shaped like an unopened blossom atop a concrete stalk in the city\u2019s financial district. LONDON \u2014 A glass tulip perched a thousand feet above London may be the next striking addition to the British capital\u2019s ever-changing skyline, according to plans announced by the architect Norman Foster\u2019s studio on Monday. When a bullet-shaped skyscraper, a creation of the Foster studio that quickly became known as the Gherkin, opened in 2004, its curved lines made it a curiosity in the city\u2019s skyline. The building, officially 30 St Mary Axe, was a bold addition to London\u2019s historic financial center, known as the City.The proposed new tower, the Tulip, would raise the aesthetic stakes, with a glass structure like a closed tulip blossom, echoing the shape of the Gherkin, on an elongated concrete stem, high above its neighbors. With Brexit sowing fears about where the City, and Britain as a whole, are headed, the plan to build the Tulip by 2025 comes as an optimistic statement about London\u2019s future.\u201cContinuing the pioneering design of 30 St Mary Axe, the Tulip is in the spirit of London as a progressive, forward-thinking city,\u201d Mr. Foster said in a statement.The project is a partnership between the J. Safra Group, the owner of the Gherkin, and Foster and Partners. A formal planning application was submitted to the City authorities last week, and construction could begin in 2020 if permission is granted, though a spokeswoman for the project declined to discuss how it might be financed.Visitors would be able to ride in glass \u201cgondola pods\u201d revolving around the outside of the summit. Inside would be viewing platforms, restaurants and a bar, and a glass chute for people to slide from one level to another.There would be an interactive exhibition on the history of London, in keeping with the local authorities\u2019 drive to infuse cultural experiences into the financial district.At just over 305 meters tall (around 1,000 feet) the Tulip would not quite match London\u2019s tallest structure, the Shard, designed by Renzo Piano, which is almost 310 meters. For centuries, St. Paul\u2019s, the domed 17th-century cathedral, was the tallest structure in London and the highest vantage point for viewing a low-rise city. At about 365 feet tall, it was not surpassed until the 1960s. The Gherkin was the first new tall building in the City of London since the 1970s, but after it came several more. Some newer London structures, like the Shard and the giant Ferris wheel called the London Eye, offer lofty, publicly accessible views of the city, which the Gherkin does not.While some people greeted the proposal for the Tulip as a welcome, bold idea its shape quickly drew mockery on social media.Advertisement"}

Mr. Williams, then a retail bank manager, sometimes exhibited art at the branch he managed, while Ms. Williams volunteered at the Baltimore Museum of Art, haunting the collection donated decades earlier by Etta and Claribel Cone, well-traveled local sisters who amassed works by Matisse and other European artists.\u201cThe Cone sisters were way ahead of their time,\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cWhat resonated with me was the way the sisters joined the personal circles\u201d of the artists they championed.As their collection grew, the Williamses, too, took part in art circles. They began to invite students and fledgling collectors as well as established curators and museum directors for casual exhibitions at home, which continue today.Mr. Williams said, \u201cLater on, when we moved to New York, we began collecting limited edition prints\u201d of works by African-American artists including Romare Bearden, Thornton Dial and Hale Woodruff. \u201cThese were the artists we heard so much about, the contemporaries of our parents,\u201d he said.\u201cWe moved from prints into original works\u201d as he switched to real estate finance, which gave the couple \u201cmore cash on hand,\u201d Mr. Williams said.

But after a closely watched, expensive battle, Democrats won eight Republican-held seats, giving their party decisive command of Albany\u2019s triumvirate of power and positioning them to unleash a cascade of long-stymied progressive legislation.Democrats had needed to flip only one seat to erase the Republicans\u2019 razor-thin majority.

Any control they have won has always been short-lived \u2014 since World War II, the periods of Democratic rule add up to fewer than three years.Democratic unity seems more assured this time, especially after primary voters ousted the majority of those renegade senators in September in what was widely seen as proof of the energy in the party\u2019s progressive wing.Those primary victories may have an outsize effect on the temperature of the new Senate majority. Several of the freshman senators are first-time politicians who ran on unapologetically progressive bona fides; some support proposals, such as legalizing recreational marijuana, that are still a source of debate, even among Democrats. One incoming senator, Julia Salazar, will be the first democratic socialist to serve in the State Legislature.\u201cAlbany has never seen this scale of turnover,\u201d said Bill Lipton, the state party director of the progressive Working Families Party, referring to both the primary and general election victories.But there are almost certain to be moderating forces, including from other Democrats. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fiscal centrist, has long been wary of increasing government spending. A long-running rumor in Albany held that Mr. Cuomo actually favored \u2014 or even tacitly encouraged \u2014 Republican control of the Senate, so that more expensive progressive bills would not land on his desk. Already, several of the newly elected senators have joined Mr. Cuomo in pledging to hold down property taxes, a key issue for suburban voters.Still, the Democrats have already declared a long list of priorities for next year, including codifying Roe v. Wade and tightening gun restrictions. They have also promised to reform the bail system and enact universal health care.The Democrats\u2019 victory was likely fueled partly by the entry of new players, and partly by the absence of old ones. In most of the districts where the parties had focused their efforts, the number of active Democratic voters had increased since 2014, and the number of Republicans had fallen. Powerful outside groups that normally funneled millions of dollars to the Republicans, such as a charter school PAC, reined in their giving.Grass-roots groups and unions deployed to swing districts in full force, chartering buses from New York City and fanning out across the suburbs of Long Island and the Hudson Valley.In a sign of the high-stakes nature of the battle, the races attracted attention \u2014 and even a rare sheen of glamour \u2014 from far outside the circles that normally tune in to state politics. Nearly three-quarters of Mr. Gaughran\u2019s donations, many small-dollar amounts, came from out of state. On Monday, the actor Ben Stiller made a surprise cameo to knock on doors in Brooklyn with Andrew Gounardes, who unseated Senator Martin J. Golden. The actress Uma Thurman also donated several thousand dollars to female Democratic candidates.The incoming class of legislators includes several notable firsts: not just the first female legislative leader in Ms. Stewart-Cousins, or the first democratic socialist in Ms. Salazar, but also the first Asian senator (John C. Liu, from Queens, who was also the former New York City comptroller) and the first so-called Dreamer (Catalina Cruz, an immigrant from Colombia who won an Assembly seat in Queens).Several victorious candidates nodded to the challenges still ahead, ticking off their to-do lists for next year: fixing the subways, fixing state election laws, fixing campaign finance regulations \u2014 in short, fixing Albany. Mr. Gounardes, at his victory party, promised to be greeting voters at 8 o\u2019clock the next morning.But until then, the Democrats reveled.Ms. Stewart-Cousins, on Long Island, took a moment to savor the long-awaited victory. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to forgive us for basking in the applause,\u201d she said.Arielle Dollinger contributed reporting from Garden City, N.Y. and Alexandra E.

Hire a Pro", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "Rich New Yorkers who feel bad about keeping their dogs inside all day are paying dog hikers to let them run free in the country.Supported byWhen they leave for work, \u201cMackey\u2019s usually a little sullen, a little sad,\u201d said Mr. Carillo, 34, a finance trader who lives in a co-op in Chelsea.To make sure the puppy stayed active, they first hired professional dog walkers to take Mackey on twice-daily, 45-minute strolls. But it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cHe likes to be outside when we\u2019re in New York, but he doesn\u2019t love to walk that far,\u201d Mr. Carillo said.\u201cHe\u2019s so much more alive when he\u2019s outside the city,\u201d Mr. Carillo said.At 9 a.m. on a brisk October Monday in SoHo, three dogs were lined up outside a dry cleaner, like children waiting for the school bus. They barked, wagged their tails and jumped on their hind legs as a black Toyota 4Runner pulled up to the curb.The dogs made a beeline for Andrea Klein, 33, the founder of My Dog Hikes, and her lead hiker, Mia Godwin, 27, who guided them into the back seat and secured them with tether-like seatbelts clipped to their harnesses. \u201cClosing!\u201d Ms. Klein said in her alpha-dog voice, as her charges tucked their paws under their furry bodies.Some of the dogs have more pampered lives than others. Leo Moon, an Australian labradoodle who hikes weekly, appeared in an anti-fur campaign with Gisele B\u00fcndchen last year.With everyone buckled in, they drove to the Upper West Side to pick up four more dogs. Among those waiting was Elena Atkin, 59, a homemaker who works with various charities. She and her husband, Doug, a venture capitalist, adopted Emy, a Labrador mix, from a rescue organization in Sag Harbor, N.Y., but they didn\u2019t want her sitting around the apartment all day.So eight years ago, they signed Emy up for three hikes a week with My Dog Hikes. (She recently scaled back to once a week. On her off days, Emy goes running with a professional dog runner along the East River promenade.) \u201cI got to meet Emy\u2019s playmates,\u201d Ms. Atkin said. \u201cEmy has her own life outside of the home. Who knew?\u201dWith the parking lot out of sight, the hikers unleash the dogs one by one. A few pups take a bathroom break. Theo, the gray Weimaraner, tears up and down the path. Otis, an amber pit bull, barrels through the trees.How is Ms. Klein so sure the dogs won\u2019t run away? As an animal behaviorist, she trained most of the dogs herself. But just in case, every dog wears a waterproof GPS tracker.\u201cThis is an extreme amount of trust, when you tell people from the city, \u2018We\u2019re going to be taking your dog off-leash hiking,\u2019\u201d Ms. Godwin said. She and Ms. Klein perform regular head counts. Both are efficient and easily manage 14 dogs for about three miles, while carrying knapsacks stocked with medical supplies and water jugs.\u201cI treat this like a Fortune 100 company,\u201d said Ms. Klein, who previously worked on Wall Street. But sometimes, pet parents are tougher than C.E.O.s. \u201cThey have their intricacies.\u201d Raisen, a Border terrier, wears a collar because her owner wants her to, even though Ms. Klein would prefer she wear a harness.Dog hikers say that the field trips can have a profound effect on dogs\u2019 behavior, particularly those confined by cramped apartments.Think of it as the canine equivalent of self-care.\u201cHe\u2019s so much more fit. He has that sexy waist now,\u201d Ms. Lasry said. \u201cWhen he gets home, he comes running in with a smile on his face and running around in circles.\u201dDog hiking services regularly post social media photos and videos mid-hike, so owners can live vicariously through their pets\u2019 adventures.There is an eight-month waiting list for My Dog Hikes, though spots tend to open up in the summer, when many dogs have free run of their owners\u2019 vacation homes. Before a new dog is approved, Ms. Klein meets with the owners to make sure the dog can follow commands and is on anti-tick medication.\u201cNo aggressive dogs, ever,\u201d Ms. Klein said. \u201cIf they fight, they\u2019re out.\u201d But if a dog has potential to grow, Ms. Klein will work with it. She points to Luna, a pit bull who has \u201cbeen kicked out of every day care she\u2019s been to. The pit bull is really high energy, and they\u2019re misunderstood a lot.\u201dBy 2:30 p.m., the dogs start to fade, pausing for water. Ms. Klein and Ms. Godwin clip their leashes back on and return to the car for a tick check. The women sit cross-legged in the gravel parking lot, cradling each dog like an infant while looking for ticks.Owners are required to certify their dogs\u2019 tick medication, but every so often Klein and Godwin find a few. \u201cI\u2019ve become a connoisseur, unfortunately,\u201d Ms. Klein said, picking a tick off Mackey.Tuckered out from a day on the trail, some of the dogs fall asleep. On the drive back to the city, Klein and Godwin recap each dog\u2019s behavior on the hike and draft report cards to email their owners.\u201cMackey has come a long way! Our individual training sessions paid off!\u201d read one report card, which rated him an A. \u201cHe checks in often with the pack leader and plays nicely. He loves to swim, chase and chew sticks.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Copa Libertadores at a Crossroads, a Weekend to Forget", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerSlowly, laconically, technicians wandered around Sunday afternoon, dismantling the stage they had constructed. They rolled up vast tentacles of wiring and piled up the electronic advertising boards. They took apart Fox Sports\u2019s pitch-side studio, and they vented the meter-high gas canisters stationed behind the goal.But they dawdled a little as they worked, too: some basking in the sunshine, some kneeling to kiss the turf, some taking photos \u2014 digital proof that they were present for an event that never actually took place.Two men lifted the Copa Libertadores, a great gaudy tower of silver, from its plinth, and carried it along the edge of the field, stopping only to pose for a few more pictures. Then the trophy \u2014 actually a replica owned by the television rights-holder \u2014 slipped from view, disappearing underneath the stadium stands. It was taken by taxi to a \u201cmore secure\u201d location, a tournament official said. Nobody is quite sure when it will be seen again.This was not, needless to say, how it was supposed to end: with the final postponed not once, but twice; with the Boca Juniors bus attacked by River Plate fans and the visiting players in no condition to play either on Saturday or Sunday; with a meeting scheduled for Tuesday to decide when \u2014 or if, really \u2014 the game will go ahead; and with reports circulating that Boca already had been discussing possible legal challenges if the resolution is not to its liking.It was supposed to be a red-letter day for Argentina, for all of South American soccer \u2014 the culmination of the first meeting of River Plate and Boca Juniors, Buenos Aires\u2019s sibling rivals, in the final of the continent\u2019s most important club competition.Before the first leg, Mauricio Macri, the Argentine president, had declared the final a chance to show that the country had \u201cchanged,\u201d that it had grown up, that it was capable of staging an event of this magnitude, that it could \u201cplay in peace.\u201dTwo weeks later, in a meeting room in the Hotel Alvear Icon in the affluent Puerto Madero neighborhood the morning before the first attempt at the second leg, Alejandro Dominguez, the president of Conmebol \u2014 South American soccer\u2019s governing body \u2014 explained confidently how this would prove an opportunity for his organization and the continent it represents, too.River vs. Boca might have been the end of a 58-year wait for South America\u2019s biggest game to take place on its biggest stage, but it also would mark the start of something, Dominguez said: a new era in the Copa Libertadores, one in which it might not be able to match the glamour of the Champions League, its European sister, but could at least provide an appealing counterweight.Already, the Copa Libertadores is being modernized: The final has been shifted to November from May, so that the time difference to Europe is not so extreme, and it is being played on the weekend, rather than on weeknights. Rules designed to prevent two teams from the same country from meeting in the final have been abolished, opening the door for a Supercl\u00e1sico showdown like River vs. Boca.And starting next year, the two-legged format for the final will be abolished in favor of a Champions League-style, one-off final, held at a neutral site. The first edition is slated for Santiago, Chile. Conmebol, rather than the two host clubs, will be in charge of the logistics, and through that authority it would be able to guarantee not only the presence of both sets of fans at the final, but also their security, and thus produce a grand spectacle \u2014 \u201ca world-class event,\u201d Dominguez boasted.A more appealing Copa Libertadores would not just benefit Conmebol, he said, but all of South American soccer. It has already been able to improve its broadcast deals, promised $1.4 billion over four years by its new partner, FC Diez.\u201cIs it a lot of money? Yes,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cIs it enough? No. But it is a huge step.\u201dTo Dominguez, the destination is what matters. He is not na\u00efve; he does not believe South American soccer can ever catch and overtake Europe, mostly because he does not think improved television income for the Copa Libertadores can balance out the massive economic advantages enjoyed on the other side of the Atlantic.But he does hope that by harnessing what makes the Libertadores so special, so different \u2014 the color, the spirit, the frenzy \u2014 South America could start to stanch the endless flow of its best players to Europe, to end the decades of decline the game has seen here.There is an allure, he said Friday, to how South America \u201clives its soccer.\u201d He has previously compared the Champions League to \u201cPlayStation soccer\u201d: precise and perfectly executed, but somehow shallow, two-dimensional. \u201cI see my kids playing it and they have fun, they tease each other, but it is football on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the way we live it here. The way the fans support their teams, the passion they bring: It is life.\u201dThat spectacle is what attracts viewers, and that is what brings in money: more money for the clubs, which means they can pay their players a little better, improve their facilities a little quicker, persuade their stars to stay just a little longer before moving to England, to Italy, to Spain.\u201cIt is not that we can shorten the gap to Europe,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cBut at least we can keep track of it. We can prevent it from getting bigger.\u201dIt is an admirable plan, a fine vision. River against Boca was supposed to illustrate how it would work, what South America could offer that Europe had lost. And then, as Boca\u2019s bus rounded the corner at the end of Avenida Monroe on Saturday and a flurry of projectiles smashed its windows and pepper spray drifted along its aisle, the vision fell apart. Argentina\u2019s new dawn and South American soccer\u2019s fresh start were both lost in the chaos, scattered with the shards of glass.That is because, ultimately, the latter cannot induce the former. The challenge facing Dominguez is one of organization, strategy and financing; there is a part of it that can be turned into a neat presentation, drawn up on spreadsheets. There is a part of it, however, that cannot.\u201cIt is a combination of factors: the climate of suspicion that pervades our game; the policies of prevention and control of violence that have always failed; and the culture around our football, which is violent, macho, forgetful and thinks only of success.\u201dIt is that last element that comes up most frequently when speaking with those inside Argentine soccer: an awareness that here, ultimately, winning means too much. It infects the game at every level. It means managers are given no time to build teams, getting fired after a bad week of results. It means youth systems are anarchic, with little thought of how to develop players. It means clubs are constantly in disarray, lurching from one perceived crisis to another. It means fans exist on a coiled spring, conditioned by a hyperbolic discourse both within their teams and their news media to see the slightest setback as a disaster.It means defeat is unthinkable, a fate to be avoided at all costs. For players, that might mean a little casual brutality toward an opponent or some deliberate theatricality. In a country where many see their soccer team as the principal source of their identity, where far too many feel they have little else to live for, and where the economy is struggling and inflation rampant, it can have much more serious consequences for fans.For some, it creates an environment where any measures in support of their team, or to the detriment of a rival, can be considered. That may be why River fans targeted the Boca Juniors bus: because this was a game they could not lose.It is an example worth considering across the globe, in an era where sport \u2014 and soccer in particular \u2014 is afforded an ever-greater significance and discussed in increasingly breathless, histrionic terms, where all defeats are crises and all failures humiliation. Argentina is an example of what can happen when it goes too far.Dominguez seemed sincere when he said, in the calm before the storm, that next year\u2019s final would be \u201cwonderful.\u201d He appears to feel, genuinely, that a more lucrative, better organized Copa Libertadores can start to change things.But Argentine soccer \u2014 though its problems are not unique \u2014 cannot be changed in a boardroom, on a spreadsheet. It has to be changed on the streets. That is where the damage is done, where the problems lie, where the final to end all finals became the final without end.Advertisement"}

But this year, when politics had energized the country, she formed a giving circle that chose to focus on Michigan, where it felt Democrats were underrepresented.While similar to crowdfunding, in which hundreds or thousands of people come together to donate to a cause, giving circles allow dozens to pool dollars to donate to charities, nonprofits and political campaigns agreed on by the group.\u201cGiving circles bring people together,\u201d Ms. Rowland said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re working for change.\u201dIt is also easier to feel as if you were making a difference around big issues like climate change and women\u2019s rights if your group is giving $100,000, versus an individual donation of perhaps $100, Mr. Franklin said.Giving circles account for only a tiny fraction of the money donated to charity in any given year. In 2016, that total was $390 billion, while giving circles contributed only $30 million, according to the research group.About 56 percent of circles are composed entirely of women, while 76 percent are at least 50 percent female, according to the research group. \u201cThey want to find and build community with others and solve problems together,\u201d Mr. Franklin said, \u201cpatterns consistent with other research around gender norms in U.S. giving.\u201dEach giving circle operates somewhat differently, but all follow a basic procedure: People come together, share ideas about which groups to support and then vote on who should receive the funds.Ms. Rossman\u2019s circle has an initial meeting in October, when about 40 people gather to hear a speaker discuss a community-related topic. Members have until mid-November to suggest recipients. Ms. Rossman asks each of those organizations to submit a request outlining the funding it would like to receive.In January, everyone gathers to hear members give a brief presentation on each group. A list of around 30 is pared down by about half, and then circle members are assigned to visit the nonprofits that have made that cut.At the end of April, all 60 members take a final vote on funding those organizations, and in May, AllInBklyn gives a party where the circle and its grantees celebrate.While the members help Ms. Lee and the group\u2019s steering committee whittle down about 75 funding applications to around a dozen finalists, all who gave money to help members reach their donation goals get a final vote.

{"Headline": "Years After Plea Deal in Sex Case, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Accusers Will Get Their Day in Court", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 The sordid case against Jeffrey E. Epstein, who was accused of paying dozens of underage girls for sexual massages in Florida, appeared to end a decade ago. The wealthy New York financier struck a deal to avoid any federal criminal charges, enraging some of his victims who got no say in the agreement, which they deemed far too lenient.But the victims and their lawyers have continued to fight in civil court, long after Mr. Epstein, who pleaded guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting prostitution, completed his sentence in a county lockup, registered as a sex offender and became a free man.Jury selection is scheduled to begin next week in a West Palm Beach, Fla., courtroom for a civil trial that \u2014 for the first time \u2014 could give Mr. Epstein\u2019s victims, who are now adults, a chance to publicly testify about their attempts to win justice after the sexual abuse they endured as children.The report published Wednesday by The Miami Herald reached all the way to the nation\u2019s capital: The former chief federal prosecutor in Miami who signed off on Mr. Epstein\u2019s plea deal, then-United States Attorney R. Alexander Acosta, is now President Trump\u2019s labor secretary. Mr. Acosta had recently been mentioned as a long-shot candidate to replace former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.On Thursday, a Labor Department spokesman pointed to Mr. Acosta\u2019s past remarks on the Epstein case, including during his confirmation hearing in March 2017, and directed new questions to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida, which did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Acosta said at his confirmation hearing that the plea deal was the result of a \u201cbroadly held\u201d consensus among prosecutors. \u201cAt the end of the day, based on the evidence, professionals within a prosecutor\u2019s office decide that a plea that guarantees that someone goes to jail, that guarantees that someone register generally, and that guarantees other outcomes is a good thing,\u201d he said.In Florida, though, there was fresh outrage over the new interviews, in which young women described how Mr. Epstein had solicited girls as young as 14 and 15 for nude massages, which sometimes ended in masturbation, oral sex or, in at least one case, forcible rape.\u201cWhere\u2019s the righteous indignation for these young women?\u201d said State Senator Lauren Book, a South Florida Democrat and survivor of childhood sexual abuse. \u201cIs it because he has a private plane? Is it because he has the money to be able to circumvent the system? Well, then that means the system is unfortunately broken, and we have to fix it.\u201dDuring their investigation, law enforcement officers found that Mr. Epstein \u2014 a former hedge fund manager who was friendly with the likes of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; former President Bill Clinton; and Mr. Trump \u2014 paid dozens of girls cash to engage in the illicit sexual activity. The encounters took place from 1999 to 2005 in Mr. Epstein\u2019s mansions in Palm Beach, New York and the United States Virgin Islands. Some of the girls were runaways or foster children without permanent homes; in some cases, Mr. Epstein would ask them to recruit other girls, his victims told the police.One girl told the F.B.I. in a 2007 interview that she began visiting Mr. Epstein when she was 15 to give him massages \u2014 first in her underwear, then in the nude \u2014 for $200 each, court records show. The massages turned increasingly sexual, and Mr. Epstein also had the victim, who was identified at the time only by her initials, C.W., because she was a minor, bring other girls who worked with her in a local strip club.The authorities identified more than 30 victims. In its latest report, The Herald located about 60 and spoke to four of them on the record \u2014 including Courtney Wild, who is now 31.\u201cJeffrey preyed on girls who were in a bad way, girls who were basically homeless,\u201d Ms. Wild, who still wore braces when she first met Mr. Epstein, told The Herald. \u201cHe went after girls who he thought no one would listen to and he was right.\u201dMr. Acosta\u2019s office drafted a 53-page federal indictment against Mr. Epstein that carried a potential punishment of up to life in prison. The indictment, however, was ultimately shelved. Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He registered as a sex offender, paid damages to victims and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County Stockade \u2014 the local jail \u2014 under an extraordinary arrangement that allowed him to leave and work out of his office six days a week.\u201cThere was nothing normal about this case,\u201d said retired Police Chief Michael Reiter of Palm Beach, who said he had turned the investigation over to federal prosecutors when state prosecutors waffled on filing serious charges. \u201cSo many people, primarily the victims, paid so dearly for how this was handled from the government.\u201dNot one of Mr. Epstein\u2019s victims was initially informed of the nonprosecution agreement, whose terms called for it to be kept secret. It was not until afterward that victims and their lawyers learned that no federal prosecutions against Mr. Epstein would be initiated. The secret deal prompted two of the victims, identified in court records as \u201cJane Doe 1\u201d and \u201cJane Doe 2,\u201d to sue the government, claiming that the agreement had violated the federal Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act, which grants victims the right to be informed of crucial steps during a prosecution, such as plea negotiations. (Ms. Wild is Jane Doe 1, according to The Herald.)Bradley J. Edwards, the lawyer representing Ms. Wild and other victims, wrote in a court filing that had the women known about the nonprosecution agreement, \u201cthey would have taken steps to object\u201d to the deal, perhaps appearing in person to appeal to the judge to reject it. The victims\u2019 rights case, which began in 2008, is still pending. Mr. Edwards did not respond to an interview request on Thursday.The case set to begin with jury selection on Tuesday is a separate civil matter which also involves Mr. Edwards. He is suing Mr. Epstein claiming malicious prosecution; Mr. Epstein had earlier claimed that Mr. Edwards\u2019s civil cases involving the Epstein victims were helping to finance an unlawful Ponzi scheme being run by Scott Rothstein, a partner in Mr. Edwards\u2019s former law firm. Mr. Epstein dropped his lawsuit after Mr. Rothstein said Mr. Edwards was not involved in the financial scheme.

Mr. Bookbinder is executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Mr. Eisen is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea agreement and accompanying cooperation are also of profound importance for what they don\u2019t cover. When Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to tax and campaign finance charges in August, he did so without the benefit of a cooperation agreement. Now that he has one, it is safe to assume that Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has found his cooperation valuable and thinks it will help build a case against other targets. That cooperation will almost certainly involve topics beyond those mentioned in the documents filed Thursday. Mr. Trump\u2019s allies will try to dismiss the significance of Mr. Cohen\u2019s cooperation, pointing out that he has now confessed to multiple crimes in two separate actions. But as any experienced legal practitioner knows, the government almost always relies on cooperators to make their case against their criminal cohorts. Often the best way of learning about, and proving, criminal activity is by working with those involved in that activity, unsavory as they may be. Plus, the documents filed Thursday quote extensively from emails that are almost certainly in the special counsel\u2019s possession, which corroborates the belief that Mr. Cohen has come clean about his Russia dealings.The president and his lawyers may now be lamenting the game that they have been playing for nearly a year in delaying the president\u2019s responses to Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions. In so doing, they have given Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators time to flip multiple key associates. And the president now faces a new Congress that will be more likely to take action in the event that Mr. Trump tries to shut Mr. Mueller down, and diligently pursue the issues raised in any report released by Mr. Mueller and his team.The potential risk to the president on three investigative fronts \u2014 obstruction, collusion and campaign finance \u2014 continues to grow. We know that the president has a tendency to hit back twice as hard when he is threatened. That puts the investigation at greater risk. Legislation to protect the special counsel was once again blocked by Republican leadership from a Senate vote on Wednesday. The coming omnibus spending legislation will provide a must-pass vehicle to try again to enact these protections, and we hope the supporters of Mr. Mueller, and of democracy and accountability, on both sides of the aisle will seize the moment. The course of justice may depend on it.Advertisement"}

To those critics, this latest move was surely meant to send another message as well: He\u2019s not about to back down. The facts to which Mr. Cohen admitted on Thursday don\u2019t establish that Mr. Trump conspired with Russian efforts to win him the election, but they refute Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent, vehement claim that he had nothing to do with Russia as he sought the White House.

In the same vein, high-quality development of China\u2019s economy in the future can only be guaranteed with greater openness. I have made it clear once and again that China\u2019s door will never be closed. It will only open still wider.\u201dThe six-day expo in Shanghai is believed to be the biggest import exhibition ever held with 3,600 companies from around 130 countries and regions in attendance. Also present were leaders from 18 countries.In his speech Xi once again made a strong defense of globalization as he did in his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2017 as well as at the Boao Forum in Hainan in April. \u201cPeople with vision in the world would agree that economic globalization, as an irreversible trend of history, has greatly boosted global growth. This is an overarching trend, something that is independent of people\u2019s will. What we, mankind, can do is to understand, adapt to, and apply the law of history instead of trying to prevent it from happening. The wheel of history, indeed, will keep rolling forward no matter what.\u201d \u201cIt was a strong statement of steady as you go. China is not going to be deflected from its basic strategy and position. Xi was saying that the Chinese economy is basically in a sound position and that it is more than capable of handling its current challenges, despite what the speculation might be in the West,\u201d he said.In his speech Xi highlighted the importance of the Chinese consumer to the global economy with China\u2019s goods imports expected to exceed $30 trillion and services $10 trillion over the next 15 years.\u201cWe will stimulate the potential for increased imports. China\u2019s initiative to expand imports is not a choice of expediency. It is a future-oriented step taken to embrace the world and promote common development.\u201dXi also pledged to continue opening up the China economy, building on the measures to open up finance, including insurance, and the automotive sector to foreign companies that he announced at Boao.Since that announcement German carmaker BMW has announced that it is taking majority control of its China joint venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings.He said China would continue to steadily increase the openness of the financial sector, services as well as agriculture, mining and manufacturing, telecommunications, education, medical services and culture.He also pledged that the foreign ownership limits in both education and medical services would be eased.

The investigation could undermine the party, known by its German initials AfD, which has become the main opposition force in Parliament.So far AfD has stood behind Ms. Weidel, who has denied the campaign finance violations, which were first uncovered last week by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and the public broadcasters NDR and WDR. Prosecutors in the southern city of Konstanz then started the investigation, but had to wait for Ms. Weidel\u2019s parliamentary immunity to be lifted.Under German law, political parties are banned from accepting donations of more than 1,000 euros, about $1,100, from anyone living in a country that is not a member of the European Union, unless the donor is a German national. The full identity of the individual donor must also be stated, not just the name of an entity like a company or foundation.At a party congress over the weekend, Ms. Weidel sought to blame the journalists who had uncovered the donations, whose reports she said \u201clack any basis and represent an attempt to discredit me personally and politically.\u201dQuestionable donations are not unknown to German political parties, but the AfD, best known for hostility toward immigrants, has claimed to be more transparent than the leading parties. Prosecutors did not identify the three other party members under investigation in connection with the donation, but said all were from Ms. Weidel\u2019s regional party chapter.The AfD has confirmed that the $145,000, which came from a Zurich-based pharmaceutical firm, was deposited in the account of the party\u2019s Bodensee branch, of which Ms. Weidel is a co-leader. It was earmarked \u201cElection Donation Alice Weidel.\u201d Although the party repaid the donation, which arrived in 18 installments of around $9,000 each, it did not do so until this spring, long after the campaign.The party later said it also received $170,000 from a Belgian foundation, which was later revealed to be Dutch. The AfD also returned that money after concerns were raised about a lack of clarity regarding the exact donor, party officials told German media.The investigation will force the party to defend itself as its popularity, which had grown sharply, appears to have hit a plateau. Recent polls have shown the party hovering around 15 percent support nationwide, only slightly above the 12.6 percent of the vote it won in last year\u2019s parliamentary election.But the wave of anti-refugee sentiment that carried the AfD following the arrival in Germany of more than 1 million people seeking asylum in 2015 failed to galvanize large numbers of voters in two regional votes, in the western states of Bavaria and Hesse.Christopher F.

But Tuesday night at Christie\u2019s, Edward Hopper joined the unreality of today\u2019s art market when his 1929 painting \u201cChop Suey\u201d sold for $91.9 million, with fees, an auction high for the artist.The previous high for Hopper had been $40.5 million back in 2013 (roughly $43.8 million with inflation).\u201cReally, $100 million for a Hopper? I don\u2019t know how they come up with these valuations,\u201d said Howard Rehs, a New York gallerist specializing in American art, who, like other dealers, expressed incredulity at some of the estimates put on works in a \u201cgigaweek\u201d of Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s and Phillips art auctions that could raise at least $1.8 billion.But \u201cChop Suey\u201d was always going to sell, being one of 10 works in Christie\u2019s 42-lot evening session of the Ebsworth auction backed by third-party guarantors. They hoped either to buy the works or be financially rewarded if they were outbid. The guarantor of the Hopper, for example, was rewarded with a handsome financing fee of about $4 million, deducted from the final price.The combination of some hefty estimates and third-party guarantees resulted in measured bidding for the top lots. Willem de Kooning\u2019s 1955 canvas, \u201cWoman as Landscape,\u201d a rare early work at auction, took $68.9 million, with fees \u2014 also a salesroom high for the artist. And the relatively small 1950 Jackson Pollock drip painting \u201cComposition With Red Strokes\u201d went for $55.4 million. Both works sold near their low estimates.\u201cIt didn\u2019t fly, but it was pretty solid,\u201d said Philippe S\u00e9galot, a private art dealer based in New York, referring to the auction.With Christie\u2019s securing the prime 20th century collection of the November auction season, Sotheby\u2019s had been keen to include trophy works in its Monday evening sale of Impressionist and modern works.Eyebrows were also raised by the $30 million Sotheby\u2019s had guaranteed the New York collectors Ed and Deborah Shein to sell a 1913 painting by the pioneering American modernist Marsden Hartley. The artist had hitherto achieved a high of $6.3 million at auction, according to the Artnet price database.\u201cHe\u2019s an interesting artist, but I don\u2019t know how much he means to an international audience,\u201d said the New York collector David Nisinson who, along with Mr. Rehs, the New York dealer, regarded even $15 million as an ambitious valuation for the painting.Sotheby\u2019s was unable to find a third-party \u201cirrevocable bidder\u201d to back its $30 million risk on the Hartley and on Monday it failed to sell, denting the profitability of a 65-lot auction that raised $315.4 million. But other, less highly valued works did inspire competition.Demand had been more subdued the previous evening at Christie\u2019s sale of 61 Impressionist and modern works. Though a Claude Monet water lily painting from about 1918 did sell for $31.8 million, the final total of $279.3 million was below the $304.7 million presale estimate, and there were several big-ticket casualties.Van Gogh\u2019s 1887 oil-on-canvas garden scene, \u201cCoin de Jardin Avec Papillons,\u201d for instance, was ambitiously estimated at $40 million. Neither Christie\u2019s nor a third party was prepared to guarantee the work at that level, and it was left unsold.\u201cThings are 10 to 20 percent too expensive, and until estimates come down, I\u2019m out,\u201d said Philip Hoffman, chief executive of the Fine Art Group, based in London, which had regularly guaranteed works at Impressionist and modern auctions. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough market,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not in the business of owning art.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even before taking office, he has been hounded by controversy about conflicts of interest related to the company he ran for decades. Opponents threaten to remove him.If some of that sounds familiar, Andrej Babis, prime minister of the Czech Republic and its second-richest person, has long been compared to Donald J. Trump for his populist politics, bombastic style and exuberant wealth. He has also been similarly besieged by opponents he accuses of being part of an organized cabal out to bring him down.On Friday, those tensions hit another high point when lawmakers held a vote of no confidence seeking to end Mr. Babis\u2019s government, the second time they have done so since he came to power more than a year ago.Though Mr. Babis survived the challenge, all sides agree that the conflict has become so venomous that it has paralyzed the politics of this small Central European country at a critical moment when populist forces are threatening to tear apart the democratic gains made since the fall of communism almost 30 years ago.For Mr. Babis, those politics have become increasingly personal. In the most recent and bizarre turn of the scandal, it was reported that Mr. Babis\u2019s eldest son \u2014 Andrej Babis Jr., 35, known as Junior \u2014 had claimed that his father had had him abducted and held outside the country against his will to prevent him from talking to investigators.In response, Mr. Babis revealed that his son was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2015 and charged the reporters, whom he called \u201chyenas,\u201d with exploiting his mentally ill son when they tracked him down in Switzerland and interviewed him on the doorstep of his home.Sitting in a conference room outside his office in Prague, Mr. Babis was by turns angry, rueful and deeply emotional.\u201cWhat if I will say you are a pedophile?\u201dHe leaned in closely to emphasize his point. \u201cI will say it 10,000 times, and finally you will be a pedophile. Then start to make your defense. How could you fight against this?\u201dWojciech Przybylski, the editor of the magazine Visegrad Insight, said that Czech politics was now in a state of limbo \u2014 caught between fortifying its democratic institutions and moving in the illiberal direction of other countries in the region.It \u201chas not gone as far as Hungary or Poland, but if it continues along the path it may very soon follow,\u201d he said.\u201cImportantly, the rise of pro-European sentiment in public opinion and increasing mobilization of protesters are showing that there is a new counter-trend,\u2019\u2019 he said, referring to the forces arrayed against Mr. Babis, whom opponents say tends toward a populist, anti-immigrant and increasingly authoritarian approach.\u2018\u2018The important trigger will be next steps or lack of progress by the prosecutors investigating the prime minister\u2019s corruption,\u201d Mr. Przybylski added.Mr. Babis came to power vowing to clean up politics. The credentials he ran on included the argument that he was so rich that he could not be tempted by corruption.But he has never been able to lift himself out of a scandal that dates back more than a decade tied to the conglomerate he built, Agrofert, and that made his fortune \u2014 in particular, whether he misused subsidies from the European Union.Tomas Pergler, head of domestic political news at the Prague financial daily Hospodarske Noviny and author of \u201cBabis \u2014 The Story of an Oligarch,\u201d said that Mr. Babis had become the country\u2019s largest employer \u2014 with some 34,000 people on the payroll \u2014 through a combination of hard work and clever tactics.\u201cAgrofert prosperity is to a large extent based on as efficient as possible use of subsidy programs, both from the E.U. as well as the national ones,\u201d he said.\u201cThe magic is the structure of the holding that is divided into more than 250 companies. At first sight, smaller agricultural companies of the group receive individually relatively small sums,\u201d he said. But if you add it all up, he said, it amounts to billions.Mr. Babis called Mr. Pergler one of his enemies and said there was nothing wrong with the way he had structured his former company.Still, it was one of those subsidiaries that is at the heart of the scandal plaguing Mr. Babis.In 2007, his company looked at investing in a farm known as Capi Hnizdo, or Stork\u2019s Nest, about an hour outside Prague. Mr. Babis has offered varying explanations about what happened next, but no one disputes that the company decided to set up a subsidiary to develop the property.Mr. Babis, in the interview, said that the project was the idea of his daughter, who loved horses and wanted a place where she could ride.In creating a subsidiary, he was able to tap into some $2 million in European Union funds for the project. However, at the time, he did not disclose the shareholders of the newly formed company.It was only later revealed, under pressure from Parliament, that they included his two children from his first marriage, his current wife and her brother.Mr. Babis, in the interview, asserted repeatedly that questions had never been raised about the project until he decided to enter politics.Those questions reached full boil as Mr. Babis\u2019s ANO party competed in the parliamentary elections in 2017, with the Czech police bringing fraud charges against him and ten other people, including his two children from his first marriage.When investigators sought to interview the children, their lawyer claimed that both suffered from mental illness and could not testify.It was around this time that Andrej Babis Jr. left the country. In late December of 2017, he sent an email to the Czech police saying he was being held against his will in Crimea.Mr. Babis, in the interview, said that his son had been on vacation, seeking to escape from the media glare, and there was nothing unusual about the trip.Last month, two journalists, Jiri Kubik and Sabina Slonkova, working for the news website Seznam Zpr\u00e1vy, tracked down the son, who was now in Switzerland.With his mother by his side, he at first declined to talk, but then claimed that, at the time of his trip to Crimea, he had been told he could either go on an extended \u201choliday\u201d or be locked up in a mental institution.Mr. Kubik defended his pursuit of that interview.\u201cEven if he is mentally ill, it does not mean that he cannot speak his mind,\u201d he said, adding that his mother had been by his side the whole time and had never contradicted a word he said.After Mr. Babis flew to Geneva last weekend, however, she issued a video statement saying that the reporters had asked leading questions and taken advantage of her son.Mr. Babis accused the reporters of \u201cterrorizing\u201d his family and aggravating his son\u2019s condition.Critics of Mr. Babis are quick to note that the doctor who had diagnosed his eldest son as schizophrenic, Dita Protopopova, would later work for Mr. Babis at the Finance Ministry and join his ANO party.Shortly after the report about Andrej Babis Jr. was published, she resigned from her position at the National Institute of Mental Health, and stepped down as an elected representative in a district of Prague.Mr. Babis repeatedly said that all the charges against him were part of an orchestrated campaign and that those same people were now trying to use his family against him.Asked if he now regretted getting involved in politics, he said: every day. But just as quickly, he made it clear that he was not going anywhere, no matter the cost.\u201cThe truth is on my side,\u201d Mr. Babis said. \u201cI am very sorry this is making negative publicity, because all these people, which want to destroy me based on these lies, of course, hate me, because no one can corrupt me.\u201dHana de Goeij contributed reporting from Prague.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Takeaways From Our New China Project", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did China do it?How did the land once commonly \u2014 and with some disdain \u2014 known in the West as Communist China come to lead the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires?How did a once-cloistered nation with a flailing economy drive extreme poverty down to less than 1 percent? How did it achieve social economic mobility unrivaled by much of the world?And perhaps most of all, how did a country that rejected all of the conventional wisdom Western economists had to offer arrive at a moment when it is on track to surpass the American economy and become the world\u2019s largest?When The Times launched China Rules, the series that began last Sunday, these were the questions we asked our reporters to try to answer. The last four articles in the series will appear this Sunday, when a special print section will also be published.Here are some takeaways about what they found. In the uncertain years after the death of Mao Zedong \u2014 the founding father of the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 Chinese leaders struggled to find a way forward. It was the 1980s, and the country was still recovering from decades of political and economic turmoil.After decades of centralized planning and state control of the economy brought much of the country to its knees, Chinese officials knew they had to try something else \u2014 but what? The answer was far from clear. \u201cThe Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation,\u201d writes Philip P. Pan in the opening article of our China Rules reports.The world may have thought that it could change China, and in many ways it has, but China has also changed the world.Now, the question for China has turned from how to compete to how to pull ahead in an era of American hostility that has realigned the global dynamic. As President Xi Jinping pushes a more aggressive agenda overseas and tightens controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war that has brought the countries to the cusp of a new Cold War. When Henry A. Kissinger, President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, made a secret trip to Beijing in 1971, he opened a new era of engagement between the United States and China. It was grounded in the mind-set that increasing trade and investment would benefit both countries by making America safer and China more prosperous. But the decades of engagement that followed have given way to a trade war encouraged by China hawks like Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Trump. Mr. Bannon\u2019s view that China is the greatest long-term threat to the United States has influenced Mr. Trump\u2019s policymaking.And now, China has begun clamping down even more. President Xi has reversed course on some of the decades of reforms that the former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made to drag the economy forward. New internal and external pressures will test this model like never before. Its relationship with the United States may be contentious, but China has been busy making its mark in a bid for global influence, even as America turns increasingly inward.From Cambodia to South Africa, it has been funding major infrastructure projects like dams, bridges, ports and power plants. Some describe the effort as a modern-day Marshall Plan, the American reconstruction campaign after World War II that laid the foundation for many enduring military and diplomatic alliances.China\u2019s take on that, the so-called Belt and Road Initiative, is bolder, more expensive and far riskier. As it works to win new allies and develop new markets, Chinese-funded projects are reshaping financial and geopolitical ties. But the costs for both aid recipients and China can be high. And Beijing is sometimes accused of using its infrastructure investments to ensnare partners in debt traps \u2014 and then seize their assets.We examined nearly 600 projects that China helped finance in the last decade. They show the scope of China\u2019s strategy on a global scale. As China focuses attention on its immediate neighbors, it has overtaken the United States as the leading trade partner in Asia. It is also projecting power through military might in the South China Sea, where Mr. Xi has ordered the development of several contested islands.The American Dream has long promised a pathway to a better life for those willing to work hard. But unprecedented economic expansion in China has created an environment where upward mobility may now be more attainable in Beijing than Baltimore.While China is still much poorer than America over all, it is outpacing its Western rival in some crucial areas.Its population is among the most optimistic in the world, according to public opinion surveys. Eight hundred million people have risen out of poverty since the 1990s. Incomes are rising across generations, with children out-earning their parents. Life expectancy has soared. It\u2019s more complicated than that, of course. Education and a growing private sector have offered a path to social mobility, but they can also function as a means of social control. The government offers an unspoken pact to its people: A good life is possible for anyone who works hard, even the children of peasants \u2014 as long as they stay out of politics.China charted a new manufacturing model in a bid to build cutting-edge industries that could rival Western giants.Defying the conventional wisdom of economic development, it is trying to do it all. The Communist Party is throwing the full financial weight of the state behind these efforts.Beyond manufacturing, China has begun getting more involved in all types of industries.Mr. Xi has emphasized the need to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well.\u201d Chinese companies have long mimicked their American corporate counterparts, but Chinese tech firms have evolved quickly from copying Silicon Valley\u2019s successes to making huge strides of their own, from mobile payments to social media innovations. Now the inspiration flows both ways, with American companies taking notes from Chinese counterparts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Idaho Isn\u2019t Turning Blue, but One Democrat Is Turning Heads", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEMMETT, Idaho \u2014 This state is indisputably Trump country, what with the president\u2019s 32-point victory margin in 2016 and the Republican state leadership and congressional delegation. Still, in storefront windows like at the Possumtrot Traders pawnshop in this deeply conservative town of 6,800, you see it: a large Paulette Jordan sign displayed next to a Trump sign.Ms. Jordan is the Democratic nominee for governor in Idaho. But Tuesday\u2019s election, which she is not likely to win, is not the only reason she is interesting. She also represents a fresh attempt by Democrats in the frontier West to find a brand of politician who can help keep the party credible and energized, instead of an endangered species. In other governor\u2019s races in the region, Democrats are running a Latino educator in Arizona, a gay congressman in Colorado, a white businessman in Nevada and prominent female leaders in New Mexico and Wyoming.A 38-year-old former state legislator, Ms. Jordan holds some traditional Democratic positions like helping low-income Idahoans, supporting abortion rights and decriminalizing marijuana. But she also wants to give local officials more autonomy on tax policy and land use, and supports term limits. She owns guns, and while she supports universal background checks, restrictions for domestic abusers and a ban on bump stocks, she does not advocate stricter measures like a ban on AR-15s \u2014 the weapon that is popular with many gun owners but also used in many mass shootings, including last Saturday\u2019s attack at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.Ms. Jordan has Idaho\u2019s small contingent of Democrats fired up; many said they had never expected to be so excited about a statewide Democratic candidate. But Tri Robinson, a retired evangelical pastor in Boise and a longtime Republican, is voting for her, too. She also won over Mayor Michael Barrett of Challis, Idaho, who described his politics as \u201csomewhere to the right of Attila the Hun.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have a traditional conservative R and a traditional liberal D,\u201d Mr. Barrett said. \u201cAs a conservative, and especially somebody who\u2019s representing a small community, there are certain things that we believe, and I think they\u2019re better represented by Paulette.\u201dThe Republican candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Brad Little, has consistently led polls and enjoys an array of advantages: There are more than four times as many registered Republicans as registered Democrats in Idaho. The state has elected only one Democratic member of Congress in the past 25 years, and he lost re-election after a single term. And recently, Ms. Jordan has been trailed by suggestions of campaign finance violations, which her team denies but have brought substantial scrutiny.But Ms. Jordan may be attracting attention because, in a state with about 30,000 Native Americans, she would be the first Native American to be governor of any state, as well as the first woman to lead Idaho. Native Americans are still relatively unrepresented in high political office, but many of them vote Democrat, and party leaders see them as a key part of a political coalition if a Democrat is ever going to win statewide here.Born into two lines of tribal chiefs, Ms. Jordan was raised in Plummer, a city of 1,000 on the Coeur d\u2019Alene Reservation in northern Idaho. Growing up, she hunted and fished and pitched on an otherwise all-male baseball team. She attended a Jesuit high school in Spokane \u2014 Jesuit missionaries converted most of the Coeur d\u2019Alene tribe to Catholicism in the mid-1800s \u2014 and returned to the reservation every evening to listen to the tribal elders\u2019 stories.\u201cWhen you just are a certain way, you don\u2019t see yourself any differently, until you come across people who don\u2019t know what an indigenous person is like or what that means to have a connection to the land,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people here don\u2019t know what that is. They don\u2019t know what it means to be connected to a land for thousands of years.\u201dMs. Jordan returned to Plummer after college and was elected to her tribal council. She became a state representative in 2014 and was re-elected in 2016. She was the only Democrat to win a state legislative race in northern Idaho that year.Shelby Scott, political director of the Idaho Democratic Party, said she thought that Ms. Jordan benefited from being willing to work across the aisle, and that she stood out as a Native American woman. Still, \u201cthere are a lot of structural things that don\u2019t necessarily help set us up for success,\u201d Ms. Scott said.Partisanship is still very much in play, with most Republicans supporting Mr. Little. At a Boise State football game in early October, a woman seated near Ms. Jordan grimaced upon learning she was there and turned away, saying, \u201cNo comment.\u201d Don Brister, 76, of Meridian, added that he could not vote for Ms. Jordan because he considered her a socialist.But the exceptions are hard to miss.The morning after the game, Ms. Jordan attended a service at Vineyard Boise, an evangelical church with some 3,000 members. Mr. Robinson, the church\u2019s founder and former pastor, had invited her. He noted dryly before the service that his fellow evangelical leaders might not be happy with him. He, too, was a lifelong Republican until very recently.\u201cShe\u2019s authentic and genuine, and I haven\u2019t seen that so much in other politicians,\u201d he said.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.A few feet away, Ms. Jordan was talking to two teenage girls who had taken several minutes to gather the courage to introduce themselves. Ms. Jordan\u2019s scheduler hovered behind them. She was supposed to attend another service at St. Paul Baptist Church in seven minutes, and the church was 10 minutes away.As Ms. Jordan finally made her way out the door, a woman who had been approaching fell back with a small \u201coh\u201d of disappointment.To the scheduler\u2019s consternation, Ms. Jordan stopped. She shook the woman\u2019s hand and leaned in to listen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why SAP\u2019s Purchase of Qualtrics May Be Mutually Beneficial", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsRather than proceed with an imminent initial public offering at a possible valuation of around $4.5 billion, the market-analytics company Qualtrics is selling itself to the German software giant SAP for $8 billion in cash. That casts aside the desire for control of Qualtrics\u2019 founders, but it may still be a smart choice.The agreed deal, SAP\u2019s biggest since it bought the travel and expense management firm Concur in 2014 for $8.3 billion, backs its chief executive Bill McDermott\u2019s expansion into customer relationship management, from its core business of helping firms run their finance, logistics and human resources.Qualtrics had filed with U.S. regulators to sell 20.5 million shares in an initial public offering at an indicated price of $18 to $21 per share. At the top of that range, but excluding additional shares available to the underwriters, Qualtrics would have had a market capitalization of around $4.5 billion.The deal with SAP is certainly a good one financially for Qualtrics in the short term. Ryan and Jared Smith, along with their father Scott, will collect more than $3 billion for their stake. That\u2019s against a lower valuation in an unpredictable stock market. The similar, if less impressive, company SurveyMonkey, which only went public in September, is trading below its I.P.O. price.Ryan Smith, the chief executive of Qualtrics, will remain in charge, and the company will keep its brand and two headquarters in the United States. Being part of a $130 billion behemoth may erode autonomy, but there were risks in the original plan too. Buyers of public Qualtrics shares could have eventually resented the tight control that the Smiths were going to retain through super-voting rights and other mechanisms.Qualtrics collects data and feedback on a business\u2019s customers, employees, products and brands \u2014 something it calls experience management, or XM. It has produced positive free cash flow every year since its founding in 2002, according to I.P.O. filings. Not being a drain on resources makes it less likely that SAP will interfere.Despite the cloud of jargon, there\u2019s also visible scope for mutual benefit. SAP claims around 413,000 customers, while Qualtrics has a mere 9,000 or so. Revenue synergies can be questionable, but when a much smaller company\u2019s products \u2014 especially scalable cloud-based ones \u2014 can be inserted into the marketing channels of a far larger entity, top-line gains seem less far-fetched.At 20 times the company\u2019s forecast revenue for 2018, SAP is paying up for Qualtrics, though control ought to merit a premium to second-class public-market shares. But SAP\u2019s Mr. McDermott sees XM as a new frontier for the operations-heavy group, and has breathlessly likened the deal to Facebook\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012. If he can make the analogy hold, Qualtrics will soon matter far more to SAP than the deal price suggests.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S.-China Clash at Asian Summit Was Over More Than Words", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBEIJING \u2014 The tensions were already high.At a major international gathering in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, the United States wanted to end with a group statement emphasizing free trade. China objected.But instead of working out the disagreement through dialogue, Chinese officials barged uninvited into the office of the host country\u2019s foreign minister demanding changes in the official communiqu\u00e9.China\u2019s action marked a striking break with diplomatic decorum at a meeting that is normally used to promote cooperation among countries that ring the Pacific Ocean.More important, analysts said, it signaled a new phase in relations between the two powers, with China showing its willingness to cast diplomacy aside in favor of a more aggressive posture as it challenges the United States\u2019 dominance in the region.The West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It\u2019s still waiting.China\u2019s more assertive approach comes as Mr. Xi considers accepting an invitation from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit the North. Such a trip could complicate stalled nuclear talks between the United States and North Korea.The way the two big powers vied openly in Papua New Guinea with money and military assets for advantage was reminiscent of how Washington and Moscow behaved during the Cold War, analysts said.\u201cChina doesn\u2019t care if it looks like a boor. If you are a tough guy, you don\u2019t care what others think,\u201d said Hugh White, a former military strategist for the Australian government and author of \u201cThe China Choice.\u201dSuch behavior was only surprising because it had been more than 30 years since the world had witnessed such edginess, Mr. White said. In that era, tit-for-tat diplomacy was a leitmotif between the pre-Gorbachev leaders of the Soviet Union and Ronald Reagan. Such public snarling between Washington and Beijing is likely to become more common, he said.The latest tensions \u2014 part of a heated trade war \u2014 boiled over Saturday when four Chinese officials barged into the office of the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea, Rimbink Pato, according to a diplomat in the region and an American official involved in the drafting of the communiqu\u00e9.Security officials were summoned and the Chinese left voluntarily. The police were then posted at the office to prevent further disruptions.The American official said the Chinese had taken issue with two portions of the draft communiqu\u00e9 that Washington supported and other members embraced.One paragraph said the APEC member economies agreed to fight against unfair trade practices. Another paragraph said that members of the group would work together to improve the \u201cnegotiating, monitoring and dispute settlement functions\u201d of the World Trade Organization.Negotiators had been working on the final communiqu\u00e9 for days, diplomats said, and the disputed material was not suddenly inserted into the text.The diplomat from the region said the Chinese move was puzzling.Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, said: \u201cChina\u2019s strident reaction to such innocuous language signals its leaders\u2019 concern about being isolated by the U.S. and other countries who may still create a unified front to take on unfair Chinese trading and economic practices.\u201dChina seemed to dismiss the account that its officials burst into the foreign minister\u2019s office as \u201crumor.\u201d But Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hinted at the source of Chinese anger by saying that most APEC members opposed the practice of \u201ceconomic bullying,\u201d an apparent reference to the United States\u2019 actions.Beijing\u2019s aggressive posture might backfire on its plans to present itself as a rising power that brings countries together as the United States looks increasingly inward.\u201cIt is certain that China gained nothing by refusing a few words in the proposed draft when almost every other country accepted them,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cWe have seen this sort of situation generally since a few years ago.\u201dThe Chinese may have also gone unceremoniously to the foreign office because they felt targeted, and isolated, by the Americans, and were seeking last-minute support, the diplomat from the region said.By delegating Mr. Pence to attend the APEC meeting, President Trump dispatched the administration\u2019s point person for its get-tough-on-China policy. Mr. Pence was accompanied by the head of China policy at the National Security Council, Matthew Pottinger, also a hard-liner on China.In Papua New Guinea, Mr. Pence continued his theme, criticizing China\u2019s global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative, as a \u201cconstricting belt\u201d and a \u201cone-way road.\u201dThe day before, Mr. Xi had vigorously defended the project, which is considered among the Chinese elite to be the foreign policy effort in which the president is most invested.\u201cIt does not exclude anyone,\u201d Mr. Xi said in his speech about the Belt and Road Initiative. \u201cIt is not an exclusive club closed to nonmembers, nor is it a trap as some people have labeled it.\u201dChina may also have been rattled by the American decision to join hands with its major allies, Japan and Australia, to increase its economic development assistance to Papua New Guinea and to embark on redeveloping a naval port there at Manus Island.Mr. Xi arrived in Papua New Guinea two days ahead of the APEC meeting, for which China financed roads and a $50 million renovation of a convention center. The Chinese leader stressed his nation\u2019s largess to Pacific island nations like Papua New Guinea.But China is the third-largest donor to these countries, trailing Australia and New Zealand, said Jonathan Pryke, an expert on the Pacific islands at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. The United States was the fourth largest, sending most of its aid to the northern Pacific countries of Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, Mr. Pryke said.At the meeting, Mr. Pence announced that the United States would increase engagement in the region, pledging to join Australia and Japan in helping to bring electricity to 70 percent of Papua New Guinea by 2030. (Only 13 percent of the country currently has electricity.)The United States is also working with Australia to develop the deepwater port at Manus Island, which lies 1,060 miles south of the American territory of Guam.Manus Island played an important role for the United States Navy in the defeat of Japan during World War II. Now it could play a strategic role against China\u2019s expansion in part because the port is big enough to hold large naval vessels and task groups, said Peter Dean, professor of war studies at the University of Western Australia.\u201cIf the Chinese were able to land this as a base instead of the United States and Australia, then it would have had significant strategic implications,\u201d Mr. Dean said.Luz Ding contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Bill Gates Encourages the World to Build a Better Toilet", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Bill Gates believes the world needs better toilets.Specifically, toilets that improve hygiene, don\u2019t have to connect to sewage systems at all and can break down human waste into fertilizer.So on Tuesday in Beijing, Mr. Gates held the Reinvented Toilet Expo, a chance for companies to showcase their takes on the simple bathroom fixture. Companies showed toilets that could separate urine from other waste for more efficient treatment, that recycled water for hand washing and that sported solar roofs.Mr. Gates said in an interview that \u201cit will be at least a decade\u201d before the reinvented toilets reach tens of millions of people in the poorest areas, and they will have to prove both practical and economical. \u201cNobody wants overnight solutions\u201d in sanitation, he added.Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s top leader, has called for a \u201ctoilet revolution.\u201d (Incidentally, the Reinvented Toilet Expo is called \u201cToilets in the New Era\u201d in Chinese.) Having clean toilets, Mr. Xi said in 2015, is an important goal in \u201cadvancing the revitalization of the countryside.\u201dLi Shuangxin, a 41-year-old stay-at-home mother who lives on the outskirts of Beijing, walks about 100 meters to an outhouse several times a day from her shack. About 20 people share the \u201ctoilet,\u201d which is little more than two planks over a mud pit.\u201cWhen you do your business, you just don\u2019t look down,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with such a toilet, but you don\u2019t really have a choice. Our economic conditions are such.\u201dBut China\u2019s toilet revolution has led to excesses \u2014 a problem that critics say could plague the Gates effort as well.Though the products on display on Tuesday were nowhere as flashy, Mr. Gates has drawn criticism for giving thousands of dollars to universities in developed countries to create high-tech toilets that will take years to pay off \u2014 if they ever do.\u201cIt might be a thing like the space program where people have fantasies about colonizing the moon and Mars, but it\u2019s really not that practical,\u201d he said.Mr. Gates acknowledged that some reinvented toilets, in small volumes, could cost as much as $10,000, but added, \u201cThat will pretty quickly come down.\u201d\u201cThe hard part will be getting it from $2,000 to $500,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say we are more confident today that it was a good bet than where we started, but we are still not there.\u201dThe Gates Foundation said the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank would commit $2.5 billion in financing for sanitation projects that provide people in all parts of a city \u2014 including the poorest neighborhoods \u2014 with safely managed sanitation services.\u201cWe see ourselves on the cusp of a sanitation revolution,\u201d Mr. Gates told expo attendees on Tuesday.At a showroom in an art center in Beijing, companies including China\u2019s Clear, Ecosan and CRRC, Sedron Technologies of the United States, India\u2019s Eram Scientific and Switzerland\u2019s Blue Diversion Autarky displayed toilets that could separate urine and recycle water for hand washing.During his opening remarks, Mr. Gates said he had started getting interested in sanitation after he stopped working full time at Microsoft and began traveling more frequently to poor countries with his wife, Melinda.Holding up a beaker of fecal matter, Mr. Gates reminded the audience that human waste is disgusting, containing 200 trillion rotavirus particles and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs, among other organisms.Mr. Gates\u2019s efforts to bring the discussion of toilets into the mainstream have legitimized a topic that many have avoided talking about for decades, said Jack Sim, the founder of the World Toilet Organization, a Singapore-based nonprofit organization committed to improving toilet and sanitation conditions worldwide.\u201cThe subject of toilets has been a neglected subject for some time,\u201d Mr. Sim said. \u201cThe Gates Foundation is part of this momentum of breaking the taboo.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Bill Gates\u2019s remarks on human waste at the Reinvented Toilet Expo in Beijing, based on erroneous information provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

{"Headline": "The Future of Football Has Flags", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore American children ages 6 to 12 now play flag football than the tackle version of the sport. The N.F.L. has taken note and is investing in the game.HOOVER, Ala. \u2014 Robin Schultz knows how important football is in this Alabama city. He was going to games long before Hoover became famous (or perhaps infamous) for its devotion to the sport, as chronicled in an MTV reality show, \u201cTwo-a-Days,\u201d that focused on the nationally ranked Hoover High School Bucs.\u201cNot happening,\u201d he told them.Yet Schultz, like many adults, was not quite ready to give up football altogether. Instead, these parents and caregivers have let their children experience the game but avoid the bulk of its contact by playing flag football. The shift, through thriving leagues in Hoover and dozens of other cities and towns, has helped flag football become the fastest-growing team sport in the United States.The shift has some high-profile supporters. New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, a Super Bowl champion and the most productive passer in N.F.L. history, did not put on pads for the first time until high school, and he credits flag football with laying the foundation for the skills that almost certainly will land him in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. \u201cEvery parent looks at football now and has reservations,\u201d said Brees, now in his 18th N.F.L. season. \u201cI know I do. If parents feel like the only option is tackle, then there\u2019s a danger that a whole generation of kids may never be introduced to the game.\u201d\u201cFootball is part of our fabric,\u201d said Jeff Lewis, a founder of the new American Flag Football League, whose games were broadcast by the N.F.L. Network and covered on the league website last summer. The tournament, the first U.S. Open of Football, saw 128 amateur teams and four \u201cpro\u201d squads compete this summer. A 2016 UMass Lowell Center for Public Opinion Research survey found that 78 percent of American adults did not think it was appropriate for children to participate in tackle football before age 14. Last month, the LA84 Foundation, which has given millions in grants to youth sports programs in Southern California, announced that it would no longer finance tackle football programs for children under 14. In many cases, in fact, the rush to flag football has been led by so-called \u201cfootball people.\u201dThis fall, Chicago\u2019s Academy for Urban School Leadership, a nonprofit after-school program, added flag football for fifth- and sixth-grade girls and boys to complement an existing tackle program. The new program was made possible by a $15,000 donation from the Chicago Bears, who already help pay for a tackle program for junior high school boys.\u201cI just couldn\u2019t rationalize it,\u201d Lee said of letting Danny play tackle football at a young age.Demand was so strong for places in the league that Lee was able to fill a second team; among the players who signed up was Connor Drew, whose grandfather, Dave Wannstedt, is the former Chicago Bears and Miami Dolphins coach. Wannstedt told his daughter Keri Drew that Connor would be better off playing flag football.\u201cMy dad didn\u2019t really start tackle until high school, so his opinion has been to wait until even more of the science comes out,\u201d Keri Drew said. \u201cThe unknown is what\u2019s scary.\u201dIn Hoover, the Bucs are still the most important team in town, and the looming presence of the University of Alabama \u2014 an hour\u2019s drive away \u2014 hovers over the city\u2019s booming flag football league; recently, the league moved its game days to Tuesday evenings from Saturdays to avoid conflicts with Nick Saban\u2019s top-ranked Crimson Tide.\u201cIt\u2019s really cut into tackle football here,\u201d Solberg said. \u201cOur tackle league has lost about 180 to 200 kids in the last two years. I have a lot of ex-college players among my dads and coaches, and they know the wear and tear and grind that goes into playing tackle. They say this is more fun for their kids.\u201dWhile flag football pitches itself as a safer alternative, some parents still steer their children away from football entirely. Jim Schwantz, a former N.F.L. player who is now the mayor of Palatine, Ill., discovered this after he started a recreational flag football league.\u201cI found that there was a group of parents, they don\u2019t even want to introduce their kids to flag, period, because they\u2019ll enjoy the game and then ask to play tackle,\u201d Schwantz said.In New Orleans on autumn Fridays, Brees coaches each of his three boys\u2019 flag football teams in the league he co-founded. It is the night that he can share the sport that has made him wealthy and famous with the boys \u2014 Baylen, 9, Bowen, 8 and Callen, 6 \u2014 without worrying about the harm the game might do to their futures.Brees is bracing for what he acknowledges will be a difficult discussion with his wife, Brittany, and his boys if they ask to play tackle. \u201cThey are at the age where they know what Dad does,\u201d he said.In the meantime, Brees hopes Football 'N\u2019 America, now in its second year and with leagues in 11 cities, can delay that conversation a while longer and perhaps lead him, and other parents, to a more informed decision.\u201cIt\u2019s every parent\u2019s decision if, and when, they want their kids to play tackle,\u201d Brees said. \u201cWe are armed with more information than ever before, and there is more coming every day. Flag is where I developed my love and passion for the game. Maybe some will pursue tackle. If they don\u2019t, I hope they had a great time playing flag and appreciate the game.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Send in the Stagers", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the real estate market sluggish, a little decluttering won\u2019t be enough to sell your home. Time to turn the space into a showroom.11 PhotosJohn and Molly Cesarz have three young sons and an insufficient number of bedrooms to go around. This past August, they decided it was time to put their Upper East Side co-op on the market.The couple, who were preparing to close on a four-bedroom co-op nearby but would have to remain in their apartment for a few months, had fully expected such diktats and nodded agreeably.But Mr. Eiden wasn\u2019t finished.He also wanted to rearrange some furniture and temporarily replace several pieces with things he believed would make the space more pleasing to prospective buyers. The list included lamps, a sofa, an area rug, plants and assorted knickknacks.\u201cOur first reaction was \u2018No way,\u2019\u201d recalled Mrs. Cesarz, a high school teacher. As for the couple\u2019s second reaction, well, let\u2019s just say a beloved Oriental rug that once covered the living room floor can now be found tied up in a closet.These days, thanks to New York\u2019s sluggish real estate market, all the world\u2019s staged.Inventory is high, buyers are eager to find fault with a property (get a load of that plaid sectional in the living room and the statue of a shepherdess in the foyer!) and quick to find the exit. Understandably, sellers want to ensure that those prospects \u2014 any prospects! \u2014 stick around long enough to sniff the fresh-baked cookies. Thus, they are living, and not always happily, in the company of unfamiliar sofas, easy chairs, end tables, headboards and tchotchkes, and relegating much of their own furniture to storage.In some instances, the sellers haven\u2019t yet closed on their new homes and would like to skip the bother and the added expense of a short-term rental. And, of course, many people simply can\u2019t afford to carry two properties, so they\u2019ve got no choice but to stay where they are until they\u2019ve lassoed a buyer.When the market was booming, even an estate sale might call for only minimal tweaking. \u201cIf an apartment was in nice condition with a view, you expected prospective buyers to come in and have their own imagination and know how a room could be laid out,\u201d Mr. Moss continued. \u201cNow every apartment has to be prepared for showing.\u201dAnd sellers don\u2019t need a lot of convincing. Disheartening statistics help explain sellers\u2019 willingness to get with the program.But the difficult market isn\u2019t the only driver here. \u201cBecause of HGTV, we\u2019ve become more visually and design-oriented as a society,\u201d Mr. Harkov said. \u201cMany of us are skimming through Pinterest or looking at photos on Facebook, so we expect to see things look a certain way.\u201dIn a nod to the current climate, a stager was engaged to do the living room and master bedroom to the tune of $3,000 a month.Many stagers typically accept jobs only on properties that have been emptied of furniture \u2014 and emptied of occupants. They don\u2019t want the wear and tear on their sofas and rugs; they certainly don\u2019t need the aggravation. But some stagers, loath to miss out on a revenue stream, are taking all comers.Staging for a studio runs about $5,000, including the consultation and installation fees and the cost of renting the furniture for three months (although most staging contracts are for six months). The tab can run $40,000 to outfit a Classic Six, depending on how high end a client wants to go. \u201cEverything we bring in has a price tag,\u201d Ms. Lorenz said.Of course, storing a seller\u2019s furniture has a price tag too. Done & Done, a move management and organizing company, charges $400 and up each month, depending on the size of the storage room, said Ann Lightfoot, a founder of the company.If an apartment sells \u2014 mirabile dictu \u2014 on its very first day on the market, \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Ms. Lorenz said. \u201cBut our contract still holds in its entirety because of all the work we already put into the project.\u201dMs. Guinnessey has also seen an uptick in requests for, say, a headboard but no mattress or a dining table but no chairs to go with it. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of order from a stager that tells me someone is still living in the apartment,\u201d she said.Stagers face a particular set of challenges when working on an owner-occupied apartment \u2014 the biggest being the presence of the owner and the owner\u2019s stuff.When the seller hasn\u2019t moved out, \u201cyou\u2019re working with what\u2019s in the apartment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people may have a navy easy chair and a maroon sofa, and I think, \u2018Hmmm, now what am I going to do? Maybe I\u2019ll bring in white pillows or a white rug to make the room feel lighter and brighter.\u2019\u201dIn some instances, stagers working on an owner-occupied apartment will charge an additional fee to cover wear and tear on the furniture and accessories. Ms. Lorenz has just instituted a 10 percent security deposit on every item from her own inventory. She and several fellow stagers have also established some new terms of engagement. Ms. Lorenz, for instance, will not stage an owner-occupied apartment that has pets. And if she puts a bunch of wine glasses on the bar for show, she said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want clients to use the glasses.\u201d \u201cI have to tell people all the time that they don\u2019t get a vote about the kind of couch or end table I\u2019m going to use, and I have to be very firm on that point,\u201d she said. \u201cI explain to them the difference between interior design, which is for a specific taste, and staging, which has to have broad appeal. That\u2019s our expertise.\u201dLast month, partly in response to the softening market, Compass introduced Compass Concierge, a service that assumes the costs of decluttering, painting and staging clients\u2019 apartments; the cost is repaid by the sellers at closing. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important in this climate to put your apartment in the best light,\u201d said Samantha Lynch, the senior director of corporate development and strategic finance at Compass. \u201cThe program lets sellers invest in their homes while we assume the upfront costs.\u201dIn some cases, real estate agents themselves will take on the role of ad hoc stager, in the interest of saving a client both the cost of furniture rental and the staging fees charged by the professionals.Ms. Beauchamp, of Engel & Volkers, has a cache of chairs, lamps, glassware, vases and multiple sets of bed linens that she keeps in her own apartment and deploys gratis to dress up residences that she finds wanting. \u201cIt tells clients \u2018I\u2019m in this with you,\u2019\u201d she said.Mr. Eiden, of Compass, rents a few storage spaces to hold a collection of furniture and accessories (much of it from Wayfair) sufficient to outfit four two- or three-bedroom apartments. \u201cI don\u2019t charge my sellers anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all-inclusive of my commission. That\u2019s how important it is to me.\u201dSellers accept the invasion of the end tables and accent chairs with varying degrees of enthusiasm. \u201cInitially, people are a little bit worried to sit on the sofa that isn\u2019t theirs. They\u2019re a little intimidated by the whole setup,\u201d Ms. Kenney said. \u201cBut several of our sellers have thrown parties because the place looks so darn good they want people to come and see it.\u201dMrs. Cesarz, Mr. Eiden\u2019s client, described her staged apartment as \u201cfeeling institutional.\u201d She isn\u2019t wild about all the throw pillows on the bed, and she doesn\u2019t care a whit for the blue-and-white area rug that has taken the place of her Oriental. \u201cBut it probably photographs well,\u201d she said.But Mark Mayo and My My Tntien, the parents of two young children, were only too happy for Mr. Eiden to have his way with their two-bedroom apartment in South Park Slope. \u201cA lot of our furniture is stained with baby vomit and milk,\u201d said Mr. Mayo, 40, a data engineer. \u201cMartin showed us a couple of sofa styles, and he let us choose.\u201d Mr. Eiden also switched out the coffee table and TV stand and staged the couple\u2019s roof deck, adding a Buddha statue, an outdoor rug and plants. \u201cWe had to water them and everything,\u201d Mr. Mayo said of the plants. Listed at $869,000, the apartment recently sold for $800,000.\u201cMartin told me I would have to lose my sectional and maybe the dining table,\u201d said Alex Hall, 43, whose Mercer Street duplex recently went on the market for $1.5 million. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised that he and his team kept a couple of my things here,\u201d added Mr. Hall, who works in the tech sector. \u201cI mostly love what they\u2019ve done, even though my apartment is no longer perfectly set up for slouching around and watching a movie marathon.\u201dOccasionally, a staged apartment looks so good that sellers rethink their decision to move. One of Ms. Kenney\u2019s first projects was an owner-occupied two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. The clients were suburbia bound.\u201cThe apartment wasn\u2019t set up well,\u201d Ms. Kenney said. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t designers; they just do the best they can. We had the sellers take a lot of stuff out, then we rearranged everything and brought in accent pillows and bedding.\u201dShe continued: \u201cAnd when we got done, they said, \u2018This is so great. We\u2019re not going to move.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018I am never going to work in this town again!\u2019\u201d Three months later, the couple decided, on second thought, that they really did need more space.Mr. Eiden recalled a similar experience, when the owners of a three-bedroom duplex in Chelsea said to him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad at us. The apartment looks super great, and we don\u2019t want to sell it.\u201d He had decluttered their apartment, brought in lighting and a clutch of throw pillows, and rearranged the furniture to better define the space. \u201cI made more than my commission back with all the referrals they\u2019ve given me,\u201d Mr. Eiden said.But with staging, as with weight-loss products, results may vary. \u201cI don\u2019t think, in this market, we can guarantee that if you stage you will get X amount more dollars or a bidding war or even the asking price,\u201d said Ms. Larson, of Warburg. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this is a buyer\u2019s market with a lot of competition, and we need to check every box we can.\u201dStill, staging does have one invaluable benefit: Like packing up the pots and pans and books and linens, it\u2019s another, well, stage in the letting-go of home sweet home and the moving-on process.\u201cI really think staging in an owner-occupied apartment helps people detach from the property,\u201d said Ms. Beauchamp, of Engel & Volkers. \u201cThen it becomes a commodity that we\u2019re trying to sell for the best price possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Four Years From Its Big Party, Qatar Remains a Soccer Work in Progress", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerEUPEN, Belgium \u2014 The chant started midway through the first half, emanating from a corner of the Kehrweg Stadium where a few dozen preteens, each of them wearing a thick down jacket amid the falling snow, were gathered.The children were clearly eager to show their gratitude on Monday when Qatar\u2019s national team paid a rare visit to Eupen to face Iceland in an exhibition match. As Ari Skulason, the Icelandic captain, lined up a free kick, that small corner of the stadium came out in support of his opponent. In shrill, excited voices, carrying across the bitterly cold night, the Belgian children chanted, \u201cQatar, Qatar.\u201dEupen itself accounts for only the tiniest sliver of Qatar\u2019s multibillion-dollar investment. Far more has gone into Aspire, with its expert, imported staff and its state-of-the-art facilities in Doha and Senegal.Even that, though, pales into insignificance when compared with Qatar\u2019s sponsorship deals with Barcelona, the establishment and expansion of the broadcaster beIN Sports, or the billion or so dollars spent on the purchase and subsequent transformation of Paris St.-Germain into one of Europe\u2019s most powerful and most glamorous clubs.That is the price; it is not the whole cost. It has been eight years since the former FIFA president Sepp Blatter confirmed, in front of a stunned conference hall in Zurich, that Qatar had beaten the United States, South Korea, Japan and Australia to win the rights to the 2022 tournament. What has happened since must surely cause both FIFA and Qatar itself the occasional quiver of doubt as to whether it was worth it.For years, allegations of corruption, bribery and fraud in the bidding process swirled. Few of the members of the FIFA Executive Committee who were party to the vote remain; many have been indicted or arrested. The scandal eventually brought down Blatter and his entire regime. FIFA does what it can to claim that it has changed, but its case is unconvincing. The stain remains. In truth, it may never wash out.Nor has the spotlight on Qatar been kind. If hosting the World Cup was imagined as a way to convey the country\u2019s strength to the world, it has done little to that end. Human rights groups continue to report grave abuses of migrant workers in Qatar, frequently on projects related to the World Cup.That is not to cast FIFA, or Qatar, as victims. The victims are the workers themselves, the ones who are living in appalling conditions, who are paid barely enough to survive, and who continue to die in the searing desert heat \u2014 written off as collateral damage in a power game, the cost of Qatar\u2019s obsession with soccer.Or, rather, its obsession with the tool that it hopes soccer can be. It has long seemed as if it is the theater of the World Cup \u2014 the display of wealth, the conspicuous consumption \u2014 that appeals to Qatar. The sport itself has always seemed something of an afterthought, what happened on the field somehow less important than the beauty of the stadiums.Monday\u2019s game against Iceland, in front of only 2,830 fans here in Eupen \u2014 quite a few of them wearing Aspire jackets \u2014 is a case in point. Qatar is choosing its opponents carefully, avoiding the temptation to play the game\u2019s giants. There would be little educational benefit for its players, entirely based in the Qatari Stars League, from being picked apart by France or Brazil.Instead, Qatar\u2019s Spanish coach, F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez Bas, and his players take on the likes of Iceland and Switzerland. These are teams that can teach the squad \u201cwhat it is to play at a high level, how quickly mistakes are punished,\u201d as S\u00e1nchez Bas said; teams that \u201cwere at the World Cup, that are some of the best in the world or the best in Europe,\u201d according to winger Akram Afif, one of Qatar\u2019s brightest talents.The idea is that the Qataris can learn gradually, carefully and without intense pressure what they will need to do if they are to exceed the world\u2019s (admittedly low) expectations in 2022. \u201cThe World Cup is the long-term objective,\u201d S\u00e1nchez Bas said. \u201cWe know it is there.\u201dHe prefers to focus on the short term: the Asian Cup this winter, followed by a guest spot at the Copa Am\u00e9rica next summer in Brazil. \u201cIt is all experience for 2022,\u201d he said.The results, over the last few days, have been encouraging: a win against Switzerland followed by a commendable draw with a slightly weakened Iceland. \u201cThey have improved a lot,\u201d said Erik Hamren, Iceland\u2019s Swedish coach. \u201cAnd they still have four years, and a lot of resources, to take more steps.\u201dFour years is a long time, of course: It is dozens more friendlies, each one a little more exacting than the last. It is countless training sessions. \u201cWe have every day to work, 24 hours every day,\u201d Afif said.But it is also not that long. Qatar is two-thirds of the way through its World Cup project. It is tempting to wonder if that is why so much effort has gone into the stadiums, because that is the part Qatar could indisputably control. Building a team is not something that can be done to deadline, no matter how much money is available.In a country with such a small pool of players, as Afif said, it is likely that the team that took the field against Iceland will remain at least partly in place for the tournament. \u201cIt is hard to find players of a high level,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the difference between Qatar and places like Spain.\u201dLike his coach, Afif does not see the World Cup as an immediate worry. There is no pressure on the players because of 2022, he said, no sense of urgency or panic. The clock, though, is ticking. Four years from now, all of the money Qatar has spent, all of the players it has bought for P.S.G. and all the stadiums it has built, all of the hearts and minds it has tried to win, will be forgotten. In the eyes of the world, the success or failure of its grand ambition will rest on 23 players and a coach. Four years from now, the game will start.Advertisement"}

In the process, Mr. Elias has earned a reputation as one of the most formidable election lawyers in the country, and arguably one of the most influential of unelected Democrats in Washington.That approach, however, has earned him the ire of activists who support increased transparency and decreased money in politics. They say he has been among the biggest impediments to both causes, and has often put the short-term interests of the Democratic Party ahead of the interests of the party\u2019s base, and even of American democracy more broadly.\u201cHe\u2019s doing really important work for voting rights that benefits all voters, but he\u2019s also pushed for a deregulation of money in politics that serves the interests of the wealthy,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation for the nonpartisan government watchdog group Common Cause.Yet Common Cause and other government-reform groups have consistently opposed Mr. Elias\u2019s efforts to shape campaign finance rules, through legislative maneuvering, Federal Election Commission filings and court cases, to allow his clients to raise more money with fewer restrictions.In some ways, Mr. Elias\u2019s efforts to expand big-money fund-raising and spending undermine his efforts to protect and expand voting access, said Craig Holman, an official at the government watchdog group Public Citizen.\u201cWhile he supports leveling the playing field when it comes to the right to vote, it\u2019s ironic that he opposes any legislation or policies that would level the playing field when it comes to money in politics,\u201d Mr. Holman said. \u201cMarc does not understand that in a world of unlimited and undisclosed money in politics, the Republicans generally hold a strategic advantage.\u201dRight now, though, the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership and base appear united in cheering for Mr. Elias\u2019s aggressive tactics in the Florida recount, and galvanized by Republican attacks on him.In announcing his role leading the recount efforts last week, Mr. Elias declared that \u201cwe believe that at the end of this process, Senator Nelson is going to be declared the winner.\u201dThat prompted umbrage on the right, with Governor Scott asserting it proved that Mr. Elias did not care about a fair recount, and was, in fact, \u201chere to steal this election.\u201dThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, one of Mr. Elias\u2019s clients, has gone so far as to send out summaries of the coverage of Mr. Elias\u2019s conference calls with reporters, a treatment more typically reserved for the candidates themselves.\u201cMarc is a very smart campaign finance and election lawyer, but his legal positions are usually designed to serve the best interests of his Democratic Party clients in winning elections rather than any particular legal principle,\u201d said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican election lawyer who has worked against Mr. Elias in several recounts, including in Florida.Mr. Elias did not respond to requests to be interviewed.A fast-talking native of Rockland County, N.Y., Mr. Elias, 49, joined the Washington office of Perkins Coie shortly after graduating from the Duke University Law School in 1993.He rose through the ranks to become a partner, joining with the head of the firm\u2019s political practice, Robert F. Bauer, to build Perkins Coie into the dominant Democratic firm in the lucrative election law industry.The firm has been paid nearly $80 million since 2001 by federal candidates and committees, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Those fees, which do not include the millions more paid by nonprofit groups represented by Mr. Elias, are most likely rising further with the Florida recount, in which several of his clients are active.He brought a team from Perkins Coie with him to Orlando, where its members set up a command center in the building that housed Mr. Nelson\u2019s campaign headquarters, though the team has since moved to another building. They have filed lawsuits on behalf of several clients, including the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which sued to extend the deadline for mailed-in ballots to be counted. And Mr. Elias filed suit on behalf of the Nelson campaign challenging the state\u2019s ballot signature-validation process as unconstitutional.\u201cElias is a really sharp, credible attorney,\u201d said Jon Soltz, a co-founder of VoteVets, another group that signed on to one of his lawsuits in Florida. \u201cIf you\u2019re credible and you\u2019re dangerous to the president, his playbook is to attack. So Marc Elias should wear this as a badge of honor that he\u2019s being effective.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel\u2019s Hawkish Defense Minister Resigns and Calls for Early Elections", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision by Mr. Lieberman to step down, and to withdraw his hawkish Yisrael Beiteinu party from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, will decrease the number of seats held by the government from 66 to a precarious 61 in the 120-seat Parliament.The battle to replace him could precipitate the beginning of the end of the Netanyahu government as the prime minister, whose calling card has been national security, faces increasing criticism from his right-wing rivals who say he was too quick to agree to the cease-fire.The political crisis began with a covert Israeli intelligence operation in Gaza on Sunday that went awry and spiraled into the fiercest round of fighting since the last Gaza war in the summer of 2014.It was not immediately clear who would replace Mr. Lieberman as defense minister after the resignation takes effect on Friday.Naftali Bennett, the education minister who is a member of the pro-settlement Jewish Home party and who frequently espouses bellicose positions, is demanding the defense job. Mr. Netanyahu will not be eager to give it to him, Israeli political analysts said.But a legislator from Mr. Bennett\u2019s party, Shuli Moalem-Refaeli, said that if Mr. Bennett was not appointed defense minister, then his party, Jewish Home, would also pull out of the coalition, a move that would bring down the government.Mr. Netanyahu \u2014 who is plagued by corruption investigations and facing possible bribery charges \u2014 also could take on the role, at least temporarily. But critics said he ought to quickly find an alternative since he already has a second job as the country\u2019s foreign minister. He also nominally serves as minister of health.Mr. Netanyahu held consultations on Wednesday with the remaining coalition party heads in an effort to stabilize his government.Various coalition partners \u2014 including Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud, Mr. Lieberman\u2019s ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu, and Mr. Bennett\u2019s Jewish Home \u2014 are vying for support from the same right-wing electorate.In Gaza, there were celebrations about what the Palestinians viewed as a rare victory over Israel.Many Israelis, including commentators considered close to Mr. Netanyahu and residents of the south who had been under heavy barrages of rocket fire, assailed the government for what they called a humiliating surrender after militant groups fired some 460 rockets and mortar shells from Gaza into southern Israel. Israel responded with airstrikes against 160 targets in Gaza.Explaining the timing of his resignation and appealing to his right-wing constituency, Mr. Lieberman said he considered the cease-fire to be a \u201ccapitulation to terror.\u201d He also listed a number of other recent policy decisions with which he disagreed.\u201cWhat we are doing now as a state is buying short-term quiet at the price of serious damage to national long-term security,\u201d Mr. Lieberman said.Mr. Netanyahu apparently preferred a speedy cease-fire over the alternative \u2014 a stronger and more sustained Israeli bombing campaign, the likelihood of longer-range rockets from Gaza reaching further into Israel\u2019s densely populated coastal plain and the risk of sliding into an unwanted, full-scale conflict.Just before the latest spasm of violence broke out, he said he was doing everything he could to avoid what he called an \u201cunnecessary war\u201d that would achieve little in the long run.In his announcement, Mr. Lieberman also called for early elections, saying the lack of clarity over the country\u2019s security policy must be brought to an end.\u201cI very much hope that by Sunday, negotiations between the parties will reach an agreed date for elections,\u201d he said.It takes at least three months to prepare for elections in Israel. The current government\u2019s four-year term is scheduled to run out a year from now.Despite the historical fragility of Israeli coalitions, until now Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing and religious coalition partners have not been eager to bring down the most right-wing and religious government Israel has known.Mr. Lieberman has outflanked Mr. Netanyahu from the right on the issue of national security.Mr. Netanyahu defended his acceptance of the cease-fire by saying Hamas had begged for it. He also hinted at other justifications and plans but said he could not elaborate for security reasons.\u201cI hear the voices of the residents of the south,\u201d he said, speaking at a state memorial ceremony for David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s first prime minister. \u201cBelieve me, they are precious to me, their words penetrate my heart.\u201d\u201cBut together with the heads of the security forces,\u201d he said, \u201cI see the overall picture of Israel\u2019s security, which I cannot share with the public.\u201dAvi Dichter, a former security agency chief and now the Likud head of the Knesset\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said he regretted Mr. Lieberman\u2019s resignation, adding, \u201cIn my opinion, it stems from political interests, not security ones.\u201dAbraham Diskin, professor emeritus of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that there were no good solutions for the Gaza conundrum but that \u201cmaybe the cease-fire was reached too early, before Hamas was punished more severely.\u201dMr. Lieberman entered the coalition with a history of far-reaching goals and demands, including the introduction of the death penalty for people convicted of terrorist attacks, the toppling of Hamas and the ousting of the more moderate President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.Mr. Lieberman\u2019s other disagreements with Mr. Netanyahu included the entry of Qatari-financed fuel into Gaza, which he opposed but which Mr. Netanyahu forced him to permit in order to ease a chronic electricity shortage in the Palestinian territory.Mr. Lieberman earned a reputation as a blunt talking, polarizing figure, but his party\u2019s strength has dwindled in recent opinion polls, barely scraping past the electoral threshold.He was named defense minister in May 2016, as part of a political deal augmenting Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, which had survived for a year with a razor-thin majority of one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gregg Renfrew of Beautycounter on Toxic Chemicals and Getting Fired by Messenger", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "Corner officeBefore starting the all-natural personal care business, the New York native worked for Martha Stewart and Susie Hilfiger. Supported byBeautycounter, which is privately held, has raised some $86 million from investors including the U2 frontman Bono and the private equity firm TPG, and is valued at about $400 million. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in New York. What was your childhood like? My father worked in finance. He was quite successful early on, but then fell on hard times. My mother started working to support the family, selling real estate, and also buying houses and renovating them. We moved 11 times when I was little, and it was a good learning experience for me. From a very early age I understood the value of money, how quickly it can come and go, and the need to be financially independent. I'm not driven by money to be extremely wealthy. I\u2019m driven to not have to worry about money, which is a different thing.What did you do after college?When I graduated, my mother gave me a black briefcase with my initials on it and a check for $5,000 and said: \u201cThis should be enough to get you your first and last month\u2019s payment on an apartment, and some furniture, and a suit. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d I wanted to go be a ski bum. My mom said, \u201cYou can do whatever you want to, but this is the only money you\u2019re going to get.\u201dSo I moved to New York and started at a company called Marke Communications, which was a print advertising firm. About six months in, I had racked up a large American Express bill, and I called my mom and I said, \u201cMom, I think I need some help with this Amex bill.\u201d And she said, \u201cGuess it\u2019s time to get a new job.\u201d And that was that. Click.So what did you do? Within six months I switched jobs, because I needed to make more money. I learned that Xerox Corporation had the best sales training program at the time in the country, and before long I was selling copiers in the jewelry district on the West Side of Manhattan. It was a particularly challenging district for me. I was a young woman and am Protestant, and this was a group of primarily older, Orthodox Jewish men. I had to learn them culturally before I could actually sell to them. Once I learned how to deal with these guys, then I became one of the top salespeople in the country.You eventually launched the Wedding List. What was it like working for Martha Stewart? She\u2019s an extremely demanding woman. She used to call me every single Friday at 6:01 p.m. to make sure I was still in the office. She can find the one flaw in your strategy, or in an image, and if you\u2019re not equipped to handle that conversation, if you don\u2019t have all the data, it is going to be a very long meeting.You left Martha and went to work for Susie Hilfiger at Best & Company. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working for some very strong-willed women. Any commonalities there? Businesses are successful when the business side and the creative side have good checks and balances. When one side of the business has too much power, it can be really challenging. And those two companies tipped more toward creative than the business side of it. When the creative could always trump business decisions, it made it very difficult to do my job.So what happened at Best & Company?Susie flat out fired me by messenger in front of my entire team when I was C.E.O. in the fall of 2006. The messenger came and said, \u201cAre you Gregg Renfrew?\u201d And I opened up this package, and it said: \u201cYou\u2019re fired. You\u2019re out of this building right now.\u201d I was in the middle of a meeting in front of the entire team. So that was a humbling experience.What did you learn from Martha and Susie? How did Beautycounter get going? At the same time, I was looking at where direct to consumer was going, and where I saw the biggest white space was in beauty. No one had pioneered meaningful change in that industry. It took me a couple of years to concept the idea, the selling model, create the products from scratch. I went in thinking that we could just use white-label products and change a few ingredients. That was certainly not the case.You\u2019re very focused on bringing more regulation to your own industry. That\u2019s unusual. Most people still believe that the Food and Drug Administration is protecting them in terms of personal care products. And most people believe that the products on the market are safe. But the F.D.A. is not necessarily screening ingredients for safety, which is very different from the food industry. The F.D.A. can be protective of the consumer in certain industries, but in our industry, we are woefully underregulated, and they don\u2019t have the power to recall products. And this is one area where you have bipartisan support. Everyone agrees that we need to update the laws. It\u2019s been 80 years now.So what ingredients do you use and not use? And if you look at the younger generation right now, they are very conscious of sustainability efforts. They\u2019re focused on wellness and doing right by the earth. They are keenly aware of the environmental challenges that we face. Whereas older generations may be slightly less focused on that.Beautycounter has an unusual business model, with a network of independent consultants selling products to other consumers. How do you make sure you don\u2019t come off as a pyramid scheme? Are you really optimistic about the prospect of new regulation during this administration?The Trump administration is focusing on undoing regulations. They\u2019re anti-regulation. And we are asking for regulations. That puts us at odds with the administration. That said, I think that for whatever reason \u2014 maybe because every single person has someone who is ill, maybe because it has been 80 years \u2014 there does seem to be bipartisan support for cosmetic reform.An earlier version of this article misstated Gregg Renfrew's role during her two years at Best & Company. She worked there but was not chief executive for all of that time. The article also misstated the date of the founding of Beautycounter. It was in 2011, not 2013.Advertisement"}

He previously served as the Treasury Department's financial attach\u00e9 to Mexico and Central America, and was based in Mexico City. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University, from which he also received a master\u2019s degree in international finance and a Ph.D. in international political economy.

{"Headline": "Matthew Whitaker Earned $1.2 Million From Group Backed by Undisclosed Donors", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, was paid more than $1.2 million in the past few years by a group active in conservative politics that does not reveal its donors, according to financial disclosure statements released Tuesday and other documents.The disclosure raised questions about who Mr. Whitaker\u2019s financial patrons had been before he joined the Justice Department last year and whether he might have any undisclosed conflicts of interest. And it highlighted the prominence of so-called dark money groups that pursue political agendas and employ members of both parties without being required to make public the source of their funding.The group provided the overwhelming majority of his income since at least 2016, according to the filings released Tuesday by the Justice Department.During the period covered by the filings, the next largest source of income for Mr. Whitaker, a lawyer, was $103,000 from a law firm at which he was a partner. He was also paid $15,000 by CNN, where he appeared on air as a legal analyst starting last year.Mr. Whitaker also faced new questions on Tuesday about donations to his unsuccessful 2014 campaign for a United States Senate seat in Iowa. Mr. Whitaker\u2019s campaign committee received four donations totaling $8,800 this year, a few months after he joined the Justice Department, records show.Executive branch officials are generally prohibited by a federal law, the Hatch Act, from knowingly soliciting or accepting campaign donations.As acting attorney general, Mr. Whitaker now oversees the Russia investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, raising concerns on both sides of the aisle about his willingness to allow the investigation to proceed unfettered.FACT has raised nearly $3.5 million since its inception in 2014, according to tax filings, which show that the group\u2019s largest single expense was Mr. Whitaker\u2019s salary.There is very little publicly available information about FACT\u2019s financing.DonorsTrust, a conservative foundation that allows other conservative foundations to mask their giving, provided much of FACT\u2019s seed funding \u2014 $1.1 million donated in 2014 and 2015 \u2014 but the original source of that donation is not clear.FACT applied for a general support grant in April 2016 from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a group funded by the network of conservative donors led by the industrialist brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, according to people familiar with the grant request. The people said that the request was not fulfilled.FACT is registered under a section of the tax code \u2014 501(c)3 \u2014 that allows groups to accept unlimited donations from people, corporations and unions without publicly disclosing the donors\u2019 identities.Such groups, and those registered under section 501(c)4, which allows more overt campaign activity, have played increasingly prominent roles in American politics in recent years. That has prompted concerns from transparency advocates about donors funneling money into politics to secretly finance their agendas.That should not be a concern at all when it comes to Mr. Whitaker, said his law partner of eight years, William R. Gustoff.\u201cI don\u2019t see Matt Whitaker ever playing the role of anybody\u2019s bag man or errand boy,\u201d Mr. Gustoff said. He said that Mr. Whitaker \u201cmight possibly\u201d know the identities of FACT\u2019s donors, but added that Mr. Whitaker \u201cwould do what he thinks is right regardless of whether somebody funded an activity he was involved in or not.\u201dMr. Gustoff, who serves on the board of FACT, submitted the grant request to the Koch-related group. He said FACT \u201cwas well received\u201d by Republican donors, who were eager to fund watchdog efforts.Mr. Gustoff and his law firm have been key participants in Mr. Whitaker\u2019s political and public policy efforts.Another partner at the law firm, Kendra Arnold, who has worked for the group for years, became its executive director when Mr. Whitaker left to join the Trump administration.FACT has mostly targeted Democratic politicians with complaints of wrongdoing, and its tax filings show that it paid a nearly $914,000 combined to the Republican opposition research firm America Rising and the conservative public relations shop Creative Response Concepts.But Mr. Gustoff and Ms. Arnold defended the group as nonpartisan.\u201cFACT has outed both Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Mr. Gustoff said.Ms. Arnold pointed to a complaint the group filed in 2015, during Mr. Whitaker\u2019s time at the helm, against Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, for providing a taxpayer-funded severance package to a former top aide who left the office after being accused of sexual harassment.Ms. Arnold said in a statement that the decision \u201creaffirms that no public official or organization is above the law and that harassment of any kind should not be tolerated.\u201dMr. Gustoff was also the treasurer for Mr. Whitaker\u2019s 2014 Senate campaign in Iowa. A Justice Department spokeswoman referred questions about the recent campaign donations to him.The four donations to the \u201cWhitaker for U.S. Senate\u201d committee \u2014 three of $2,600 and one of $1,000 \u2014 came within days of each other at the end of January and the second day of February, federal election records show. They were the first to be made to the account in just over two years.In addition to the Hatch Act\u2019s prohibition on political activity by most executive branch employees, a separate Justice Department memo restricts political activity by its personnel even further, in the hopes of keeping the agency as far from partisan politics as possible.Mr. Gustoff signed the campaign\u2019s filings with the federal election committee.\u201cThe donations were not solicited by me or by Matt,\u201d Mr. Gustoff said. He could not explain why they suddenly came about long after the end of the campaign.\u201cThe checks came in. I, as the treasurer, deposited the checks, and I retired the debt that I knew I could without talking to Matt,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to Matt about the campaign.\u201dA provision of the Hatch Act allows officials to raise money to retire campaign debt. Mr. Whitaker lent his campaign $50,000 in the 2014 race, and the campaign has yet to repay him for the majority of it.But the campaign\u2019s only expenditures in 2018 so far were $228 to reimburse for \u201cdata services\u201d and $500 to his old law firm for renting office space. There is no indication he sought to repay himself with the donations.\u201cThe filings make clear that his campaign committee took donations and made expenditures in 2018 after he took office,\u201d said Austin Evers, the executive director of the liberal watchdog group American Oversight, adding that the donations appear to violate the Hatch Act.Officials at the permanent Office of the Special Counsel, which polices Hatch Act violations, said that they could not comment on specific potential allegations or as to whether there are open inquiries.Three of the donors are well known in political circles in Iowa. One of them, Gary Kirke, a wealthy casino owner, donated $2,600. His business partner, Michael J. Richards, made a donation for the same amount a few days earlier, records show.During the period when Mr. Whitaker was registered as a lobbyist in Iowa, he was registered to lobby for Mr. Kirke\u2019s company.A woman who answered the phone at the firm hung up right after hearing a New York Times reporter was on the line. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to comment on anything \u2014 thank you very much,\u201d she said.Another donor, Cameron Sutton, has served on the board of the conservative Heritage Foundation. He did not respond to a call seeking comment. Leon Shearer, the fourth donor, also did not respond to a call for comment.Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Welling up rapidly from rural and forgotten France, this broad-based, citizen-driven movement is among the most serious challenges yet to President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pro-business government, say analysts, political opponents and even many of Mr. Macron\u2019s supporters.On Saturday, thousands of so-called Yellow Jackets, named for the fluorescent road-safety vests that all French drivers must carry in their vehicles, converged on Paris for a second weekend to protest a rise in fuel taxes and to express general discontent with the fiscal burden in one of the most highly taxed states in Europe, where taxes represent over 45 percent of G.D.P.The numbers had dropped sharply from the preceding week\u2019s several hundred thousand protesters; the police estimated there were about 8,000 in Paris and more than 80,000 across the country on Saturday. But this time, more were concentrated on the protesters\u2019 symbolic targets: the capital and Mr. Macron himself.\u201cWe\u2019re just fed up. It seems like to us that the government is only working to maintain its own privileges,\u201d said Mathieu Styrna, one of the thousands marching down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. A contractor, he said he had been forced to drive hundreds of miles a week for work and could no longer afford his gas bills.For the protesters, it was all about making ends meet.\u201cWhy should we have to finance their projects?\u201d Mr. Styrna said, referring to the government\u2019s plan to discourage car use through gas taxes. Many in the crowd said that they did not disdain the government\u2019s environmental goals, but that their own survival was more important.The movement appears to be without leaders, and the opposition parties in France have scrambled to keep up with it.The movement has forced itself on the government\u2019s unwilling attention with a message analysts say is not going away soon: We are in trouble.Like many at the protest, Mr. Styrna, a father of three, said he had trouble paying his bills. \u201cIt\u2019s not even by the end of the month; it\u2019s by the middle,\u201d he said, referring to point when the funds run dry. \u201cWe don\u2019t even go out any more \u2014 no cinema.\u201dJulien Viguerard, 31, who works in a biscuit factory in Toulouse, said: \u201cThe end of the month? Ha! It\u2019s the 15th for me.\u201dHe has seven children, earns 1,500 euros a month, about $1,700, and is \u201csick of being taxed on everything.\u201d The problem \u201cis low salaries,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got children to feed. We\u2019re not just imbeciles. They treat us like cattle. We can\u2019t accept it.\u201dSaturday\u2019s protesters came from all over France. Many said they had been recruited on the internet, followed no political movement and emphasized that they simply didn\u2019t have enough to live on.\u201cI don\u2019t have the means to live or to die,\u201d read the sign held up by Jennifer Hurau, who works as an online saleswoman in the Paris suburbs on a temporary contract that is soon to end. For now, she makes \u20ac1600 a month and pays \u20ac550 in rent. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I will do,\u201d she said.It is the movement\u2019s amorphousness that makes it new, powerful and potentially dangerous for Mr. Macron, analysts say.\u201cThe government parties didn\u2019t understand that their tax policies would wind up producing this,\u201d said Mr. Reyni\u00e9, the political scientist. \u201cThis is a movement that thinks the political parties are incapable of producing a solution. It is part of the chemistry of populism,\u201d he added, pointing out that the tax burden had grown by about \u20ac25 billion every year between 2002 and 2017.\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re seeing a mobilization that\u2019s coming from the social networks, and not led by the political parties or the unions,\u201d said Jean-Yves Camus, a political scientist who heads the Observatory on Political Radicalism.\u201cThis is really a populist-type movement, and it\u2019s an extremely strong protest against elite France,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a protest against tax policy that\u2019s considered confiscatory. And there\u2019s been an undeniable drop in the buying power not just of the workers, but of the middle class.\u201dThe government\u2019s response to the protest movement so far has been halting, \u201ca sort of condescension,\u201d Mr. Camus said.No high-ranking official has met with any of the self-designated spokespeople for the movement who have been appearing on French television all week. There have been a few small fiscal gestures \u2014 promises of checks and rebates \u2014 but these were dismissed by Saturday\u2019s protesters as irrelevant to their daily struggle.Mr. Macron, in a speech to some of the country\u2019s thousands of mayors this past week, did not mention the Yellow Jacket protests directly, but instead spoke in his usual finely sculpted abstractions.\u201cThe challenge that is ours is to invent a new grammar,\u201d the president said.Later, in a question-and-answer session with the mayors, the president did address the protests, obliquely, and largely to complain about them.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cThey see my face when they fill up at the gas pump.\u201dMr. Macron added: \u201cThere is a moral crisis in society. The risk is in the ambient demagogy. I\u2019m hearing the anger. But I don\u2019t want to hear it in a demagogic fashion.\u201dEven some of the president\u2019s own supporters in Parliament have expressed concern that the anger of the protesters is not being heard. Their own insurgent political movement was partly born of this anger, they said.\u201cThey\u2019re expressing a seething anger, which we know about,\u201d said Thomas Mesnier, a parliamentary deputy in Mr. Macron\u2019s party. \u201cPeople are waiting for results, and they are waiting for their daily lives to improve.\u201d\u201cThis is a movement without precedent, and we don\u2019t have a good diagnosis of it,\u201d said Nicolas D\u00e9moulin, another Macronist deputy in Parliament. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to these citizens who feel they are completely shut out of politics.\u201dThe government declined to make its spokesman available for a response to the Yellow Jackets protest. On Friday, the spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux, told French television that \u201cthe crisis is deeper than just over the price of gas,\u201d but \u201cone must never set the environmental fight up against social justice.\u201dThere was disappointment and bewilderment at Mr. Macron\u2019s response to the protests at the giant annual French mayor\u2019s convention in Paris this past week.\u201cThe response has been out of step, disconnected,\u201d said Sony Clinquart, the mayor of a small town near Dunkirk in the north.\u201cThere is a lack of intermediary between him and the population,\u201d said Isabelle Henniquau, the mayor of a town near the Swiss border. \u201cHe should explain what he is going to do.\u201dBy Saturday afternoon, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es was a battleground of overturned barricades, billowing smoke, bonfires and pushing between Yellow Jackets protesters and the police.\u201cWe\u2019re hungry and we\u2019re fed up,\u201d said Jessica Monnier, 28, who works in a watch factory in the French Alps. She earns \u20ac970 a month, and said: \u201cOnce I pay my bills, I don\u2019t have enough to eat. We\u2019re just hungry, that\u2019s all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "N.Y. Democrats Vowed to Get Big Money Out of Politics. Will Big Money Interfere?", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the months before the Nov. 6 elections, New York\u2019s Senate Democrats received $25,000 from a mysterious group of five donors, with names like 2332 7 Ave L.L.C., 207 Silver Lane L.L.C. and 228 W 132 L.L.C.The donors shared one address, at 223 West 138th Street in Manhattan \u2014 home to a real estate management firm with properties across Harlem and the rest of the city. Two more donors from the same address gave $20,000 to another Democrat: Letitia James, who was just elected New York attorney general.The law treats limited liability companies as people, allowing each to donate up to $65,100 to every statewide candidate per election cycle \u2014 far more than the $5,000 aggregate contribution limit for corporations. Firms can create multiple L.L.C.s, effectively erasing any maximum.But even as they vowed to muzzle big money\u2019s influence, they benefited from the same L.L.C. donations they were railing against. Before the 2016 election, when the Democrats\u2019 chances of regaining power seemed less certain, their campaign committee amassed $42,500 from L.L.C.s in the final weeks of the campaign. This year, amid widespread consensus that they would prevail, they took in more than $400,000 in the same period.The corporations\u2019 sudden generosity, and Democrats\u2019 acceptance of it, has raised questions about whether lawmakers will make good on their promise to overhaul New York\u2019s much-maligned campaign finance system, or whether \u2014 now that they have consolidated control of Albany\u2019s levers of power \u2014 they might prefer to bask in its perks.\u201cCynics are right to think that, O.K., people in power want to get more campaign contributions, whether they\u2019re Democrats or Republicans,\u201d said Michael Kink, the executive director of the Strong Economy for All Coalition, a group of unions and community organizations.Democrats insist that closing the loophole will be one of their first priorities in the new year. They have proposed holding L.L.C.s to the same limit as corporations, and to count any donations funneled through them toward each stakeholder\u2019s individual limits.By all appearances, the proposal should sail through. The Democrat-dominated Assembly has voted to close the loophole for years. Mr. Cuomo has said he supports ending it.But, as always in politics, there is rhetoric and there is reality.Several people involved with the real estate industry\u2019s political giving said they did not expect the newly Democratic Albany to be entirely hostile to their overtures. Mr. Cuomo has suggested that the Assembly may become less enthusiastic about passing ethics reform without the Senate standing by to squash it.\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that it\u2019s a manipulation, but when you know something\u2019s not going to happen anyway, it\u2019s easier to be supportive of it,\u201d the governor said in a recent radio interview.The same, of course, could be said of Mr. Cuomo. For years, he has professed support for closing the loophole; for years, he blamed Republicans for the effort\u2019s downfall. In the meantime, he has raised far more through L.L.C.s than the entire Senate Republican conference. In 2018 alone, L.L.C.s gave Mr. Cuomo more than $1.9 million.Democratics denied that their new position in the majority would push the loophole down their agenda.\u201cMany Democrats have run on the issue,\u201d said Senator Brian P. Kavanagh, a Democrat who has sponsored several unsuccessful bills to close the loophole. \u201cWe won, and now we\u2019re going to do it.\u201dHe dismissed the benefits that Democrats had accrued from the loophole in the past. \u201cFor better or for worse, people campaign under the laws as they are when they\u2019re running,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a consensus among Democrats that we should change this law.\u201dMr. Kink was also optimistic about the prospect of reform, adding that heightened voter attention to money in politics could be enough to dissuade lawmakers from reneging on their promises. Democrats especially, with their New York City base, could be wary of getting too cozy with the real estate interests most associated with the loophole, he said.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bunch of lawmakers that might or might not care about abstract campaign finance or good government rules,\u201d Mr. Kink said, \u201cbut they understand that taking care of tenants is really important to their political survival.\u201dIf the Democrats close the L.L.C. loophole and carry out other changes they have backed, including a statewide small-donor matching funds program, New York\u2019s campaign finance laws could go from the nation\u2019s most lax to its most robust, said Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Democracy Program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. No other state has a similar active matching program.The timing of reform may prove pivotal to what is sure to be one of next year\u2019s biggest legislative fights: renegotiation of the state\u2019s rent laws, which are set to expire in June. If Democrats close the L.L.C. loophole early, developers may lose one powerful means for making their voices heard.In the past, real estate groups used L.L.C.s to deluge upstate Republicans, knowing that their constituents would be less likely to care about the industry\u2019s long shadow, according to Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a government reform group.But those involved with the real estate industry said its power brokers did not seem concerned about the prospect of the loophole\u2019s demise. In fact, they cheered it: Tighter restrictions could save firms from having to spend so lavishly on candidates.And they noted that moneyed interests would always find a way to exert influence \u2014 if not through the loophole, then elsewhere, such as through unlimited independent expenditure spending.Indeed, New York\u2019s campaign finance problems run far deeper than the L.L.C. loophole. The state ranks second to last in the nation in the percentage of candidates\u2019 money that comes from small donors, said Michael Malbin, the head of the Washington-based Campaign Finance Institute.\u201cI don\u2019t think the State Legislature should be patting itself on the back\u201d for closing the loophole, Mr. Norden said. \u201cWithout more, it\u2019s not going to mean much in terms of changing the role of big money in New York State politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Democratic Control of the House Could Mean for Your Wallet", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA change in control will block renewed tax-cut initiatives, but there may be room for accord on drug pricing and even stimulus, if the recovery falters.The Democrats\u2019 success in winning back control of the House comes after an election in which economic issues were often overshadowed. Still, the change on Capitol Hill will make a difference on some spending priorities and tax policy.House Democrats are in a position to block Republicans from extending the temporary tax cuts and provisions enacted last year, and from giving further breaks to businesses. President Trump even talked at his Wednesday news conference about working with Democrats to raise business taxes to pay for a middle-class tax cut. Teaming up to rebuild infrastructure is another possibility, the president said.Prospects for agreement, though, are still sketchy. Republicans and Democrats \u201ccan have overlapping positions,\u201d said William G. Gale, co-director of the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington. \u201cBut any compromise requires trust, and I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any trust available right now.\u201dIn any case, the larger economic story line of the year ahead is unlikely to be shaped by initiatives from Capitol Hill. The economy is strong, but growth is still expected to slow in 2019 as the extra juice injected through the tax cuts fades. Trade tensions are not going away. The jobless rate, already circling near a half-century low, will probably inch down even more. Swoops in the stock market will continue to be unpredictable, and anxieties about global growth remain. Moreover, as Janice Mays, managing director in the accounting firm PwC\u2019s Washington National Tax Services, said: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have the same president.\u201dWith control of only one chamber, and an antagonist in the White House, the Democrats won\u2019t be able to push through initiatives on their own. Instead, they are likely to highlight their priorities for the future by passing a lot of bills \u2014 think of them more as billboards, designed to shape an agenda and deliver a message. An increase in the minimum wage, an expansion of health care coverage, and an infrastructure build-a-thon are obvious candidates. Democrats will be able to block efforts to trim safety net programs like food stamps and Medicaid. They are also likely to focus on investigating the administration. But prospects of any major legislative efforts look doubtful. Consider that a major tax overhaul was passed during the current congressional session, but much of the rest of the Republicans\u2019 legislative agenda stalled despite their control of both houses. Raising taxes would be a repudiation of the agenda of House Republicans. They laid out a plan in September to make permanent most of the temporary cuts and provisions for individuals and small businesses enacted last year. The parties could also find common ground on increased tax incentives for retirement savings. And there is a long list of technical fixes and extensions on Congress\u2019s to-do list. You may remember that for the blink of an eye last year, it seemed that the Democratic leadership in Congress might make a deal with Mr. Trump to tie tax reform to a proposal to repair roads, bridges, waterways and airports. Infrastructure has often been hospitable ground for bipartisan initiatives. Mr. Trump has always been enthusiastic about building on a grand scale, and in many ways, the Democrats are more willing partners than Republicans, who have consistently objected to the kind of spending required. Mr. Trump noted the potential on Wednesday, saying, \u201cWe have a lot of things in common on infrastructure.\u201d The Democrats have put together a trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal aimed at everything from broadband to waterways.Nor is the atmosphere in Washington particularly conducive to cross-the-aisle collaboration. And Democrats may think twice about giving the president a victory before the 2020 election.A significant slowdown in the economy could always change that calculus. With the effects of the stimulus fading, Mr. Trump has stepped up complaints that the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates will slow the economy. \u201cIf somebody offers him the opportunity to offset that with a spending bill, he would sign it, with no regard for the deficit,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington who was an adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Restricting the president\u2019s power on trade would require the approval of the House and a 60-vote majority in the Senate. That is unlikely. The Democrats have traditionally been less enamored with free trade than Republicans. (Their views, however, may evolve as the Republican Party under Mr. Trump continues its shift from free-trade orthodoxy to protectionist measures.)Congress will have the chance to weigh in on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement has incorporated a number of provisions \u2014 like higher pay for autoworkers \u2014 that render it somewhat more palatable for the Democrats, Ms. Mays of PwC said. But the accord could come up for a vote before the Democrats take control, heading off any push by House Democrats for a tougher deal. There are two issues that Congress must confront next year: the debt ceiling and the legally mandated limits on spending approved annually by Congress. Failure to address the budget limits could prompt deep spending cuts and a partial government shutdown. And without an accord on the debt ceiling, the government would default on its payments and risk injuring its credit rating and causing a global panic. After President Barack Obama signed a bill requiring across-the-board spending cuts if the budget exceeded set limits, Republicans and Democrats in Congress have patched together compromise budgets and agreed to raise the spending caps. In general, the deals have involved Republican agreement to greater spending on domestic programs and Democratic acceptance of bigger defense budgets. That has meant larger deficits.\u201cBoth parties seem to care about the deficit when they\u2019re out of the power, but not so much when they\u2019re in power,\u201d said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Since a shutdown can tar both parties, Democrats and Republicans are likely to strike some deal. \u201cThey\u2019ll lurch from deadline to deadline and do the minimum to get by,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the president of the conservative American Action Forum.The wild card is Mr. Trump. The president has said that \u201cI would have no problem doing a shutdown\u201d to force Congress to fund a wall along the Mexican border. He may have even less of a problem with it if he could more easily blame the Democrats.\u201cA shutdown is always a possibility, and the wall would mostly likely be the reason for that,\u201d Mr. Lazio of Alliantgroup said. \u201cBut Senate Republicans are less likely to barrel into a confrontation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
