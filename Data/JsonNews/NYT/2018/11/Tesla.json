{"Headline": "Menial Tasks, Slurs and Swastikas: Many Black Workers at Tesla Say They Faced Racism", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "African-American workers have reported threats, humiliation and barriers to promotion at the plant. The automaker says there is no pattern of bias.Supported byFREMONT, Calif. \u2014 Owen Diaz had seen swastikas in the bathrooms at Tesla\u2019s electric-car plant, and he had tried to ignore racist taunts around the factory.\u201cYou hear, \u2018Hey, boy, come here,\u2019 \u2018N-i-g-g-e-r,\u2019 you know, all this,\u201d said Mr. Diaz, who is African-American. Then, a few hours into his shift running the elevators, he noticed a drawing on a bale of cardboard. It had an oversize mouth, big eyes and a bone stuck in the patch of hair scribbled over a long face, with \u201cBooo\u201d written underneath.On that winter night in the factory, when, he said, a supervisor admitted drawing the figure as a joke, Mr. Diaz had had enough. He typed a complaint to a Tesla manager on his phone. \u201cRacist effigy & drawing\u201d was the subject.\u201cWhen you really just look at it, you ask yourself at some point, \u2018Where is my line?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Diaz, 50, who worked at the factory as a contractor for 11 months before he quit in May 2016.It is a line that others say they reached, too.Interviews, internal communications and sworn legal statements filed by more than two dozen current or former Tesla employees and contractors describe a wide range of concerns among some African-American workers at the factory in Fremont, including threats by co-workers, demeaning assignments and barriers to advancement. Three lawsuits by former workers accusing Tesla of failing to curb racial discrimination and harassment have been filed since early last year, including one by Mr. Diaz awaiting trial.Tesla rejects the workplace portrait painted in the complaints as inaccurate, saying there is no evidence to support \u201ca pattern of discrimination and harassment.\u201d It is not the only automaker to face allegations of racism in recent years, and it acknowledges that \u201cin a company the size of a small city, there will at times be claims of bad behavior,\u201d real or false. But it said there was no indication that the factory had an unusual rate of complaints.\u201cWe strive to provide a respectful work environment for all employees and do our best to prevent bad conduct,\u201d the company said. African-American employees at various levels of authority, made available by Tesla, said their own experiences had been positive.Crystal Spates, a production manager overseeing 500 people building the Model 3, said racial slurs were not tolerated at the factory. \u201cI have never heard, myself, anyone use that terminology,\u201d said Ms. Spates, 30, who is African-American and joined Tesla two years ago.Mr. Diaz, like Tesla itself, likened the plant to a small city \u2014 one in which experiences can vary, he said. \u201cYou know, you can have something that happens in one part of the city that doesn\u2019t happen in another part,\u201d he said. But when his son encountered racial slurs and caricatures in a different part of the factory, Mr. Diaz concluded that the issue was not an isolated one.One suit accusing Tesla of racial discrimination and harassment, filed last November in California Superior Court, seeks class-action status. The lawyers involved \u2014 Lawrence A. Organ and Bryan Schwartz, whose practices focus on workplace rights \u2014 say they have identified dozens of potential plaintiffs. Each lawyer has won multimillion-dollar judgments in other harassment or discrimination cases against major employers. Tesla is seeking to move the case into arbitration, which would require workers to bring individual lawsuits rather than a joint claim.The state\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing says it has issued 10 \u201cright to sue\u201d letters \u2014 a precondition for a discrimination lawsuit \u2014 to employees complaining of racial bias at the Fremont plant. Dozens of other complaints against Tesla are pending, but the agency would not say how many involved race.In an email to employees last year, which the company later released in response to one of the lawsuits, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, warned against \u201cbeing a huge jerk\u201d to members of \u201ca historically less represented group.\u201d At the same time, he wrote, \u201cif someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology.\u201dBut by many accounts, the issues at the Tesla factory go beyond the need for a thick skin.In any case, some African-American workers who expected to help build a future for the company and themselves, like Teshawna Stewart, say the reality proved to be a slap in the face.Before starting at Tesla last year, Ms. Stewart, 25, sorted and packed orders at a nearby Amazon warehouse.The job she landed installing taillights at the Tesla factory paid several dollars an hour more. But she discovered a downside when she was assigned to \u201cthe brick,\u201d the production area for Model 3 sedans.During several weeks when the Model 3 production line was not yet operating, Ms. Stewart said, she was frequently assigned to menial tasks, while workers of other races did work like sorting components.In a sworn statement for a lawsuit, she said that when she had complained about \u201cAfrican-American employees being required to get down on our hands and knees and scrub the floor,\u201d a human resources representative told her that she was \u201cmaking up stories.\u201dTesla said Ms. Stewart \u201cdid not raise these types of claims during her employment.\u201d Ms. Spates, the production manager, said assembly workers were expected to handle other tasks if production was interrupted, but \u201cnothing in terms of \u2018get on your hands and knees.\u2019\u201d She does not recall working with Ms. Stewart.In May, Ms. Stewart was fired for \u201cjob abandonment,\u201d she said, after her team was assigned to a job in San Francisco for the day to help prepare cars for shipment to China. Tesla said she had been fired because she failed to return to the factory and had been given written warnings about her attendance. She said she had returned with the other workers, who were not African-American, and was the only one fired.Like Ms. Stewart, Nigel Jones arrived at Tesla with high hopes. He was fresh out of the Army when he started as a temporary battery technician at Tesla in September 2015. Mr. Jones, now 26, quickly found the kind of rapid professional mobility often out of reach without a college degree. In about 22 months, he went from being an $18-an-hour contractor to making $85,000 a year as a mobile-equipment supervisor.Then, on a busy afternoon in January during the ramp-up of Model 3 production, Mr. Jones said, he stopped to help two other African-American workers set up a water cart. A new manager questioned the group, and after Mr. Jones assured him that he had everything \u201cunder control,\u201d the manager turned and muttered a vulgar racial epithet within 10 feet of the group, Mr. Jones recalled. His recollection was affirmed by a current employee who said he had witnessed it; he asked not to be identified.Though he tried to \u201clet that go,\u201d Mr. Jones soon put a post on Facebook about growing tired of \u201csubtle racial discrimination\u201d at work. His mother said Mr. Jones had also told her about the incident two to three weeks later, shortly before he was fired.Tesla said Mr. Jones had been \u201creprimanded numerous times for attendance and safety violations\u201d and given a \u201cfinal written warning\u201d before being fired for attendance problems.Mr. Jones denied having had attendance problems, attributing that account to the manager with whom he tangled. He looks back with regret that the prospect of a bright future didn\u2019t pan out.\u201cTesla, it is a cool company,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cYou sit there and you\u2019re like, \u2018This can\u2019t be happening here.\u2019\u201dDeWitt Lambert, an African-American electrician, was not quite 40 when he left home in Mobile, Ala., in 2012 and drove to California in search of a job. Tesla hired him in June 2015 as a production associate, mostly installing seatbelts.Soon, he said, he encountered co-workers mocking his Southern drawl. He started to wear headphones to drown them out, but when the occasional taunts turned to frequent racial slurs, he said, they were hard to ignore.The company granted his request to change stations, but his tormentors started lingering near his new spot, he told officials, and he worried that they \u201care going to do something to me.\u201dBetween June 2016 and February 2017, Mr. Lambert sent at least a dozen text messages, emails, photos and videos to human resources, copies show.The evidence sent by Mr. Lambert included a 58-second cellphone video, punctuated by repeated racial slurs, in which an unidentified narrator walking the factory floor says it\u2019s \u201cDeWitt\u2019s\u201d phone and threatens to \u201ccut you up \u2026 so everybody can have a piece of you, nigger.\u201d He said it had been recorded by co-workers who took his phone and meant it as a threat.Feeling that he had a potential civil rights claim, he consulted a lawyer about legal options, and filed a complaint with the state fair-employment agency.Tesla\u2019s general counsel, Todd Maron, wrote in March 2017 with an offer to settle.\u201cWe are willing to pay Mr. Lambert $100,000, but only if we are to resolve this matter before there is media attention,\u201d Mr. Maron wrote in an email provided by Mr. Lambert\u2019s lawyer.Attached was a four-page document outlining information the company had collected to undermine Mr. Lambert\u2019s claims. \u201cOur C.E.O., Elon Musk, has reviewed this case personally and notwithstanding everything that\u2019s in the attached document, he is sorry that this case did not get escalated much sooner and he agrees that change is needed,\u201d the email stated.Mr. Lambert, who declined the settlement offer in favor of a chance to take the claim to trial and argue for higher damages, was put on paid administrative leave.In June, after Tesla succeeded in moving the case to arbitration, Mr. Lambert received a letter terminating his employment, saying the company had discovered acts \u201cinconsistent with Tesla\u2019s values.\u201d Tesla said Mr. Lambert himself had been involved in \u201cinstigating use of the \u2018N-word.\u2019\u201d He conceded that he had used the epithet at times, but only with other African-Americans.After Tesla moved to bring the case to a close, an arbitrator issued a preliminary ruling saying it merited fuller consideration.\u201cI feel like everything was taken away from me,\u201d said Mr. Lambert, who is living at his mother\u2019s house back in Alabama. \u201cI got everything snatched from up under me since I complained about it.\u201dWithin about 90 days after starting at Tesla as a contract production associate, he became a full-time employee and saw his pay steadily climb from $17 to $21 an hour.Mr. Jones (no relation to Nigel Jones) said he had then started to notice that black workers weren\u2019t being promoted. In one case, he said, a manufacturing official told him that \u201cpeople like you\u201d didn\u2019t move up to lead positions. He also reported that he had heard a supervisor say of black employees that \u201cthere\u2019s too many of them in there, they are not Tesla material,\u201d and that he had been at a meeting where a supervisor, gesturing toward African-American workers, remarked that \u201cmonkeys work outside.\u201dTesla said there was no record of a formal complaint from Mr. Jones about racial insults.The company also denied that there was any inequity in its career development practices. \u201cYou do a great job, you make your way here,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of diversity and inclusion, Felicia Mayo, who is African-American. After a year at the company, she was recently made a vice president.Clarence Johnson, who came to Tesla four and a half years ago as a forklift driver and now tests equipment on a safety team \u2014 his second promotion \u2014 said his experience reflected opportunity.While he said he could not speak for others, he added, \u201cI\u2019m an African-American male, and I didn\u2019t have any of those roadblocks.\u201dLike Ms. Spates, he said supervisors would not tolerate racial slurs \u2014 though he said the use of a racial epithet \u201cwhere it\u2019s two people referring to one another as friends\u201d was common.For Mr. Jones, the route was not up but out. He said his children and a psychologist he had started seeing persuaded him to go back to truck driving.\u201cEverybody has a breaking point,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m able to breathe now.\u201dIf Nummi represented the auto industry\u2019s past, Owen Diaz was sure that Tesla was the future.But that was before the racist effigy on the cardboard bale, and the slurs and offensive graffiti that came earlier. He said he had ultimately found the environment so degrading that he struggled to get out of bed for work.As for the graffiti, Tesla said that Mr. Diaz brought \u201ca single drawing to the attention of his supervisor\u201d and that it \u201cwas promptly and thoroughly investigated.\u201d It said a contractor involved had been given a warning and suspended without pay.Despite what he said he had experienced, Mr. Diaz was eager to give his youngest son, Demetric, a chance at the company\u2019s pay and stock options. So he recruited him as a fellow contractor in 2015, working in a different production area.The first weeks were fine for Demetric, now 23. But he started to notice incidents that disturbed him.\u201cI started telling him like, \u2018Hey, well, I seen this, Dad,\u201d Demetric said. \u201cWhen I was in the bathroom,\u201d he said, he saw vulgar graffiti that included a racial slur.The younger Mr. Diaz complained to his staffing firm and then to a Tesla supervisor about racial abuse, protesting that the supervisor was \u201ccalling me an N-word every day,\u201d according to a lawsuit. The suit says that within days, he was given a written warning of misconduct and was shortly out of a job. Tesla said he had been let go after repeated warnings about failing to wear protective clothing.His father hung on for a few more months. Then he quit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alan Greenspan\u2019s Ode to Creative Destruction", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.At age 92, Alan Greenspan remains a towering figure in American finance. He was the second-longest serving chairman of the Federal Reserve (after William McChesney Martin). Dubbed a \u201crock star\u201d by The Economist, Greenspan achieved an unprecedented level of celebrity for a Fed chairman as stocks soared to record levels in the 1990s, and then notoriety, as his legacy was undermined by the Great Recession that began in 2008, less than two years after he left office.Greenspan was appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1987 and reappointed by three successive presidents from both parties. That a lifelong champion of free markets and an early acolyte of the objectivist author and philosopher Ayn Rand could so successfully straddle the political spectrum for so long is a testament to the bipartisan free-market ideology that followed the end of the Cold War. At the time it all seemed like the ultimate triumph of democratic capitalism.Now, 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers provoked a global financial panic and led to what Greenspan refers to as \u201cthe great stagnation,\u201d the self-congratulation seems to have been premature. Both parties have largely repudiated Greenspan\u2019s precepts, with Republicans lurching toward protectionism and a nativist hostility for globalization and Democrats lurching toward something he would surely find equally repugnant: income redistribution, ever-expanding government entitlements and identity politics.Less a conventional history than an extended polemic, \u201cCapitalism in America: A History,\u201d by Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, a columnist and editor for The Economist, explores and ultimately celebrates the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s concept of \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d which the authors describe as a \u201cperennial gale\u201d that \u201cuproots businesses \u2014 and lives \u2014 but that, in the process, creates a more productive economy.\u201d While this approach risks oversimplifying centuries of American economic history, it provides a useful lens for analyzing America\u2019s current polarization and for understanding the centrifugal forces that have given rise to a President Trump, on the right, or a Bernie Sanders on the left.Other than a few paragraphs arguing the case that the Fed\u2019s easy money policy had little to no impact on the housing bubble that led to the Great Recession, \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d has almost nothing to say about Greenspan\u2019s own role in recent economic history, and he offers no defense of his tenure as Fed chairman.But that isn\u2019t his purpose here. \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d is Greenspan and Wooldridge\u2019s plea to re-embrace America\u2019s long-held capitalist traditions and entrepreneurial culture in order to rescue the country from its current \u201cfading dynamism.\u201dWhile \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d begins with the colonial era, when Americans were already enjoying \u201cthe world\u2019s fastest growth rate,\u201d Greenspan and Wooldridge hit their narrative stride and ideological sweet spot when they reach the late-19th-century \u201cAge of Giants,\u201d a name they prefer to the prevailing \u201cRobber Barons,\u201d who may have been rich but, as self-made men, were neither robbers nor hereditary barons.In the authors\u2019 approving view, men like the banker John Pierpont Morgan, the oil baron John D. Rockefeller and the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, all born within a few years of one another in the 1830s, were \u201cgiants of energy and ambition\u201d who \u201cexercised more power than anybody other than kings or generals had exercised before.\u201d These men (and they were all men) are \u201cheroes of creative destruction\u201d because they \u201chelped to produce a massive improvement in living standards for all.\u201dThat they also produced social and economic upheaval for many is a small price to pay, the authors contend. The rise of their great corporations, not to mention the industries they helped build and finance, from railroads to autos to retail chains like Sears, Roebuck, displaced millions of workers and small-business owners who were rendered obsolete. Cyrus McCormack\u2019s threshing machine displaced a quarter of the world\u2019s agricultural workers. \u201cPeople seldom achieve great things without being willing to ride roughshod over the opposition,\u201d the authors note.Not surprisingly, these \u201cgiants\u201d attracted popular hostility and resentment \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt called them \u201cmalefactors of great wealth.\u201d Their success and attendant wealth unleashed a populist backlash. Williams Jennings Bryan campaigned against Wall Street and its \u201ccross of gold.\u201d Congress passed the first antitrust laws. The first federal income tax paved the way to income redistribution.History\u2019s harsh judgment of the era (which culminated in the 1929 stock market crash and ensuing Great Depression) suggests why creative destruction has had trouble gaining much of a following. Like the Robber Barons, today\u2019s drivers of creative destruction, technology and internet entrepreneurs, \u201care seldom the easiest of heroes, nor the nicest,\u201d the authors note. \u201cThey will sacrifice anything, from their own peace of mind to the lives of those around them, to build a business empire and then protect that business empire from destruction.\u201d Such people are prone \u201cto what the Norwegians call Stormannsgalskap, or the \u2018madness of great men.\u2019\u201d Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, who merits several approving mentions, comes to mind. The disruptive forces they unleash generate \u201cunease: the fiercer the gale the greater the unease.\u201dAnd not all destruction, it should be said, is creative. In a nod to the exotic derivatives and mortgage-backed securities that led to the Great Recession (and went largely undetected by Greenspan\u2019s Fed), Greenspan and Wooldridge acknowledge that \u201ccreative destruction can sometimes be all destruction and no creation.\u201dThe popular reaction is typically a well-intentioned but misguided effort to preserve the status quo. \u201cPeople link arms to protect threatened jobs and save dying industries. They denounce capitalists for their ruthless greed. The result is stagnation: In trying to tame the creative destruction, for example by preserving jobs or keeping factories open, they end up killing it,\u201d the authors contend.In their view, America today is already well along that path to stagnation. \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d barely mentions Trump beyond condemning his \u201cdangerous\u201d trade policies and warning about the fiscal recklessness of his tax cuts. But the entire book is an indictment of Trump\u2019s stands on immigration and protectionism and his attempts to resurrect fading mining and industrial concerns \u2014 attempts that, as \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d shows repeatedly, are almost surely doomed.At the same time, Greenspan\u2019s admiration for the rugged individualists who populate the novels of Ayn Rand (who merits a nod in this history) and the frontier spirit that animated America\u2019s early development shows no sign of weakening as Greenspan has aged. He and Wooldridge lament that Americans are \u201closing the rugged pioneering spirit\u201d that once defined them and mock the \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d and \u201csafe spaces\u201d that now obsess academia.The authors quote Winston Churchill: \u201cWe have not journeyed across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.\u201d But now, they conclude, \u201csugar candy people are everywhere.\u201dTheir prescription for American renewal \u2014 reining in entitlements, instituting fiscal responsibility and limited government, deregulating, focusing on education and opportunity, and above all fostering a fierceness in the face of creative destruction \u2014 was Republican orthodoxy not so long ago. Before the Great Recession it was embraced by most Democrats as well, and more recently by President Bill Clinton, the recipient of glowing praise in these pages.No longer. \u201cCapitalism in America,\u201d in both its interpretation of economic history and its recipe for revival, is likely to offend the dominant Trump wing of the Republican Party and the resurgent left among Democrats. It\u2019s not clear who, if anyone, will pick up the Greenspan torch.America is now \u201ctrapped in an iron cage of its own making,\u201d the authors contend. But \u201cwe have shown that America has all the keys that it needs to open the cage. The great question is whether it has the political will to turn them.\u201dJames B.

{"Headline": "What Tesla\u2019s \u2018Delivery Logistics Hell\u2019 Is Like for Model 3 Buyers", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJim Fyfe knows what Mr. Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, was talking about.A 44-year-old technology specialist at a bank in Jacksonville, Fla., Mr. Fyfe paid a $2,500 deposit in June to order a black Performance version of the Model 3 priced at $70,000.He was given a delivery date in early September, but when he went to collect the car, he was told that it was still in California, Mr. Fyfe recalled. Two weeks later, with no update, Mr. Fyfe called the delivery center and was given bad news: His Model 3 had been involved in an accident in transit.Days later, Mr. Fyfe asked for his money back, but quickly received an email saying Tesla had another car for him. Delivery was set for Oct. 27, but as Mr. Fyfe was heading to the rendezvous, his phone rang. A Tesla sales representative said this second car was no longer available because it, too, had been in an accident. A Tesla spokeswoman said that was a mistaken reference to the original car.Two false starts were Mr. Fyfe\u2019s limit. \u201cIf they had been straight up with me, I probably wouldn\u2019t have canceled,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost all faith in Tesla. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever buy a Tesla.\u201d He recently received a refund of his deposit.Despite the good news, Tesla still faces many challenges. The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining past claims about production goals. The commission, in rejecting a request by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act for a transcript of Mr. Musk\u2019s deposition in the case, said its release could interfere with \u201cactive and ongoing\u201d investigations related to Tesla.On Thursday, Mr. Musk said in a message on Twitter that the company had \u201cacquired trucking capacity\u201d that would allow it to deliver Model 3 sedans ordered by the end of November by the end of the year in the United States.Tesla may also be facing a new customer-satisfaction issue reflected in the experience of Mr. Fyfe. Tesla\u2019s owner forums show that other consumers have encountered similar problems.Dealers for established automakers rarely see damage to the cars trucked to their showrooms.Doug Waikem, owner of seven dealerships in Massillon, Ohio, said he had hardly ever received a car too damaged to sell. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare.\u201d Occasionally, his dealerships have to touch up paint on cars. More serious repairs are disclosed to shoppers before they buy, he said.The Tesla spokeswoman declined to say how often the company\u2019s cars are damaged in transit.While working on these issues, Tesla is still moving ahead with plans to produce a new roadster, a semitrailer truck, a pickup truck and a small sport utility vehicle in the next few years. On top of that, Mr. Musk intends to build a giant car-and-battery factory in China.Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst, said the delivery problems reflected the downsides of Tesla\u2019s effort to build each car to match a specific order, and its use of its own delivery centers that were not designed to hold stocks of cars. Tesla has 104 delivery centers in the United States. BMW, by comparison, has more than 300 American dealers.\u201cTesla had a huge volume push in the third quarter, and they probably could have avoided a lot of this if they had traditional dealers,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said.Clearly, many Tesla customers are thrilled with their cars. Zachary Pernikliyski, a bartender at a Chicago hotel, took delivery of a Model 3 in June with no problems and is exhilarated by the ride. \u201cThe joy is like having sex,\u201d he said.Tesla\u2019s spokeswoman said that of the customers who bought cars in the last two and a half months, 90 percent said they would recommend Tesla after experiencing its delivery process.But even some customers who love their cars have had unhappy delivery experiences. Russell Rabadeau, an investment adviser in Westfield, N.J., ordered a metallic-silver, all-wheel-drive Model 3 with the longest-lasting battery Tesla offers. His delivery date was supposed to be Sept. 25. The day before, looking forward to his new car, he sold the BMW 328 he was driving.Two hours before he was to pick up the Model 3, Mr. Rabadeau got a phone call. A Tesla delivery associate said his delivery center didn\u2019t have a silver car for him, and probably wouldn\u2019t have one until mid-October. \u201cThat was frustrating because nobody called me to let me know sooner,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no communication.\u201dAfter walking to work for two weeks, he checked on the status of his car. Tesla had one \u2014 but it was still at the plant in Fremont, Calif. Tesla rented a Cadillac for him to drive in the meantime. He finally got his Model 3 on Oct. 26. \u201cIt\u2019s very fun to drive, great pickup,\u201d Mr. Rabadeau said.Mr. Musk acknowledged that Tesla was having serious problems when he referred to \u201cdelivery logistics hell\u201d in a Twitter post on Sept. 16. At the time, Tesla was scrambling to sell and deliver as many Model 3 sedans as it could, to help turn a profit in the third quarter. The chief executive also asked current customers to help out at delivery centers to ease the load on Tesla\u2019s staff.Jonathan Berent, a technology executive in California, recounted a particularly frustrating episode. He paid a $1,000 deposit in 2016 to reserve the right to order a Model 3, then $2,500 this year as a further deposit on a Performance version. In early September, he was told that his car was at a delivery center near Tesla\u2019s Fremont plant, and he headed there with a cashier\u2019s check for the balance. When he arrived, a sales representative showed him the car, and gave him his vehicle identification number.\u201cI thought, finally, it\u2019s here,\u201d Mr. Berent said. \u201cI\u2019d been waiting two years for this car.\u201dWhile his Model 3 was being detailed, however, a salesman said there had been a mix-up. The car Mr. Berent had just sat in was actually assigned to another customer, also named Jonathan. After a considerable wait, the salesman found another car in an inventory lot about an hour\u2019s drive away, Mr. Berent recalled. When the car arrived, it had paint defects that had to be repaired, and he went home.By then, some friends had told him about problems with their Teslas. Mr. Berent considered the paint issue with the car he was assigned, and the delivery frustrations, and decided to cancel his order.\u201cI didn\u2019t want a car that might not work,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no way I was taking that car.\u201dNevertheless, he was contacted repeatedly over the next two weeks by Tesla sales representatives who said they had a car ready for him. One woman phoned and offered to deliver the car within eight hours, to his home or even to a coffee shop if he preferred, Mr. Berent said.He declined the offers, and is awaiting a refund. \u201cIf you\u2019re buying an $85,000 car, it should be a great experience,\u201d he said.Tesla said it had no record of Mr. Berent\u2019s canceling his order.Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Real Estate Technology: Try, Try Again", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "Stackable apartments. Robotic valets. Infrared spas. The future has arrived, haltingly, and this time will be different. Maybe.Supported byPerhaps the most prescient scene in the futuristic 1960s cartoon \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d was when George, the eager technophile, had to run as fast as he could to stay on a newfangled treadmill gone haywire.It\u2019s an apt metaphor for some technology today, particularly in the real estate industry, which is quick to jump on the newest disruptive innovation, but often ends up with the next Bluetooth-enabled toaster instead. Is any of it really necessary? Maybe.There are real changes taking place that could have a lasting effect on housing \u2014 from land use and affordability to the fancy amenities that influence how and where we live.Some of the best tech, the kind with staying power, has been percolating for years, often after failing miserably at first. It persists because there are no perfect solutions to the problems it is attempting to solve, but there is always hope that someday someone might get it right. Among the innovations currently worth taking seriously: modular housing that can be built faster and cheaper than traditional construction; robotic parking systems that move cars safely and efficiently; signal-boosting devices that allow cellphone reception in high-rise towers; and luxury amenities like infrared saunas. Roger Krulak, the chief executive of Full Stack Modular, likes to point out that with conventional building methods \u201calmost every construction project is past deadline and over budget.\u201d And he asks: \u201cWhat other industry could survive that?\u201d15 PhotosThe solution, he said, is off-site construction, in which factory-made steel modules \u2014 outfitted with electrical and plumbing systems, high-end finishes and even elaborate facades \u2014 can be stacked on site, like Legos, in about 70 percent of the time it would take for conventional builders to complete a high-rise tower, and with considerably less waste. Plus, since the manufacturing is done indoors, weather delays and safety concerns are reduced.Part of the technology\u2019s appeal is that it is less reliant on highly skilled workers. Using technology from the aerospace industry, a robotic camera in Full Stack\u2019s 85,000-square-foot factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard can measure within two-thousandths of an inch, while most contractors might settle for a two-inch margin. During on-site assembly, the company deploys a drone camera that uses photogrammetry, a series of precise surveying-image measurements, to ensure the modules are correctly stacked.\u201cIt was a mess,\u201d said Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development, adding that the tower was too big and complex for a prefab construction project. Mr. Krulak, who also worked on it, admitted there were miscues in the process.But the city remains interested in modular construction and hopes to use it for affordable housing. The department of Housing Preservation and Development is expected to announce a deal with a subsidiary of Radson Development to build an 80-unit, 10-story modular rental tower in Far Rockaway, Queens, where all of the units will be reserved for those making no more than 70 percent of the area\u2019s median income, or $65,730 a year for a family of three. \u201cPart of what we\u2019re doing, in some way, is to correct the narrative\u201d about modular construction, Ms. Glen said. The project, on Beach 20th Street, will go up around the same time as a similar, conventionally built mid-rise on the same street by the same developer. The company hopes to finish the modular tower 30 percent faster, for only slightly more than the cost of a normal build, Ms. Glen said, although she didn\u2019t disclose the budget. The architect is Magnusson Architecture and Planning, and Full Stack will manufacture the modules.\u201cThe assembly will take days, not weeks,\u201d said Chris Sharples, one of the architects, adding that the proprietary software will allow a number of regional suppliers to collaborate in a process more akin to manufacturing Boeing airliners than building with bricks and mortar. One of the problems with previous modular projects was miscommunication between the developers, the city and the suppliers, he said, which caused bottlenecks in delivery and assembly: \u201cIt\u2019s not about product innovation; it\u2019s about process innovation.\u201d One recent afternoon, Yair Goldberg, an executive with the automated parking company U-Tron, pointed to the outdoor pool at Park + Garden, a 212-unit luxury rental tower in Hoboken, N.J. Then he pointed to the rooftop park and the lounge, amenities that might have been smaller, or not built at all, he said, if the developer, Bijou Properties, had opted for a traditional ramp parking lot.Original plans for the project called for a 10-story parking garage with more than 300 spaces. U-Tron\u2019s design achieved the same goal in a four-story space, allowing the developer to add more than 30 units to the building and dedicate more room to amenities. \u201cYou\u2019re benefiting the developer, who\u2019s getting a much better land use, but you\u2019re also benefiting tenants,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said.The U-Tron system is essentially a vending machine on a giant scale, with a computerized brain. It uses big turntables, robotic arms and a network of checks and balances to ensure that cars get from point A to point B unscathed. The U-Tron system can pack cars four inches apart, with six inches of overhead clearance, resulting in two or three times the density of a normal garage. And aside from upkeep, there is no human intervention, which means the builder saves on labor, ventilation and lighting costs. With the use of an app, a driver can summon a parked car and retrieve it from a loading bay in an average of five minutes.That is, when everything goes according to plan. The robotic parking industry was poised to take off in the early 2000s when the real estate market was booming and positive reviews from overseas markets spread. Then the recession happened, and the systems \u2014 which can cost about $30,000 to $40,000 a space, or nearly twice as much as conventional parking \u2014 fell out of favor. Builders today \u201care just afraid \u2014 they\u2019ve heard the horror stories,\u201d said Jerry Marcus, the owner of the Parking Advisory Group, a consultancy that works with developers and architects. But there are signs that the technology may finally be gaining traction.\u201cThere are going to be more built in the next two to three years than there have been in the last 15,\u201d said Ian Todd, the director of automated parking systems for Westfalia Technologies, in York, Pa. His company has completed two robotic lots in the United States, and is in talks to do 25 more, mostly in the Northeast, but also in Austin, Tex., and the San Francisco Bay Area.The technology has improved, Mr. Goldberg said. U-Tron, for instance, takes 3D photographs of a car\u2019s dimensions to ensure that it is given adequate space. The system also does a kind of housekeeping, in which it learns the habits of users and can shuffle cars to more convenient spots for removal, to keep drivers from growing impatient in the loading area.\u201cWe put an emphasis on the psychology of waiting,\u201d he said.Jersey City Urby, a 69-story luxury rental tower across the river from Manhattan, is a certified green building, with high-tech features like keyless apartment entry with the use of a smartphone app. But the developers didn\u2019t anticipate that the building\u2019s energy-efficient windows and walls would create cellphone dead zones and interfere with their fancy app.\u201cIt was one of the worst cases that we\u2019d seen,\u201d said Alex Goge, director of sales for Illuminati Labs, the company brought in after construction to fix the signal problems. \u201cYou could not make a call. You could not make a text.\u201d That was especially true on the top floors \u2014 that is, the prime real estate \u2014 where two-bedrooms were priced at $5,500 a month.For about $400,000, Illuminati installed a passive distributed antenna system, or D.A.S., a network of antennas, cables and signal boosters that amplified the signal from the air, without the costly infrastructure of hard-wiring the building to each of the major service providers. \u201cCellphone connectivity is really looked at as a utility,\u201d said Jeffrey Gudewicz, the chief product officer at Wilson Electronics, the company whose devices were installed at Urby.\u201cIt used to be that you\u2019d negotiate, pre-construction, with the cellular providers,\u201d said David Barry, the president of Ironstate, one of the developers. But in the last several years cellular companies have increased the price of installing the wiring that ensures a strong signal in a building, Mr. Barry said, and it would have cost $2 million and taken more than a year to install at Urby. Whereas the Wilson system, he said, is carrier-agnostic and can be installed in weeks, not months. Now the 762-unit building, which opened in 2017, is fully leased.Others are also recognizing connectivity as an amenity. Related Companies has partnered with Starry, a Boston-based company that provides what is known as 5G fixed wireless internet service, for a flat fee of $50 a month to those who live in residential towers, with no additional rental costs or unwanted bundles. \u201cNobody actually knows what 5G is,\u201d said Virginia Lam Abrams, an executive with Starry, because it represents the next generation of low-latency, high-capacity access networks with smoother performance. In Starry\u2019s case, that means 200 megabits a second for downloads and uploads, up to a gigabit a second, with no usage caps, she said, adding that larger companies might charge double that for lower speeds or require a bundled package with cable.\u201cThere are still going to be folks who want their NY1 and their bundled content, but there\u2019s a real desire from the younger generation,\u201d said Joanna Rose, an executive vice president with Related, who said the service will be rolled out to all of the developer\u2019s New York buildings, with a reduced-cost subscription in the affordable projects.\u201cIt\u2019s been very well received,\u201d said Beth Fisher, a senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is marketing the building. Wellness is the theme at other new developments, too. At Waterline Square, a three-tower complex rising on the West Side of Manhattan, the buildings will share a below-grade, roughly 100,000-square-foot area with a saltwater swimming pool, an indoor tennis court, a skate park and other amenities, said Elisa Orlanski Ours, the chief planning and design officer at Corcoran Sunshine.But because the space is subterranean, the developer hired Focus Lighting to install a diurnal LED system that will change throughout the day to mimic the quality of natural light.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to feel like a Vegas casino,\u201d said Stephanie Daigle, a senior designer with Focus Lighting. The three-story space will have more than 1,000 linear feet of lighting that will mix various tones and colors to create an inviting space.Elsewhere, amenities are embracing a space-age look. At 520 West 28th Street, the futuristic condo designed by Zaha Hadid, there is an equally futuristic-looking IMAX theater \u2014 the first in a residential setting in New York. The 10-by-18-foot screen is flanked by a surround-sound system built into custom millwork that evokes the feeling of an alien spacecraft. The 12 fully reclining seats are on platforms that can retract into the wall to create a more open, social space. Not including the price of the technical equipment, the room cost well over $1 million to build.It\u2019s all in service of attracting an upscale clientele. (Naturally, the building also has robotic parking and storage.) So far, half of the 39 units have sold, but the $50 million triplex penthouse is still on the market.Gregory H. Gush\u00e9e, an executive vice president with Related, the developer, said the company has a special client in mind. In the penthouse library, there is a shelf of carefully chosen books: biographies of Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d a treatise on super intelligence \u2014 all purported favorites of the Tesla co-founder Elon Musk.\u201cWe\u2019re still working on the Elon staging,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cryptocurrency Millionaire Wants to Build a Utopia in Nevada", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "A man spent millions on an enormous plot of land near Reno. Now he wants to build a community based on the blockchain technology introduced by Bitcoin.Supported bySTOREY COUNTY, Nev. \u2014 An enormous plot of land in the Nevada desert \u2014 bigger than nearby Reno \u2014 has been the subject of local intrigue since a company with no history, Blockchains L.L.C., bought it for $170 million in cash this year.The man who owns the company, a lawyer and cryptocurrency millionaire named Jeffrey Berns, put on a helmet and climbed into a Polaris off-road vehicle last week to give a tour of the sprawling property and dispel a bit of the mystery.He imagines a sort of experimental community spread over about a hundred square miles, where houses, schools, commercial districts and production studios will be built. The centerpiece of this giant project will be the blockchain, a new kind of database that was introduced by Bitcoin.After his driver stopped the Polaris on a high desert plateau, surrounded by blooming rabbit brush and a grazing herd of wild horses, Mr. Berns, who is 56, pointed to the highlights of his dream community.\u201cYou see that first range of mountains,\u201d he said, pointing south. \u201cThose mountains are the border of our South Valley. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going to build the high-tech park,\u201d a research campus that would cover hundreds of acres. There are also plans for a college and an e-gaming arena.As strange \u2014 even fantastical \u2014 as all this might sound, Mr. Berns\u2019s ambitions fit right into the idiosyncratic world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains.The blockchain began as a digital ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Some aficionados have grander plans. They think it could be a new way of taking power back from the institutions they believe are calling all the shots.Just as Bitcoin made it possible to transfer money without using a bank, blockchain believers like Mr. Berns think the technology will make it possible for ordinary people to control their own data \u2014 the lifeblood of the digital economy \u2014 without relying on big companies or governments.Mr. Berns was drawn to Nevada by its tax benefits, including the lack of income taxes. And the breadth of his ambitions certainly raises the risk of a boondoggle.But he is different from his crypto-brethren in one big way: He is spending his own money. So far, he said, he has spent $300 million on the land, offices, planning and a staff of 70 people. And buying 67,000 largely undeveloped acres is a bit of old-fashioned, real estate risk-taking.Still, Mr. Berns said his ambition was not to be a real estate magnate or even to get rich \u2014 or richer. He is promising to give away all decision-making power for the project and 90 percent of any dividends it generates to a corporate structure that will be held by residents, employees and future investors. That structure, which he calls a \u201cdistributed collaborative entity,\u201d is supposed to operate on a blockchain where everyone\u2019s ownership rights and voting powers will be recorded in a digital wallet.Mr. Berns acknowledged that all this is way beyond what blockchains have actually accomplished. But that hasn\u2019t discouraged him.\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d he said over the roar of the Polaris engine. \u201cI just \u2014 something inside me tells me this is the answer, that if we can get enough people to trust the blockchain, we can begin to change all the systems we operate by.\u201dMr. Berns has managed to win over local officials who are eager for economic development. Nevada\u2019s governor, Brian Sandoval, read a proclamation that named the Blockchains property \u201cInnovation Park\u201d at an event last month where Mr. Berns sat on a panel with the governor and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla.Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory in Nevada, which has been described as the largest building in the world, is surrounded by Blockchains\u2019 land. Companies like Google, Apple and Switch also have properties in the industrial park that is surrounded by Mr. Berns\u2019s holdings.The Nevada county where this is all located, Storey County, has only about 4,000 residents and was best known, until recently, for its history of silver mining and its modern brothels, including one owned by a county commissioner.That same county commissioner, Lance Gilman, bought the land surrounding the brothel and turned it into the industrial park where Tesla and Google are now located.Blockchains has already received preliminary county support for a new town along the Truckee River, with thousands of homes, a school and a drone delivery system, and is working closely with the county on a broader master plan.But for now, Blockchains is empty land and a repurposed office building. Mr. Berns said the company won\u2019t begin construction on the broader property until late 2019, at the earliest, after putting together the master plan and getting it approved by the county.The office manager from Mr. Berns\u2019s old law office in Los Angeles, Joanna Rodriguez, moved with her four children and husband to Nevada.\u201cHe has these crazy ideas \u2014 but I know that every time he sets his mind to something he will get there,\u201d said Ms. Rodriguez, 29, who has worked with Mr. Berns for eight years and is now the manager of the Blockchains office in Nevada. \u201cThat\u2019s why I decided to move.\u201dMr. Berns spent most of his professional life on class-action lawsuits, many of them against financial companies. He learned about Bitcoin in 2012 but was won over by another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, which makes it possible to store more than just transaction data on a blockchain.Mr. Berns bought Ether, the digital token associated with Ethereum, in a big sale in 2015. Thanks to an astronomical increase in the price of Ether and some well-timed selling last year before it crashed, he became wealthy enough to fund his dream project.Ethereum is what he believes makes his community more than just a giant real estate project. To understand why requires more than a bit of imagination. And faith. Every resident and employee will have what amounts to an Ethereum address, which they will use to vote on local measures and store their personal data.Mr. Berns believes Ethereum will give people a way to control their identity and online data without any governments or companies involved.That is a widely shared view in the blockchain community, but there are significant questions about whether any of it can work in the real world. Most blockchain companies have failed to gain any traction, and Ethereum and Bitcoin networks have struggled to handle even moderate amounts of traffic.Mr. Berns believes that one of the big problems has been security. People have been terrible at holding the private keys that are necessary to get access to a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet.He wants to address that with a custom-built system where people\u2019s private keys are stored on multiple digital devices, kept in vaults, so that no one device can gain access to the keys. He has already purchased vaults that are burrowed into mountains in Sweden and Switzerland, and he plans to build additional vaults in the mountains in Nevada.The other thing holding back Ethereum, Mr. Berns believes, has been a lack of real-world laboratories. His Nevada land, he hopes, will change that.\u201cThis will either be the biggest thing ever, or the most spectacular crash and burn in the history of mankind,\u201d Mr. Berns said. \u201cI don\u2019t know which one. I believe it\u2019s the former, but either way it\u2019s going to be one hell of a ride.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Spares Corporate Wrongdoers Billions in Penalties", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the final months of the Obama administration, Walmart was under pressure from federal officials to pay nearly $1 billion and accept a guilty plea to resolve a foreign bribery investigation.Barclays faced demands that it pay nearly $7 billion to settle civil claims that it had sold toxic mortgage investments that helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis, and the Royal Bank of Scotland was ensnared in a criminal investigation over its role in the crisis.The three corporate giants complained that the Obama administration was being unreasonable and stood their ground, according to people briefed on the investigations. After President Trump took office, they looked to his administration for a more sympathetic ear \u2014 and got one.Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission have yet to charge Walmart, and the Justice Department reached a much lower settlement agreement with Barclays in March, for $2 billion. R.B.S. paid a civil penalty, but escaped criminal charges altogether.Across the corporate landscape, the Trump administration has presided over a sharp decline in financial penalties against banks and big companies accused of malfeasance, according to analyses of government data and interviews with more than 60 former and current federal officials. The approach mirrors the administration\u2019s aggressive deregulatory agenda throughout the federal government.The New York Times and outside experts tallied enforcement activity at the S.E.C. and the Justice Department, the two most powerful agencies policing the corporate and financial sectors. Comparing cases filed during the first 20 months of the Trump presidency with the final 20 months of the Obama administration, the review found:\u2022 A 62 percent drop in penalties imposed and illicit profits ordered returned by the S.E.C., to $1.9 billion under the Trump administration from $5 billion under the Obama administration;\u2022 A 72 percent decline in corporate penalties from the Justice Department\u2019s criminal prosecutions, to $3.93 billion from $14.15 billion, and a similar percent drop in civil penalties against financial institutions, to $7.4 billion;\u2022 A lighter touch toward the banking industry, with the S.E.C. ordering banks to pay $1.7 billion during the Obama period, nearly four times as much as in the Trump era, and Mr. Trump\u2019s Justice Department bringing 17 such cases, compared with 71.While career officials in the federal government have continued to investigate wrongdoing at companies large and small, some of the top political appointees under Mr. Trump have led a philosophical shift in governing that favors big business and prioritizes the interests of individual investors.Many Republicans in regulatory and law enforcement roles have resisted corporate penalties, suggesting that they unfairly punish a company\u2019s shareholders for the misconduct of employees. Democratic appointees have more often maintained that shareholders wrongly benefit from ill-gotten gains, no matter who was responsible for them, and that tough penalties could deter future lawbreaking.If the balance tilted toward a heavier hand in corporate penalties under former President Barack Obama \u2014 even as critics argued that his administration did not do enough to punish top bankers after the crisis \u2014 it began to swing in the opposite direction under Mr. Trump, the data show.With the exception of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a small agency where a new enforcement director has presided over an uptick in penalties and a Trump-appointed chairman vowed \u201cno pause\u201d in enforcement, the new approach extends across the federal financial enforcement regime.The S.E.C., an independent agency composed of a bipartisan group of presidentially appointed commissioners, is less subject to political considerations. The leaders of the agency\u2019s enforcement division act in a nonpartisan capacity.Still, Robert J. Jackson Jr., a Democratic commissioner at the S.E.C. who is a former law professor and corporate lawyer, said the philosophy of Republican commissioners sent the wrong message. \u201cWe should be trying to deter management from committing fraud, not rewarding corporations when their lawyers cleverly mask bad deeds,\u201d he said, while declining to discuss specific cases.\u201cThe goal is really to instill in those who are regulated the illusion that the government is everywhere and looking over your shoulder,\u201d said Harvey L. Pitt, a Republican who was chairman of the S.E.C. under President George W. Bush. \u201cIf you take away that threat, that could embolden some to keep breaking the law.\u201dIn a statement, the S.E.C. disputed The Times\u2019s approach to assessing the agency\u2019s record.\u201cThe article\u2019s conclusion that enforcement of the federal securities laws has flagged rests on deeply flawed methodology,\u201d said Stephanie Avakian and Steven Peikin, the heads of enforcement. \u201cAs the thorough analysis in our annual report makes clear, the division of enforcement\u2019s performance, effectiveness and activity level during our tenure compares favorably with any period in the commission\u2019s history.\u201dMs. Avakian and Mr. Peikin also highlighted their efforts to root out wrongdoing in virtual currencies, saying the agency had \u201cemerged as a global leader in addressing misconduct relating to digital assets.\u201dThe S.E.C. has chalked up some of the decline in settlement sizes to recent Supreme Court rulings that effectively handcuffed the agency. The agency has also noted that it filed a flurry of cases toward the end of the government\u2019s fiscal year on Sept. 30 even while losing 10 percent of its workers over the past two years.Legal experts who track the S.E.C. and Justice Department attributed some of the decline in penalties to factors beyond the federal government\u2019s control, noting that a soaring stock market had left the agencies with a smaller pipeline of cases because evidence of malfeasance is often easier to identify in tougher economic times. The Obama administration owed its surge in penalties partly to the fallout of the financial crisis, the experts said, whereas Wall Street has since bolstered some compliance procedures.The decline in corporate penalties from the Justice Department may partly reflect the Trump administration\u2019s heavier emphasis on immigration, violent crime and drugs. For two years in a row, the department has announced record-breaking prosecutions of health care fraud, much of which is related to the opioid crisis.\u201cAttorney General Sessions has set clear goals for this department: reducing violent crime, homicides, opioid prescriptions and drug overdose deaths,\u201d said Steven Stafford, a department spokesman. \u201cUnder his leadership, we have begun to achieve all four of these goals by increasing violent crime and firearm prosecutions to all-time highs.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere can be no doubt that this is a pro-law enforcement administration and Department of Justice.\u201dWhen Jay Clayton, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for chairman of the S.E.C., took the oath of office in May last year, he was surrounded by his family, his staff and the Supreme Court justice he had selected to swear him in: Anthony M. Kennedy.The presence of Justice Kennedy, a moderate conservative, indicated that Mr. Clayton, a political independent, was not plotting a radical partisan revamping of the agency.But Mr. Clayton\u2019s remarks that day about job creation \u2014 something not directly under the purview of the commission \u2014 signaled a new emphasis on bolstering the economy rather than policing Wall Street.\u201cThe work of the S.E.C. is fundamental to growing the economy, creating jobs and providing investors and entrepreneurs with a share of the American dream,\u201d he said in a statement that referred to keeping markets safe but made no mention of the agency\u2019s enforcement role.\u201cI think Clayton has a different focus,\u201d said J. Bradley Bennett, a partner at Baker Botts who is a Republican and a former head of enforcement at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a nongovernmental brokerage regulator. \u201cHis success metric is not enforcement fines or cases; it\u2019s the number of I.P.O.s.\u201dAs part of the analysis of S.E.C. enforcement, The Times, in consultation with legal experts, identified every case the S.E.C. filed between mid-May 2015 and September this year, reflecting back-to-back 20 month periods in the Obama and Trump presidencies. The analysis spanned 2,158 cases and was intended to measure the real-time impact of the change in administrations in January 2017.In addition to charting a sharp drop in financial penalties of $3.1 billion across all cases, the analysis shows that the S.E.C. charged far fewer high-profile defendants under Mr. Trump, including less than half as many banks and 40 percent fewer public companies. (Many of the bank cases under Mr. Obama stemmed from a voluntary self-reporting program aimed at penalizing misconduct in municipal bond offerings.)In May, the Securities Enforcement Empirical Database at New York University and Cornerstone Research, which helped The Times identify public companies among the defendants, reported a lag in cases against public companies. The data showed an uptick as the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement unit shifted into higher gear over the summer, and the S.E.C. during the Trump era has penalized such prominent companies as Citigroup and Walgreens.But even with that surge, many of the S.E.C.\u2019s cases underscored its focus on smaller defendants who defraud individual investors, according to experts who track the agency\u2019s doings.For example, actions soared in the 2018 fiscal year against fraudulent stock offerings and investment advisers accused of lying and stealing, said Gerald Hodgkins, a former senior S.E.C. enforcement official who left the agency last December and is now a partner at Covington & Burling. One recent case targeted a Florida man who was purporting to sell snake oil \u2014 pain relief drugs using cobra venom, to be precise \u2014 but whose company, it turned out, had no snakes.\u201cWe are definitely seeing a shift from the more complex cases to those that are less time-intensive and affect a narrower segment of the investing public,\u201d Mr. Hodgkins said, adding that he thought the agency overall had a productive year.When the S.E.C. publicizes enforcement figures, it includes penalties that other government agencies have collected in related actions, and calculates them based on when the cases were resolved, not when they were filed. This method, which predates Mr. Trump, credits the S.E.C. under his administration with bringing in $1.7 billion that Petrobras, a Brazilian company, was ordered to pay to other government agencies and plaintiffs in a private lawsuit.Tabulating penalties this way still leads to a $938 million gap between the two administrations, according to Urska Velikonja, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who studies the S.E.C. (The Times analysis, which found a $3.1 billion gap, excluded payments to outside agencies and attributed penalties to each administration based on when a case was initiated, not settled.)The S.E.C. disagreed with The Times\u2019s analysis, saying that it failed to account for the natural ebb in enforcement activity at the start of an administration, and that the early months of the Trump era saw more cases filed than the beginning of the Obama era. The agency also took issue with The Times\u2019s decision to focus on penalties, a spokeswoman said, because \u201cthe dollar amount of the penalties on their own don\u2019t say anything about whether we\u2019re protecting investors or enhancing market integrity.\u201dSome of the decline in penalties may reflect the growing skepticism over corporate penalties, particularly among the agency\u2019s Republican commissioners. Mr. Clayton, who during his confirmation hearing said he was \u201c100 percent committed to rooting out any fraud,\u201d is often caught in the middle between the agency\u2019s Republican and Democratic commissioners.The Times also found some investigations begun under Andrew J. Ceresney, the enforcement director in the final years of Mr. Obama\u2018s presidency, that hit a brick wall under Mr. Trump.In an investigation involving Morgan Stanley and Barclays, the banks had helped assemble the prospectus for a 2014 Puerto Rican bond deal. Although Puerto Rico\u2019s dire financial health was well known to investors, the S.E.C. under Mr. Obama investigated whether the document accurately warned that the territory was on the brink of bankruptcy.The investigation continued into the early months of the Trump presidency, when S.E.C. investigators told the bank they planned to bring charges. After higher-ranking S.E.C. enforcement officials reviewed the evidence, the agency dropped the investigation, people briefed on the matter said.Morgan Stanley and Barclays declined to comment. Legal experts said that the agency had occasionally reversed itself and ended investigations during the Obama era as well.Separately, an investigation into whether Carlyle, the private equity firm, misled investors about certain fees sputtered. The S.E.C. filed and settled similar cases against Carlyle\u2019s main competitors during both administrations, but the Trump administration did not do the same against Carlyle, people briefed on the matter said. Carlyle declined to comment.A Supreme Court ruling last year, Kokesh v. S.E.C., may have influenced the agency\u2019s approach to the investigation. The ruling held that the S.E.C. has only five years to collect ill-gotten profits; private equity firms like Carlyle typically have investment funds with a life span of 10 years or more.The S.E.C. has also said that a separate legal challenge to the constitutionality of its administrative court, where it typically filed many of its cases, reduced enforcement. A Supreme Court ruling this year forced the agency to reboot its administrative court process.As the presidential campaign was drawing to a close in late 2016, lawyers for Walmart met with senior Justice Department officials in Washington to discuss a possible settlement.Walmart bristled, and as the election came and went, the two sides continued to negotiate, leading Walmart to receive more favorable terms from the Justice Department. But at the tail end of the Obama administration, it became increasingly difficult to get Walmart\u2019s lawyers to schedule meetings, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke about the private discussions on the condition of anonymity.A person briefed on the matter said that negotiations gained steam in the early months of the Trump administration. Although Walmart was negotiating with the same career officials as it had during the Obama administration, the company closed in on a more favorable deal. Negotiations stalled again, and to date, the case against Walmart has not been resolved, though an announcement could come soon, the person briefed said. The company has said publicly that it set aside $283 million to cover potential settlements.A Walmart spokesman said the company was \u201ccontinuing discussions with the government agencies as we work to reach a solution.\u201d Mr. Stafford, the Justice Department spokesman, objected to The Times\u2019s account of the negotiations, without specifying what the department disputed.Brandon L. Garrett, the Duke law professor who examined the data, identified a drop in the number of penalties under Mr. Trump when compared with the final 20 months of the Obama administration (a 72 percent decline), and when compared with the first 20 months of the Obama presidency in 2009-10 (a 23 percent decline).Mr. Garrett said he routinely spoke to corporate compliance officers who lamented how the drop had undercut efforts inside companies to allocate more resources to preventing misconduct.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to fear prosecution for committing serious corporate crimes,\u201d he said.In March, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein declared that the Justice Department wanted to \u201cavoid imposing penalties that disproportionately punish innocent employees, shareholders, customers and other stakeholders.\u201d He has also promised that the department would try to prevent multiple law enforcement agencies from \u201cpiling on\u201d corporate fines. That approach was reflected in a number of recent cases against prominent defendants, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, in which the Justice Department gave the companies credit for penalties paid to other authorities.Some current and former employees attributed the deceleration in corporate cases, at least in part, to a leadership vacuum in the department\u2019s criminal division. Until July, the division had no Senate-confirmed leader.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have stability and organization at the Department of Justice, you may not have the bandwidth to handle major corporate prosecutions,\u201d Mr. Garrett said.The decline in criminal penalties has unfolded against a backdrop of broader regulatory rollbacks in the civil arena.Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division poured resources into lending-discrimination cases, some involving the nation\u2019s biggest banks. In the last full year of the Obama administration, the department filed seven lawsuits alleging lending violations. The next year, the Trump administration filed one such lawsuit.And like Walmart on the criminal side, some targets of civil prosecutions welcomed the more business-friendly approach of the Trump administration.Barclays, under investigation by the Obama administration for selling the soured mortgage investments, had rejected the Justice Department\u2019s demands to pay almost $7 billion, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. The Obama administration had, in turn, filed a lawsuit against the company using the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, a law that Republicans in Congress had tried to curtail.In March, Barclays settled for a much reduced penalty of $2 billion, which the bank argued was in line with what other financial institutions had paid for similar conduct.R.B.S., similarly suspected of defrauding investors in mortgage-backed securities, was facing a criminal investigation from federal prosecutors in Boston, who had obtained records of bank employees discussing \u201cgarbage\u201d loans and \u201crampant\u201d fraud.Toward the end of the Obama administration, Boston prosecutors declined to take a potential criminal prosecution off the table, according to people familiar with the matter. But under the Trump administration, Mr. Rosenstein decided that the case should not involve criminal charges in part because it was unfair to single out one of the many banks caught up in the mortgage investigations, two of the people said. Ultimately, R.B.S. reached a $4.9 billion civil settlement. The bank declined to comment.The Barclays and R.B.S. outcomes reflected the broader trend in cases brought against financial firms under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement law and the False Claims Act, which targets fraud of government programs.Andrew Schilling, a partner with Buckley Sandler who previously led the civil division at the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, said there had also been a marked decline in new financial fraud investigations being opened.\u201cCertainly, 10 years out of the financial crisis you\u2019re not going see quite the same activity,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I never thought I would see financial fraud enforcement fall off as sharply as it has.\u201dReporting was contributed by Sylvia Varnham O\u2019Regan, Gilda Di Carli, Grace Ashford, Daniela Porat and David Barstow.

I admit, I have a hard time picturing it.But if we look beyond the what-ifs and issues and ideology \u2014 if we really step back \u2014 maybe we can see something more illuminating.The results and the messiness of American democracy \u2014 with ridiculously long lines to vote, with far too many ways to cast ballots, with oodles of money sloshing around from billionaires \u2014 all spotlight the jumble of paradoxes that have shaped the United States since settlement.It\u2019s a country founded as a utopian \u201ccity on a hill\u201d \u2014 and defined by ruthlessness in capitalism and politics.It\u2019s a country where white nationalism is surging \u2014 and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is the year\u2019s top box-office earner.I could give you a dozen more of these with 10 minutes and a beer, but I don\u2019t live there anymore so I won\u2019t bore you with that.And really, Taylor Swift said it best. With just her guitar, playing in the middle of a giant stadium, with most of her big budget production taking a rest, she stripped down America to its essence:\u201cWe\u2019re happy free confused and lonely in the best way,\u201d she sang. \u201cIt\u2019s miserable and magical, oh yeah.\u201dNow for some other stories. Because even Tay knows it\u2019s not always about her or her country.______We had a busy week. So busy in fact, that I\u2019m going to limit this week\u2019s roundup to coverage connected to Australia and the region. Let\u2019s dive in.If you have a thoughtful 15 minutes...If you\u2019re wondering about Australians and the world...If you\u2019re looking for something to smirk or smile about...______Are there other things in media or life you\u2019d like to see Times guides for?

Ink splashes at page corners as if Inkling were alive between the book\u2019s covers; characters seem to morph out of black puddles; and whenever the inky gremlin is left untethered too long, Smith mirrors its creative rages with startling full-page panels suggesting Inkling might swallow the story straight out of readers\u2019 hands. With each page, we feel Ethan\u2019s tension growing, his father\u2019s anxieties looming larger and larger, like Inkling\u2019s growing blot. To control Inkling, then, the son must find a way to vanquish Dad\u2019s demons.Phelan\u2019s illustrations heighten the contrast. Mel is drawn deftly, lightly; Bors is a barrel-chested Cro-Magnon with a bald skull and angry glower. The assumed end to the story would be Mel taming her master and Bors softening in turn \u2014 the child become parent. But Phelan stays true to Bors\u2019s stubbornness: Even after she saves his life, earning his trust and respect, he abandons her at quest\u2019s end: \u201cI cannot have a girl as a squire. It just \u2026 it just isn\u2019t done.\u201d The moment is jarring and cleareyed, reminding us that not every parent can change. Sometimes, family must be found elsewhere.In one of Brooks\u2019s sharp, well-paced panels, which juggle action set pieces with helter-skelter angles and onomatopoeic effects, Tallulah\u2019s Latina mother redoes her own hair band after teleporting herself, while in another, Sanity\u2019s African-American father interrupts his station-saving to make sure his daughter eats dinner. Sanity and Tallulah have no resentment against their parents, no building rebellion; their goal is to find Franken-kitty and keep her alive, despite their parents\u2019 threats to destroy the lab cat once she\u2019s captured. Given how tempered and loving the guardians are, the cat\u2019s fate never seems in doubt. But if such enviable parenting drains a deeper threat from the novel, keeping the girls\u2019 mischief well-bounded, Brooks restores the balance by amping up the clear and present danger, forcing both families to work as a unit, suggesting that when it comes to the future, parent and child relying on each other just might be a new frontier.Soman Chainani is the author of the School for Good and Evil series. His next book, \u201cA Crystal of Time,\u201d will be published in the spring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Names a Successor to Elon Musk as Board Chief", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix weeks after settling a securities-fraud lawsuit with federal regulators, Tesla and Elon Musk have made good on one of the agreement\u2019s key provisions \u2014 naming a new board chief to impose order on a company whose automaking has often been overshadowed by Mr. Musk\u2019s behavior.The company said a current director, Robyn Denholm, would become its chairwoman immediately. Mr. Musk stepped down as chairman last month but remains Tesla\u2019s chief executive.Ms. Denholm, 55, is the chief financial officer of Telstra, which dominates telecommunications in Australia. She is a longtime technology executive with experience in Silicon Valley, where Tesla is based, and once worked for Toyota in Australia.Under the settlement, Tesla agreed to name a new leader for the board, splitting those responsibilities from Mr. Musk\u2019s post as chief executive, by next Tuesday.The company was also required to add two independent board members and to set up a permanent committee to monitor Mr. Musk\u2019s public declarations, including his Twitter posts. It has several weeks to complete that requirement.Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the appointment of Ms. Denholm \u201ctechnically complies\u201d with the S.E.C. settlement, but he questioned how much Ms. Denholm would be able to push back against a forceful personality like Mr. Musk.\u201cIf the goal is to provide adult supervision, it won\u2019t accomplish that,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cShe\u2019s been on the board through all of the shenanigans. She never resigned in protest. She is a Musk supporter. If it doesn\u2019t work out, she will be the one who leaves. It won\u2019t be Musk who leaves.\u201dMr. Musk has galvanized investors and the public imagination with his sleek electric cars and his big dreams for space travel and other ambitions. But his public declarations increasingly unnerved Tesla shareholders and the directors who represent them. Production problems only added to those concerns.Tesla reported a substantial profit in the third quarter, powered by a significant jump in production and sales of its Model 3 sedan. The earnings beat the expectations of many analysts and eased worries about its finances, for now. In the first half of 2018, the company reported losses and used up more than $1 billion in cash.\u201cThey are doing much better than we thought they would a quarter ago,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cYou have to give them credit for that.\u201dYet Tesla still faces challenges. It must prove it can sustain profits in the fourth quarter and beyond, pay out more than $1 billion to bondholders over the next few months, address quality issues and fix a chaotic delivery system.Tesla has also had an exodus of senior executives. It has had three chief accounting officers this year. And while the fraud suit with the S.E.C. has been settled, Tesla\u2019s past production forecasts for the Model 3 are still being examined by the agency.\u201cIn just about every area, they\u2019ve had extraordinary volatility,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said.David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar who follows Tesla, said the appointment of Ms. Denholm was \u201ca good balance\u201d and was probably best for Tesla\u2019s stock price. Bringing in a hard-nosed outsider \u201cwho wouldn\u2019t put up with Elon\u2019s Twitter nonsense,\u201d he added, \u201cwould clash with Elon and it wouldn\u2019t work at all.\u201dTesla shares rose almost 1 percent on Thursday.\u201cIt\u2019s troubling to me that since the settlement Elon has already made a mockery of the S.E.C. twice,\u201d Mr. Whiston said. He said Mr. Musk should \u201cstop playing games and just make the darn cars.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld said he would have preferred to see Tesla name a chairman with deep automotive experience, like Alan Mulally or Mark Fields, both former Ford Motor chief executives. \u201cIt would do them good to get somebody who knows how to run the production process without sleeping on the factory floor,\u201d he said.Ms. Denholm\u2019s exposure to the auto industry came in her seven years at Toyota Motor Corporation Australia, where she was national manager for finance, before leaving in 1996 for Sun Microsystems, a onetime Silicon Valley powerhouse later acquired by Oracle.Before her current position at Telstra, Ms. Denholm was an executive at Juniper Networks, which makes computer networking equipment, for about a decade. She has both Australian and American citizenship.Tesla said Ms. Denholm would step down from her role at Telstra once her six-month notice period is complete.Mr. Whiston said Ms. Denholm\u2019s plan to leave Telstra \u201cshows commitment to Tesla to make sure this oversight is done properly.\u201d But Professor Gordon cautioned that once she left her Telstra position, being chairwoman of Tesla \u201cwill be her full-time gig,\u201d making her less likely to confront Mr. Musk. \u201cIt will be a job she doesn\u2019t want to lose,\u201d he said.Mr. Musk heralded the change in typical fashion \u2014 on Twitter.In the Tesla announcement, Mr. Musk cited Ms. Denholm\u2019s experience and years with his company. \u201cRobyn has extensive experience in both the tech and auto industries, and she has made significant contributions as a Tesla board member over the past four years in helping us become a profitable company,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to working even more closely with Robyn as we continue accelerating the advent of sustainable energy.\u201dNow the question is whether Mr. Musk can conform to the more conventional corporate culture that Ms. Denholm is meant to represent.Carlos Tejada contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

One day he was visited by a clever god called Theuth.Theuth was an inventor of many useful things: arithmetic and geometry; astronomy and dice. But his greatest discovery, so he believed, \u201cwas the use of letters.\u201d And it was this invention that Theuth was most eager to share with King Thamus.The art of writing, Theuth said, \u201cwill make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit.\u201dBut Thamus rebuffed him. \u201cO most ingenious Theuth,\u201d he said, \u201cthe parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them.\u201dThe king continued: \u201cFor this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners\u2019 souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember themselves.\u201dWritten words, Thamus concluded, \u201cgive your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things but will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.\u201dWelcome to Facebook.To which one can only say: About time.The story of the wildly exaggerated promises and damaging unintended consequences of technology isn\u2019t exactly a new one. The real marvel is that it constantly seems to surprise us. Why?But the deeper reason that technology so often disappoints and betrays us is that it promises to make easy things that, by their intrinsic nature, have to be hard.Tweeting and trolling are easy. Mastering the arts of conversation and measured debate is hard. Texting is easy. Writing a proper letter is hard. Looking stuff up on Google is easy. Knowing what to search for in the first place is hard. Having a thousand friends on Facebook is easy. Maintaining six or seven close adult friendships over the space of many years is hard. Swiping right on Tinder is easy. Finding love \u2014 and staying in it \u2014 is hard.That\u2019s what Socrates (or Thamus) means when he deprecates the written word: It gives us an out. It creates the illusion that we can remain informed, and connected, even as we are spared the burdens of attentiveness, presence of mind and memory. That may seem quaint today. But how many of our personal, professional or national problems might be solved if we desisted from depending on shortcuts?To read The Times\u2019s account of how Facebook dealt with its problems is to be struck by how desperately Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg sought to massage and finesse \u2014 with consultants, lobbyists and technological patches \u2014 what amounted to a daunting if simple crisis of trust. As with love and grammar, acquiring and maintaining trust is hard. There are no workarounds.Start over, Facebook. Do the basics. Stop pretending that you\u2019re about transforming the state of the world. Work harder to operate ethically, openly and responsibly. Accept that the work will take time.

{"Headline": "Tech C.E.O.s Are in Love With Their Principal Doomsayer", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "The futurist philosopher Yuval Noah Harari thinks Silicon Valley is an engine of dystopian ruin. So why do the digital elite adore him so?Supported byThe futurist philosopher Yuval Noah Harari worries about a lot.He worries that Silicon Valley is undermining democracy and ushering in a dystopian hellscape in which voting is obsolete.He worries that by creating powerful influence machines to control billions of minds, the big tech companies are destroying the idea of a sovereign individual with free will.He worries that because the technological revolution\u2019s work requires so few laborers, Silicon Valley is creating a tiny ruling class and a teeming, furious \u201cuseless class.\u201dBut lately, Mr. Harari is anxious about something much more personal. If this is his harrowing warning, then why do Silicon Valley C.E.O.s love him so?\u201cOne possibility is that my message is not threatening to them, and so they embrace it?\u201d a puzzled Mr. Harari said one afternoon in October. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s more worrying. Maybe I\u2019m missing something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m interested in how Silicon Valley can be so infatuated with Yuval, which they are \u2014 it\u2019s insane he\u2019s so popular, they\u2019re all inviting him to campus \u2014 yet what Yuval is saying undermines the premise of the advertising- and engagement-based model of their products,\u201d said Tristan Harris, Google\u2019s former in-house design ethicist and the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.Mr. Harari, thinking about all this, puts it this way: \u201cUtopia and dystopia depends on your values.\u201dHe followed up with \u201cHomo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,\u201d which outlined his vision of what comes after human evolution. In it, he describes Dataism, a new faith based around the power of algorithms. Mr. Harari\u2019s future is one in which big data is worshiped, artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, and some humans develop Godlike abilities.His prophecies might have made him a Cassandra in Silicon Valley, or at the very least an unwelcome presence. Instead, he has had to reconcile himself to the locals\u2019 strange delight. \u201cIf you make people start thinking far more deeply and seriously about these issues,\u201d he told me, sounding weary, \u201csome of the things they will think about might not be what you want them to think about.\u201dMr. Harari agreed to let me tag along for a few days on his travels through the Valley, and one afternoon in September, I waited for him outside X\u2019s offices, in Mountain View, while he spoke to the Alphabet employees inside. After a while, he emerged: a shy, thin, bespectacled man with a dusting of dark hair. Mr. Harari has a sort of owlish demeanor, in that he looks wise and also does not move his body very much, even while glancing to the side. His face is not particularly expressive, with the exception of one rogue eyebrow. When you catch his eye, there is a wary look \u2014\u00a0like he wants to know if you, too, understand exactly how bad the world is about to get. At the Alphabet talk, Mr. Harari had been accompanied by his publisher. They said that the younger employees had expressed concern about whether their work was contributing to a less free society, while the executives generally thought their impact was positive.Some workers had tried to predict how well humans would adapt to large technological change based on how they have responded to small shifts, like a new version of Gmail. Mr. Harari told them to think more starkly: If there isn\u2019t a major policy intervention, most humans probably will not adapt at all.It made him sad, he told me, to see people build things that destroy their own societies, but he works every day to maintain an academic distance and remind himself that humans are just animals. \u201cPart of it is really coming from seeing humans as apes, that this is how they behave,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re chimpanzees. They\u2019re sapiens. This is what they do.\u201dHe was slouching a little. Socializing exhausts him. An Alphabet media relations manager later reached out to Mr. Harari\u2019s team to tell him to tell me that the visit to X was not allowed to be part of this story. The request confused and then amused Mr. Harari. It is interesting, he said, that unlike politicians, tech companies do not need a free press, since they already control the means of message distribution. He said he had resigned himself to tech executives\u2019 global reign, pointing out how much worse the politicians are. \u201cI\u2019ve met a number of these high-tech giants, and generally they\u2019re good people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not Attila the Hun. In the lottery of human leaders, you could get far worse.\u201dSome of his tech fans, he thinks, come to him out of anxiety. \u201cSome may be very frightened of the impact of what they are doing,\u201d Mr. Harari said. Still, their enthusiastic embrace of his work makes him uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rule of thumb in history that if you are so much coddled by the elites it must mean that you don\u2019t want to frighten them,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cThey can absorb you. You can become the intellectual entertainment.\u201dC.E.O. testimonials to Mr. Harari\u2019s acumen are indeed not hard to come by. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to Yuval for his clarity of thought,\u201d Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter and Square, wrote in an email, going on to praise a particular chapter on meditation.And Mr. Hastings wrote: \u201cYuval\u2019s the anti-Silicon Valley persona \u2014 he doesn\u2019t carry a phone and he spends a lot of time contemplating while off the grid. We see in him who we wish we were.\u201d He added, \u201cHis thinking on A.I. and biotech in his new book pushes our understanding of the dramas to unfold.\u201dA few nights earlier, Mr. Harari spoke to a sold-out theater of 3,500 in San Francisco. One ticket-holder walking in, an older man, told me it was brave and honest for Mr. Harari to use the term \u201cuseless class.\u201dHe told the audience that free will is an illusion, and that human rights are just a story we tell ourselves. Political parties, he said, might not make sense anymore. He went on to argue that the liberal world order has relied on fictions like \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d and \u201cfollow your heart,\u201d and that these ideas no longer work in the age of artificial intelligence, when hearts can be manipulated at scale.Everyone in Silicon Valley is focused on building the future, Mr. Harari continued, while most of the world\u2019s people are not even needed enough to be exploited. \u201cNow you increasingly feel that there are all these elites that just don\u2019t need me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s much worse to be irrelevant than to be exploited.\u201dThe useless class he describes is uniquely vulnerable. \u201cIf a century ago you mounted a revolution against exploitation, you knew that when bad comes to worse, they can\u2019t shoot all of us because they need us,\u201d he said, citing army service and factory work.Now it is becoming less clear why the ruling elite would not just kill the new useless class. \u201cYou\u2019re totally expendable,\u201d he told the audience.This, Mr. Harari told me later, is why Silicon Valley is so excited about the concept of universal basic income, or stipends paid to people regardless of whether they work. The message is: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you. But we are nice, so we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\u201cIf humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don\u2019t reflect our free will, what should the point of politics be?\u201d he wrote. \u201cHow do you live when you realize \u2026 that your heart might be a government agent, that your amygdala might be working for Putin, and that the next thought that emerges in your mind might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourself? These are the most interesting questions humanity now faces.\u201dMr. Harari and his husband, Itzik Yahav, who is also his manager, rented a small house in Mountain View for their visit, and one morning I found them there making oatmeal. Mr. Harari observed that as his celebrity in Silicon Valley has risen, tech fans have focused on his lifestyle.\u201cSilicon Valley was already kind of a hotbed for meditation and yoga and all these things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the things that made me kind of more popular and palatable is that I also have this bedrock.\u201d He was wearing an old sweatshirt and denim track pants. His voice was quiet, but he gestured widely, waving his hands, hitting a jar of spatulas.Mr. Harari grew up in Kiryat Ata, near Haifa, and his father worked in the arms industry. His mother, who worked in office administration, now volunteers for her son handling his mail; he gets about 1,000 messages a week. Mr. Yahav\u2019s mother is their accountant.Most days, Mr. Harari doesn\u2019t use an alarm clock, and wakes up between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m., then meditates and has a cup of tea. He works until 4 or 5 p.m., then does another hour of meditation, followed by an hourlong walk, maybe a swim, and then TV with Mr. Yahav.The two met 16 years ago through the dating site Check Me Out. \u201cWe are not big believers in falling in love,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cIt was more a rational choice.\u201d\u201cWe met each other and we thought, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re \u2014 O.K., let\u2019s move in with each other,\u2019\u201d Mr. Yahav said.Mr. Yahav became Mr. Harari\u2019s manager. During the period when English-language publishers were cool on the commercial viability of \u201cSapiens\u201d \u2014 thinking it too serious for the average reader and not serious enough for the scholars \u2014 Mr. Yahav persisted, eventually landing the Jerusalem-based agent Deborah Harris. One day when Mr. Harari was away meditating, Mr. Yahav and Ms. Harris finally sold it at auction to Random House in London.Mr. Yahav used to meditate, but has recently stopped. \u201cIt was too hectic,\u201d he said while folding laundry. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get this kind of huge success and a regular practice.\u201d Mr. Harari remains dedicated.\u201cIf it were only up to him, he would be a monk in a cave, writing things and never getting his hair cut,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, looking at his husband. \u201cCan I tell that story?\u201dMr. Harari said no.\u201cOn our first meeting,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, \u201che had cut his hair by himself. And it was a very bad job.\u201dThe couple are vegan, and Mr. Harari is particularly sensitive to animals. He identified the sweatshirt he was wearing as one he got just before one of his dogs died. Mr. Yahav cut in to ask if he could tell another story; Mr. Harari seemed to know exactly what he meant, and said absolutely not.\u201cIn the middle of the night,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, \u201cwhen there is a mosquito, he will catch him and take him out.\u201dBeing gay, Mr. Harari said, has helped his work \u2014 it set him apart to study culture more clearly because it made him question the dominant stories of his own conservative Jewish society. \u201cIf society got this thing wrong, who guarantees it didn\u2019t get everything else wrong as well?\u201d he said.\u201cIf I was a superhuman, my superpower would be detachment,\u201d Mr. Harari added. \u201cO.K., so maybe humankind is going to disappear \u2014 O.K., let\u2019s just observe.\u201dFor fun, the couple watches TV.

{"Headline": "End Forced Arbitration for Sexual Harassment. Then Do More.", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf tech companies really want to be cutting-edge, they should get rid of the policy in all employment-related disputes. Ms. Gerstein the director of the Project on State and Local Enforcement at the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program.On Nov. 1, more than 20,000 Google employees walked off the job in protest of the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct. A week later, Google capitulated to some of the protesters\u2019 key demands and announced the end to forced arbitration for its employees in relation to sexual harassment and assault claims. The very next day, Facebook followed suit with regard to sexual harassment claims. Microsoft, Uber and Lyft have taken similar steps in the past year.Technology companies pride themselves on their cutting-edge, visionary nature. Now that they\u2019ve taken the first step, here\u2019s an opportunity for them to be early adopters, and national leaders, by making an even more impactful move: ending forced arbitration in relation to all employment-related disputes, not just sexual harassment. And given the extensive reach of these companies through their multitude of contractors, they should prohibit their contractors from forcing employees into arbitration, as well.Of course, workplace violations of different types are often intertwined: The same employers that permit or perpetrate sexual harassment also commit a host of other violations \u2014 underpaying workers, discriminating in other ways or preventing workers from organizing. A case I handled long ago captures this. A group of women who worked for a dry cleaner came to our office because they were underpaid, working 56 hours a week for subminimum wages and no overtime.As I investigated, I quickly learned how interrelated their problems were. The women, who were Latina, were paid less than their male co-workers. All of the Latino workers, male and female, made less than their non-Latino counterparts. No one made enough to live on, and everyone there was surely exposed to highly toxic chemicals. Over repeated meetings, another story also emerged: The boss routinely made leering comments to the women workers, told them to wear short skirts and, as I later learned, had sex with one of them in a La Guardia Airport hotel \u2014 consensually, he insisted. When I questioned him in sworn testimony about his behavior toward his female employees, he said, \u201cSpanish women like it.\u201dHow do you tease apart the sexism, racism and economic exploitation in this situation? You can\u2019t. They\u2019re inseparable. What brought the women to our office was their unlawfully low pay. But this was partly a result of discrimination against them based on their sex and national origin, and from an even broader viewpoint, it was a result of their lack of power or a voice on the job.So why would it make sense to end forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment only? Why should any company still block people from filing in court when they\u2019re racially harassed or underpaid or paid less because of their national origin? All are offenses against human dignity, and in all of these cases, there is the same tremendous power differential that makes it so hard for people to speak up.The workers who walked out at Google have lives very distinct from the immigrant women who spend their days pressing clothes. But at the root of sexual harassment, or any kind of workplace abuse, is abuse of power. Even a Hollywood legend like Gwyneth Paltrow didn\u2019t speak up about Harvey Weinstein because she thought she would be fired.Even if these companies stop using forced arbitration, their workers will still have plenty of reasons not to speak up: fear of retaliation (even though it\u2019s illegal), fear of being blacklisted, difficulty finding a lawyer to take the case. And with President Trump remaking the judiciary in his image, federal court may soon not be such a great option, either. But at the very least, working people should have the chance to have their day, together, in court.By ending forced arbitration only in cases of sexual harassment, Google, Facebook and their fellow technology companies have responded to public pressure, to the day\u2019s news cycle. But it\u2019s time to be proactive, not just reactive. There\u2019s no logic to ending forced arbitration for sexual harassment only and leaving it intact for so much else.In the end, the most compelling reason for a company to foist arbitration on its work force is to avoid liability and public exposure that might result from a court case. But if a company wants to avoid liability, blocking workers from court isn\u2019t the best way to do that. The answer is to create a fair and lawful workplace, the best possible workplace, for everyone who contributes to a company\u2019s success and to give workers a voice. That, and not a new phone or new app, is the kind of vision and disruption we need more of.Terri Gerstein is the director of the Project on State and Local Enforcement at the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s What They Should Worry About.", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchCompanies that lag their peers sometimes cut accounting corners to make themselves appear stronger than they really are. But is the risk of getting caught worth it?The recent news that the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are looking at the accounting and disclosures of General Electric, Tesla and Snap does not bode well for the companies. An investigation of possibly faulty accounting typically looks deep into corporate books and public statements, and the government rarely commits resources without evidence that there may be significant misstatements.Snap disclosed that the S.E.C. and Justice Department sent it subpoenas for records related to its disclosure about competition from Instagram when it went public in March 2017. Regulators are investigating whether the company understated the impact of Instagram on its own growth \u2014 a key issue for investors in a tech company built around rapid user growth.Unsurprisingly, all three companies vowed to cooperate with the government. Snap has taken the position that its disclosures were \u201caccurate and complete,\u201d while Tesla asserted that \u201cto our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred.\u201d Companies generally provide little information about how an investigation is progressing until they obtain a clear picture from the government about what might have gone awry.Accounting investigations can take months, or even years, to be resolved. That leaves investors with uncertainty as investigators pore over corporate records and try to build a case \u2014 and little hobbles a company\u2019s stock price more than investor uncertainty.Unlike S.E.C. regulators, who typically settle cases without an admission or denial of liability, federal prosecutors generally require a company to acknowledge its violations in a statement of facts that is then incorporated into a deferred prosecution agreement. Any resolution of a criminal case, even if the company does not have to plead guilty, means that investors will be able to piggyback on the acknowledgment in private securities fraud lawsuits. That could add to the cost of any penalty that might be imposed.Warren Buffett once pointed out that \u201cyou only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.\u201d But when your competitors are posting record profits and sales, the incentive to make yourself appear better can be very tempting, at least as long as the tide is high.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Behind the G.M. Cutbacks, and Why Trump Is Angry ", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House signaled that the automaker could suffer for planning thousands of layoffs, but the company says the course is essential to its future.When General Motors announced that it would idle five North American plants and eliminate thousands of jobs, it said the move would ease the burden of spending billions of dollars to develop the battery-powered vehicles of the future.But the White House put a question mark over those plans on Tuesday when President Trump \u2014 irate over the cutbacks \u2014 threatened to punish G.M. by ending federal tax credits that have helped underwrite that automaker\u2019s electric-vehicle fleet.Apparently referring to G.M.\u2019s federal rescue from bankruptcy in 2009, the president added: \u201cThe U.S. saved General Motors, and this is the THANKS we get! We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies, including for electric cars.\u201dSo a day after announcing a plan meant to put it on firmer financial ground by shedding money-losing operations and refocusing its resources, the biggest of Detroit\u2019s automakers found itself on the defensive.At a White House news briefing, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of disappointment, even anger\u201d in the administration over G.M.\u2019s decision \u2014 a sentiment he said he had shared in a \u201clengthy conversation\u201d with Ms. Barra. He cited the recent renegotiation of a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico on terms that he said were \u201ca great help to the automobile industry, and to autoworkers.\u201dG.M.\u2019s shares rose almost 5 percent on Monday, but they gave back about half of those gains on Tuesday in the face of the administration\u2019s unhappiness and its threat over the tax credits.A bright future for electric vehicles is one of G.M.\u2019s goals. Here are some of the calculations, and the uncertainties, behind the course it has chosen.Tesla is the only carmaker to have sold more than 200,000 electric cars in the United States. At the end of this year, the tax credit on Tesla vehicles falls to $3,750.G.M. says it has sold about 190,000 \u2014 mostly hybrid Volts, a model it said Monday it was discontinuing, and fully electric Bolts \u2014 and will pass 200,000 early next year. There are proposals in Congress that would extend or expand the credit, but the Trump administration\u2019s opposition could dim or kill those prospects. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and others and whether they should apply or not,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said Tuesday. \u201cCan\u2019t say anything final about that, but we are looking into it.\u201dOf the five factories that G.M. is mothballing, three are assembly plants: Lordstown, Ohio; Oshawa, Ontario; and the Detroit-Hamtramck plant in Michigan. All are almost certainly losing money, and make cars whose sales have plunged. As a result, the plants are operating well below capacity. Production in Lordstown fell by more than half last year from 2016. This year it has operated just a single, eight-hour shift each day. Typically, car plants must operate two shifts to generate profits.Moreover, the outlook for each plant is grim. With gas prices low, American consumers have flocked to S.U.V.s and all but abandoned small cars, like the Cruze, which is made in Lordstown, and the Impala, the Buick LaCrosse, and the Cadillac CT6, made at Detroit-Hamtramck. The plant in Oshawa also produces the Impala.Not necessarily. G.M. specifically announced that the plants were now \u201cunassigned\u201d \u2014 that is, they have not yet been assigned new vehicles to make after they stop production in 2019. Next year the company and the United Auto Workers union will negotiate a new labor contract. In past negotiations, the union has given concessions on wages and other cost-saving measures in exchange for the company\u2019s keeping plants open. Idling the plants now gives G.M. a powerful bargaining chip in the contract talks.In addition, G.M. is working on a dozen or more electric vehicles that it plans to roll out in two to four years. Those models will have to be made somewhere, and some could end up in one or more of the three idled plants.It\u2019s not clear. Tesla has proved that tens of thousands of people are willing to buy upscale electric cars. It has not yet proved definitively that it can make money doing so. That\u2019s also a big hurdle for G.M., as well as Ford and most other major automakers. G.M. and others have produced electric vehicles, but sales for each model have usually amounted to a few thousand cars a month \u2014 far too few to turn a profit. G.M. produces the Chevrolet Bolt, an electric car that is supposed to go up to 238 miles before needing a recharge. But so far this year, it has sold only about 13,000 Bolts.As for the huge investments in self-driving technologies, their profit potential is even less certain. G.M. has poured billions of dollars into its autonomous-driving unit, G.M. Cruise, and has recruited Honda and SoftBank, the Japanese technology giant, as partners.G.M. Cruise is working on a self-driving car with no steering wheel and no pedals, and it intends to use the car in driverless and delivery services that the company hopes will become a lucrative line of business.G.M. may be one of the first to rush into this field, but it faces an unfamiliar path and plenty of competition. Ford, Uber, Lyft and Waymo, the self-driving company started by Alphabet, the parent of Google, are all working on driverless services. Even if these services generate profits, it could be years before the companies earn back their investments.Not a lot. The halting of production at these three sites doesn\u2019t mean G.M. is struggling. On the contrary, the company continues to report billions in profits, thanks to buoyant pickup and S.U.V. sales.G.M. took this action because it is being squeezed. It is losing money on the small cars and sedans these plants make, and it needs to keep investing in new technologies. By idling the three assembly plants \u2014 the other two make transmissions \u2014 it hopes to use the savings to help fund its electric-vehicle and autonomous-driving ambitions. That particular need to shift capital investment is not an issue in other sectors. And while the industry is the largest manufacturing sector, it makes up only about 4 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.A broader economic slowdown could certainly cause grief for automakers. While Ms. Barra said one factor in G.M.\u2019s move was to \u201cimprove our downturn protection,\u201d she also made a point of saying the automaker was acting \u201cwhile the company and the economy are strong.\u201d So a few idle auto plants are not necessarily a leading indicator for the broader American economy.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Tesla's electric car sales. Tesla is the only company to have sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles in the United States, not the only company to sell 200,000 over all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Killer Robots the Future of War? Parsing the Facts on Autonomous Weapons", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarIt\u2019s a freezing, snowy day on the border between Estonia and Russia. Soldiers from the two nations are on routine border patrol, each side accompanied by an autonomous weapon system, a tracked robot armed with a machine gun and an optical system that can identify threats, like people or vehicles. As the patrols converge on uneven ground, an Estonian soldier trips and accidentally discharges his assault rifle. The Russian robot records the gunshots and instantaneously determines the appropriate response to what it interprets as an attack. In less than a second, both the Estonian and Russian robots, commanded by algorithms, turn their weapons on the human targets and fire. When the shooting stops, a dozen dead or injured soldiers lie scattered around their companion machines, leaving both nations to sift through the wreckage \u2014 or blame the other side for the attack.The hypothetical scenario seems fantastical, but those battlefield robots already exist today in an early form. Milrem Robotics, a company based in Estonia, has developed a robot called THeMIS (Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry System), which consists of a mobile body mounted on small tank treads, topped with a remote-weapon turret that can be equipped with small or large-caliber machine guns. It also includes cameras and target-tracking software, so the turret can pursue people or objects as programmed. This is a human-controlled system for now (and Milrem, for its part, insists that it will remain that way), but the components are there for a robot that can interpret what it sees, identify likely combatants and target them, all on its own. \u201cThe possible uses for the THeMIS,\u201d the robot\u2019s builders gush on the website, \u201care almost limitless.\u201dUnder what circumstances can and should militaries delegate the decision to take a human life to machines? It\u2019s a moral leap that has raised fundamental questions about the nature of warfare and that military planners, human rights organizations, defense officials, research analysts and ethicists have yet to reach a consensus on.The most advanced automated American weaponry has focused on defensive applications. When rocket and mortar attacks threatened large American bases in Iraq in 2003, the Army developed the Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar system (C-RAM) \u2014 a rapid-fire 20 mm cannon that can identify an incoming airborne threat, alert a human operator and \u2014 with the operator\u2019s press of a button \u2014 track and destroy it with a burst of special ammunition that self-destructs in midair to minimize damage to friendly personnel or civilians below.Those weapons were based on a naval gun system, the Phalanx, that\u2019s considered a last line of defense against antiship missiles. The Phalanx was just one of the Navy\u2019s automated answers to late Cold War pressures: Soviet naval doctrine relied on overwhelming enemy ship squadrons with as many as 60 cruise missiles at a time. \u201cWhen large salvos come in, it\u2019s impossible for humans to be able to say, \u2018O.K., you\u2019ve got to take this missile out first,\u2019\u201d says Robert Work, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cThere was no way for humans in the combat information center to be able to keep up with that.\u201d So American planners developed Phalanx and the Aegis Combat System, which links sensors on fleet ships and aircraft to identify airborne threats and, with operator input, automatically attack them with shipboard missiles. It was programmed, Work says, \u201cto have a totally automatic setting, and literally the human at some point pushes the button and the machine makes all the decisions.\u201dIt depends on how autonomous they are. \u201cThere\u2019s a type of fire-and-forget weapon where the weapon itself decides, \u2018O.K., this is what I see happening in the battlefield, and I think I\u2019m going to have to take out this particular tank because I think this tank is the command tank,\u2019\u201d says Work. This is his definition of a true lethal autonomous weapon system: an independent weapon that decides everything about who and what it destroys once a human has unleashed it.Darpa (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has a program called CODE, or Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment, to design sophisticated software that will allow groups of drones to work in closely coordinated teams, even in places where the enemy has been able to deny American forces access to GPS and other satellite-based communications. CODE \u201cis not intended to create autonomous weapons,\u201d says Paul Scharre, author of \u201cArmy of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War,\u201d but rather adapting to \u201ca world where we\u2019ll have groups of robots operating collaboratively together under one person in supervisory control. The program manager has compared it to wolves hunting in coordinated packs.\u201dCODE\u2019s human operators monitor the swarm without micromanaging it, and the autonomy of the drones means that they are programmed to improvise and adjust as they pursue their preset mission. \u201cThe idea here is that CODE is going after mobile or rapidly relocatable targets, so the target locations cannot be specified precisely in advance by humans,\u201d Scharre says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a Tomahawk cruise missile, where you just program in the coordinates and then the missile goes and strikes it. The drones have to be able to search an area and find targets on the move.\u201dA simpler autonomous system is the loitering munition: a drone that can fly for some time on its own, looking for specific signals, before finding a target and crashing into it with an explosive payload. Israel produces a loitering munition, dubbed the \u201cHarpy,\u201d which is designed to hunt out and destroy enemy radar stations and which became a sticking point in U.S.-Israeli relations when some were sold to China in the late 1990s. Companies in several nations, including Slovakia and the United States, have also produced loitering munitions.\u201cImagine that we are fighting in a city and we have a foe that is using human life indiscriminately as a human shield,\u201d says Tony Cerri, who until recently oversaw data science, models and simulations at the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. \u201cIt\u2019s constantly in your face as you\u2019re out walking in the street. You can\u2019t deal with every situation. You are going to make a mistake.\u201dAutonomous weapons, he suggests, are much less likely to make such mistakes: \u201cA robot, operating with milliseconds, looking at data that you can\u2019t even begin to conceive, is going to say this is the right time to use this kind of weapon to limit collateral damage.\u201d This argument parallels the controversial case for self-driving cars. In both instances, sensor-rich machines navigate a complex environment without the fatigue, distractions and other human fallibilities that can lead to fatal mistakes. Yet both arguments discount the emergent behaviors that can come from increasingly intelligent machines interpreting the world differently from humans.Even advocates concede that autonomous military robots could behave in new and unforeseen ways, inducing new errors \u2014 the way trading algorithms unleashed on the stock market can cause flash crashes or a pair of dueling book resellers\u2019 algorithms on Amazon could end up pricing a $70 biology text at $23 million, which happened in 2011. Those possibilities \u2014 and the danger that lethal machine errors could precipitate bloodier conflicts \u2014 will require close cooperative measures between robot-armed nations. Delegations to the United Nations have begun discussions on regulating lethal autonomous weapon systems under an existing Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which governs things ranging from booby traps to blinding lasers.In August, a United Nations working group set down principles that could be used to guide future international regulations on lethal autonomy. Chief among them is the idea of ensuring human responsibility for any weapon throughout its life cycle, which could create new liabilities for arms manufacturers. The United Nations group is set to release a formal report, with recommendations for future action, this month. Besides governments, the group\u2019s meetings attract their share of activists, like Mary Wareham of Human Rights Watch, who is the global coordinator for the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, an initiative launched in 2013 with the explicit mission of keeping humans in charge of lethal decisions in war.\u201cWe\u2019ve focused on two things that we want to see remain under meaningful, or appropriate, or adequate, or necessary human control,\u201d Wareham says. \u201cThat\u2019s the identification and selection of targets and then the use of force against them, lethal or otherwise.\u201d Those are the key decision points, critics say, where only a human\u2019s judgment \u2014 capable of discriminating between enemies and civilians, and keeping a sense of proportionality in responding \u2014 can be accountable and satisfy the conventions of war.The way in which we tend to justify war or condemn certain acts \u201chas to do with the fact that human beings are making decisions that are either moral or immoral,\u201d says Pauline Shanks Kaurin, a professor specializing in military ethics at the U.S. Naval War College. \u201cIf humans aren\u2019t making those decisions, if it\u2019s literally machines against machines, then it seems like then it\u2019s something else, right?\u201dFor Work, the question of morality might come down to America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cThere may be a place and time in the future where we\u2019re up against an opponent who is less worried about delegating lethal authority to a machine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s a long way off, and we have a lot of time to think about that and a lot of time to take action and make sure that we can still control all the weapons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Through All the Hype, Self-Driving Cars Remain Elusive", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe relentlessly hyped arrival of autonomous vehicles looms as the greatest disruption in personal transportation since Henry Ford\u2019s moving assembly line started producing Model T\u2019s by the millions. One word in that statement \u2014 arrival \u2014 is, however, doing a disproportionate amount of work.With this radical shift in driving comes questions about the viability of traditional business models based on the private ownership of cars and the dominance of the large carmakers.Still, Reilly Brennan, a general partner at Trucks Venture Capital and a lecturer in transportation at Stanford University, is cautious about how quickly a commercial market will develop for new companies.\u201cFully unstructured driving by go-anywhere cars is a long time away,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cFew start-ups actually understood the commitment required to create a complete vehicle.\u201dInstead, Mr. Brennan suggests, autonomy will first come to specialized applications like agriculture, mining and fleets dedicated to city delivery routes.The vast amount of data that must be digested by an autonomous car gives rise to another class of participants: the suppliers of the underlying technology like analysis tools and sensor systems. Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia, a partner with several prominent autonomous-vehicle developers, emphasizes the crucial role of such companies in making possible the cars that will be built without pedals or steering wheels.\u201cOur approach was to build an artificial intelligence brain, a supercomputer the size of a laptop to interpret the data from a car\u2019s sensors and build a 3-D picture of its surroundings,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said.While creeping along in a highway traffic jam may not be so demanding, detecting a distracted pedestrian on a city street and plotting a safe reaction is far more rigorous.\u201cWhen it comes to dealing with those situations, there\u2019s no such thing as having too much computing power in the car,\u201d he said.Following are some of the start-ups that are expected to play a role in developing the diverse ecosystem of autonomous vehicles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Director of \u2018Anchorman\u2019 Decided to Take On Dick Cheney", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "FeatureWith \u201cVice,\u201d his biopic of Bush\u2019s vice president, Adam McKay completes his journey from \u201cS.N.L.\u201d writer to fierce critic of the American right.Supported byMcKay made his name as a filmmaker in the early 2000s with a string of hit comedies that included \u201cAnchorman\u201d and \u201cTalladega Nights.\u201d But since co-writing and directing a 2015 adaptation of Michael Lewis\u2019s financial-crash caper \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which earned him an Oscar for screenwriting, he has gravitated to more serious material. His new movie, \u201cVice,\u201d is a grim account of the life of Dick Cheney, with Christian Bale \u2014 smoldering beneath prosthetic jowls and the ample weight he gained for the role \u2014 in the lead. McKay went into it aware that it would be, as he put it to me, \u201cthe most challenging, ambitious movie\u201d he ever made.\u201cThe movie was big,\u201d he said. His shooting script encompassed five decades of Cheney\u2019s life, 200 locations and more than 150 speaking parts. Chief among McKay\u2019s coping mechanisms for stress, going back to his 20s, were cigarettes and junk food, and during the \u201cVice\u201d shoot, he averaged half a pack of American Spirit Ultra Lights a day and put on around 25 pounds. When filming was through, McKay, who is 50, booked time with a trainer he\u2019d hired before. He came over for a session in mid-January. It was then that McKay\u2019s stomach turned. \u201cMy trainer says, \u2018Are you O.K.?\u2019 And I\u2019m, like: \u2018Yeah, yeah, I\u2019m just in bad shape. I\u2019m worn out. I\u2019m still smoking.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe trainer decided not to push it and left. Just then, McKay remembered that Bale, when researching Cheney\u2019s several heart attacks in preparation for \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cmet with a heart surgeon, and he said: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of ways you can show a heart attack. The hands tingling is one, the most common one is the pain in the arm, but what\u2019s really common is queasiness.\u2019 And in that moment, I ran upstairs.\u201d McKay swallowed three baby aspirin and called his wife, who called 911. At the hospital, a doctor confirmed the bad news: He\u2019d had a heart attack. The good news was that they were opening him up, inserting a stent and, if McKay quit smoking and got into better shape, he\u2019d come out fine. One of his two daughters brought him a card at the hospital that read, \u201cCongratulations on Your New Baby!\u201d which she\u2019d modified to say, \u201cI\u2019m Sorry about Your New Heart Attack!\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m 100 percent O.K.,\u201d McKay said. \u201cI do get a little lightheaded sometimes, but I recovered. It\u2019s like in \u2018Jaws,\u2019 when the shark swims right past the kid and doesn\u2019t touch him.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd then about two days later, I called Bale and I said, \u2018Hey man, either you or Dick Cheney saved my life.\u2019\u2009\u201dThis is as close as McKay is likely to come to expressing good will toward the 46th vice president. Far from a grateful tribute, \u201cVice\u201d \u2014 which co-stars Amy Adams as Cheney\u2019s wife, Lynne \u2014 proceeds in a spirit of frenetic and ferocious irreverence. Annapurna, the company behind the film, spent about $60 million to make it, and executives there are positioning the movie, as they did last year with \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d as a major awards-season contender. But McKay had little interest in obeying the familiar rhythms of the academy-pleasing biopic that Cheney\u2019s story might have inspired. In previous features, McKay staged the murder of a man by an airborne trident; filmed a prosthetic scrotum in close-up bobbing atop a snare drum; and enlisted Margot Robbie to explain subprime mortgages from a bubble bath. And yet \u201cVice\u201d is, in tone and form, one of the wildest movies he has made \u2014 and one of the wildest movies ever made about politics, period.A filmmaker less restive than McKay, having cast actors as gifted as Bale and Adams, might have done his best impersonation of, say, Steven Spielberg directing \u201cLincoln\u201d \u2014 filling his movie with so much solemn soliloquizing and rousing Oval Office debate. But in \u201cVice,\u201d scenes of finely wrought drama give way to passages of surreally heightened satire, which in turn give way to horrible v\u00e9rit\u00e9 footage of \u201cenhanced interrogations.\u201d The movie doesn\u2019t only double and triple back on itself but is punctuated throughout with nature-documentary clips, the \u201cWhassup!\u201d beer commercial and a variety of self-reflexive feints. The film\u2019s narrator is Jesse Plemons, whose relationship to Cheney is mysterious: at points he is a soldier, at others a warehouse worker, and at others, Naomi Watts, playing a cable-news anchor, is suddenly narrating instead.What is unambiguous, by the end, is McKay\u2019s conviction that the American right, in its post-Reagan consolidation of power, has set our country and our planet on a path to ruin \u2014 and that no single figure illustrates this better than Cheney. \u201cHe was the expert safecracker who opened up the safe,\u201d McKay said, alluding to Cheney\u2019s deft dismantling of checks on executive power, \u201cand now the orangutan is in there, throwing around the money and the jewels.\u201d McKay knows that a conservative backlash to his film is very likely, and while he emphasized how diligently he grounded the film in research, he also argued that making a less confrontational movie, hewing to a measured realism would have felt not only boring but also incommensurate to the task.\u201cI\u2019ve never dealt with a tone like this, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s by accident,\u201d McKay said. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a world with a tone that none of us has ever experienced. Pipe bombs are being sent to the leaders of a political party, and the guy who made \u2018Dilbert\u2019 is saying, You know the bombs were really made by left-wingers because they didn\u2019t work.\u201d He made an incredulous face. \u201cSo, you\u2019re claiming the assassination attempts are a false flag operation while slamming the liberals and you\u2019re the guy who did \u2018Dilbert\u2019?\u201d When it came to the movie\u2019s protean tone, he said, \u201cAll I can tell you is that we were very conscious of it, we knew it was challenging and indefinable \u2014 and we knew it had to be.\u201dThis was true, he added, not in spite of the material\u2019s seriousness, but because of it. \u201cI\u2019m suspicious of anything that feels like an old form,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re discovering new styles and forms, because this era we\u2019re in demands it. The world has gotten so cartoonishly exaggerated and over the top. Why be subtle anymore?\u201dBut like many self-identifying progressives, McKay \u2014 who grew up on food stamps and was raised in suburban Pennsylvania by his waitress single mother (his father, a musician, left the family when McKay was 7) \u2014 has grown steadily disenchanted with what he calls \u201cthe corporate left.\u201d This summer he joined the L.A. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. He thinks that capitalism must come under greater, Scandinavian-style regulatory control, \u201cespecially if we\u2019re going to do anything about climate change.\u201d Earlier this year he left Funny or Die, a comedy website he co-founded in 2007, after it entered into a sponsored-content agreement with Shell, a deal he called \u201cdisgusting.\u201dMcKay stands at a towering 6-foot-5 and sometimes seems to have more body than he knows what to do with. In his home office, he arranged himself across a beige couch like a coat hurled off in a hurry: torso horizontal, head kinked up against a pillow, legs crossed off the front. The room was trimmed in dark wood. \u201cThis is where I wrote \u2018Vice,\u2019\u2009\u201d McKay said, indicating a desk facing a bay window. A faux-Roman bust, purchased in a prop-department sale for $5, dwarfed McKay\u2019s computer. A vintage poster for the Japanese release of \u201cNetwork\u201d hung beside bookshelves decorated with memorabilia from McKay\u2019s films: the clapboard from \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d a production still from \u201cThe Other Guys.\u201dPiled together on one shelf were some of the books McKay consulted for \u201cVice,\u201d including Barton Gellman\u2019s Cheney biography, \u201cAngler,\u201d Jane Mayer\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d history, \u201cThe Dark Side,\u201d and Cheney\u2019s own memoir, \u201cIn My Time.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of layers to my attraction to Cheney\u2019s story, and one of them is how quiet and mysterious he was, how he\u2019s covered his trail all these years,\u201d McKay said. \u201cYou read his entire autobiography, and you learn nothing about him. Cheney is one of the most brilliant bureaucratic infighters in history, but he knew how to do all this stuff so that you barely knew it was happening.\u201dMcKay has dedicated his recent work to illuminating just such self-obscuring systems of power, the kind that depend on opacity to function. In \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d the narrator, played by Ryan Gosling, puts it this way: \u201cMortgage-backed securities. Subprime loans. Tranches. It\u2019s pretty confusing, right? Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid? Well, it\u2019s supposed to. Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or, even better, for you just to leave them the [expletive] alone.\u201d Last year, McKay directed the pilot for and served as an executive producer on \u201cSuccession,\u201d an HBO drama about a Murdoch-style media-empire patriarch and his reprobate heirs \u2014 their nefarious business dealings and abject power moves.In \u201cVice,\u201d he uses Cheney\u2019s life to tell a broader tale about what McKay describes as \u201cthe Republican revolution and how it changed our country.\u201d He sees Cheney as a \u201cZelig-style\u201d figure of the right. His career in national politics began in the Nixon administration as a congressional intern and then apprentice to Donald Rumsfeld and, from there, intersected and coincided with the rise of key conservative figures: among them the Fox News founder, Roger Ailes, who first floated the idea for a conservative news network while working for Nixon; right-wing megadonors like the Koch brothers; conservative strategy shops like the Heritage Foundation; and, finally, George W. Bush, over whose administration \u2014 and over whose decision to invade Iraq after Sept. 11, despite paltry intelligence linking the two \u2014 Cheney exercised unprecedented influence for a vice president.One of McKay\u2019s models was \u201cThe Power Broker,\u201d Robert Caro\u2019s landmark biography of Robert Moses. \u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of all this stuff,\u201d McKay said of Cheney, \u201cand finally he gets his hand on the wheel.\u201d Unlike Caro, McKay had to tell his story through a camera, and so there are compressions, elisions and metaphors in \u201cVice\u201d that reflect both a filmmaker\u2019s desire to enthrall the crowd and a prosecutor\u2019s desire to nail the defendant. Reading journalistic accounts of Cheney\u2019s move, in 2000, from the private sector back into public service, we learn that he took elaborate steps to divest from Halliburton, the oil conglomerate where he was C.E.O., to avoid the appearance of conflict; here, the relationship between Cheney and the energy sector is presented as one of clear cronyism. Or take Sept. 11. In Barton Gellman\u2019s play-by-play of that morning in \u201cAngler,\u201d it\u2019s strongly implied that Cheney usurped Bush\u2019s authority, ignoring the chain of command and giving fighter jets the O.K. to shoot down commercial airliners if they appeared to be hijacked. The official White House version was that Bush gave Cheney permission to pass along this order, and Gellman, poring carefully through communications records and notes taken by administration staff members, leaves open the extremely slim possibility that this is true. In \u201cVice\u201d there is no such equivocation. We see Cheney give the order to take out the planes himself. Compression, of course, isn\u2019t the same as distortion: Jane Mayer, the investigative journalist, described this scene to me as \u201ca perfect gem,\u201d and told McKay, after he screened the movie for her, that he \u201cgot it right.\u201dOne way McKay might have buttressed \u201cVice\u201d against possible charges of liberal bias would be to include the sorts of political critiques he readily offers up in conversation. \u201cWhen Clinton was elected, he cut welfare and deregulated banks, just like a Republican would have done,\u201d he said, from his couch. \u201cObama waged a war against whistle-blowers, he let the banks off the hook and he expanded executive power.\u201d McKay did tinker for a while with stitching points like these into \u201cVice\u201d \u2014 making it \u201cthe story of Dick Cheney and the rise of the Republican Party, and how they got so big they swallowed the Democrats.\u201d To this end, he pieced in footage of Hillary Clinton supporting the Iraq war. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard,\u201d McKay went on. \u201cThe audience only has a certain amount of oxygen in their lungs.\u201d As he said earlier: \u201cI could have made the movie three and a half hours long, but you can thank me that I didn\u2019t.\u201d (The film runs just over 130 minutes.)McKay predicted that some of the fiercest criticisms of \u201cVice\u201d might come from putatively sympathetic voices: \u201cI actually think left-wing friends of mine are going to be mad at me for humanizing him as much as I do.\u201d Throughout the film, Cheney is depicted as a fearsomely capable stalker of prey; a recurring motif concerns his passion for fly fishing, which McKay described to me as crucial to understanding him. He hired a fly fisherman as a consultant. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe the level of patience and detail that\u2019s involved \u2014 lifting up the rocks to see what kinds of bugs are underneath so you know what kind of lure to use; watching the drift, the way the sun\u2019s hitting it so you know what illusion to create with your lure. And that\u2019s the story with Dick Cheney. Meticulous detail and tremendous patience.\u201d Cheney is rendered tenderly in his interactions with Lynne, his sweetheart since high school, and with his second daughter, Mary, whose coming out as gay in the mid-\u201980s he met with private encouragement and affection. Christian Bale told me that he seized on Cheney\u2019s marriage as his way into the role. \u201cWith any part, you choose what you focus on,\u201d he said, explaining that, in \u201cVice,\u201d he chose \u201cthe love story. I think Cheney\u2019s one of the most romantic men around. At the start he wasn\u2019t particularly ambitious. Very laid back. But he has this undying love, where he\u2019ll do anything to win Lynne\u2019s approval \u2014 he did it all for her.\u201d He added that \u201cthe hardest thing with playing him was trying to understand that awesome power. I could never quite imagine what it must be like to wake up every morning knowing the power within your hands, where your choices affect whether people will die. I obsessed over it for months. But I don\u2019t think he sees himself as a villain \u2014 unless someone\u2019s a sociopath, I think they believe their motives are for a bigger good.\u201dOn the subject of villainy, McKay said: \u201cCheney and Bush did kill, conservatively, half a million civilians in Iraq. Some estimates have it at more than a million. So he\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d But, he said, \u201cI think you have to humanize him, because unless we see how a regular human being can go down these roads, it\u2019s useless.\u201d (McKay has heard nothing from the Cheneys, who did not participate in the making of the film, although he noted that Mary started following him on Twitter.)Recently, a sizable portion of the left has adopted surprising, relatively sanguine attitudes toward the Bush-Cheney years. I asked McKay, who directed a scathingly satirical 2009 Broadway show about Bush called, \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome America,\u201d whether he saw his unsparing portrait of Cheney in \u201cVice\u201d \u2014 humanizing gestures notwithstanding \u2014 as a would-be corrective to liberal amnesia on this score. \u201cI hope to God that it is,\u201d McKay said, nodding. \u201cReally what that shows you is the number of people for whom government is just about appearance. Bush and Cheney just kept up the facade, whereas this administration doesn\u2019t even remotely pretend. So when I hear people say, \u2018I miss the days of Bush and Cheney,\u2019 what they\u2019re really saying is, \u2018I miss the days when people would at least pretend.\u2019\u2009\u201d He went on: \u201cEvery time I see it, I shake my head, like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. The world economy collapsed, we had the greatest military fiasco in U.S. history apart from Vietnam.\u2019 When I hear \u2018Trump makes you miss Bush,\u2019 I go, \u2018There\u2019s no question that Bush and Cheney are way ahead of him in terms of damage done.\u2019\u2009\u201d He characterized such Bush nostalgia bluntly: \u201cNow that my house is on fire, I long for when it was infested by bees.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been playing with this one scene,\u201d McKay explained. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our most challenging runs.\u201d The scene in question takes place in Dick and Lynne Cheney\u2019s bedroom on a stormy night in 2000, after George W. Bush has won the Republican nomination and offered Cheney the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Cheney has declined, volunteering instead to lead the vice-presidential search. In the available accounts of this moment, Cheney\u2019s motivations remain obscure. Was the search a canard \u2014 a mechanism for Cheney, who always intended to take the job, to amass dirt on G.O.P. luminaries that he could later leverage against them? By stalling, was he able to extract more power from Bush when he eventually said yes?Rather than paper over this uncertainty, McKay decided to dramatize it in a particularly audacious way: Bale and Adams begin speaking in a Shakespearean approximation of Early Modern English. \u201cIs my life to be spent in servant\u2019s bow to Nixon, Ford, the thespian Reagan and Bush the Elder?\u201d Dick asks, to which Lynne replies, \u201cDanced nimbly \u2019round the kings\u2019 hearth thou hath, even whilst clamored I for more.\u201d As thunder grows louder in the background, the couple converse in iambs for three full minutes, working themselves up into a libidinal fever as they contemplate the opportunity before them: \u201cMine own blood and will are yours \u2019til pierced be the last soldier\u2019s breastplate spilling forth its ruby jellied treasures!\u201d Adams cries out as she climbs atop Bale.Corwin showed me the Shakespeare run, then said, \u201cEvery time we play this at test screenings \u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s resoundingly rejected,\u201d McKay said.\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying how much people hate it,\u201d Corwin reiterated.Wholey chimed in on a more upbeat note: \u201cI missed it when you took it out.\u201d\u201cSome people love it,\u201d McKay allowed, \u201cbut three out of four definitely hate it.\u201dMcKay has long relied on test screenings to shape his movies. Making comedies, he liked to swap in different punch lines for different crowds, like a stand-up, seeing which ones got bigger laughs and tweaking cuts accordingly. Even after moving into drama, he has found test screenings and focus groups indispensable to ensuring that audiences remain on board, moment to moment \u2014 especially so with \u201cVice,\u201d given its collage of moods and modes. \u201cIf you sit in rooms like this too long, you lose perspective,\u201d Corwin said. Not that the goal is milquetoast consensus. In 2013, when I visited the set of \u201cAnchorman 2,\u201d McKay put it to me this way: \u201cIdeally, you want to be alienating four people, and you want six people to love it.\u201d (Annapurna is likely hoping for more favorable math \u2014 in October, reports circulated that the company was suffering from money trouble, attributed to its model of spending lavishly on auteur-driven projects; McKay\u2019s movies have all done well at the box office, but several of these reports invoked \u201cVice\u201d as a particularly pricey gamble. Annapurna dismisses such reports and says they have full confidence in \u201cVice.\u201d)McKay also showed \u201cVice\u201d to filmmaker friends like Paul Thomas Anderson and David O. Russell. After Anderson, who watched two preliminary cuts, told McKay that the end of the movie worked great but the start \u201chad problems,\u201d McKay decided to scrap two early sections: an elaborate musical number and a prolonged passage set in Cheney\u2019s Wyoming adolescence. McKay adored both but decided that Anderson was right \u2014 they were gumming up the machinery.Amy Adams, for her part, loved the Shakespeare sequence. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great way to explain the motivations of the characters,\u201d she said, while acknowledging that \u201cit was challenging, because it could so easily feel big and broad, but it has to feel intimate.\u201d The passage testified, in her mind, to the way McKay \u201cwas able to so seamlessly navigate tone.\u201d She mentioned an informal exercise that she and McKay practiced on set to help keep her grounded in her character despite the movie\u2019s many shifts in register. \u201cI\u2019d come in at the beginning of the day, kind of half-Lynne, half-Amy, and Adam and I would have these debates\u201d \u2014 about news events depicted in the film, about whatever was in the headlines on that day of shooting. \u201cIt was such a great tool for me to get into Lynne,\u201d she said.McKay wasn\u2019t sure he could get the Shakespeare scene to click, but he was intent on trying. \u201cWe have a nice head of steam going through this part of the movie that we\u2019re loath to mess up, so we took it out for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scene ends well \u2014 it\u2019s always ended well. Getting into it is a little rickety. Now we\u2019re feeling that the movie\u2019s overall structure is playing so strong, though, that maybe we can try and pull off this cliff dive.\u201d So they experimented. Three minutes did feel long. Could they trim the exchange closer to one? And what if Plemons\u2019s narrator came in up top with some coy prefatory remarks to the effect of, \u201cO.K., so we have no idea what was going through Cheney\u2019s head here, and it\u2019s not like we can just imagine it through a scene of fake Shakespeare \u2014 or can we?\u201dMcKay was leaning toward something like that: \u201cMy new thought is maybe we just go bigger with our interruption.\u201d What if the screen went black?\u201cNo matter what we do, there\u2019s gonna be a \u2018What the [expletive]\u2019 reaction,\u201d said Corwin.\u201cOh, that\u2019s a given,\u201d McKay replied. \u201cIt\u2019s more about percentages of \u2018What the. ... \u2019 I could live with 46 percent. I could even get to 55-60 percent. But this scene might be 88 percent, where you start ripping a hole in the movie. Are you O.K. with 88 percent \u2018What the ... ,\u2019 Hank?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll follow you to the gates of hell,\u201d Corwin said, and rewound the scene to give it another look.He found a like-minded conspirator in Will Ferrell, who was hired onto \u201cS.N.L.\u201d the same day as McKay, and who shared his taste for absurd sketches poking fun at oafish, arrogant, rageful men. In the first thing they wrote together, Ferrell played a grotesque version of Neil Diamond, revealing the depraved inspirations behind benign hits like \u201cForever in Blue Jeans.\u201d (\u201cThis next song I wrote after I killed a drifter to get an erection.\u201d) One of McKay\u2019s fondest early contributions to the show starts with the title sequence for a program called \u201cThe Hulk Hogan Talk Show!!!\u201d This sequence \u2014 consisting of a droningly repetitive jingle, garish title cards and numerous stills of Hogan in the ring \u2014 lasts an almost interminable 45 seconds, ramping up in fanfare as it goes. The joke is that this is all misdirection. When the talk show finally starts, we are greeted by Ferrell, wearing a suit and tie on a chintzy set and interviewing a recently released hostage. \u201cHulk Hogan is on vacation,\u201d Ferrell says. \u201cI\u2019m your guest host, Phil Tobin.\u201d (McKay mocked Cheney several times on the show, including in cold opens and an installment of the animated \u201cX-Presidents\u201d series, which he co-wrote, during which the ghost of George Washington calls Cheney \u201ca douche bag\u201d and impales him with a quill pen.)McKay traces his sense of humor to a youthful love of Monty Python and some lasting lessons in irreverence from his mother. \u201cShe\u2019d always be poking holes in things,\u201d McKay said, whether it was sneaking him into the local Y.M.C.A. pool, because memberships were too expensive, or reading children\u2019s books and changing them \u201cso that Little Andy and Dottie were going to the supermarket and shoplifting.\u201d He recalled how one April Fools\u2019 Day, when he was in second grade, he got into bed and she\u2019d dumped sand into it. \u201cAnd she\u2019s like, \u2018April Fools\u2019! It confused me for a couple days, but then it was awesome. It opened up the whole world to me, like, You can play pranks on people!\u201d Over the past decade or so, McKay noted, his mother has grown increasingly conservative, faithfully watching Fox News and voting for Trump in the 2016 election despite supporting Obama in 2008. McKay described her move rightward as a source of both pain and confusion for him \u2014 and a source of ongoing debate between them \u2014 but said that their relationship remained a loving one.When he went to college at Temple University in Philadelphia, McKay studied literature. His favorite authors were those who scrambled storytelling conventions, like John Dos Passos and William Faulkner. Outside class, he tried stand-up comedy. \u201cI started doing open mics and bombing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was never great, but I got decent enough.\u201d McKay has said, \u201cOccasionally I\u2019d drop a political joke in, and I was really bad at it, so I would quickly get them out of my act and go back to joking about airplanes and girlfriends I broke up with.\u201dDuring his senior year, a fellow aspiring comedian named Rick Roman came back from a trip to Chicago and told him, \u201c\u2009\u2018There\u2019s this thing out there called long-form improv, where you get onstage and do whatever you want,\u2019\u2009\u201d McKay recalled. \u201cI go, \u2018Like stand-up?\u2019 \u2018No. You go into a scene and you say, \u201cWe\u2019re on the moon,\u201d and the only rule is you can\u2019t say no.\u2019\u2009\u201d McKay was sold. In 1990, just 18 credits shy of graduation, he unloaded his comic-book collection for $800, bought a secondhand Chrysler and moved to Chicago.There, he enrolled in improv classes with the avant-garde acting coach Del Close, a gruff, bearded guru whose past students had included Bill Murray and Gilda Radner, and whose \u201990s-era charges included Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert. (Close died in 1999.) McKay joined an improv team called the Family, which became Close\u2019s test group: \u201cHe would work out his new forms through us,\u201d McKay recalled. In one of these, \u201cwe\u2019d improvise a whole movie, and use movie language \u2014 credits, camera angles, smash cuts and all.\u201d McKay, the erstwhile lit major, named one new form \u201cthe Deconstruction\u201d: \u201cYou started with a scene played really well. Close listening, detailed characters, implying a world. And then for the rest of the form you rip that first scene apart: pick up on pieces of it, flash backward, flash forward, pick up a character element and exaggerate it.\u201dIn the early 1990s, McKay formed a troupe that would become the Upright Citizens Brigade, including Matt Besser, Horatio Sanz and Ian Roberts. Today, U.C.B. has grown into a bicoastal talent factory, offering classes in New York and Los Angeles, and its former students are everywhere in modern comedy. In its earliest incarnation, though, it was a scrappy upstart with an anarchic sensibility that stood in contrast to more established and relatively staid Chicago outfits like Second City. \u201cWe were doing this crazy show in a coffee house, but then we got a good review, and there were lines around the block,\u201d McKay said. \u201cIt was an amazing experience, but I was still broke.\u201d He eventually decamped for Second City, where he was integral to some modernizing changes \u2014 no more stage, no more curtain, no more rigidly formulaic revues \u2014 and where he \u201cactually started making some money. Besser was pissed at me, but I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, I can\u2019t pay my rent!\u2019\u2009\u201d (His U.C.B. teammates soon replaced him with another young comedian, Amy Poehler.)It\u2019s hard to imagine McKay making a movie like \u201cVice\u201d without his time spent exploding narrative strategies and provoking audiences in Chicago. This is nowhere clearer than in accounts of \u201cPi\u00f1ata Full of Bees,\u201d a hit Second City revue he cocreated. In one bit, McKay portrayed Noam Chomsky as a substitute teacher, terrifying grade-school children with the genocidal story of \u201cthe real Thanksgiving.\u201d Cast members would interrupt performances to recite statistics about how, say, military spending dwarfed welfare spending.One night, they tried to convince the audience that President Clinton had just moments before been killed, stopping the performance with a shellshocked announcement. Wheeling out a television to watch news of the assassination, however, the cast became distracted by frivolous programming. The comedian Scott Adsit, who was part of the troupe, described this stunt several years ago: \u201cWe all started sitting with our backs to the audience, watching sports bloopers, and didn\u2019t do anything but laugh at the TV for another 10 minutes, until the room cleared.\u201d It was a macabre and confrontational prank they pulled only once, Adsit said, noting that even some Second City members were uncomfortable with it. He gave credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 where it was due: \u201cIt was Adam McKay\u2019s idea.\u201dMcKay, like Hayes and Glass, has become invested in figuring out how to get audiences to enjoy the taste of vegetables. He is producing a documentary series at Amazon called \u201cThis Giant Beast That Is the Global Economy,\u201d which will explore such topics as the corruption-riddled world of concrete. He has signed on to direct a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence as Elizabeth Holmes, the Silicon Valley executive, indicted on charges of fraud, behind the disgraced health-services company Theranos. And, he told me, he has three ideas for movies about climate change, which he considers the ultimate vegetable: \u201cI have one that\u2019s epic, one that\u2019s comedic and one that\u2019s a poetic art film,\u201d he said. The comedy \u2014 the only one of these he would describe \u2014 concerns a group of Republican congresspeople from Oklahoma, forced to live in an air-conditioned dome after their state has been otherwise depopulated by global warming, unwilling to give up their seats despite their nonexistent constituency.If McKay ever makes this movie, it will be bleak, no matter how funny it turns out. He acknowledged that \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is a bleak movie, too, and that \u201cVice\u201d is bleaker still: \u201cIt does not send you back into the world feeling good.\u201d It was getting late in the afternoon. I could hear an animal whimpering in McKay\u2019s kitchen. It was the family\u2019s new puppy, a black-and-brown rescue named Timothy, who was being house-trained within a mesh-walled pen.McKay told me that not long after his heart attack, the last family pet, a beloved dog named Pumpkin, died. \u201cThat was tough,\u201d he said, and there was more where that came from. Last fall, Shira Piven was riding in a Lyft when another driver smashed into the car. An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where they took CT scans and M.R.I.s. Scrutinizing these, doctors discovered two troubling things: Piven\u2019s neck was broken and, what\u2019s more, there was a small growth in her chest, eventually diagnosed as malignant. \u201cLung cancer,\u201d McKay said. \u201cThey removed a quarter of her lung, and for a month you could barely hear her talk.\u201d Like McKay, Piven recovered, he said, but they were shaken. \u201cAnd then on top of all this, you\u2019re seeing democracy worldwide collapse, and we\u2019re getting scientific reports from the U.N. basically saying mankind will be extinct in 25 years. I have just never experienced a two-year period like the last two years.\u201dMcKay\u2019s comedies always carried dark undertones. Ferrell\u2019s protagonists might have registered as endearing buffoons, but their tendencies toward ignorance, selfishness, sexism, racism and/or jingoism were among the ways that McKay signaled mordant satirical intentions. It might be most accurate to say that, rather than abandoning comedy in his films, he has inverted the ratio between light and dark.But despite McKay\u2019s suspicion of \u201cold forms\u201d \u2014 despite his conviction that, circa 2018, the best use for a big megaphone is to deliver urgent and edifying messages as loudly as possible \u2014 spending all your time exploring the dark side can be wearying, especially if you spent much of your career chasing sillier and sillier ways to make strangers laugh. Making comedies, McKay was essentially a shadow cast member, yelling out impromptu jokes, midscene, for his actors to repeat, cracking them up as the cameras rolled. Far from disavowing his early movies, he recalled them proudly, describing the family-prayer scene in \u201cTalladega Nights\u201d \u2014 an improv-heavy sequence full of preposterous tangents about infant Jesus and Lynyrd Skynyrd \u2014 as \u201cthe best scene we\u2019ve ever done.\u201dOf his directorial approach, he told me that \u201cdoing a scene with Ferrell, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m out there with him,\u201d whereas, working with Bale and Adams on \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s very gentle, very subtle. If Ferrell\u2019s a Ferrari, meaning fast and fun, I feel like Bale and Adams are narwhals\u201d \u2014 a wondrous species of whale with a unicorn-like tusk, hard to find outside the Far North. \u201cYou\u2019re watching them, like: \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing this. I\u2019m gonna shut up. That\u2019s an actual narwhal. You can see the horn!\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed. \u201cOnce I have this magical moment, then I\u2019ll dare to wreck it.\u201dI reminded McKay of a moment of a much daffier sort that I observed years ago, during the making of \u201cAnchorman 2.\u201d McKay and Ferrell improvised an improbable erotic fantasy about Mrs. Butterworth, nowhere in the film\u2019s script, with each topping the other\u2019s jokes, relay-race style, and sent the entire set into bouts of convulsive laughter. McKay beamed at this memory. \u201cOh, I miss those days,\u201d he said, sounding suddenly homesick. Timothy was crying softly in the kitchen; the sun was setting; the sea ice was melting; the actual narwhals were imperiled. McKay shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re making me want to go do a comedy right now.\u201dJonah Weiner is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine and a contributing editor at Rolling Stone.Advertisement"}
