{"Headline": "In Luxury, What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpeakers at The New York Times International Luxury Conference, held Nov. 12-13 in Hong Kong, were asked what will be the luxury industry\u2019s greatest challenge in the next five years, and what will be its greatest focus. Here\u2019s what they said. (Comments have been edited for length.)It is indeed a turbulent world but one that also brings opportunities. Looking out five years, we continue to see both challenges and opportunities in e-commerce. Digital innovation, globalization and changes in consumer spending habits will continue catapulting the fashion industry into the midst of further seismic shifts.The challenges we foresee will center on the decline of brand loyalty, due largely to market fragmentation. With large e-platforms dominating the space, consumers will continue to gravitate to the fastest, broadest or cheapest, hence why the experiential aspect of e-commerce will become more explored. One of the key strategies at Fosun is called C2M, customer to maker \u2014 essentially a digital connection between consumer needs and smart manufacturing.The greatest challenge for the luxury industry over the next five years is keeping up with the rapid pace of change in new retail technologies which will enable luxury brands to engage their consumers in new and innovative ways.Biggest challenge in next five years: global recession driven by a slowdown in China and withdrawal of central bank support in the United States and Europe.At Nike, we are privileged to begin every project through the lens of sport. It is intrinsically human. It is universal. We believe, and we always have, that Nike\u2019s strength is in accessing the inherent empathy of our playing field.The future of luxury will be defined by the strength of that relationship. Nike\u2019s greatest opportunity is to leverage emerging technologies and data-driven craft to forge a new vision of bespoke \u2014 one where all athletes are able to collaborate directly with Nike to solve their discrete problems, however big or small. With sport as focus, this reimagined bespoke is democratic and holds up emotional connection as a critical component.As time is perceived as being ever more critical and precious, the brick-and-mortar shopping experience is in danger, particularly as millennials embrace the online shopping experience with which they are so familiar. A quick poll of millennials with whom I interact indicated that they generally purchase 80 percent to 90 percent of non-grocery goods over the internet, including luxury items.As consumers become more impact-oriented and demand transparency into the way their items are created, the luxury industry will have to prove the provenance of goods and verify they are ethically and sustainably produced. Blockchain can be used to bring efficiency and transparency to supply chains, while eliminating corruptibility, as records cannot be improperly changed or deleted. Beyond benefits to supply-chain processes, blockchain can also be used to create new incentive structures for both consumers and producers of luxury goods.Luxury\u2019s greatest challenge in the next five years will be to address the impacts of technology, as technology will lead younger generations of consumers away from traditional expectations of retail.Luxury\u2019s greatest new focus during this same period will be a renewed commitment to outstanding retail experiences.The rate of change in terms of customer expectations has become increasingly rapid. We always ask ourselves: \u201cHow will the world shop for fashion in five, 10, 20 years?\u201d I think this has to be the focus for all of us in luxury.Today\u2019s digital-first customers have been exposed to ultra-personalized experiences. Our favorite apps and internet companies know us, our preferences and give us an experience that is truly personalized. It is what consumers expect and demand. Offline retailers know nothing about us and learn nothing about us when we come in and after we leave.I think the most challenging part of our jobs is to figure out how to keep our brands relevant and meaningful for the future generation of clients.Digital has gone from being on the horizon to being where the growth in our industry will come from. Twenty-nine billion dollars in e-commerce today will become $150 billion by 2022, and that\u2019s just the direct sales \u2014 even our in-store transactions are influenced by interacting with brands online.As the luxury consumer is taking a new form, the ability to manage a brand\u2019s accessibility \u2014 while maintaining its exclusivity \u2014 will be the key to capturing and nurturing these clients. With this shift, now more than ever, influencers play an essential role in helping brands engage with this customer, acting as the middlemen to build relationships on behalf of the brands and serving as the trusted voices that consumers look to.Worldwide markets and consumer habits are changing radically and at an unprecedented pace. Our industry is changing more rapidly than ever before and companies must be ready to react at digital speed. In my view, to continue to play a leading role in the industry today, means to be as flexible as possible while keeping a strong vision and remaining faithful to the company\u2019s DNA.There is no reason to fight the change: Change must be embraced and welcomed. I believe that you must be open to change even when you are successful, without waiting the problems to come along. It\u2019s key to evolve rather than merely adapt.The greatest challenge is how to exploit the latest in technology to connect to consumers globally.In the long run, the Chinese consumer will continue to be a major growth engine for the global luxury industry, but their tastes and preferences are changing. We at J.P. Morgan believe that the greatest challenge the international luxury sector will face in the near future is maintaining the attention and interest of the growing Chinese wealthy class. Chinese consumers are starting to show a preference for local brands that offer high-quality products with designs tailored for unique domestic tastes. They are also beginning to hold back on spending as the markets become more volatile.Global luxury brands still have significant potential for growth in China, but global brands will have to continue to find new ways to attract consumers and maintain their loyalty.As Gen-Z consumers become increasingly important in terms of buying power and social influence, luxury players have to understand their psychologies, develop unique products and build authentic communications to engage with them.It is very important to embrace the benefits technology can provide and the tools to capture trends and data effectively. Data-driven analysis linked to e-commerce channels will be very powerful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Singles Day Sales Top $30 Billion. The Party May Not Last.", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 After 24 hours of frenzied buying and selling, and weeks of advertising and promotions before it, the Alibaba Group announced that its sales hit another titanic high on Singles Day, the Nov. 11 shopping festival that the Chinese e-commerce behemoth cooked up a decade ago.This time, as China\u2019s vast economy slows, the party was held with icebergs in sight from the deck.But all around China, gloom and uncertainty are the word.Meanwhile, some young Chinese shoppers seem less enthused this year about celebrating manic consumerism.Yang Sun, a 26-year-old from the northern city of Xi\u2019an, said that the Singles Day discounts were no longer good enough to persuade her to wait all year to buy the things she wanted. Wang Xin, 24, an engineer in Shanghai, said he had rediscovered the joys of shopping offline.\u201cSingles Day just doesn\u2019t hold that much appeal for me,\u201d Mr. Wang said.Asked about the current mood among Chinese consumers, Joseph C. Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, told reporters on Sunday that Alibaba should be understood in the context of the epochal rise of China\u2019s middle class.\u201cThat trend is not going to stop, trade war or no trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cAny kind of short-term economic effects, we believe, will be cyclical.\u201dAlibaba is not like Amazon in that it is not a retailer. It merely provides the digital shelves and aisles for other merchants to sell their goods. But in its relentless ambition, Alibaba may be Amazon\u2019s only global equal. Both companies want to fulfill their customers\u2019 every desire and need.The business case for all this empire-building, Alibaba says, is that the company\u2019s lakes of commercial data give it a leg up in anything that requires understanding customers or merchants.But Wall Street is still waiting for results, and has grown skeptical in the meantime of the costs of expanding into new areas. Alibaba\u2019s shares have lost nearly one-third of their value since June.Singles Day 2018 showed that Alibaba remains, if nothing else, China\u2019s king of hype. During the broadcast event, the M.C.s periodically encouraged people watching at home to open up their phones and check out the great deals. As acrobats with Cirque du Soleil twirled in midair, the logo of Kukahome, a Chinese furniture maker, shone brightly behind them.At one point, the performer Liu Wei rapped out the specs of a new model of Skoda sport utility vehicle.Anna Lin, a 25-year-old who works in finance in Shanghai, said she was feeling more lukewarm about the whole thing than in years past. Singles Day is now just one of many big shopping festivals each year, she said.Plus, Ms. Lin said, the Singles Day promotions have become increasingly baroque. This year, there were coupons for specific items and brands, coupons that were available only at certain times of day, and coupons that appeared randomly and could be grabbed only by playing a game. Gathering friends into a team could help you collect even more coupons.\u201cThat\u2019s too much work,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cIt also isn\u2019t worth it when you realize that after you\u2019ve done all that, all you\u2019ve got is 10 to 15 percent off, or even less.\u201d\u201cMy time is more valuable than that,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cI honestly think all the math is a way to hide the fact that there isn\u2019t much of a discount.\u201dAlibaba does not lack for other methods of subtle persuasion on Singles Day. If you had opened your Taobao shopping app on Sunday, you would have seen how your spending that day ranked against that of other people in your area.The company\u2019s methods for ginning up excitement have come under scrutiny before. Two years ago, Alibaba said that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating it for the way it reports Singles Day sales. The company\u2019s preferred metric, gross merchandise value, is supposed to represent the amount of money that changes hands on its platforms. But there is no standardized way of calculating it.The company has since de-emphasized the number. But the episode illustrated the way that Alibaba sees itself \u2014 as a company that breaks the mold.Ever since Alibaba listed its shares in New York four years ago, the company has used a sense of manifest destiny to beguile investors, stock analysts and an eager news media. China was on the long road to middle-class prosperity, the company said, and Alibaba had the biggest tollbooth. A bet on Alibaba was a bet on China itself.Now, though, it is clear that Alibaba\u2019s privileged place in China\u2019s rise is not guaranteed.In takeout delivery, for instance, Alibaba is facing off against several wealthy rivals. It has made big bets that have struggled, including on the troubled bike-rental company Ofo.No one expects Alibaba to generate whopper Singles Day sales growth numbers every year for eternity. At some point, when growth starts decelerating quickly, the event could change, to focus on one week\u2019s sales instead of one day\u2019s, or on something else entirely.Alibaba\u2019s track record suggests that when the time comes, it will have no trouble pulling off another act of conjuring.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about Alibaba at all,\u201d said Steven Zhu, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm Pacific Epoch. \u201cThese guys are really good at creating things from nothing.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

And now, they want to direct the nation\u2019s talent and tech acumen toward an even loftier end: building an innovation-driven economy, one that produces world-leading companies.Not long ago, Chinese tech firms were best known for copying Silicon Valley.GoogleBaiduYouTubeYoukuInstagramDouyinUberDidiBut the flow of inspiration now runs both ways. American social media executives look to Tencent and ByteDance for the latest tricks for keeping users glued to their phones.Tencent\u2019s WeChat app, an all-in-one hub for socializing, playing games, paying bills, booking train tickets and more, paved the way for the increasingly feature-stuffed chat apps made by Facebook and Apple. Facebook recently took a page from TikTok, a Chinese service that is a sensation among Western tweens, by releasing its own highly similar app for creating goofy short videos.If people in the West didn\u2019t see this coming, it was because they mistook China\u2019s authoritarianism for hostility toward technology.But in some ways Chinese tech firms are less fettered than American ones. Witness the backlash against Big Data in the United States, the calls to break up giants like Facebook and the anxiety about digital addiction. None of those are big problems for Chinese companies.In China, there is pretty much only one rule, and it is simple: Don\u2019t undermine the state.So titans like Weibo and Baidu heed censorship orders. Unwanted beliefs and ideologies are kept out.Beyond that, everything is fair game. Start-ups can achieve mammoth scale with astonishing speed; they can also crash brutally. Thanks to weak intellectual property protections, they can rip one another off with abandon \u2014 not great for rewarding innovation, but O.K. for consumers, who get lots of choices.And the money just keeps flowing in.$25 billionUnited States2015China10520102011201220132014201520162017\u201918$25 billionUnited States2015China105\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917\u201918$25 billionUnited States2015China10520102011201220132014201520162017\u201918In another advantage, old-school industries like media, finance and health care have been dominated by lumbering state-run giants. That has allowed internet champions like Alibaba and Tencent to sew themselves into these businesses with ease.With their mobile payment platforms, the two giants have built sprawling ecosystems in which vast amounts of commercial activity now take place. Little remains of daily life that has not been transformed. Shopping. Getting a loan. Renting a bike. Even going to the doctor.This level of clout hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by China\u2019s leaders. Never in the Communist era have private entities wielded such influence over people\u2019s lives.To keep tech in its place, the government is demanding stakes in companies and influence over management. Regulators have reprimanded online platforms for hosting content they deem distasteful \u2014 too raunchy, too flirty, too creepy or just too weird.That\u2019s why the best way for tech companies to thrive in China is to make themselves useful to the state. Nearly everyone in China uses WeChat, making the social network a great way for the authorities to police what people say and do. SenseTime, whose facial recognition technology powers those fun filters in video apps, also sells software to law enforcement.The risk for these companies is that the government demands more, sucking away resources that could be better spent chasing innovations or breaking into new markets.In China, says Lance Noble of the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, the government\u2019s support \u201ccan be a blessing and a curse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jin Yong, 94, Lionized Author of Chinese Martial Arts Epics, Dies", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Jin Yong, a literary giant of the Chinese-speaking world whose fantastical epic novels inspired countless film, television and video game adaptations and were read by generations of ethnic Chinese, died on Oct. 30 in Hong Kong. He was 94.Jin Yong received his start as a novelist in the mid-1950s while working as a film critic and editor for The New Evening Post in Hong Kong, which was then a British crown colony. He had moved there in 1948 and lived there for most of his life.From 1955 to 1972, Jin Yong wrote 14 novels and novellas and one short story in the popular genre known as wuxia, which consisted mainly of swashbuckling martial arts adventures.His first wuxia novel, \u201cThe Book and the Sword\u201d (1955), drew its inspiration from a legend that held that the Manchu emperor Qianlong was in fact a Han Chinese who had been switched at birth. The novel was serialized in The New Evening Post and became an instant hit.By the time he began writing, the Chinese Communist Party had banned wuxia literature, calling it \u201cdecadent\u201d and \u201cfeudal.\u201d The ban reflected a centuries-old view of wuxia as a marginal genre within the Chinese literary tradition.But in Hong Kong and other parts of the Chinese diaspora, Jin Yong\u2019s novels helped spearhead a new wave of martial arts fiction in the 1950s and \u201860s.Jin Yong elevated what had been a rather formulaic genre by blending in poetry, history and fantasy to create hundreds of vivid characters who travel through a mirror underworld that operates according to its own laws and code of ethics.In tales of love, chivalry, friendship and filial piety, his characters are flawed, with complex emotional histories, making them all the more appealing.Translated into many languages, his books have sold tens of millions of copies, fueling a sprawling industry of film, television and video game adaptations.Jin Yong used martial arts fiction as a vehicle to talk about Chinese history and traditional culture, forging his own fictional vernacular that drew heavily on classical expressions. His stories were often set at pivotal moments in Chinese history, like the rise and fall of dynasties. They made reference to Confucian, Buddhist and Taoist ideas, and positioned martial arts as an integral part of Chinese culture, alongside traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and calligraphy.Following the early success of his novels, Jin Yong established his own newspaper, Ming Pao Daily News, in Hong Kong in 1959. Soon he was publishing installments of his novels while writing daily social commentaries about the horrors of Mao Zedong\u2019s China.It was a subject he was intimately familiar with: In 1951, his father had been labeled a \u201cclass enemy\u201d and was executed by the Communists.In 1981, as China was beginning to open up economically and politically, Jin Yong traveled to Beijing to meet with Deng Xiaoping, Mao\u2019s successor. Deng confessed that he was an avid fan of Jin Yong\u2019s books.Not long afterward, China lifted its ban on Jin Yong\u2019s novels. At the time, many young Chinese were eager to read something other than the socialist propaganda they had become accustomed to under Mao.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018In 1985, Jin Yong was appointed to a political committee charged with drafting Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law, the mini-constitution that would govern that semiautonomous city once Britain handed it over, ending colonial rule. He drew criticism for backing a conservative proposal to select the city\u2019s leader without universal suffrage.Jin Yong\u2019s initial optimism about China\u2019s political opening was dashed by the government\u2019s bloody crackdown on the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989.Cha Leung-yung was born the second of seven children on March 10, 1924, in Haining, in the central coastal province of Zhejiang. His father, Zha Shuqing, was an educated landlord. His mother, Xu Lu, was from a wealthy business family.Jin Yong graduated from Soochow University\u2019s law school in 1948. By then he had begun working as a journalist and translator for the newspaper Ta Kung Pao in Shanghai. In 1948 he moved with the newspaper to Hong Kong, which would become his home for the next seven decades.He retired from writing novels in 1972. He stepped down as chairman of the Ming Pao Enterprise Corporation in 1993.Jin Yong is survived by his third wife, Lam Lok Yi, and his children from his second marriage: a son, Andrew, and two daughters, Grace and Edna.This year, the first installment of Jin Yong\u2019s popular trilogy, \u201cLegends of the Condor Heroes,\u201d was translated into English, by Anna Holmwood.Among readers of original Chinese versions, Jin Yong had no shortage of prominent fans. They include Jack Ma, the chairman of Alibaba, who at one point gave employees nicknames drawn from characters in the novels.Claire Fu contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How China\u2019s Rulers Control Society: Opportunity, Nationalism, Fear", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "They didn\u2019t like the West\u2019s playbook. So they wrote their own.As China grew richer, the West assumed, political freedoms would follow. Now it is an economic superpower \u2014 and the opposite has happened.In the dusty hillsides of one of China\u2019s poorest regions, Gong Wanping rises each day at 5:10 a.m. to fetch well water and cook her son\u2019s breakfast. She washes his feet while he keeps his nose in English and chemistry books. She hits him if he peeks at her cellphone.To Ms. Gong, 51, who dropped out of school, the future of her son, Li Qiucai, 17, is paramount. If Qiucai does well on the college entrance exam, if he gets a spot at a top university, if he can achieve his dream of becoming a tech executive \u2014 then everything will change.\u201cHe is our way out of poverty,\u201d she said.To achieve all this, Ms. Gong and millions of other Chinese like her have an unspoken bargain with the ruling Communist Party. The government promises a good life to anyone who works hard, even the children of peasants. In exchange, they stay out of politics, look away when protesters climb onto rooftops to denounce the forced demolition of their homes, and accept the propaganda posters plastered across the city.Ms. Gong is proud of China\u2019s economic success and wants a piece of it. Politics, she said, doesn\u2019t matter in her life. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the leaders,\u201d she said, \u201cand the leaders don\u2019t care about me.\u201dHow China became a superpowerFor years, many Western analysts believed the Chinese people, having endured decades of hardship under Mao, would tolerate one-party rule in exchange for rising incomes and more social freedom until the day \u2014 or so the argument went \u2014 that a newly prosperous nation would demand political freedoms, too.Instead, the opposite has happened. Income levels have jumped, yet China\u2019s authoritarian leaders have consolidated power. President Xi Jinping could be a ruler for life. China\u2019s people still place demands on the party, but the old assumption that prosperity inevitably stirs democratization is being challenged.It turns out that the unspoken bargain that binds Ms. Gong and others to the state is more complicated. It resonates, in part, because China is still intent on addressing the questions that it asked itself one century ago, before the Communist Revolution in 1949: What made it so weak and held it back as the West advanced? And what did it need to do to get ahead?Back then, the blame was placed on a conservative traditional culture that emphasized hierarchy, discouraged individual initiative and rewarded knowledge of Confucian classics over more practical topics like mathematics and science. The Communists sought to smash that culture through Marxist-inspired policies, but that ended in disaster.Yet China\u2019s leaders, and its people, have continued to look for answers, as the party crafts new ones that build on and reshape traditional culture without rejecting it entirely.The government has offered education as a path to social mobility, unleashed private enterprise by removing Confucian and Marxist stigmas against the merchant class and cultivated a potent brand of nationalism, blending pride and humiliation into a narrative of restoring Chinese greatness.But for many Chinese, those incentives are only part of the calculation. So, too, are the costs of rejecting the party\u2019s bargain.Over the years, the party has expanded its repressive capabilities.For some, like the ethnic minority Uighurs in Xinjiang, the country\u2019s turn toward hard-nosed authoritarianism has meant the devastation of entire families, cultural and religious practices and ways of life. For others, just the fear of repression is enough to keep them in line.It is impossible to know how many Chinese disapprove of the system. In private, many middle-class Chinese have voiced frustrations with, for example, Beijing\u2019s handling of the growing trade war with the Trump administration. But few dare to speak out.Memories of famine and political upheaval have shaped Ms. Gong\u2019s generation and are passed down in the form of whispered warnings: China has too many people. China is not ready for democracy. Stay out of politics. Don\u2019t ask questions.But so far, frustrations and fears have been overshadowed by the surge in pride \u2014 and the sense of opportunity \u2014 that has come from seeing the motherland\u2019s rise.Once, the allure of the West was considered irresistible; now many Chinese educated in Europe or the United States have returned, eager for their children to know a China that is proud and powerful. James Ni had a chance to study in America but instead remained in China and became a multimillionaire. Hua Yijia, a venture capitalist in Beijing, studied and worked in America but wants her 8-year-old daughter to take pride in being Chinese.\u201cI want her to understand the beauty of the language and the hard work and sacrifices of the people, especially in the countryside,\u201d Ms. Hua said. \u201cChina used to be a very backward country, but her generation will have so many more opportunities.\u201dMany analysts and Western diplomats are now confronting the likelihood that so much of what they assumed about how China would change \u2014 and become more like the West \u2014 is turning out to be wrong.\u201cThe Chinese mentality is very practical,\u201d said Xu Zhiyuan, a Beijing-based historian and writer. \u201cFrom a young age, you are told not to be idealistic, you are told not to be different. You are encouraged to survive, to compete, to excel within the system.\u201d\u201cThe whole society is a competitive playground.\u201dIt was Aug. 9, exactly 302 days until the college entrance exam, and Li Qiucai was frantic.In the halls of Huining No. 1 High School, in the northwestern province of Gansu, teachers were already turning up the pressure. The school is a powerhouse in producing rural students with top test scores, and teachers urged Qiucai to preserve the school\u2019s reputation and \u201cshine like the sun.\u201d Signs posted in the hallways warned that students must tolerate a little pain now to avoid a \u201clife of suffering.\u201dSince Qiucai began attending the school two years ago, his life has been a blur of late-night cram sessions, practice tests and mastering the art of finishing geometry problems while slurping noodles. He starts each day by running around a racetrack chanting, \u201cThe heavens reward industrious people!\u201dHe attends classes until almost 10 p.m., with only a short break on Sundays, and lives nearby in a $32-a-month apartment with his mother, who cooks and cleans so that he can study full time.All of it is pointed toward next June, when Qiucai will be one of nine million students taking a test that is at the core of China\u2019s high-stakes meritocracy \u2014 those who perform best get a ticket to the Chinese dream.\u201cOnly if I do well on the test,\u201d Qiucai said one recent night as he worked on physics problems, \u201ccan I have a better life.\u201dYet if the gaokao is a symbol of opportunity, it is also a tool of social control. Scholars say it is a clever governing tactic borrowed from the keju, the Confucian examination system that determined the selection of government officials in China for more than 1,300 years. Even in dynastic China, the keju lent the government an aura of meritocracy, as it was open to all men. But only 1 percent of applicants passed the exam for the highest degree, since few had the time and money to prepare.In a modern China rife with corruption, the gaokao is seen as relatively fair and incorruptible, meaning that those who fail are unlikely to blame the government.\u201cIt allows the government to say: \u2018If you are not successful, you can only blame yourself. You did not work hard enough,\u2019\u201d said Yong Zhao, an education professor at the University of Kansas. \u201cThat is a very powerful way of governing.\u201dThe gaokao was established in 1952, under Mao, and initially only students with class backgrounds deemed suitably red were allowed to apply. The test was suspended during the Cultural Revolution \u2014 the turbulent period in which teachers were beaten and schools shuttered \u2014 and then restored in 1977, after Mao\u2019s death. More than 10 million students rushed to take the exam, which was now more meritocratic, and open to almost anyone.In the decades since, the spread of basic literacy and numeracy, and the cultivation of top technical talent, have resulted in immeasurable economic gains. But the gaokao has contributed to concerns that China\u2019s education system overemphasizes rote memorization and instills values of obedience and conformity, not critical thinking.So some are opting for another way to get ahead: They apply to join the Communist Party.James Ni is fine with not being a member of the Communist Party. He is a fabulously wealthy private entrepreneur whose company, Mlily, is the official pillow and mattress partner of the English soccer club Manchester United. His goal is for Mlily to become a global brand.Growing up in a small town in Jiangsu Province, Mr. Ni came of age during China\u2019s once-unimaginable economic transformation. Private enterprise wasn\u2019t even legal when he was born in 1975. And once the state did open the door for private entrepreneurs, they faced persistent obstacles \u2014 as they still do even today.\u201cOf course, there are a lot of things that are unfair,\u201d Mr. Ni said. \u201cThe state-owned companies have an advantage. Those who have the right connections have an advantage. But in this environment of development and expansion, anyone can find their own way.\u201dToday, Mr. Ni estimates his personal wealth at $400 million. Many Chinese executives cozy up to local governments to gain advantages, but Mr. Ni says he keeps a distance from officials, hewing to a philosophy that \u201cit\u2019s better for business to stay business.\u201dIn the long view of Chinese history, it is remarkable how the country now embraces entrepreneurs, given the traditional Confucian condescension toward profit-seeking merchants. To catch up to the West, the party embraced market mechanisms and capitalist ideas not as end in itself but as a means through which to achieve national wealth and power.Party leaders have always worried that private business could evolve into an independent economic force, and some in the West predicted that capitalism could be a Trojan horse for democratization. Yet though Mr. Ni resists joining the party, he is fiercely patriotic, loves China and believes that, ultimately, party leaders want what is best for the country.\u201cThis country is my land,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as long as I live on this land, I will be comfortable and have self-respect. That is what\u2019s important to me.\u201dParty leaders legalized certain private enterprises in 1979 and made a historic shift in 2001 by accepting capitalists as members of the party itself.\u201cAllowing private entrepreneurs into the party really reinforced a certain mutual dependence between the party-state and the private economy,\u201d said Kellee Tsai, the dean of humanities and social sciences at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.Even so, the rules of competition have been tilted in favor of state-owned enterprises. Mr. Ni\u2019s first business venture, selling software, failed. He got into the bedding business after noticing the high prices of memory foam pillows in a shop display. But while state-backed companies could easily get bank loans, Mr. Ni, a private entrepreneur with no credit history, was shut out.Instead, Mr. Ni raised 500,000 renminbi \u2014 about $60,000 at the time \u2014 in seed money in 2003 from friends and family, with over half coming from a single cousin. These trust networks are at the heart of China\u2019s huge \u201cgray\u201d economy, operating outside the formal banking structure and providing an investment engine for a private sector.As Mr. Ni\u2019s company grew in Nantong, a city in Jiangsu Province, local cadres began to take notice. But Mr. Ni said they did not interfere because he complies with regulations, employs about 3,000 people and is a major tax contributor. That, in turn, helps the officials advance their careers by meeting production targets.And even when the party does hand down orders, there is sometimes room to push back. Four years ago, Mr. Ni\u2019s vice chairman told him that the government wanted the company to create a party cell inside Mlily.\u201cI said no,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt is just some middle-level officials trying to please higher-ups. It wasn\u2019t an order that came down from Xi Jinping.\u201dBut there are signs that under Mr. Xi, the space for maneuver may be shrinking. In recent months, leftist scholars, bloggers and government officials have publicly endorsed what appears to be a state-led shift away from free-market policies. Mr. Xi has recently sought to reassure private business leaders, praising their contribution to China\u2019s economic miracle, but his broader approach has favored the state-owned sector.\u201cToday you have the largest bureaucracy in history, with a capacity to intrude in anything,\u201d said William C. Kirby, a professor of China studies at Harvard. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just ideology. There are now enormous numbers of interest groups that don\u2019t like competition.\u201dFor guidance, Mr. Ni often looks to Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Alibaba, who is China\u2019s richest man and a cultlike figure among many businessmen. Mr. Ni is currently enrolled in a business school program that Mr. Ma established to cultivate China\u2019s next generation of entrepreneurs.Over the years, Mr. Ma has spoken publicly about the push-pull relationship between private companies and the government, though there is one piece of his advice for entrepreneurs that Mr. Ni seems to have especially taken to heart: \u201cFall in love. But don\u2019t marry.\u201dOver time, Hua Yijia felt the pull of China. The feeling surprised her.Living in Boston, Ms. Hua had received an elite education in the United States, landed a consulting job and even contemplated applying for American citizenship. She loved jazz and American pop culture.But more than a decade after she left China, she decided to return in 2007.Part of it was opportunity: a job prospect at a consulting firm in Beijing. Part of it was a tinge of disillusionment: She had seen Chinese friends hit a \u201cbamboo ceiling\u201d in corporate America, even as the careers of friends in China seemed to be taking off. And part of it was something deeper: a desire to help the country catch up with the West and to reconnect with her Chinese roots.Now a partner at a venture capital firm, Ms. Hua, 44, has a daughter whose elementary school offers a steady dose of Tang dynasty poems, calligraphy lessons and excursions to ancient sites. \u201cShe needs to know where she came from,\u201d Ms. Hua said.Exposed to liberal democracy, Ms. Hua\u2019s generation was supposed to be the one that demanded it at home. Middle-class Chinese students poured into universities in the United States and Europe \u2014 then seen as the most promising path to wealth and prestige \u2014 and some Western analysts predicted that they would return to China as a force for political change.Like many other middle-class parents, Ms. Hua worries about repression and rampant materialism in Chinese society. Yet many of these parents say they want their children to see themselves as Chinese above all else \u2014 to understand China\u2019s roots as an agrarian society and to have a sense of pride in the perseverance of the Chinese people through decades of poverty and strife.Patriotism has run through centuries of Chinese history, uniting the country in difficult times and, more recently, blending a pride in the cultural legacy of China\u2019s civilization with deep resentment over the humiliations at the hands of foreign powers during the colonial era. It is a volatile mix that the party skillfully manipulates to stir the feeling that China needs to stand up in the world.Even as some analysts argue that China\u2019s success has more to do with the resilience of its people than the Communist Party and its policies, leaders have been adept at shaping a politicized nationalism that reinforces the primacy of the party \u2014 and defends the authoritarian model as the best bulwark against chaos.\u201cChinese nationalism binds the people with the state, not to each other,\u201d said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.Mr. Xi has selectively revived traditional Chinese culture \u2014 an effort, experts say, to give people something to be proud of. That approach, however, is rich with historical irony. Both the modernizers who overthrew the Qing dynasty and then Mao and his communists once blamed Chinese tradition for holding the country back.But with communist ideology long ago having lost its appeal to the public, Mr. Xi is drawing on Chinese tradition to reinforce the idea that the country needs a strong leader to prevent chaos and to guard against outsiders. That leaves some worrying that he could be leading the country into a new period of isolation.\u201cOpening up and learning from the West is not a humiliating thing,\u201d said Zhu Dake, a scholar and cultural critic in Shanghai. \u201cChinese culture is not a self-enclosed culture, and our greatness is not wholly self-created. Unfortunately this is a minority point of view.\u201dMs. Hua\u2019s apartment complex overlooking Chaoyang Park in central Beijing is covered with propaganda posters, including displays celebrating \u201csocialist\u201d values like \u201cpatriotism\u201d and \u201chonesty.\u201d She said she worried that it had become nearly impossible to criticize the country without being labeled unpatriotic, and she is uneasy with tightening censorship and information control.\u201cI\u2019m a Chinese citizen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I think everything in China is great.\u201dBut if she has grievances, she still believes society is moving in the right direction \u2014 and has made peace with waiting. \u201cTwo steps forward, one step backward,\u201d she said.Ms. Hua has started to take her daughter on trips to poor parts of China, to show her the vast inequalities that still persist, even in an age of mobile payments and self-driving cars. She hopes her daughter will live in a more tolerant China, one still open to the outside world.But that is not the same as wanting China to be just like the West.\u201cI hope my daughter will have the chance to be exposed to different worlds and different cultures,\u201d she said. \u201cBut she was born in China. She grew up here. She will always need some understanding of who she is and what it means to be Chinese, from the very beginning.\u201dJavier C.

Its purchases are delivered by JD\u2019s Luxury Express service, a delivery man wearing a suit and white gloves.It also has Tmall, its business-to-consumer platform, which traditionally leans toward fashion and apparel, and Luxury Pavilion, an invitation-only portal for high-end goods introduced in August 2017.Douyin (its international version is known as Tik Tok) is the younger, edgier \u201cnew kid\u201d live-streaming site with shareable, snappy video content, as well as memes and GIFs to which users can add music, sound effects and emoticons.The retail app, which began as a platform for review and discussion of products purchased abroad, says that trust is at the heart of what it promotes.

{"Headline": "The Crash and Burn of Dolce & Gabbana", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRacism and arrogance about China has imperiled the brand.\u201cThe purpose of burning my clothes is to awaken the Chinese people and the Chinese nation,\u201d said Mr. Xiang, who posted photos online of his products in flames. \u201cSome people say you\u2019ve wasted a lot of money. I\u2019m willing to waste this money for the nation\u2019s dignity.\u201dThe dominoes begin to fall. The pigeons come home to roost. The rats abandon the sinking ship. You become a veritable paragon of clich\u00e9s! And a cautionary tale. After all, in the four days since, the brand has, in no short order:Been forced to cancel the show;Been excoriated by the Chinese celebrities and models slated to walk in the show;Been the subject of videos of consumers burning, destroying and otherwise renouncing their Dolce products;Had their physical locations altered, with the label\u2019s storefronts plastered with \u201cNot me\u201d posters mocking Mr. Gabbana\u2019s response to the scandal;And increasingly been abandoned by its European and American supporters, including the influencers the brand has expensively wooed over the last few years.Net-a-Porter, the luxury e-tailer headquartered in London and owned by Richemont, has removed all Dolce products from their Chinese website. Lucky Blue Smith, a model/influencer with 3.2 million followers on Instagram who has become a millennial Dolce staple, posted a note on his account explaining his decision to skip the show that read in part, \u201cWe are all gods children and we should all be treating EVERYONE, EVERY CULTURE with respect. I will be back to China soon \u2014 love you all so much.\u201dAnd apparently fearful of damage by association, fellow Italian brand MaxMara made a proactive statement Thursday on its WeChat account, stating \u201cChina, you\u2019re the best! I love you, homeland!\u201dSpokespeople for Secoo and Net-a-Porter could not remember either company ever dropping a brand for such reasons before. As Angelica Cheung, the editor of Vogue China, wrote in an email, \u201cThis case is a wake-up call: a 1.4 billion population is for sure a huge consumption power, but if you don\u2019t get it right, hundreds of millions of people voicing their outrage on social media is a powerful force, hard to ignore.\u201dDolce & Gabbana released three statements, first saying its accounts had been hacked, then offering words of support for the people who worked on the canceled show and declarations of love for China. But it wasn\u2019t until the end of the week that the founders officially apologized in a video in Mandarin. They seemed to have underestimated the importance of Chinese national identity while also overestimating their place in the wider fashion ecosystem.The hacking excuse, which could have been accepted at face value as a way for supporters to embrace the brand, has had almost no traction, in part because of Mr. Gabbana\u2019s history of hitting back at any criticism of the brand on his Instagram feed. Though traditionally the brand has seemed impervious to such controversies \u2014 indeed, has seemed to thrive on being politically incorrect \u2014 this time is different.As Susie Bubble, a London-based critic, street style star and front-row regular, posted to her 440,000 Instagram followers, \u201cthis is yet another example of a misguided diva creative director in the upper echelons of the industry throwing his weight around and vomiting over social media in a reckless manner that impacts on a billion dollar company with thousands of employees as well as umpteen parts of the industry that would have been flown into Shanghai for what was supposed to be a media/celebrity fueled extravaganza.\u201d Estelle Chen, the Victoria\u2019s Secret model, had a similar reaction, writing: \u201csaying your accounts (both personal and official: Dolce & Gabbana) were hacked shows how much of a coward you are. Could you please at least take responsibility for your behavior?\u201dThe brand\u2019s track record of insensitivity has not helped. Dolce has been called out in recent years for labeling a $2,395 pair of shoes \u201cslave sandals\u201d (in 2016; they later changed the name to the more innocuous \u201cdecorative flat sandal\u201d) and including earrings that looked like they were made of blackamoor faces in a 2012 collection. They have also banned a number of critics from shows (The Times has not been invited to a Dolce show for over a decade; Women\u2019s Wear Daily, W magazine, Italian Vogue and Vanity Fair have also been rejected at various times).Dolce & Gabbana is also the only major Italian brand that has refused to join the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiano, Italian fashion\u2019s governing organization and lobbying group, and does not appear on the official Milan Fashion Week schedule. As a result, Carlo Capasa, the president of the Camera della Moda, which has always been fiercely protective of Italian brands and industry and which might have been expected to come to the brand\u2019s defense, simply said he couldn\u2019t make a statement about the situation because Dolce was not a member.The Chinese government, though, seems to be taking steps to try to tone down the reaction. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, when asked about the controversy, said: \u201cThe Chinese side does not want this matter to rise to a diplomatic issue.\u201dChinese state media also sought to limit the fallout. Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times, called on consumers to be \u201cmore open-minded.\u201d\u201cDolce & Gabbana was undoubtedly wrong, but sins do not equate to death,\u201d Mr. Hu wrote on Friday on his Weibo account.Mr. Cavender, the analyst, was not so sure. \u201cThe reality is this is probably going to kill growth for them,\u201d he said. The last time a consumer boycott erupted on this scale in China was in 2017 over South Korea\u2019s embrace of an American missile defense system that China feared could be used to spy on its territory. Back then, protesters besieged branches of Lotte Mart, a South Korean supermarket chain. This year, it closed all of its stores in China.Advertisement"}

That was the future Silicon Valley\u2019s greatest claim to fame in the 1920s, when it was a sleepy landscape of fruit orchards and farms far removed from the nation\u2019s industrial might. Seattle was a city of fishing and timber, where a young entrepreneur named Bill Boeing had so few customers for his airplanes that he briefly pivoted to making furniture. The most innovative companies in the world clustered in the ferociously inventive cities of the East and Midwest \u2014 cars in Detroit; cash registers in Dayton, Ohio; light bulbs in Cleveland.The high-tech geography began to flip in the 1950s, as electronics and aerospace boomed. Before the Eisenhower era was over, cities across the country and across the globe had started racing to capture some of the West Coast\u2019s high-tech magic. Silicon Valley and Seattle are now a long way from biplanes and prunes.So what can the new HQ2 city or cities learn from high-tech history?First and foremost: Yes, tech companies are a prize worth chasing. They offer jobs that are well-paying and productive, and attract a highly educated work force. Under the right conditions \u2014 the presence of strong research universities, access to capital and a quality of life that draws people in and keeps them there \u2014 a well-rooted tech community can seed several successive generations of companies, with the entrepreneurs of one era becoming mentors and investors and civic philanthropists in the next.This is what happened in Boston, in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, whose tech scene includes not only Amazon and Microsoft but also a wide variety of spinoff companies, as well as Facebook, Google, Alibaba and Baidu.San Francisco and Seattle were ill prepared for the tech wave that hit in the past decade. Current responses range from the promising but piecemeal (Amazon subsidizing additional city bus service in Seattle) to the impractical and divisive (San Francisco considering a ban on employee cafeterias in new office buildings to force tech workers to patronize local restaurants). Although tech companies and cities often find themselves fiercely opposed in these debates \u2014 most hotly in the recent attempt by Seattle to tax large employers like Amazon to pay for homeless services \u2014 there is some recognition on both sides that the current patterns are unsustainable.This means breaking out of the bubble and redefining the corporate bottom line to include measures that reduce inequality, sustain existing small businesses and protect housing affordability, and, yes, even supporting cities in raising the tax revenue they need.This isn\u2019t an impossible dream. The secret of Silicon Valley wasn\u2019t tax breaks and cheap real estate; it was a postwar era of generous public spending on research and education, as well as on affordable housing and public infrastructure. These investments were designed to help everyone, but they were critical to helping tech flourish.No place or industry rules forever. Ask Detroit, once the most innovative place in America. The new capitals of tech should not take this prosperity for granted.Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is a bad time of the year to sell new equity and Tencent has already pared back its plans. A subdued deal would confirm fears that the window for sizable offerings is closing fast.A global stock sell-off has already hit Tencent\u2019s plan to spin off its majority-owned streaming arm, which owns the QQ Music app. In May, the $354 billion gaming and social media company hoped to raise as much as $4 billion in a deal that would have valued Tencent Music Entertainment at $25 billion, sources told International Financing Review. The Chinese company delayed its October plan to go public after halving the size of its planned offer, according to Reuters.Large investors in the United States prefer to shy away from big deals during the festive period. Just three companies have launched December New York offerings of more than $1 billion in the past decade, according to data from Refinitiv. Tencent would stretch the precedent: The Financial Times says shares of the music unit will start trading on Dec. 12, later than any of these earlier year-end offerings.Other Chinese technology outfits rushing to market have had to lower their valuations. The Alibaba-backed parenting site, Babytree, has just priced its Hong Kong debut at the bottom of the marketed range, valuing it at $1.5 billion, compared to the $2 billion it was pegged at earlier this year. The online travel agent Tongcheng-Elong, which counts Tencent as its largest shareholder, set its I.P.O. valuation almost 30 percent lower than in a May funding round.The execution risk hardly seems worthwhile. Tencent Music doesn\u2019t obviously need fresh funds: The unit is already profitable and had roughly 9.5 billion yuan, or around $1.4 billion, in cash as of June, according to its I.P.O. prospectus.Anything less than a strong and compelling deal before New Year\u2019s will signal a gloomy year ahead for others waiting to I.P.O.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Libraries, Gardens, Museums. Oh, and a Clothing Store.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShopping areas in Asia are about the experience, not just the retail sale.But train your ears toward another direction. In Asia, an entirely different story is being sung: one full of glimmer and potential; one that is not limited to luxury products but treats all customers as if they were buying luxury; one in which consumers are drawn like magnets to the physical reality of a \u2014 what to call it? Not a bazaar, really, or an arcade, or a plaza. An immersive aesthetic experience with shopping as a byproduct, perhaps.In Seoul, the 30,140-square-foot library in the COEX Mall includes approximately 50,000 books and magazines to browse, and offers couches and reading tables for passers-by as well as serving as a venue for cultural events.In Siem Reap, Cambodia, the 86,000-square-foot T Galleria by DFS (yes, the \u201cduty free\u201d folks, though this is not your standard airport experience) houses a multitude of brands alongside reflecting pools, verdant gardens and work from local artisans.To name a few.Together, these projects embody a new way of thinking about the physical space where stores congregate, one that borrows from the online playbook: prioritizing the idea of content over contents, and further demonstrating the way in which the real and virtual worlds increasingly intertwine. Not because they offer video screens or iPads for ordering (though they are on hand) but because of a more fundamental conceptual connectivity.\u201cIt\u2019s a core reality shift,\u201d said Scott Malkin, the founder and chairman of Value Retail. \u201cThe war is over. Alibaba won. That means physical retail is no longer about the distribution of goods but building brand equity.\u201dAnd brand equity is created via the subliminal communication of ephemeral values: service and touch \u2014 what Mr. Malkin calls \u201cthe software\u201d that surrounds the \u201chardware\u201d of bricks and mortar (and marble and sandstone) reality. Which then becomes the place, he said, \u201cwhere the interface behavior occurs.\u201d\u201cThe context for stores is more and more important,\u201d said Luca Solca, head of luxury goods research at Exane BNP Paribas, \u201cbecause you have to make people want to get out of their homes and away from their screens.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the store itself,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s retail counter-standardization.\u201dIf the old model \u2014 the merch emporium \u2014 gave way during the turn of the millennium to the flagship model, which saw stores become echoing and somewhat austere temples where consumers worshiped the handbag on the plinth, we are now entering a new stage. One embodied more by Apple or Starbucks than any previous fashion retail space.One that takes the rising principles of the experience economy and the growing belief that millennial consumers \u2014 who hate anything smacking of marketing or overt product pushing \u2014 are increasingly choosing to spend their money on the unique event rather than on the aspirational product, and applies them to shopping.One that says investing in a value system that surrounds the shopping experience will pay off in consumption. Because instead of taking home a postcard or a T-shirt to remember the visit, you take home a Prada shoe, or a Dior dress.Mr. Cheng first began exploring these principles in 2009 in his K-11 Art Mall developments in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Guangzhou, which originally combined art and shopping elements \u2014 a mix of high and consumer culture previously seen as heretical \u2014 and then expanded from there. The Shanghai Art Mall, for example, includes an urban farm where visitors can grow herbs that they eventually take home for their dinner. It\u2019s not an obvious sales driver but, Mr. Cheng said on stage at The New York Times International Luxury conference in Hong Kong last week, foot traffic went up dramatically after it was opened.Not that the point was \u201cabout traffic,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building a community. About grooming the audience and having access to their behavior, which then continues online.\u201d The farm is the bait, in a sense.Going to a store, Mr. Malkin said, \u201cshould feel like going to a hotel or resort, where you are taking away a memory because you are touched by an emotion you want to revisit.\u201d As a retailer, this means \u201cyou are not serving a person who needs an item,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are serving a person who needs an experience.\u201d And that changes how the retailer does things.Mr. Solca said he believed this kind of strategic approach would form a new model for global retail. Mr. Malkin agrees.\u201cThe reality is our experience in China will set the gold standard for what\u2019s possible in other international locations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s driving our thinking about the future.\u201dJust whatever you do, don\u2019t call it a \u201cshopping center.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Promise of China", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWestern luxury money has been pouring into China at a rapid rate this fall.Next, Cond\u00e9 Nast International unveiled plans for Vogue Hong Kong, the 26th global version of the fashion title with a print edition published in the traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong and a bilingual website, in Chinese and English. Then, in its latest earnings call, Ralph Lauren said it had opened 10 additional stores in mainland China in the last quarter, putting it on track to open more than 50 by the end of 2019. And Coach said it would stage its first runway show in China on Dec. 8, a blockbuster spectacle and after-party titled \u201cCoach Lights Up Shanghai.\u201dChina\u2019s great luxury promise appears to have the sector\u2019s biggest power players well and truly in its thrall. But in the background, dark clouds have also been gathering.A brewing trade war with the United States, the weakening renminbi and the sputtering growth of China\u2019s economy in recent months all have executives on edge. During the fall Golden Week, a holiday period around the Oct. 1 National Day observance when many Chinese consumers splurge on travel and luxury goods, sales grew at the slowest pace since 2000, according to data from China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce.The painful luxury industry downturn that occurred worldwide between 2013 and 2016 in the wake of a Chinese government clampdown on corruption and a spate of terrorist attacks in Europe \u2014 ending years of soaring sales growth \u2014 is still fresh in the minds of many. Could a similar situation be about to unfold again?An inflection point came in early October, at the end of Golden Week, when social media posts showing emptied shopping bags, luggage searches and snaking lines at airport customs checks suggested that the state was cracking down on the practice known as daigou, when Chinese travelers buy high-end merchandise on trips abroad and sell the items at a profit after they return home. Spooked that the appetite for luxury goods in China could tip into a rapid slump, investor jitters prompted a global market sell-off, largely hitting European players such as LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Kering, Richemont, Burberry and Prada. Companies in the United States, like Tapestry and Tiffany & Co., also felt the strain.Some brands have sounded notes of caution about the current and future state of Chinese consumer confidence.\u201cIn the past few months I would say there has been a slowing down of consumption, and probably the Chinese consumer is becoming more careful in what he or she does,\u201d said Ermenegildo Zegna, chief executive of the Italian men\u2019s luxury house of the same name. \u201cI am more cautious than three months ago. For next year, we are going to plan a conservative budget because there are many uncertainties in the air and you have to be realistic.\u201dSo what will come next for a sector that Bain & Co. still predicts will grow by 6 to 8 percent, to \u20ac281 billion from \u20ac276 billion, this year? Given the money still being plowed into the region by brands and investors alike, could the stock market be overreacting?\u201cClearly stocks were hit dramatically in past weeks, with investors keen to avoid being stung as they were in the last downturn,\u201d said Erwan Rambourg, global co-head of consumer and retail research at HSBC. \u201cHowever, it is possible that these macro fears are overextended and we can expect more of a soft landing.\u201cWe believe the current \u2018slowdown\u2019 is more to do with being a period of normalization, after two years of phenomenal growth,\u201d he added. \u201cThe sector decline will not be on as steep a slope as the market seems to expect.\u201dThomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods equity research at Citigroup, concurred. He noted that many luxury brands had re-evaluated their expansion strategies in China in recent years, particularly around retail networks, targeted digital marketing and pricing, so their business \u2014 and bottom lines \u2014 are better protected in the event of another cyclical downturn.He also added that luxury\u2019s latest bull run had not been wholly dependent on Chinese spending: The American market has improved significantly in the last year, while many brands have posted double-digit sales growth in both Europe and Japan.\u201cClearly China has been the white-hot engine for luxury growth lately \u2014 but this is also a global story, and price harmonization across markets is better than it was a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Chauvet said. \u201cThe central question now should be whether international demand drivers are still in place to support a healthy level of sales and earnings growth over the next 12 months as China moderates.\u201dHowever, some market observers have highlighted positive consumer trends in China. As the country looks for ways to shore up its domestic economy, the government crackdown on daigou and the lowering of import duties this summer to encourage consumers to make purchases at home rather than chasing lower prices abroad are likely to make their mark, according to Angela Wang, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group and co-author, with the Chinese investment holding conglomerate Tencent, of a recently published study on China\u2019s luxury market. She said that, although Chinese customers now are responsible for 32 percent of luxury goods sales worldwide, that number is still expected to grow to 40 percent by 2024 and power 75 percent growth of the global market. Unsurprisingly, millennials \u2014 particularly educated women \u2014 will be the driving force.\u201cLuxury shoppers in China have an average age of 28, a majority have college degrees and are far better educated than their parents,\u201d Ms. Wang said, noting that more than 50 percent of luxury customers now lived in second- and third-tier cities like Tianjin and Dalian, bolstering the importance of online platforms as there are few premium malls in those locations.\u201cSocial shopping is now 11 percent of total luxury commerce in China and growing at a tremendous rate,\u201d she added. \u201cAll this momentum won\u2019t disappear in the wake of the recent slowdown.\u201dThe fact that many major players have continued to double down on their presence in China despite the recent uncertainty suggests that long-term opportunities will continue to trump short-term volatility. Richemont\u2019s deal with Alibaba will allow sites like Net-a-Porter to begin business on Luxury Pavilion, an invitation-only luxury platform on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall site \u2014 even as many Western brands are continuing to be cautious in their embrace of Chinese e-commerce and alliances with local internet platforms, primarily because of fears of counterfeiting and the risk of diluting the exclusivity of their products. Also, the action follows an investment last year by JD.com, Alibaba\u2019s rival, in the luxury online marketplace Farfetch.\u201cOur digital offering in China is in its infancy,\u201d said Johann Rupert, Richemont\u2019s chairman, \u201cand we believe that partnering with Alibaba will enable us to become a significant and sustainable online player in this market.\u201dWestern companies are not the only ones looking farther afield to secure growth prospects.Despite the vast market on their doorsteps, a handful of Chinese luxury investors have been exploring a new market of their own in search of greater returns: Europe. This year, Shandong Ruyi bought the Swiss leather brand Bally while Fosun acquired the French fashion house Lanvin, both moves devised to reap profits from their countrymen\u2019s appetite for luxury marques that otherwise would go into the pockets of Western companies.The day after the event, Michael Evans, president of Alibaba Group, talked about it at The New York Times International Luxury Conference, held in Hong Kong: \u201cPart of the reason we invest so much into the infrastructure of Singles Day \u2014 a day where we delivered over one billion packages in 24 hours this year \u2014 is because we believe a time will come when we will be operating at that scale every single day.\u201dNow, eyes are turned to see how consumer desire for high-ticket handbags, ready-to-wear and sneakers \u2014 as well as lower-priced items such as cosmetics and fragrances \u2014 will fare during the important fourth quarter of the retail calendar.\u201cTo say that the luxury sector is entering another perfect storm would be too aggressive,\u201d said Mr. Chauvet, of Citigroup. \u201cThen again, when consumers don\u2019t feel a sense of optimism or feel worried about the world around them, luxury purchases are often the first to go. For now, the industry mode has got to be \u2018wait and see.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Business With No End", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "Where does this strange empire start or stop?Part I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InPart I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InWhere does this strange empire start or stop? Recently, one of my students at Stanford told me a strange story. His parents, who live in Palo Alto, Calif., had been receiving mysterious packages at their house. The packages were all different shapes and sizes but each was addressed to \u201cReturns Department, Valley Fountain LLC.\u201dI looked into it and found that a company called Valley Fountain LLC was indeed listed at his parents\u2019 address. But it also appeared to be listed at 235 Montgomery Street, Suite 350, in downtown San Francisco.There was little pattern or theme to what these Amazon shops sold. They had everything from hemorrhoid cream to desk lamps, and there were varying levels of inventory. On sale at DeepOceanStoreuk (a storefront on Amazon.uk associated with Bropastures LLC), I found a book on industrial electricity, a set of fake facial wounds and a \u201cNo Stress Tech Guide to Microsoft Works 8 & 8.5.\u201d Another storefront called Kingdom Kber, this one on Amazon.de and associated with Agapao LLC, advertised a miniature whale, nail gel and a copy of \u201cUndocumented Immigrants and Higher Education.\u201d When I clicked on these items, though, none of them were currently available. A good number of the storefronts were completely empty.One thing these LLCs had in common was that their registered agent was named Jonathan Park.Even though the packages being sent to my student\u2019s parents\u2019 home were addressed to Valley Fountain LLC, one of the packages had a return label taped to it that indicated it came from an Amazon store called Sendai Book Store. I looked it up and found that it was on several cautionary lists of unauthorized resellers, and had more than 400,000 things for sale. But once again, the offerings seemed chosen at random.I decided to order something: L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick (3 pcs) for $25.63. (I pretended not to see that the same item was listed at $10.74 by another reseller.)  Amazon informed me that the lipstick would come in two weeks; there was no tracking information. In this case, it seemed that Valley Fountain LLC and other companies were posing as traditional retailers \u2014 usually by setting up Amazon storefronts like Sendai Book Store \u2014 and were just reselling items from other Amazon storefronts at inflated prices. It sounds confusing, but ultimately, it\u2019s pretty similar to scalping concert tickets: A middleman makes money by ratcheting up the price.The items in many of the storefronts associated with 235 Montgomery, Suite 350 had an unusually long shipping time and consistently low stock, so it made sense that items purchased from them might be coming from elsewhere.While I waited for my lipstick, I returned to the list of LLCs, and noticed that there was something else that the companies had in common. According to LinkedIn and Facebook, at least a handful of the listed agents were alumni of Olivet University, a Bible college based in California.If Olivet University sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it has been in the news lately. Earlier this year its offices were raided as part of a fraud investigation being conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. As it also happens, here is where the story converged with another of my interests. My boyfriend had worked at Newsweek as an editor for a year. He was let go in April 2017.Newsweek\u2019s journalists also found that their company had offered about $149,000 worth of free advertising in the print magazine to New York\u2019s Dutchess County, where Olivet was turning an abandoned psychiatric hospital into a satellite campus of Olivet University. The deal \u2014 which resulted in 10 full-page ads promoting local tourism and the Hudson Valley Regional Airport \u2014 was facilitated by Marian Rebro, the president of the company overseeing the construction.\u201cOlivet University was not the subject of the visit,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything from the campus.\u201dSeveral of the Newsweek journalists who had worked on the investigation of their company and its relationship with Olivet University were fired earlier this year. A spokesperson for Newsweek Media Group declined to comment. I went to 235 Montgomery Street to check it out, and found a set of locked double doors outfitted with a camera, a blinking light and a card reader. On the building\u2019s directory, Suite 350 was listed as IBPort, Inc.Who could this cosmopolitan shopper be? It\u2019s hard to say.Until recently, Marian Rebro, the president of the Olivet-affiliated management company that is developing the abandoned psychiatric facility in New York, was listed on business websites as the manager of Everymarket Inc. But Mr. Rebro said, in a statement: \u201cI am not the founder of Everymarket.com. I may have advised the company at one point many years ago, but have never been an employee there.\u201d He also said: \u201cI am not, nor have I ever been, a manager or employee of Everymarket.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to see the oddly overpriced Essy Beauty peel-off mask or Asavea hair straightener as a kind of product version of clickbait. After all, what is the experience of clickbait other than realizing we have vastly overpaid, even if only with our attention?News, information and products are simply someone\u2019s inventory.This is what I thought a countless number of times!This has gotten some of the companies listed at 235 Montgomery in trouble.In another legal dispute, from February of this year, Adult Printed Diapers LLC sued Faithfulness LLC, another one of Mr. Park\u2019s companies, for selling \u201cAww So Cute\u201d diapers, which are an Adult Printed Diapers trademark. It\u2019s not clear where Faithfulness LLC got the Adult Printed Diapers diapers, but the lawsuit alleges that Faithfulness LLC\u2019s co-defendant in the lawsuit, Rearz, Inc., made an unauthorized purchase of diaper inventory directly from Adult Printed Diapers\u2019 supplier in Shandong, China.  On a recent visit to Leez, recognizable brands were mixed in with disconcerting objects, like a $59 hat that said \u201cOslo Iceland\u201d on it and something called \u201cGranny Attic Bubble Foam.\u201d Both items appeared to be made by JNG Korea Co. Ltd.Products from Little Martin\u2019s Drawer and Asavea were prominently displayed.A sorry assortment of wooden furniture haunted the second floor, while the third floor remained dark, empty and forbidding; visitors were informed that it is now an event rental space.Business cards displayed at Leez named Chris Liu as the Chief Operation Officer there. Chris Liu\u2019s Linkedin profile lists a previous position in Business Development at IBTimes Australia.Amid all of this, my lipstick arrived! Inside the package was an invoice for $10.75 from \u201cCrispy Beauty,\u201d an unfortunately named Amazon seller that was decidedly not Sendai Book Store, the store on Amazon I paid $25.63 for the lipstick. When I went back to Amazon and generated a return label, the address was for Valley Fountain LLC. I was not prepared for the way a simple question about some mysterious packages would spiral into a dizzying network of Amazon storefronts, web domains and badly written \u201cAbout us\u201d pages. But the more I looked into it, the more it seemed they were being run by a handful of people, each operating in different capacities depending on the needs of the moment. More surreal was how these websites were linked to the physical world. Chris L. also made sure to throw in a plug for the third floor: \u201cThe 3rd floor of the store is open for rent. It\u2019s quite spacious and bright. Good for all kinds of event.\u201d I decided I had to go to the San Francisco store.In what sounds like a thick Eastern European accent, he says that \u201cStevens\u201d is the last name of a man who was in the bookstore business for 60 years. \u201cThis gentleman is actually my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to work a couple years together, and this is in memory of him.\u201d There\u2019s a cut in the video, and then: \u201cHe\u2019s still alive, but this is like a tribute to him. That\u2019s why it is called Stevens Books.\u201d\u201cDo you want to check out those books?\u201d the guy asked. No, I said. I wanted to buy them. \u201cOh!\u201d he said, and then laughed to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2026 we\u2019re not a library.\u201d In an email in response to request for comment, Mr. Volansky wrote \u201cP&J Health anti-snoring devices and Piero Lorenzo wallets are not sold in Stevens Books.\u201d He said he was not the owner, and that the store and the brand were owned by the Stevens Books Group. \u201cI go by my own name, Stevens is a nickname because of Stevens Books,\u201d he wrote.Trying to map the connections between all these entities opens a gaping wormhole. I couldn\u2019t get over the idea that a church might be behind a network of used business books, hair straighteners, and suspiciously priced compression stockings \u2014 sold on Amazon storefronts with names like GiGling EyE, ShopperDooperEU and DAMP store \u2014 all while running a once-venerable American news publication into the ground.Indeed, at some point I began to feel like I was in a dream. Or that I was half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real, the local from the global, a product from a Photoshop image, the sincere from the insincere.Still harder for me to grasp was the total interpenetration of e-commerce and physical space. Standing inside Stevens Books was like being on a stage set for Stevens Books, Stevens Book, Stevens Book Shop, and Stevensbook \u2014 all at the same time. It wasn\u2019t that the bookstore wasn\u2019t real, but rather that it felt reverse-engineered by an online business, or a series of them. Being a human who resides in physical space, my perceptual abilities were overwhelmed. But in some way, even if it was impossible to articulate, I knew that some kind of intersection of Olivet University, Gratia Community Church, IBPort, the Newsweek Media Group, and someone named Stevens was right there with me, among the fidget spinners, in an otherwise unremarkable store in San Francisco.Speaking with Jonathan Park, and reaching out to Olivet, provided some kind of clarification. Mr. Park said: \u201cI currently own and operate several businesses that I started while I was at Olivet,\u201d but added that he does not operate many of the entities that he helped incorporate, and that some entities have been spun off and are not related to him anymore.He said he mentored students, including interns and graduates of Olivet, and helped them set up businesses from time to time: \u201cMy collaboration with Olivet was one of my life\u2019s best experiences because the University and its students have an entrepreneurial spirit and great aspirations. It is truly a privilege to work together with these bright and gifted individuals.\u201d The school and students, he said, \u201cpartnered and envisioned an incubating program similar to those of the leading research universities; including Stanford and Cornell. While Olivet and my businesses are of a different scale than that of Stanford\u2019s and Google\u2019s, this type of collaboration is commonplace today and has proven to be very successful and rewarding for the economy at large. Our results and volumes are not odd, but, I believe, are rather impressive and something to be proud of.\u201dOlivet was more vague in its statement, made through its spokesperson Ronn Torossian. He wrote, in full:\u201cFollowing the legacy of our (late) Honorary Chairman Dr. Ralph D. Winter, Olivet University has always looked for ways to encourage growth in mission frontiers. This influence shaped the founding vision from Dr. Jang, who, as a devout Christian, believes a Biblical worldview can be applied across all varieties of fields. In that same spirit, the University has always been happy to help evangelical business owners, and we\u2019ve had a good working relationship with IBTimes over the years. We are also proud of our business-as-mission network with various entrepreneurs going into the marketplace as part of our ongoing exploration into models about how to best plant churches and expand mission frontiers. We will continue to explore this paradigm. These are challenging times for Christian and secular higher education institutions alike. Olivet is continually learning the best ways to provide high quality education to raise leaders while developing sound and diversified income sources. One model is Stanford University, which derives 85% of its revenues from non-tuition sources including sponsored research. Olivet similarly recognizes the importance of finding new models for supporting education, and therefore the school encourages innovation and entrepreneurship for its student and alumni base. Many of our alumni are successful entrepreneurs in the U.S. and other countries and contribute to and partner with the University by donating, partnering on research projects, providing internship/training opportunities, and in other ways. We will continue promoting these values that have made America into the great country it has become. And we are proud of all our successful alumni and are thankful to all the friends, benefactors and partners of Olivet University.\u201d In the end, I decided to return the lipstick.The alleged schemes include fictitious auditors (named \u201cKaren Smith\u201d and \u201cLynn Chen\u201d) who came complete with their own fictitious emails, phone numbers and websites; networks of corporate bank accounts; and the computer server company, Oikos Networks, that is listed at 22 Cortlandt Street, which also happens to be the address where Olivet Institute, Stevens Books and Christian Media Corporation are all registered.The indictments include charges against Etienne Uzac, a co-owner of IBT (and one of the original founders of International Business Times); William Anderson, an Olivet trustee, former chief executive of Christian Media Corporation (and husband of Yen-Yi Anderson); and John Xiao, Olivet\u2019s finance director and dean of Olivet Business School. The general manager of Oikos is named only as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator.\u201dI wondered about the fate of my overpriced L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick and who, at the New Jersey warehouse, would be there to receive it. I imagined a person sitting surrounded by rejected dinosaur costumes, butane fuel canisters and butt-enhancing creams. Soon they would receive my lipstick, neither a return nor quite a gift, purchased, at one point, from a faraway place called Crispy Beauty. I wondered if they knew their place in this vast and vertiginous network \u2014 if they knew that they were helping to achieve Everymarket\u2019s dream: A dream of being a marketplace \u201coffering practically everything from everywhere for everyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba Feels the Pinch From China\u2019s Slowing Economic Growth", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s biggest e-commerce company is expecting rockier times ahead, a troubling sign for a vast economy that is one of the world\u2019s most important engines of growth.The flagging pace of economic expansion in China and the country\u2019s trade war with the United States led the Alibaba Group to cut its estimate of revenue growth for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, by around 5 percent, the shopping giant said on Friday. For the quarter that ended in September, revenue came in at $12.4 billion, a 54 percent increase from a year earlier but less than analysts had expected.\u201cThe global economy is in a state of uncertainty,\u201d Daniel Zhang, Alibaba\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cThe U.S.-China trade tensions create increased risk of instability.\u201dThe decision to lower sales expectations was made only recently, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said. Economic conditions deteriorated noticeably in just the past month, she said. \u201cMerchants are facing challenging times,\u201d she said.There is mounting evidence that China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second-largest after the United States\u2019, is slowing. But Alibaba\u2019s trimming of its sales outlook suggests the downturn is starting to affect more parts of the economy, including China\u2019s growing middle class.Shawn Yang, 27, works in finance in Shanghai. He said that distress being felt in his industry had him thinking twice about buying nonessential items like gadgets and video games.This year? He plans to spend less than half that amount, on jeans from Zara, two shirts for work and a bottle of moisturizer.The other dark cloud hovering over the Chinese economy has drifted in from overseas.The quarter that ended in September was the first since the Trump administration began its trade war with China. Alibaba executives have sought to reassure investors by pointing out that even if tariffs on imports make American goods more expensive, Chinese customers can still use Alibaba\u2019s platforms to buy more products made domestically or in other countries.But the effects of the tariffs are only beginning to be felt across China\u2019s $12 trillion economy. Factory activity is slowing, which could eventually result in job losses and a drop in retail spending. Washington and Beijing seem to be hunkering down for a protracted conflict, one in which disagreements about trade seem inextricable from broader questions involving geopolitical and technological dominance.For Alibaba, the timing is inopportune.Alibaba has long enjoyed an unmatched grip on how Chinese consumers shop on their phones and computers. Lately, the company has said its future depends on extending its consumer empire into the wider, nondigital world.Expanding its operations offline has helped raise Alibaba\u2019s sales growth. Revenue from retail experiments like Hema jumped 151 percent in the latest quarter from a year earlier. Sales in the company\u2019s cloud-computing division, the market leader in China, soared 90 percent.But spending on developing the new ventures has squeezed the company\u2019s bottom line. Asked on Friday whether the more pessimistic outlook for this year might lead Alibaba to scale back on such projects, Ms. Wu, the chief financial officer, said the company evaluated them not on their financial return, but according to other metrics, such as the number of users they attract.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael Evans of Alibaba on Singles Day and Olympic Rowing", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "Corner Office: International Luxury ConferenceA longtime Goldman Sachs banker now helps oversee the Chinese e-commerce behemoth. Supported byMr. Evans grew up in Toronto with five siblings, including a twin brother, Mark. The twins would go on to join the Canadian Olympic team, which won a gold medal in rowing at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. When did you start rowing with your brother? There was a little bit too much competition when we were young. My parents sort of purposely kept us out of the same schools. But then we started rowing together in my junior year at Princeton to train for the world championships. This was two years before the \u201984 Olympics.How was that, rowing with the twin you\u2019d been so competitive with? When it came to race day, our heads were always aligned. Our real focus was to beat the other crew, not to beat ourselves. And we were in a boat of eight. The whole crew had to be aligned and focused on the mission.And then you had a good Olympic Games. Yeah, we won. It doesn't get better than that.What was your first job out of college? Keeping consistent with what my parents had done, my brother and I didn't want to join the same investment bank. He went to Goldman and I went to Salomon Brothers.You eventually got to Goldman, too. I was recruited by John Thornton (the former president of Goldman Sachs), who tried to recruit me many times to come over, then finally succeeded. Then I spent the next 21 years there.How was the Goldman you joined different than the Goldman you left?At the time I joined, there were probably 100 people with us in London. There were probably 20 people in Asia. Goldman Sachs at this time was really a U.S. investment bank with remote locations. By the time I left, they had 7,000 people in London, 3,000 or 4,000 people in Asia, and they built businesses all over the world.When did you first get to know Alibaba? I first met Jack in 1999, and we invested $5 million. We were one of the first. In your lifetime you might meet four or five true visionaries. Of those four or five, maybe one or two are actually able to convert it into something real. Jack was one of those guys.So how did you wind up joining the company? I left Goldman in 2013 and I started thinking about what I wanted to do. One day I got a call from Jack and he said, \u201cHey, we want you to come on the board.\u201d Then, right after the I.P.O., Jack said, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you join us as the Alibaba president?\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, O.K.\u201d My wife thought was terrible idea because she knew it was going to be a huge amount of travel.It was just Singles Day and Alibaba did almost $31 billion of sales in one day. Against the backdrop of a trade war and slowing economic growth in China, what do these numbers tell you about the Chinese economy? To sell $31 billion in a single day would not suggest that there\u2019s a lot of softening in the Chinese economy. When we're selling $31 billion of product in a day, we\u2019re processing about 325,000 payments a second. We sent out just over 1 billion packages, many of them delivered last night and this morning. Clearly, the economy has slowed down, but we see continued growth in consumption by consumers.There are still tensions between Alibaba and luxury good providers over the issue of counterfeits. What are you doing to address their concerns? Several years ago we decided that if we wanted to be the global leader in commerce and represent brands everywhere in the world, we were also going to have to be the global leader in brand protection. So we\u2019re working in partnership with brands, conducting 24/7 surveillance on our platform, and working offline with law enforcement to go after the counterfeiters. This is about protecting consumers and protecting brands but it\u2019s also about protecting our brand and reputation. If we can\u2019t lead in brand protection, we will not lead in global commerce.Consumers now expect goods delivered to them almost instantaneously, and you\u2019re investing heavily in your delivery and logistics capabilities. Why is this so important to you? When a package gets lost, when it\u2019s not delivered on time, when it comes broken, when it comes in a box that\u2019s already been opened, when it comes in a soft package that\u2019s torn or looks terrible, it\u2019s a bad consumer experience. Bad consumer experiences generally do not result in conversion to repeat customers. We are highly, highly focused on the logistics experience, and when you are delivering 70 million packages a day, every day, it\u2019s impossible to keep track of everything with humans. With need bots. We need technology, and we obviously need delivery people who are going to do a terrific job.What did you learn from Singles Day this year? One of the most interesting things that comes out of Singles Day is that we have the capacity to operate for one day a year at this scale and capacity, whether it\u2019s logistics, payments, cloud or all of our enabling infrastructure. We believe there will come a day in the future when we operate at that scale, and that capacity, every day. There are no winners in a trade battle, or other battles between China and the United States. President Trump once said that trade wars were easy to win. Either he mistook his adversary, or he hadn\u2019t done enough of them to know that they are actually prolonged and very difficult. The one thing we know is that there will be no winners if there\u2019s a trade war. And if the trade war between China and the U.S. continues, we know that the impact on the rest of the world, and particularly smaller economies, is going to be significant.Advertisement"}

The Japanese anime series Dragon Ball first introduced him to East Asian culture and figure drawing. He later found it was based on the 16th-century novel \u201cJourney to the West.\u201d \u201cChina turned out to be the right choice after all,\u201d he says. Here, Borkowski goes by his Chinese name, Bai Wei. By allowing his Western worldview to influence his artistic direction, his approach differs from that of most traditional Chinese painters. \u201cChinese art is about how to follow the proper techniques,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is perhaps why they are not so hung up about imitation.\u201d Bai Wei\u2019s work, including pieces like \u201cDialogue Between Apsara and Angel,\u201d has been well received by the city, having been exhibited at the library of the Civic Center, another landmark in Qianjiang. The first such project in China, it now features 2,800 acres of creeks and ponds teeming with wildlife and vegetation. The tranquility of its emerald-green waterways is in stark contrast to the fact that at one point Xixi \u201cused to be home to pig farmers and silk weavers,\u201d says Lu Weili, a local guide. Amid ripe persimmons and the thick smell of osmanthus, two white-gloved volunteers pick up litter from the ground.

He says the company encourages employees to give back to society: \u201cWe want to show others that they too can help keep the park clean.\u201dFarther south, Chen Min is an industrial designer who also feels Alibaba\u2019s influence. His studio\u2019s proximity to the company\u2019s Cloud Town, which hosts Alibaba\u2019s Cloud Conference, means he has seen an exhibition center rise out of the ground in just four months. Nonetheless, Hangzhou is relatively peaceful. \u201cAlthough Shanghai is more well known, being here means I work undisturbed,\u201d says the Hangzhou native. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the best ideas and experiences from studying in Europe, and now I want to give back.\u201dChen\u2019s design approach is a deep synthesis of tradition and modernity, recognizing contemporary sensibilities in Song-dynasty ceramics and Qing-dynasty lacquerware. One of his most striking creations is the Hangzhou stool, made of elegantly curved layers of bamboo sheets and inspired by the six bridges of the Su Causeway, another scenic spot by the West Lake. The thoughtful design earned him a 2018 Loewe Foundation Craft Prize nomination.\nToday, the city\u2019s historical richness and its creative and technological possibilities are fueling a confident young generation of makers. As Bai Wei reflects, upon recently traveling from Poland to Hangzhou, \u201cIt felt like I was leaving one home to return to another.\u201d In a city whose streets are swept using tree branches, whose taxi-rides are paid by mobile phone, this feeling is doubly rich.\nThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "In China, Desperate Patients Smuggle Drugs. Or Make Their Own.", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite health insurance, terminally ill patients have to hunt around the world and on the internet for ways to stay alive.JINZHOU, China \u2014\u00a0Zhang Zhejun used a fat plastic straw to gently tap the pale yellow pharmaceutical powder onto a piece of silver foil that lay on an electronic scale. He made sure the amount was just right before he poured it into a clear capsule.When you\u2019re making cancer drugs at home, the measurements must be precise.Mr. Zhang has no medical experience and no background in making drugs professionally. He did this out of desperation. His mother suffered from lung cancer and required expensive drugs that China\u2019s ambitious but troubled health care system couldn\u2019t provide.He was aware of the risks. The drug he was making hadn\u2019t been approved by regulators in China or the United States. Mr. Zhang had bought the raw ingredients online, but he wasn\u2019t sure from whom, or whether they were even real.\u201cWe\u2019re not picky. We don\u2019t have the right to choose,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just hope the sellers have a conscience.\u201dIt\u2019s a desperation born out of necessity. China\u2019s aging population is increasingly stricken with deadly diseases like cancer and diabetes, but many can\u2019t find or afford drugs. The country\u2019s rudimentary insurance system doesn\u2019t begin to cover the ever-rising prices of treatments and drugs. Coverage also depends on where somebody lives, and some rural residents still lack access to certain drugs.Despite a costly new safety net from the government, illness remains the leading reason Chinese families fall below the poverty line, according to official figures.Many of China\u2019s problems are self-inflicted. Major bureaucratic hurdles keep lifesaving drugs out of the reach of millions who need them. Drug approvals, while accelerating, remain dauntingly backlogged. Until October last year, pharmaceuticals approved in the United States and Europe had to go through an extensive vetting process in China. Even now, foreign-made drugs have to clear another hurdle before insurance companies will pay for them.To stay alive, many sick people in China \u2014 and the people who love them \u2014 break the law. Online marketplaces are filled with illegal pharmaceuticals. Dealers run underground pharmacies. In some cases, cancer patients and their families make the drugs themselves, finding the ingredients and the instructions online.Lower prices send Americans to Canada and Mexico looking for the medicines they need. Patients from Russia to Britain desperately hunt for drugs through online \u201cbuyers\u2019 clubs\u201d \u2014 networks that scour the world for cheaper generic medicines.In China, the public has become increasingly concerned about access to drugs, putting pressure on the leadership. This summer\u2019s box-office hit \u201cDying to Survive\u201d was based on the real-life story of a Chinese leukemia patient who ran a buyers\u2019 club, smuggling generic drugs from India to save himself and others. It was almost universally lauded for shedding light on the difficulties of getting cancer drugs in China.The movie\u2019s popularity prompted Premier Li Keqiang to call for speeding up price cuts for the medication. China\u2019s growing affluence has led to greater expectations among its people. The Communist Party\u2019s grip on power depends heavily on providing improved opportunities for the public, including better health care.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether they can do that,\u201d said Zhou Jun, the executive director of the U.S.-China Healthcare Cooperation Program in Beijing, a group that fosters closer working relations between the countries. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge.\u201d (Mr. Zhou died of cancer several months after speaking to The New York Times.)Last year, police raided Hong Ruping\u2019s modest apartment in southwestern China. Under a television, they found what they were looking for: medicine to treat chronic kidney disease.Mr. Hong, who is unemployed and has kidney dialysis three times a week, explained that the drugs \u2014 cheap knockoffs of Western pharmaceuticals from India \u2014 were for him. The officers seized the drugs, warning that they were not approved by the country\u2019s regulators. Then, the officers let him go.After the raid, Mr. Hong continued to receive drugs in monthly packages \u2014 and they weren\u2019t all for him. Mr. Hong is known in China as a drug \u201cdaigou,\u201d or \u201cpurchasing agent,\u201d who procures pharmaceuticals through dubious means for people who can\u2019t afford them or don\u2019t have access to them.While many Chinese use daigou to buy South Korean facial masks made of snail slime and edible birds\u2019 nests, or infant formula from Australia, others rely on people like Mr. Hong to stay alive.\u201cI have this disease, and if they want to convict me, there\u2019s nothing I can do,\u201d Mr. Hong said. \u201cWhat is the difference between going to jail and being sick? There is no freedom.\u201dWhile China has achieved near-universal health insurance, the coverage is shallow. Patients must pay about 30 percent of costs out of pocket, compared with an average of about 10 percent in the United States. Many drugs aren\u2019t covered.The paltry coverage exposes hundreds of millions of Chinese to sharply rising costs. In the first three quarters of last year, China\u2019s health care expenditure per capita rose 13.2 percent, compared with a 9.1 percent increase in disposable income per capita, according to government data.That leads many Chinese to smuggling, especially from India, where prices of many drugs are capped. In China, the drug that Mr. Hong needed cost just over $4,200 a year, 10 times the price in India.Some health experts are torn about encouraging the use of drugs that aren\u2019t approved. \u201cI find it hard to give a one-size-fits-all view on whether they should or shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Gordon Liu, the director of Peking University\u2019s China Center for Health Economic Research and an adviser to the government.\u201cSome generics from India are likely to offer newer treatments than the existing medicines in the mainland,\u201d Mr. Liu said. He added: \u201cYou\u2019re acquiring drugs through informal channels. Not only are you taking on economic risks, but also the uncertainty of the technology.\u201dDr. Shen Lin, director of digestive oncology at the Peking University Cancer Hospital, said several of her patients on long-term medication couldn\u2019t afford the drugs anymore, and had asked whether they could use generics from India. She has tried to dissuade them, saying she couldn\u2019t vouch for drugs from unofficial sources.Still, she said, \u201cif they continue on their path, they would go bankrupt.\u201dTo survive, many Chinese need foreign-made drugs. But they can be costly, when they are available at all.First, drugs need to be approved. From 2001 to 2016, China approved just over 100 new drugs, about one-third the number in developed countries, according to the China Food and Drug Administration. Drugs could take six to seven years to get the green light, turning cancer for many into a death sentence.Still, the agency remains short staffed. China had roughly 600 reviewers at the end of 2016, compared with thousands in the United States. Once approved, the drugs have to qualify for coverage under one of China\u2019s insurance plans. That means earning a spot on the National Reimbursement Drug List \u2014 and that can take years. Beijing added 36 drugs to the list in 2017 and 17 this year. The last update was in 2009.When the drugs do arrive, many Chinese patients, like Yao Xianghua, can\u2019t afford them, even if they have government coverage.A petite former elementary school teacher with blunt bangs, Ms. Yao had lung cancer that didn\u2019t respond to surgery or a form of treatment called biotherapy. She was 68 in 2011, when the cancer was first diagnosed, and she felt she was too old to undergo chemotherapy and radiation.\u201cI give up,\u201d she told her son, Zhang Zhejun. \u201cI\u2019m resigned to my fate.\u201dHer doctor prescribed Iressa, a drug made by AstraZeneca that keeps cancer cells from multiplying. The drug had been added to the reimbursement drug list after AstraZeneca agreed to halve the price to just under $1,000 a month.It was still too expensive. Ms. Yao was covered by China\u2019s \u201crural cooperative medical scheme,\u201d which provides only modest benefits compared with the insurance for urban residents. She received a monthly pension of $460. Her son said the rural scheme at that time did not pay for imported drugs.Mr. Zhang vowed to save her. He quit a decent-paying job and moved in with his parents in a barely furnished apartment in Jinzhou, a largely industrial and heavily polluted city.Mr. Zhang discovered that India made a cheaper, generic version of Iressa. It worked for a while. But Ms. Yao developed a resistance to it after about nine months. Mr. Zhang needed alternatives.He went online.China in recent years has become the world\u2019s largest home of internet users. Many Chinese now shop almost exclusively in internet bazaars that offer everything from groceries and hot meals to jewelry and cars.They can also buy pharmaceuticals \u2014 even the raw ingredients to illegally make drugs themselves.Many start on forums devoted to patients and their loved ones when they can\u2019t get answers anymore. The two most popular are \u201cI Want Miracles,\u201d which is dedicated to helping people with lung cancer, and \u201cDances With Cancer.\u201d The forums combined have just over 440,000 members.\u201cThis is the current state of health care in China,\u201d said Chen Yun, who runs \u201cI Want Miracles.\u201d \u201cEvery doctor is just too busy, and there\u2019s no way that they can explain many things to you clearly. But if you want to figure it out, you just have to learn by yourself.\u201dIn many ways, they resemble medical websites in other countries. Then there are the posts on how to make drugs yourself. They direct at-home drugmakers to buy the ingredients online, on marketplaces run by Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant, and elsewhere. Dozens of suppliers offer free samples and promise fast delivery.\u201cOur products\u2019 quality better than the standard quality in the market,\u201d advertised Xian Health Biochem Technology, which was selling the ingredients for vandetanib, a cancer drug.Sellers mail the ingredients out in envelopes or, for those with bigger orders, in drums. Alibaba abides by local laws and has \u201crules and systems in place\u201d that help it identify listings that infringe on its policies, a spokeswoman said in an email. Desperate to help his mother, Mr. Zhang did a basic search: \u201cWhat to do after patient develops drug resistance on Iressa?\u201d He happened upon \u201cDances With Cancer\u201d and an active participant and a longtime cancer patient called \u201cBean Spirit,\u201d who wrote a manual on how to make drugs at home.Mr. Zhang, who previously worked at a pharmaceutical factory but was not involved in making drugs, started on his own version. He bought the ingredients for AstraZeneca\u2019s Tagrisso, a lung cancer drug. He spent just over $150 for a month\u2019s worth of ingredients, plastic capsules and an electronic scale.\u201cThe raw ingredients are worth more than the price of gold,\u201d he said.When the drugs stopped working for his mother, Mr. Zhang began making others. He started having sleepless nights, worried that he would not be able to find the ingredients each time a drug stopped working.\u201cYou don\u2019t know whether the thing that\u2019s ahead of you is a pit or a road,\u201d he said, wiping tears off his face. \u201cBut you must go forward. You can\u2019t stop.\u201dIn July 2017, Mr. Zhang started making WZ4002, yet another drug. It was discovered in 2005 by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston but has not been approved by regulators in the United States or China.His mother told Mr. Zhang that it caused dizzy spells. Earlier, she had come down with a severe bout of diarrhea after taking one of the homemade drugs and had to be hospitalized for a month.Both mother and son shrugged off any side effects.\u201cHow do you feel after taking the new medicine?\u201d Mr. Zhang asked his mother.\u201cWell, I think it feels a little bit less painful now,\u201d Ms. Yao said.\u201cLess painful?\u201d he asked.\u201cRemember, I told you that sometimes this part and this and this part hurt,\u201d she told him. \u201cNow these parts are less painful.\u201dMs. Yao died in October 2017, two years after Mr. Zhang started making drugs for her. The cause of death was gastrointestinal bleeding and acute bronchitis. Mr. Zhang said it was unclear whether the drugs that he had made were the cause.Research was contributed by Zhang Tiantian, Tang Yucheng, Zoe Mou and Elsie Chen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A South African Take on the Vision Fund May Be Small, but It Carries No Saudi Baggage", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAs SoftBank\u2019s huge Vision Fund came under scrutiny last month over its ties with Saudi Arabia, a small South African fund quietly took a leaf from its playbook.The limelight-shunning internet and media group Naspers on Oct. 26 unveiled plans to pour $315 million into tech start-ups in its native South Africa. That is one part of a larger $8.2 billion fund that is being overseen by the company to step up growth in its e-commerce ventures.It is small compared to SoftBank\u2019s $93 billion Vision Fund, which is backed in part by Saudi money. But the Naspers war chest is still worth watching.As Africa\u2019s largest listed firm, which started a century ago as a pro-Afrikaner newspaper, Naspers has been defined by one deal: It bought a third of Tencent for $36 million in 2001. At the Chinese internet giant\u2019s valuation peak in January, the stake was worth over $180 billion \u2014 roughly 45 percent more than Naspers, which also owns newspapers, a Pan-African pay-TV operation and multiple online classifieds, food delivery and fintech businesses. (As an early investor in Alibaba, SoftBank\u2019s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, offers one of the few comparable examples of such an investment home run.)One way for Naspers to narrow the discount between its own valuation and its Tencent stake was to sell off bits of Tencent to raise funds that it could reinvest in start-ups. It did that earlier this year, and netted $9.8 billion by selling a 2 percent stake. (It retains a 31.2 percent holding.) It used some of the proceeds to create an $8.2 billion fund, but Naspers shares have since struggled amid concerns that the cash will be wasted.That is understandable. Collectively, its new e-commerce ventures \u2014 such as Russia\u2019s mail.ru or Germany\u2019s Delivery Hero \u2014 lost $615 million last year. Investors could be forgiven for seeing echoes of Mr. Son\u2019s faith in the cash-gobbling ride-hailing firm Uber in Naspers\u2019 investments so far.But set against Tencent, Naspers shares have outperformed, which suggests that the firm has gotten some credit. Since the fund was announced on June 22, Naspers\u2019 14 percent decline has wiped $12 billion off its market value. Over the same period, the value of its remaining Tencent holding has lost $39 billion, a 26 percent drop.A focus on emerging markets means that Naspers\u2019 version of the Vision Fund is shielded from big losses by the relatively small amounts that can be invested \u2014 in Africa\u2019s nascent tech sector, $300 million goes a long way. And not everything it has touched has turned to dust: In May, Naspers sold an 11 percent stake in the Indian e-commerce start-up Flipkart for $2.2 billion, after investing $616 million.The group\u2019s Flipkart announcement was short on emotion and details, which may be a reflection of Naspers\u2019 taciturn Afrikaner roots. That should concern investors who want clarity on what their money is doing. But that\u2019s the same problem that stakeholders in Mr. Son\u2019s actual Vision Fund face \u2014 without the need for hand-wringing about where the cash came from.Advertisement"}

But Australia could suffer if the conflict slows China\u2019s growth.YARRAGON, Australia \u2014 There are some 2,000 goats at the Gippy Goat Cafe farm in Yarragon, two hours east of Melbourne and deep into the hinterland of the state of Victoria. The hills gleam a deep emerald here, the soil hugs the boots \u2014 and Chinese \u201ckey opinion leaders\u201d line up to film the authentic source of goat milk formula that shoppers are buying for their infants back home.That interest from China presents an opportunity, one that could expand as the trade war between Washington and Beijing intensifies. Right now, the company competes in China against monoliths like Gerber of the United States and Danone of France that have a much greater share of the market. \u201cAustralia is one of the best-placed countries in the world to reap the gains of the trade war,\u201d said Jason Aravanis, a senior industry analyst in Melbourne for IBISWorld, a market research company. \u201cOver the long term, Australia is going to step in and replace a lot of these American exports.\u201dSome of that business could end up going to Australia. As Australia\u2019s largest trade partner, China already receives about 40 percent of Australia\u2019s fruit, making Australia the biggest competitor to American fruit exports there. And while China has raised tariffs on American goods, it has been reducing them on some Australian products, such as wine. Australia\u2019s wine exports to greater China \u2014 an area that includes Hong Kong, a growing wine import hub \u2014 have surged in recent years. \u201cWe\u2019ve closed many a deal standing right here on this farm,\u201d Ms. Carr said. \u201cAll the partners come here, we bring all the key opinion leaders. All the social noise happens through influencers, and a lot of that is done through live streaming \u2014 \u2018This is where Bubs infant formula comes from\u2019 \u2014 and it goes a long way for transparency.\u201dIn the United States, the dairy industry is panicking. \u201cWe are deeply worried that the current trade situation threatens to upend the positive momentum not just this year, but also in the years to come,\u201d Shawna Morris, vice president of trade policy at the United States Dairy Export Council, told American lawmakers in written comments in August.Though it is still early, there are signs of growing demand, said Albert Tse, a private equity fund manager and a board member of Bubs Australia. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of inquiries so far from Chinese traders and baby stores and distributors in the last few months,\u201d he said.He said the surge in interest might be coming from people in China who distribute American products and are looking for different sources.When Bubs Australia first began producing formula and infant milk powder for the Australian market, it relied on goats farmed in the Netherlands.The business world in China is constantly changing, Ms. Carr said, with e-commerce sites increasingly competing with traditional brick-and-mortar stores.The key opinion leaders, or K.O.L.s, \u201care a thriving community, to the point where Chinese mums won\u2019t do anything unless their favorite K.O.L. is doing it, too,\u201d Ms. Carr said.She travels to Shanghai regularly to meet with Chinese partners who sell her products in stores and distributors who deal with cross-border trade.\u201cMy heart starts beating faster every time I land on the tarmac,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s China and it\u2019s all consuming.\u201dVicky Xiuzhong Xu contributed reporting from Sydney.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Money and Muscle Pave China\u2019s Way to Global Power", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "They didn\u2019t like the West\u2019s playbook. So they wrote their own.Beijing is leveraging its commercial and military might to redraw the terms of trade, diplomacy and security, challenging the liberal democratic order.Under a merciless sun, a dozen Chinese construction workers survey an empty expanse of desert, preparing to transform it into the heart of a new Egyptian capital.The workers are employed by China\u2019s largest construction conglomerate through a $3 billion contract from an Egyptian company, with financing from Chinese banks. They are erecting a thicket of 21 skyscrapers, one as tall as the Empire State Building.The presence of Chinese labor and largess on the sands of Egypt is a testament to China\u2019s global aspirations. After centuries of weakness and isolation, China is reclaiming what its leaders regard as its natural destiny \u2014 supremacy in Asia, and respect around the planet. Through the ventures in Egypt and elsewhere, China is exploiting its formidable economic clout to expand its geopolitical influence, directing investment to woo governments that control vital assets.A traditional ally of the United States, Egypt controls the Suez Canal, a vital shipping passage where a threat to access could impede China\u2019s movement around the globe. In constructing a central piece of the futuristic capital, China is ingratiating itself with the canal\u2019s ultimate gatekeeper, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while rendering his grandest visions dependent on friendly relations with Beijing.How China became a superpowerChina\u2019s reach for commercial expansion along with diplomatic influence guides an array of Chinese undertakings, from rail networks and highways taking shape across Africa and Latin America to ports and power stations being constructed in Eastern Europe and South Asia. In Southeast Asia, Chinese entrepreneurs are engineering a crop of web companies just as China projects growing military power in the South China Sea.Little more than a decade ago, China\u2019s forays beyond its borders were mainly about bringing home energy, minerals and other resources, often from countries forsaken by the West as pariah states like Iran, Sudan and Myanmar. In foreign policy, China pursued a sole obsession \u2014 peeling off diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory. Even as China skirmished with neighbors over contested islands, it accepted the dominance of the United States Navy.Those days are over.Under the muscular leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has cast off previous restraints, rejecting deference to an American-dominated global order as an impediment to national revival. In matters of commerce and national security, China is competing with the United States, even in traditional American spheres of influence.From a Chinese perspective, this reordering is merely an overdue reversion to historical reality as Beijing demands consideration commensurate with its stature.In the telling of the ruling Communist Party, China\u2019s modern history is the story of Chinese mastery degraded by colonial depravity. China is the land that invented the compass, gunpowder, paper and printing, amassing stupendous wealth while Europe was still backward. Then came centuries of humiliation \u2014 Britain\u2019s profiting from forcing opium on the populace, Japanese brutality, demeaning lectures about human rights from hypocritical Americans. Now, China is intent on securing its own fate.\u201cChina wants to be a great power in the world,\u201d says Paul Heer, a former chief national intelligence officer in East Asia for the United States, who now teaches at George Washington University. \u201cThey think the rest of the world owes them recognition, and a return to what the Chinese see as their rightful place.\u201dNowhere are China\u2019s designs clearer than in Asia. China has overtaken the United States as the leading trading partner with Asian nations while pushing back against American naval primacy in the South China Sea. China is disrupting American alliances in the region, from Japan to Singapore to Australia.Beyond its backyard, China\u2019s ambitions are boundless. It celebrates its Belt and Road Initiative, a vast collection of infrastructure projects around the world, as the means of recreating the Silk Road, the trails navigated in ancient times by merchants carrying goods between Asia and Europe.\u201cXi Jinping is leading a China that has influences in all corners of the globe,\u201d says Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cThe 2008 financial crisis in the West was the turning point for China. Beijing started to embrace a triumphal mind-set, and pursued global leadership with new confidence on the back of the West\u2019s perceived flaws.\u201dChina\u2019s assertive role in world affairs is grounded in its domestic needs. It is at once spreading into new markets, generating fresh demand for its factory wares just as growth slows at home. It is projecting military strength and influence when the legitimacy of the Communist Party rests on bolstering economic fortunes and international esteem.Among its neighbors, China\u2019s rise provokes fears that an unwanted piece of history is being resurrected \u2014 the old tribute system that cemented China\u2019s status as the Middle Kingdom. For centuries, other nations bowed in recognition of China\u2019s imperial might, bestowing gifts on the emperor and accepting vassal status to secure trade and peace.For the Western powers whose order has prevailed since the end of World War II, China poses a foundational challenge. The United States and its victorious allies erected institutions that were \u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014 designed to keep the peace by promoting trade and fair competition. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have dispensed aid with conditions, though frequently drawing accusations that they have failed to comply with their standards on protecting human rights and the rule of law.China\u2019s investments come with no such strictures. China bankrolls autocrats who control geopolitically valuable real estate. China demands only that its companies gain a piece of the action while recipients eschew criticizing Beijing.China\u2019s challenge to the Western-dominated order is amplified by the reality that its primary architect, the United States, is now led by an avowed nationalist. As President Trump wages a trade war and derides international cooperation, he has generated doubts about the perseverance of the liberal democratic philosophy the United States has long championed.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the United States gives China this golden opportunity to portray itself as the defender of the international order,\u201d says Jessica Chen Weiss, a China expert at Cornell University.If the new Silk Road is in part about moving goods from Chinese factories to customers in the rest of the world, the trail seems certain to pass through Central and Eastern Europe.This reality frames the proceedings of the \u201c16-plus-1\u201d group, an economic bloc that China has forged with 16 Central and Eastern European nations. Its latest summit meeting convenes on a drizzly day in July in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Officials from the 16 governments \u2014 among them the newest, least-affluent members of the European Union \u2014 pose for photos with the delegation from China, the one nation wealthy and ambitious enough to finance their visions.Leaders in the rest of the European Union construe the group as a stealth assault on the rules and cohesion of their bloc. In offering financing for infrastructure projects, China has positioned itself as an alternative to European Union development funds.Europe\u2019s money comes with rules protecting labor and the environment, while requiring that projects be awarded to companies on the basis of competitive bidding to ensure fair competition. China tends to distribute its funds with far simpler demands: Chinese companies must gain work, free of competition, while Beijing secures an international ally.European Union officials are especially worried that Chinese money could weaken the pressure Europe is applying on members that have been breaching democratic norms. Europe has threatened to withhold development funds from Poland and Hungary as punishment for their turns toward authoritarianism. Both have packed courts with government-friendly judges and menaced the press.\u201cIt\u2019s a mutually beneficial cooperation based on mutual trust without any kind of attempts to interfere into domestic issues,\u201d Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, says in an interview before the summit meeting in Sofia.\u201cWe are talking about different conversations, concrete conversations related to infrastructure, and other conversations related to the level of democracy and human rights in China,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev of Bulgaria says in an interview the day before the event. \u201cIt would not be polite and constructive if we try to merge them into one.\u201dThe summit meeting convenes in a hulking convention center that harks back to era of Soviet domination. At a news conference, the Chinese and Bulgarian prime ministers offer assurances that the 16-plus-1 bloc does not aim to divide Europe.Mr. Li seeks to allay European worries that China poses a challenge to its rules. He promises that Chinese-financed projects will be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding.\u201cThere needs to be open and transparent tendering,\u201d the Chinese premier declares.But the Serbian prime minister, Ana Brnabic, has just undercut that assertion. Asked moments earlier about the high-speed rail from Belgrade to Budapest, she says Chinese companies have been promised construction work.\u201cChina is a strategic partner,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not putting out tenders.\u201dAs a currency crisis ravaged Indonesia two decades ago, angry mobs tore through West Jakarta, killing hundreds of ethnically Chinese merchants. Yet Cheng Tao, a Chinese software engineer turned venture capitalist, can look down from his high-rise office on the same neighborhood and see a tranquil center of Chinese life \u2014 grocery shops, restaurants and his own son\u2019s school.Mr. Cheng, 34, is part of an influx of young Chinese financiers, engineers and web designers who rent space in an area full of technology companies. He first came to Indonesia a decade ago with the Chinese telecom company Huawei. He and other veterans of large Chinese conglomerates are increasingly unleashing their own start-ups.\u201cTen years ago, there were no mainland Chinese here,\u201d Mr. Cheng says as he sips tea imported from China. \u201cWe see opportunities here that no longer exist in China.\u201dThe thriving Chinese start-up scene in a neighborhood once devastated by anti-Chinese terrorism illustrates China\u2019s deepening engagement in Southeast Asia. Only a few years ago, Chinese companies in the region were mainly focused on purchasing natural resources. Today, China is investing for the future, seeding innovative industries with money and brainpower.Last year, Chinese investors participated in funding rounds for Indonesian start-ups that accounted for 95 percent of the value of those companies, according to a survey by Google and A. T. Kearney, a global management company.\u201cChina is Indonesia\u2019s Silicon Valley,\u201d says Adrian Li, a venture capitalist who has a Stanford M.B.A. and moved to Jakarta from Beijing in 2014.China\u2019s place in Southeast Asia has proceeded deliberately, and just as the United States has ceded ground.While heads of state forge ties amid pageantry, Chinese businesses have been quietly yet persistently making inroads in Indonesia, guided by bottom-line concerns. At home, Chinese web companies are running out of new customers. Indonesia, a land of 260 million people, is adding more internet users than anywhere else on Earth.Jack Ma, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, was early to appreciate this reality, pouring major investments into local shopping start-ups, including $1.1 billion last year into Tokopedia, a thriving online marketplace. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this spring, the Tokopedia site drew 78 million people, a 70 percent increase from the previous month.Such potential fortifies Mr. Ma\u2019s determination to stay ahead of his biggest global competitor \u2014 Amazon. The American e-commerce company operates in Singapore but has yet to significantly penetrate Southeast Asia.Alibaba has put more than $3 billion into a former regional competitor, Lazada. Its Alipay digital payment system operates across Southeast Asia. Mr. Ma sits on advisory boards in the region that will help set standards and shape consumer perceptions, expanding China\u2019s traditional reach.Beyond money and clicks, China projects its power through a more traditional display of strength \u2014 military might.Alex Pama has watched it unfold from uncomfortable proximity. In the 1990s, when he was a junior officer in the Philippine Navy, he saw Chinese boats landing on Mischief Reef, a glorified collection of rocks claimed by the Philippines in the South China Sea. Chinese crews erected shelters to mark the territory, then began pouring concrete for larger buildings.The Philippines sought help from its former colonial overseer, the United States. But the Clinton administration demurred. The American Navy was still smarting over losing access to Subic Bay, its longtime base in the Philippines.That decision was a historic turning point, says Mr. Pama, who would rise to become admiral of the Philippine Navy. From then on, the United States shrank from the region, relinquishing the seas to China.\u201cThat\u2019s when the appeasement started,\u201d Mr. Pama says.Two decades later, President Xi ordered the buildup of Mischief Reef and other outcroppings in the Spratly archipelago into islands bristling with reconnaissance gear, aircraft hangars, runways, deepwater harbors and, most recently, short-range missiles. Those bases and China\u2019s maritime buildup have given Beijing effective control over one of the most heavily trafficked waterways on the planet.\u201cThe U.S. should have been more assertive back then and now,\u201d says Mr. Pama, now retired.Dominating the South China Sea and unseating the United States have become central objectives in Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to return China to glory. Last year, China for the first time staged aircraft carrier drills using advanced fighter jets in the South China Sea.China has presented these moves as defensive. But the United States and its Asian allies warn that Beijing has positioned itself to hold global trade hostage while diminishing the American presence. China\u2019s emergence as the region\u2019s dominant commercial power combined with its moves toward maritime supremacy has heightened the sense that a changing of the guard is underway.\u201cOver the long term, China\u2019s power and influence will undoubtedly weaken and ultimately abolish U.S. dominance in the region,\u201d says Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, who advises the government.The perspective gained momentum during the 2012 standoff at Scarborough Shoal, a horseshoe-shaped chain of reefs that is much closer to the Philippines than to China.As the Philippine Navy challenged Chinese fishing boats, the Obama administration brokered a deal in which both sides would withdraw. The Philippine vessels departed, but some of the Chinese boats stayed.China has controlled the shoal ever since. Emboldened, China began construction of seven artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago.China appears reluctant to build a full-fledged military base on the shoal, lest it stoke nationalist anger in the Philippines, damaging relations with its pro-China president, Rodrigo Duterte.\u201cAny reclamation will outrage the Duterte government,\u201d says Zhu Feng, the executive director of the Center for the South China Sea at Nanjing University. \u201cChina can\u2019t afford to lose a good friend like that.\u201dBut many Philippine officials fear that this is merely a pause before an inevitable Chinese expansion.Two large maps of the South China Sea cover the walls of the office of Gary Alejano, a Philippine congressman and former marine. He shows visitors how the Scarborough Shoal sits on the edge of the Bashi Channel, the Chinese Navy\u2019s entryway into the western Pacific. He points out the artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago. He notes Mischief Reef, where Chinese fighter jets have landed.Unless someone confronts them, those jets will remain there, using the hangars China built, Mr. Alejano says. Philippine Navy vessels rarely patrol the area, he laments.\u201cRight now, you can feel that China controls the South China Sea,\u201d Mr. Alejano says. \u201cAnd the U.S. comes in and out.\u201dAs China charts its global reach, six zones demand special attention: the maritime choke points.The entryway to the Black Sea from the Mediterranean. The passageway from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean via the Strait of Malacca. The corridor separating Europe from Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar. Bab el Mandeb, off Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. The Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Access to the Mediterranean from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal.At any one, an outbreak of hostilities could imperil China\u2019s free movement around the globe, jeopardizing its exports and access to resources.These zones have historically been policed by American naval power, which has made China\u2019s access dependent on peaceful relations with the United States. To liberate itself, China has been lavishing investment on governments that control the choke points.Which is how China became financier and developer for the grandiose capital being constructed by President Sisi in the reddish-brown desert east of Cairo. Mr. Sisi craves investment and allies at a time when much of the world has recoiled from his brutal crackdown on dissent.In an interview, Gen. Ahmed Zaki Abdeen, who heads the Egyptian state-owned company overseeing the new capital, railed against American reluctance to invest in his country.\u201cStop talking to us about human rights,\u201d he says. \u201cCome and do business with us. The Chinese are coming \u2014 they are seeking win-win situations. Welcome to the Chinese.\u201dIn backing the new capital, China has furthered an age-old aspiration for the Egyptian powers that be: taming the desert. The project aims to construct a city of 6.5 million people, replacing crumbling Cairo with a technological metropolis engineered to rival Dubai. Construction is expected to take 15 years while costing 200 billion Egyptian pounds, more than $11 billion.Under a master agreement signed in October 2017, China Construction is building the capital\u2019s central business district. A consortium of Chinese state-owned banks is lending $3 billion to finance a first phase expected to be completed in three years. Egypt is obligated to spend the money by hiring the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. A second phase is expected to run $3.2 billion.Yu Wenchuan dons a yellow safety vest as he works security at the China Construction site. Born and raised in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, Mr. Yu, 24, complains about the 100-degree heat and the conspicuous absence of spicy noodles. But he is resigned to spending the next eight years in Egypt.\u201cThis is a good way to get experience,\u201d he says.Under the contract, 35 percent of construction materials can be brought from China. Even some of the 65 percent procured from domestic sources stands to enrich China, given the presence of entrepreneurs like Xin Zhu.Seventeen years have passed since Mr. Xin landed in Cairo from his native Hubei Province. There, he oversaw a factory that processed slabs of granite and marble into flooring and countertops. He had heard that Egypt was rich with quarries full of high-quality, low-priced rock.He took control of a lot in an industrial area outside Cairo. He endured terrible roads and power failures. \u201cI was like a pioneer,\u201d he says.Today, Mr. Xin\u2019s company employs more than 100 people, mostly migrants from China. He ships most of his production to China. But he aims to sell into the new capital, profiting as Beijing erects a veritable Pharaonic monument for Egypt\u2019s authoritarian leader.\u201cI was looking for new opportunities outside China,\u201d Mr. Xin says. \u201cMore development is good for our business.\u201dDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaMore China RulesDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaAdvertisement"}

She did encounter a long line at Anthropologie, so she skipped the store, deciding she could just as easily buy online.Her husband Danny said that nowadays people come to the mall more for the food and the experience than the shopping. \u201cYou don\u2019t see people running around with 10 bags,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to spend $50 on lunch and just soak in the atmosphere.\u201dThat\u2019s what 28-year old Mitch Williams did on this sunny morning, sitting beneath one of the palm trees. \u201cMy grandpa is visiting from Ohio, so we\u2019re having coffee and omelets.\u201dWas he doing any shopping? He shook his head no: \u201cI do that online.\u201d\u2014 Cade MetzRetailers start marketing it months in advance. Hordes of shoppers turn out in person and online. Google even programmed it into its calendar as an official holiday.But Black Friday has competition. Lots of it.Those are just the free-for-alls, where all retailers can participate.\u201cIf we\u2019ve seen anything in retail over the last 20, 30 years, it\u2019s that consumers need to be motivated to shop,\u201d said Michael Brown, a partner with A.T. Kearney\u2019s retail practice. \u201cThey need to be provoked.\u201dFor anyone above all that crass consumerism? There\u2019s a day for them, too.\u2014 Tiffany HsuRetailers and analysts said Black Friday 2018 got off to a strong start \u2014 and all indications were that it finished strong, too.Though the cold weather in the eastern United States may have kept some shoppers home, Mastercard SpendingPulse said that generally \u201conline sales appear to be filling in any weather related soft spots in brick and mortar sales.\u201d The clothing, electronics and interior furnishing sectors were seeing especially good traction, the analysis said.\u201cStores are busy, there\u2019s good traffic, the queues are manageable and well-staffed, and inventory levels appear to be good for the time of day too,\u201d said Frank Layo, managing director of Kurt Salmon, which is part of Accenture Strategy. \u201cRetailers helped themselves by starting promotions much earlier this year to spread out the holiday shopping traffic and mitigate chaos. Their efforts appear to be paying off.\u201d\u2014 Matt StevensEarly in the day, J. Crew wrote on Twitter that it was \u201cexperiencing some technical difficulties\u201d with its website. The site appeared to be functioning fine soon afterward.Still, analysts monitoring Black Friday said online sales were chugging along, driven in part by the cold, wet weather in some parts of the country, which they said may have nudged some shoppers away from stores and toward their computers or smartphones.\u2014 Matt StevensHere\u2019s the upshot: Black Friday is a great time to buy a new video game console, a television, headphones or a smart home product like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. One of the most notable deals we\u2019ve seen: Best Buy, Amazon and many retailers are selling Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 with a new Spider-Man game for $200, down from the normal price of $300 for the console alone. So come prepared: Jot down a list of things you\u2019d like to buy in those categories and look out for price drops.\u2014 Brian X. ChenYou clearly have an insatiable appetite for The Times\u2019s Black Friday coverage! Here are a few recent stories you might enjoy about this very American \u201choliday\u201d and how it fits into the broader economy.\u2014 David EnrichBelieve it or not, not everyone is a fan of Black Friday.\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for respect and a fair wage at work,\u201d David Holt, one of the organizers of the demonstration, said in an interview on Wednesday. He added that Black Friday was an especially appealing time for labor movements to organize. \u201cOne of the things this Black Friday protest is about is consumerism.\u201dMr. Holt said he hoped that holding the demonstration in front of a Walmart would encourage shoppers to think about labor conditions for the store\u2019s employees.\u2014 Zach WichterThere is no Thanksgiving holiday in Europe, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the associated consumer bonanza from hitting shops there. French retail brands like Darty, Fnac and Monoprix joined Apple, Sephora and Uniqlo in efforts to attract bargain hunters on Friday.In Britain, where sales used to take place after Christmas, shops have added Black Friday to their promotional calendars. Offers have been trickling in for at least a week. Amazon started its sales on Nov. 16.Most other stores have joined the fray with even discount supermarkets offering money off everything from vintage turntables to legs of ham.\u2014 Amie TsangYes, Black Friday is everywhere \u2014 even Canada.The \u201choliday\u201d \u2014 in French-speaking Montreal, they call it \u201cVendredi Fou\u201d \u2014 has reportedly become Canada\u2019s busiest shopping day of the year, eclipsing Boxing Day (or Dec. 26), when the traditional post-Christmas Day sales would bring out hordes of shoppers.This Black Friday, the stores in Montreal were packed, especially in the underground, labyrinth-like malls such as Eaton Center, which was crowded with people seeking shelter from the subfreezing weather. Athletic wear, women\u2019s shoes and men\u2019s suits were marked off at 50 percent or more in the Eaton Center mall. Outside one electronics store, velvet ropes were set up to keep the queues under control.It\u2019s said that Black Friday first migrated to Canada in the early 2000s, when the American and Canadian dollars were roughly on par. These days the greenback is worth 1.32 Canadian dollars, making these discounts even greater. \u2014 Stuart EmmrichThe Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said it sold $30.8 billion worth of goods on Nov. 11, the annual online bonanza known as Singles Day. The company rang up $1 billion in sales in the first 85 seconds of this year\u2019s frenzy. It took an hour to reach $10 billion. All in all, the company says it generated more than a billion delivery orders that day.For some context: In the United States last year, online shopping from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday totaled about $19.62 billion, according to Adobe Analytics. (Yes, it\u2019s true, that doesn\u2019t include all the in-store shopping that took place on Black Friday.)In addition to inundating phone owners with coupons and deals for weeks in advance, Alibaba deploys subtler methods to gin up sales on Singles Day. This year, users of the company\u2019s Taobao shopping app could see how their spending on Nov. 11 compared to that of other people in their area.\u2014 Raymond ZhongFor many shoppers, Black Friday actually begins right in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner.\u2014 Nellie BowlesOnline shoppers, too, were busy on Thanksgiving Day. They shelled out $3.7 billion on Thursday, an increase of about 28 percent compared to last year, according to a report from Adobe Analytics, which tracks transactions from 80 of the country\u2019s top 100 online retailers.And many of those online shoppers aren\u2019t heading to their desks or even grabbing their laptops. Thanksgiving marked the first day during which $1 billion in sales came from smartphones, Adobe said. And consumers spent more on their phones, with average order values up 8 percent compared with Thanksgiving Day last year.\u2014 Zach WichterIt could help retailers offset some of the deep discounts that consumers expect on Black Friday.\u201cIf you can grab people in the inspirational moment, they\u2019re not going to be as price-sensitive and maybe they won\u2019t shop around,\u201d said Jill Standish, Accenture\u2019s global lead for retail.Another advantage? Online, Ms. Standish said, it can be easy \u201cfor a small brand to look big\u201d if they know how to present themselves, and know how to attract the right influencer profiles to promote their products. A strong social media presence can make a company seem instantly reputable.\u2014 Zach WichterThere are three reasons that Black Friday is so popular, and two of them are the deals, according to Tulin Erdem, a marketing professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.\u201cThe economic savings, feeling good about yourself having found a good deal, being a shrewd consumer,\u201d she said, all add up to one key factor. Plus, because so many stores offer Black Friday sales, it\u2019s easier to find discounts without having to search as hard as you might during the rest of the year.But, Dr. Erdem said, another reason Black Friday remains so popular is tradition.\u201cIt still has its appeal because of this ritualistic aspect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a big important baseball game or Super Bowl as an American family.\u201dConsider that the National Retail Federation surveyed 7,516 consumers about their shopping plans this year, and 26 percent of those who planned to shop on Black Friday said it was because of tradition. An additional 23 percent said they would shop because it\u2019s just something to do. (As far as we know, nobody was asked whether they\u2019re shopping just to get away from family members.)Of course Black Friday is just the start of things. If retailers don\u2019t start discounting before Thanksgiving \u2014 and most seem to \u2014 they are certainly using the holiday shopping season to push merchandise at every turn. The biggest discounts tend to come on \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d \u2014 the last Saturday before Christmas, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail analysis firm.But Black Friday does matter. Consumers surveyed by the retail federation said they planned to shop more on Black Friday than on any other day of the Thanksgiving weekend.And Black Friday maintains cultural cache, especially for \u201cnew Americans,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, as recent immigrants are more likely to take part. \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn to be an American consumer, by showing up and shopping on Black Friday.\u201d\u2014 Zach WichterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China and Trump, Listen Up!", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoth sides need to be smart and honest about how the countries became economic successes. Opinion ColumnistHONG KONG \u2014 I\u2019ve been in Tokyo and Hong Kong this week, and if I were to distill what echoed in all my conversations, it would sound something like this:From Chinese business and government types, some real anxiety \u2014 \u201cCan you please tell me what is President Trump\u2019s bottom line in this trade war? Is this about rebalancing trade or containing China\u2019s rise?\u201d \u2014 combined with some real bravado \u2014 \u201cYou realize that you Americans are too late? We\u2019re too big to be pushed around anymore. You should have done this a decade ago.\u201dFrom the Japanese it was gratitude \u2014 \u201cThank God for Donald Trump. Finally we have a U.S. president who understands what a threat China is!\u201d \u2014 combined with real anxiety \u2014 \u201cPlease, please be careful. Don\u2019t go too far with Beijing and break the global trading system.\u201dAnd from a smart European consultant it was bewilderment \u2014 \u201cBoy did the Chinese have a failure of intelligence. They had no clue just how much both Democrats and Republicans, and Europeans, all want to see Trump hammer China in these trade talks. But please, please don\u2019t start a cold war with China that will force us to choose sides.\u201dAnd from me to both my Chinese and Japanese interlocutors: I\u2019m glad Trump is confronting China on its market access barriers. Those are the real issue \u2014 not the bilateral trade imbalance. This is long overdue. But trade is not a zero-sum game. China can thrive and rise, and we can, too, at the same time. That\u2019s what\u2019s been happening for the past 40 years. But we\u2019d be even better off if China offered the kind of easy access to its market for U.S. manufacturers that it enjoys in America. It\u2019s time to recalibrate U.S.-China economic ties before it really is too late.That\u2019s why this may be as consequential a moment as America\u2019s decision to contain the Soviet Union 70 years ago. We don\u2019t want to be containing China. But to avoid going down that path, both countries have to be smart and honest about how we got here: China has to be a lot more humble about how its economy got so big so fast, and Trump has to be a lot more sophisticated about how America got so strong for so long.What do I mean? China\u2019s formula for success had three pillars. The first was a lot of hard work; delayed gratification; high savings; smart investments in infrastructure, education and research; and a Darwinian system of capitalism. In China\u2019s \u201cjungle capitalism,\u201d 30 companies in the same business emerge and compete to see which becomes the alpha male and wins the government\u2019s backing to go global. This system has produced high levels of innovation \u2014 Alibaba, Tencent, DJI \u2014 despite a censored internet, lack of a free press and an authoritarian government.The second pillar was a system of cheating on World Trade Organization rules; the forced transfers of technology; the stealing of the intellectual property of others; nonreciprocal trade rules; and massive government support for the winners of both its Darwinian competitions and inefficient state-owned industries.The third pillar \u2014 never acknowledged by China \u2014 was a stable global trading system built by U.S. statesmen and sustained by the U.S. Navy. It\u2019s been the U.S. Navy in the Pacific that has assured China\u2019s trading partners there that China\u2019s economic domination wouldn\u2019t result in China\u2019s geopolitical domination over them \u2014 and therefore made them open to massive trade and investment from China.America\u2019s formula for success, which dates from our founding, also had multiple components: We always educated our children to take advantage of the prevailing technology of the day.When it was the cotton gin that meant universal primary education; when it was the factory, it meant universal secondary education; once it was the computer, some form of universal postsecondary education was required; and now that it is becoming big data and artificial intelligence, it\u2019s going to be lifelong learning.We also always aspired to have the best infrastructure (roads, ports, airports and telecom), the most government-funded basic research to push out the frontiers of science so our companies could innovate further and faster, the best rules and regulations to incentivize risk-taking and prevent recklessness, and the most open immigration system to attract both high-energy low-skilled workers and high-I.Q. risk-takers.Finally, we always stood for universal values of freedom and human rights, always paid extra to stabilize the global system from which we were the biggest beneficiary, and therefore always had enduring allies \u2014 not just intimidated neighbors and customers like China does.And all our strengths were enabled by a democratic system and political class that at key moments always found ways to compromise to renew the elements of our growth model. We had not yet become what we are today, what Francis Fukuyama calls a \u201cvetocracy\u201d \u2014 where the two national political parties often just veto each other, making it impossible to reinvest in our formula for success.This trade war can end well only if China is honest about all the pillars of its formula for success and if Trump is honest about all of ours. We can get tons of trade concessions from China, but if we get away from the formula that actually made us great, we\u2019re not going to enjoy sustainable, inclusive growth.So when I watch this spiraling trade war and listen to both sides, I want to tell the Chinese: You didn\u2019t get here with just hard work; the barriers you put up were not an entitlement that you\u2019re allowed to keep forever, and the global economic system you grew into was not one you built. Your biggest customer and rival did that \u2014 America.And to Trump I want to say: America became great with a formula that every great American president refreshed and reinvested in. And you\u2019re not doing that. You\u2019re actually undermining and neglecting some of its key elements \u2014 immigration, allies, rules and regulations.In sum, I worry that America has become so focused on who the Chinese are and what they\u2019re trying to become that we\u2019ve lost sight of who we are and how we got here. That's the biggest threat to our economy and our future.Advertisement"}

That trend could become more pronounced in the coming months if the markets sour on tech I.P.O.s.Judging by the numbers, Hollywood should be feeling buoyant right now: The summer movie season was strong, and theaters had their busiest fall on record. October ticket sales were up 45 percent compared with last year, according to Comscore.Euphoria is almost nonexistent in studio hallways. The movie capital is instead mired in a profound malaise. The reason involves fallout from the #MeToo earthquake, both the positive changes it forced, and, lately, the pushback it has incurred. Contributing are the mega-mergers that have left Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox with new owners and may find Sony Pictures, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sold or reconfigured before long. The steady march of Big Tech into entertainment also plays a role.As Amy Baer, a Hollywood veteran who is now president of Women in Film, told the NYT, \u201cEstablished protocols \u2014 decades worth \u2014 are changing at lightning speed. For people like me, who believe change is desperately needed in Hollywood, that is exciting. But a lot of people are lost in anxiety.\u201dInvestors have shifted from seeking out the companies with the highest profit growth rates to those that are expected to generate more stable earnings and issue large dividends, and tend to hold up better during turbulent economic conditions. Walgreens has also added 12 percent over the past month, while restaurant chain McDonald\u2019s Corp. has risen 9.5 percent and retail powerhouse Walmart Inc. is up 8.7 percent. The gains have come at the expense of technology companies and other fast-growing stocks that have seen their values erode since late September.But Raymond Zhong of the NYT points out why Alibaba should be worried about 2019:Economic growth is slowing, and the country\u2019s hundreds of millions of middle-class shoppers seem to be holding on more tightly to their pocketbooks. Tech companies are antsy about the government\u2019s more interventionist attitude toward big business. The tariff fight with the United States is casting a pall not simply over trade, but over China\u2019s future writ large. This month, Alibaba cut its sales forecast for the year ending in March by around 5 percent, citing the wobbly economy and the trade war.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!
