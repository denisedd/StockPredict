{"Headline": "Who Let the Dogs Out (at the Wedding)? Readers Respond", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe asked our readers to submit photos of their dogs, cats and even birds dressed in fancy wedding fashion. Here\u2019s what they shared.There was no doubt that my pets had to be included in my wedding. I am so obsessed with them. I walked down the aisle first so that I would be on the stage to watch Toby and Rooby go down. They were the main focus and the reason I chose my amazing venue. There was no negotiating. The dogs had to be a huge part of my wedding. They\u2019re my kids. Toby had a custom tuxedo made with gold buttons and velvet accents, which was modeled after the groom\u2019s. Rooby\u2019s dress was modeled after Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s outfit in the opening of \u201cSex and the City.\u201d She had a blush silk top with a tulle skirt. They were made by Danielle Pursell of SewDoggyStyle. They also had custom sunglasses made by Susan Howard of Hayleys Hats. Rooby also had a custom hair bow made by Breathe and Bark. Both wore custom garlands and leashes from Amaryllis Floral and Event Design on nude rope collars and leashes.Sarah Meashaw, Bethesda, Md.A day celebrating our love, would not have been the same without sharing it with our fur babies. Even though our wedding was canceled because of a hurricane, with less than 48 hours notice, we were able to pull through and have a smaller wedding. Our pups were able to stay with us through the entire reception. A family member made a dress for Zoe to match the dresses that my maid and matron of honor wore.Melody Emerson, High Point, N.C.He\u2019s our son. We couldn\u2019t imagine our special day without him participating. He truly stole the show, especially when he peed on the huppah at the end of his strut down the aisle. Our florist made Wayland a custom collar to match the rest of our florals. We even had to measure his neck so that it would fit just right. We wanted him to have something unique that you couldn\u2019t buy in a store.Chloe Zale, New YorkHe will always be our first son and the first pet each of us had. We bought him a harness tuxedo on Etsy. That way he could stand up at the altar. Danielle Rains-Walker, Austin, Tex.He is our child, our baby and he\u2019s been with me through everything. He adores his new permanent papa. He is wiser than the day is long. Our wedding was a Roaring \u201920s and Gatsby theme. We ordered his tuxedo and gold bow tie from Chewy.com, his top hat from Amazon and his ring-bearer pillow from eBay.Shae Steven Franklin, DenverBecause he is just as important to me, if not more, than the man I was marrying, Ernie wore a satin blue tuxedo with a velvet bow tie. It was a custom purchase on Etsy. Post ceremony, on the dance floor, Ernie loosened up and took off his jacket, sporting just his shirt underneath.Victoria Lam, Los AngelesThey are our family. My dachshund Lily had a message for all of us. She waited 10 years for us to finally get married. She wore a white linen and lace dress with a silk flower collar and matching leash. My Berner, Zoey, wore a silk flower collar with a matching leash, and she walked my husband down the aisle. Allison Black Goldberg, Union Pier, Mich.Stella is a part of our family, so there was never a question about her being a part of our wedding. One of Stella\u2019s friends from school has a mom who makes custom dog clothes, and I asked her if she could design a dress for Stella similar to my bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. We did a FaceTime fitting, and she told me how exactly I should pin it. I also included a flower from my dress, and the result was incredible, with unexpected surprises like a glitter top hat with tiny little flowers and a beautiful leash to match. Stella looked incredible.Devora Libin, New YorkWe moved to San Francisco from Hoboken, N.J., just two months after getting engaged. Upon moving, we knew we wanted to get a dog, and Bernie stole our hearts from the minute we met him. He quickly made the cross-country move for two East Coasters much easier and really is a part of our family. We couldn\u2019t imagine our wedding day without him. We got married in New Jersey overlooking our favorite city, New York, with our family and friends. Having Bernie be a part of our day allowed us to incorporate our new home of San Francisco, and we couldn\u2019t have pictured it any other way. Bernie\u2019s tuxedo was from a local San Francisco pet shop. As soon as we saw it, we knew it was the perfect black and white classic tuxedo to complement his human father and the rest of the bridal party.Elise Nest, San FranciscoBoth Bruno and Barkley are our family, and it was only fitting that they would be the ring boys for us. Their outfits were incredibly simple: a burgundy bow tie to match the ones that male members of the wedding party wore.Sophia Boccard, New YorkWoodrow was our first dog. He moved with us from the University of Michigan to Alaska, back to Cornell University, and again to Alaska. He was an enthusiastic member of our early sled dog teams, a hobby we have kept up for 37 years. At our wedding, the rabbi would not allow Woodrow into the sanctuary, but he was allowed to attend the reception in the temple's social hall. Woodrow's checkered vest and bow tie were very stylish for 1983.I can't imagine a wedding day without Nala being a part of it. I actually messaged my husband first on OkCupid, and the first thing he asked was what type of a dog I had. Little did he know, it was two weeks until Nala would come to live with me. She has been there since the beginning of our relationship and is an important part of our lives together. We bought Nala\u2019s suit off Etsy from Olivia's Doggie Designs. The suit was custom made for our pup. The color of her suit matches the groomsmen and her bow tie matched the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. We spent more time on the dog outfit than the actual wedding dress.Mandy Menaker and Eric Winer, New YorkWhile we knew that Baloo would undoubtedly steal the show at our wedding. We also knew that our wedding day would not be complete without him there. Baloo was a groomsman, and he fulfilled the role completely. He helped the groom loosen up and relax before the ceremony by taking him for a walk around the park, providing an easy conversation starter with guests that arrived early, and most importantly, stood right by his side throughout the ceremony. Of course, the bridesmaid that walked him down the aisle knew that all eyes would be on Baloo and not her, but she was willing to make that sacrifice because Baloo is our pride and joy, and firstborn child. In fact, in honor of Baloo, we chose to donate to a bulldog rescue organization, the Philly Bully Team, in lieu of providing traditional wedding favors. Baloo is a short, stocky, dense American bulldog. While his legs are no more than seven inches in length, his build is that of a large bulldog. We knew that his tuxedo for the wedding needed to be custom made. Sean did some research and found an Etsy shop that had experience with pet outfits for weddings. He took out the measuring tape, sized up Baloo's weird-shape torso, and provided the measurements over to the designer. The tuxedo, designed to match the groom, was flawless. Everything fit perfectly.Marissa Sudol and Sean Christie, PhiladelphiaSlim Jim started our family by joining our pack when she was a puppy. She showed us that love is an infinite, unconditional gift. Slim Jim wore a custom tutu inspired by joy and festivity. The tutu was handmade by our friend\u2019s young daughter, Jane Keenan.Lorelei Narvaja Gauthier and Daniel Michael Gauthier, PhiladelphiaA bridal party is supposed to be composed of your best friends, and Atticus is certainly a best friend to both of us. We call him our chaperone because he always likes to insert himself physically between the two of us and grumbles when we don't include him in hugs and kisses. Still, he's both friend and family to us and a huge part of our lives. We knew he had to be included in the wedding. But because being at the actual wedding would have been too exciting for Atticus, we went with a Build-a-Head cutout of his face from Buildahead.com. His cutout participated in photos and walked down the aisle on the arm of one of our bridesmaids.Madeleine Minton and Jaret Glazer, ChicagoTurtle is a big part of our lives, and since we had a destination wedding, she was coming with us. She was the most photogenic one of the group. Turtle is just donning her feathers. Her beautiful colors don\u2019t need any additional outfit!Jaime Altabet and Jeff Monheit, Forest Hills, N.Y.The boys are part of our family. Tasuki has been with me for 13 years and Bagel completed us when I moved back to the Bay Area to be with my future husband after a two-year stay in New Jersey. We could not imagine them not being a part of the biggest day of our lives. We looked at a lot of different options, but settled on these bow ties from Chewy.com. My husband liked the Chippendale look it gave them.Edward Lim and Luana Lim, South San Francisco, CalifBefore being with my husband, Bill, I\u2019d never had a dog of my own. After being together nine years, and despite his vow not to subject himself to the pain of losing a dog again, Bill arranged for me to get LuLou. She has truly been the most loving gift of which I could ever be the custodian/recipient. She was the only member of our wedding party because she symbolizes the generosity and sacrifice that love requires every day. She wore a Martha Stewart checkered dress, purchased at Ross for its appropriateness for a late-August outdoor wedding ceremony. We wanted it to reflect a feeling of casual fun.Honestly, having Combo in the wedding was never a question. It was an automatic detail that neither of us had to think about. Combo is a part of the family and the only logical place for her to be while we were getting married was at the ceremony. Combo was the star and \u201cbrand\u201d of our wedding. Our hashtag was #perfectcombo, because she is perfect, of course. And because we are a perfect couple and a perfect combo. Combo's leash was custom made at LaVilla Dog Works, a shop in the bride's hometown, Johnstown, N.Y. The leash's fabric was the same fabric that was used for the napkins at each place setting. Her collar was made by the bride with faux flowers.Marlaina Hunter and Dan Hunter, Poughkeepsie, N.Y.Cooper Brownstone McIsaac is a rescue dog, who as a four-month-old puppy was found abandoned just outside Paris. He was taken in by the Society for the Protection of Animals and arrived the very same day we did to our local shelter, seeking a home, as we were seeking a puppy. Cooper was an obvious choice for the Dog of Honor role at our wedding. Since his adoption in January 2018, he has proved to be a tremendously clever, playful and loving companion. He is at the very center of our days and lives. As Paris is quite dog friendly, he accompanies us on shopping excursions, long strolls through scenic Paris and often joins us when we go out to eat. He even sleeps between us in our bed each night. Our nickname for him is \u201csweetness and light.\u201d It was always obvious to us that we would include him in our wedding ceremony. We purchased Cooper's kilt on a trip to Edinburgh in May 2018, the day after we bought the groom's kilt. As the groom is Franco-Scottish, we thought doing a kilt wedding (and having a bag piper) would be a great way to pay homage to his roots. Catherine Victoria Olien and Florent John McIsaac, ParisCoco is a part of the family, so she naturally was a part of the wedding. The morning of the wedding, she hung out with the bridesmaids for hair and makeup. During the ceremony, she walked down the aisle with the flower girls. Later in the day, she mingled with friends and family. Our wedding was a traditional Indian ceremony, so fittingly Coco, like the rest of the wedding party, wore traditional Indian attire. Her outfit was designed in India to match the bridesmaids\u2019 saris. The dressmaker, Kiran of Bangalore, India, was a little surprised by the request for a dog-size sari, but did a wonderful job creating a custom piece for Coco. On her neck, Coco wore a peach garland to match the ones worn by her parents.Savina Aneja and Shravan Kandula, Winter Park, Fla.Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion, and Vows) and Instagram.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Philippines Says It Will Charge Veteran Journalist Critical of Duterte", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The Philippine government said on Friday that it would charge a veteran journalist and her online news start-up with tax evasion, a move the publication described as an attack against media in the country by the government of President Rodrigo Duterte.Rappler denied the charges, calling the case a \u201cclear form of continuing intimidation and harassment,\u201d and accused the government of trying to silence critical coverage. The penalties for tax evasion include a fine as well as up to 10 years of imprisonment.Speaking from Washington, D.C., where she received an award from the International Center for Journalists on Thursday evening, Ms. Ressa said an indictment \u2014 which the government has said could come as soon as next week \u2014 would have a chilling effect on reporters in some of the most dangerous places around the world.\u201cThis is really transforming our democracy and yet another blow,\u201d Ms. Ressa said on Friday. \u201cIt is meant for maximum impact of intimidation.\u201dSince taking office in 2016, Mr. Duterte has threatened to block the renewal of a license for the country\u2019s largest broadcast network, called reporters who ask him tough questions \u201cspies\u201d and warned that \u201cjust because you\u2019re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination.\u201dMr. Duterte is one of a handful of populist and increasingly authoritarian leaders around the world who have turned on the media and accused reporters of deceit and \u201cfake news,\u201d echoing a phrase used by President Trump.In the Philippines, some of those attacks have been more literal than rhetorical as Mr. Duterte used government institutions and the law to pressure journalists.Mr. Duterte\u2019s hostility toward the publication has been apparent since soon after he took office.A former mayor from the southern city of Davao, Mr. Duterte ran for president as a blunt antidrug populist. He executed a brutal campaign against drug dealers and users, leading to the deaths of thousands and prompting outcry overseas. Rappler became one of the administration\u2019s biggest critics, writing stories that raised questions about the violence.Mr. Duterte used his first state-of-the-union address in 2017 to single out Rappler, accusing it of being foreign-owned without giving any evidence. Not long after, the country\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into the ownership structure.In January, the government revoked Rappler\u2019s license, prompting accusations by rights groups and activists that the speed of the decision showed it was politically motivated. Rappler appealed and continued to operate from overseas.\u201cIt\u2019s virtual assassination,\u201d Ms. Ressa said in an interview this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a smear campaign. \u2018You\u2019re biased, you\u2019re corrupt, you\u2019re owned by Americans,\u2019\u201d she said, quoting Mr. Duterte.A veteran reporter and former CNN bureau chief, Ms. Ressa has covered wars and talked to terrorists, but she described the past two years as the most challenging in her multidecade career.She has since traveled the world, attending journalism industry events to bring awareness to the battle in the Philippines between the media and the government.Ms. Ressa created Rappler in 2012 after persuading three friends to leave their high-powered jobs at other news organizations. The women shared an optimism that the internet would create a more level playing field and give a platform to those without a voice.They also had years of experience tackling thorny issues. Ms. Ressa, who had negotiated the release of three staff members kidnapped by a Qaeda group in 2008 when she was head of ABS-CBN, the national broadcaster, has written two books on terrorism.Chay F. Hofile\u00f1a, who is head of investigations at Rappler, has written about media corruption, and Glenda Gloria, managing editor, about military corruption.They built their careers in the wake of the \u201cpeople power\u201d revolt that brought down the regime of President Ferdinand E. Marcos and ushered in Corazon Aquino, the first woman to become president of the Philippines. They have been arrested and threatened with death. A black funeral wreath was once delivered to Ms. Gloria\u2019s family door. Lilibeth Frondoso, Rappler\u2019s head of multimedia, was once thrown in prison with her newborn child.Now the future of Rappler and journalism in the Philippines is less certain than ever.\u201cNext,\u201d Ms. Ressa said, \u201cwill be an arrest warrant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Buy a Used Phone Without Getting Fleeced", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew smartphone season is here, but last year\u2019s models can offer similarly impressive features at great discounts. These tips will help you grab one without regretting it later.Apple, Samsung and Google have all launched their new phones. Everyone in the world is itching to upgrade to the latest and greatest, but not you. You\u2019re a deal hunter, and while everyone else is paying $1,000 or more for a shiny new device, you\u2019re buying a used version of last year\u2019s almost-as-good model for a fraction of the cost. Here\u2019s how to get a deal without getting scammed.When a carrier blacklists a device \u2014 which can happen if the device is reported as lost or stolen, or if someone sells it while it\u2019s still on a payment plan \u2014 it can\u2019t be activated on any carrier. That means you\u2019ll be stuck with a $400 paperweight.Some sellers may prefer to keep the IMEI private, and that\u2019s fine \u2014 as long as you have a return policy and buyer protection, you can check the IMEI after receiving the phone. You\u2019ll just have to go through the hassle of returning it if something goes wrong.If you\u2019d rather buy locally and hold the device before handing over your hard-earned cash, Mr. Edwards recommends checking the IMEI in person. \u201cWhen I was buying phones on Craigslist, I would always insist on meeting in a carrier store for the transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cThen the carrier can check to see if it\u2019s blacklisted.\u201dAgain, none of this is foolproof since a phone can be reported lost, stolen or unpaid-for after you\u2019ve purchased it, but it\u2019s a good thing to check before you do.These days, many phones are compatible with multiple networks. But there are two caveats: You need to make sure the device isn\u2019t software-locked to another carrier, and you need to make sure its hardware is optimized for your carrier.When you buy a phone directly from Verizon, AT&T or another carrier, it usually comes \u201ccarrier locked.\u201d That means that phone will only be usable on Verizon, AT&T or whatever carrier you bought it from unless you ask them to unlock it.If you\u2019re buying a used phone, you want to make sure it isn\u2019t locked to a carrier other than your own. If you\u2019re on AT&T, you can\u2019t buy a phone that\u2019s locked to Verizon. You\u2019ll either want an AT&T-branded phone or a phone that\u2019s listed as \u201cunlocked\u201d by the seller.In addition, \u201csome phones have a few different numeric models that work better on some carriers than others,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cFor full and optimal compatibility, you need to pay attention to the specifics.\u201dThat means you shouldn\u2019t just search for \u201ciPhone 7\u201d and buy the cheapest listing that pops up. The iPhone 7 A1660 may look nearly identical to the A1778, but the former works on all carriers, while the latter lacks support for some of the technologies used on Verizon and Sprint. In other cases, you may run into \u201cinternational\u201d models, which can lack support for certain features (like Samsung Pay, in the case of the international version of the Galaxy S7).If you aren\u2019t sure which model numbers are compatible with your network, check on the manufacturer\u2019s website, or Google around to find out which model your carrier sells; then, search for that on your marketplace of choice.Once you\u2019re able to hold the phone \u2014 whether during a physical meetup or after receiving it in the mail \u2014 be sure to inspect it for damage. If you\u2019re meeting in person, find a spot with good light, so you can inspect the phone slowly and carefully.\u201cObviously, scratches, dents and cracked glass will be evident by handling the phone,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cWater damage is harder to spot from the outside of the phone, but every phone usually does have one or two moisture indicators \u2014 sometimes behind the battery, sometimes in the SIM card tray. That\u2019s one of those things that should be checked once you\u2019ve got the phone in hand.\u201d Before you buy, research to see if there are moisture indicators you can check once you have the device.You\u2019ll also want to turn on the screen and swipe around for a bit. \u201cIf an item\u2019s been repaired or refurbished, it may have been a shoddy repair job,\u201d said Mr. Edwards. \u201cThat can be sometimes be harder to spot, but give the screen a quick usability test once you\u2019ve got it.\u201dIf you don\u2019t find any damage, perform a factory reset on the phone right away to ensure it isn\u2019t locked to the seller\u2019s iCloud or Google account, which will prevent you from using it. If it resets and you\u2019re able to log in with your account, you\u2019re good to go.On the other hand, if you find damage that wasn\u2019t indicated in the listing, you can either call off the purchase, negotiate the price down or \u2014 if the phone was purchased online \u2014 open up a dispute with the seller. Remember, even if you aren\u2019t annoyed by a particular flaw, it could lower the phone\u2019s resale value if you decide to sell it down the line. So it\u2019s usually in your best interest to get a phone in good condition, even if you can get a damaged one for cheaper.There are never any guarantees with buying used, even if you stick to these best practices. In my experience, though, problems are pretty rare, and for every broken device you might receive, you\u2019ll have many more that work perfectly \u2014 and even if you occasionally get fleeced with no recourse, you\u2019ll likely save money in the long run. Just take the right precautions, and you should be prepared for almost any hiccup that comes your way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Restlessly Seeking Celine", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPhoebe Philo has left the house, but fans are still chasing the designer\u2019s greatest hits. Combined with a surge in sales of recent and more vintage Philo designs, that figure, Ms. Boucinha said, would seem to suggest a consumer reaction \u2014 a mini-revolt, if you will \u2014 unmatched in recent memory. \u201cAt luxury houses, designers come and go,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen this kind of response to a switch in a house\u2019s creative direction.\u201dThe rush appeared to signal disenchantment with Mr. Slimane, who in his debut collection for the house swapped Ms. Philo\u2019s deftly underplayed, slightly masculine swagger for a steamier rock-meets-young-Hollywood look. But that discontent only partly accounts for the recent spike in Philo fever. Supplies may dwindle or vanish entirely from stores, but demand remains robust.\u201cIn terms of the crowds, it felt like being at Zara,\u201d Ms. Giangola said. \u201cThere was the feeling that you had to grab it all, and if you didn\u2019t, the next day it would all be gone.\u201dRarely has an exiting designer been so pursued \u2014 or so eulogized.\u201cBar perhaps Coco Chanel, I can\u2019t think of another designer whose every piece was instantaneously \u2018a classic,\u2019\u201d Lucy Chadwick, an influential art dealer, told T magazine earlier this fall. \u201cIn a time of eternally rotating fads and disposability and waste, nothing felt more necessary.\u201d Ms. Philo\u2019s sustained impact can also be measured through online searches and sales. On eBay, searches jumped 225 percent on Sept. 29, the day after Mr. Slimane showed his first collection. Sales, which sprinted ahead 35 percent from September to October, continue to climb, up 10 percent month over month, according to the company. At the RealReal, searches increased in October, with a sustained growth of 32 percent over the same period last year, said Rati Sahi Levesque, the chief merchant of the company. Prices have climbed by 30 percent over last year at this time, she noted, and revenues are up 35 percent. At Tradesy, searches for Celine have increased 34 percent since September, compared with June through August. In October, the average selling price leapt 35 percent, according to Tracy DiNunzio, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cThe things that cost more were the things that sold,\u201d Ms. DiNunzio said.\u201cWe have more people asking, \u2018Oh, what do you have in Celine?\u2019\u201d said Ina Bernstein, the owner of the Ina group of consignment stores in Manhattan. \u201cPhilo designs have alway gone fast, but they go even faster now. We can\u2019t keep the signature trapeze and luggage bags in stock.\u201d Never mind prices that range from $1,800 to about $2,500. A pair of boots combining pony, camel, black leather and leopard, outr\u00e9 by conservative standards, sold the day they arrived, Ms. Bernstein said. The rush on Ms. Philo\u2019s creations attests to a loyalty her contemporaries seldom command. Her aesthetic, some argue, represented a sea change. \u201cShe gave us a long slit dress in place of a short one, wide-leg pants that got us out of clingy jeans,\u201d Ms. Boucinha said. Ms. Philo \u201credefined femininity,\u201d Ms. Bernstein said. \u201cHer oversize dresses and coats layered over trousers stressed comfort and elegance over blatant sex appeal. She gave women permission to walk around in big clunky shoes and sneakers.\u201d\u201cLook around,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one is walking all day in high heels any more.\u201dMs. Philo\u2019s acolytes tend to shop with a collector\u2019s discernment. \u201cSince discovering Celine, I\u2019ve thought less about quantity and more about quality,\u201d Ms. Giangola said. \u201cI started shopping less and focusing more on the way I spent money and wore clothes.\u201dShe might say that her purchases were justified by the longevity of Ms. Philo\u2019s designs. So might Lizzie Hanes, an aesthetician in Brooklyn who was spotted last week eyeing a Philo cream-colored coat at the RealReal in SoHo. \u201cSo much Celine that I bought I\u2019m going to have forever,\u201d Ms. Hanes said. \u201cIf I were to buy an Ulla Johnson dress, I would probably be tired of it in a season or two.\u201dFur-lined Birkenstocks and blush-tone coats aside, it\u2019s often not easy to tell what season a Celine piece is from, Ms. Bernstein said, suggesting that Ms. Philo\u2019s designs have no apparent sell-by date. \u201cThey\u2019re all very timeless,\u201d she said, adding a bit dourly. \u201cSo much of fashion isn\u2019t timeless right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And to deliver on that strategy, many have created jobs with titles like chief consumer officer, chief experience officer, and chief digital and client officer.Such consumer-centric positions have been around for years in industries like banking and hospitality but they only recently started popping up in the luxury sector. \u201cLuxury and fashion brands are finally starting to concentrate on what customers expect from them,\u201d said Jean R\u00e9vis of MAD Network, a luxury consultancy and headhunting firm in Paris.And the new focus is, he added, \u201ca radical change from their previous top-down view of the world, when they got away with simply imposing their creative vision without taking into consideration customers\u2019 expectations.\u201dThose expectations are Mr. Sala\u2019s job. \u201cWe are not aiming for a one-shot sale but to make the customer feel that he or she is part of the maison,\u201d he said. So, for example, he has helped sales assistants learn how to build customer relationships, and sees his mission as making \u201csure that the customer gets a personalized service both online and offline and that there is no point of friction between the two.\u201d\u201cThese are new jobs,\u201d said Mr. Sala, who previously was watch marketing manager at Van Cleef & Arpels and its high jewelry product manager. \u201cSo, of course, when I started my career, I never expected to do this job today, and I am sure that my job as it is today will be completely different in a few years.\u201dSome of the executives filling these new \u201cC\u201d (or \u201cchief\u201d) level positions have luxury retail, e-commerce and technology backgrounds, dovetailing well with the brands\u2019 new and future customers, who are glued to their cellphones and routinely browse the internet before buying. But others come from very different fields.Givenchy, for example, has a new global customer experience director, Guillaume Desjardins, who previously worked at Ralph Lauren and the five-star Le Bristol hotel in Paris. Francesca Danzi, a customer experience and luxury retail consultant, became chief client officer at Tory Burch in July.And in June, Kenzo appointed a chief client and digital officer, Bruno Alazard, whose experience included jobs at Est\u00e9e Lauder, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Yahoo.Yet Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, the wine and spirits group that is part of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, hired Laure Baume as its chief consumer officer, although she had no luxury experience. She previously worked for Club Med; A\u00e9roports de Paris, which operates the three Paris airports; and Kraft Foods.In the brand\u2019s description of the Wooster Street store that opened in New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood in May, it said store connectors would \u201cconnect clients to Gucci in a new, emotional way to discover the house\u2019s latest products and collaborations\u201d \u2014 along with in-store features like a Gucci app whose augmented reality features allow customers to experiment with product customization on the spot.\u201cBeing able to connect the online and physical customer journey,\u201d said Luke Timmins, the store experience manager at Browns East in London, \u201cis key in creating a seamless experience that puts the customer first by being personal, efficient and inspiring across all channels.\u201dFarfetch, the online luxury retailer that owns Browns, is using the store to test technology that includes an app to track everything customers touch or try, which it plans to roll out at the Browns flagship in Mayfair and at some Chanel stores next year, thanks to a partnership the two companies signed earlier this year.Yet even as luxury houses expand their ranks with customer service hires \u2014 as well as data analysts to manage and interpret the information, like shopping and travel habits, that they now are gathering \u2014 some industry experts say the transitions could be difficult. \u201cI am wary of catapulting people from the technology and engineering worlds to executive positions as they come from a different corporate culture, which means that they might not be easy to integrate,\u201d said Marie-Aude Stocker, director of people, development and prospective at Van Cleef & Arpels, where she also is a member of the executive committee.Most luxury brands have hierarchical lines of command and long decision-making processes, the kind of traditional organization that can be difficult for outsiders to navigate, especially those from the more freewheeling corporate cultures of Silicon Valley, start-ups and consultancies.Challenging entrenched management could become frustrating, industry insiders say, leading to a loss of motivation and, in the end, preventing new executives from delivering on the changes they were hired to make.\u201cMiddle managers all say they want change but \u2018not in my department,\u2019\u201d said Antoinette Lemens, an executive search specialist in Paris. \u201cIt is too early days to know if people in such new positions as chief digital officer will be successful as it is certainly not an easy job!\u201dIn all these new positions, \u201cI think brands are experimenting,\u201d said Grace Nida, managing director of the global luxury sector at Korn Ferry International, an organizational consulting firm. \u201cBut one thing is clear: they need the full support of the C.E.O.; otherwise they will not be able to drive the transformation for which they were hired.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everything on Amazon Is Amazon!", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe infinite retailer appears to be ushering untold numbers of stealth brands into your life, even as it plans to take over the East Coast. If you like Ween Charm, you\u2019ll love Austin Mill!In 1618, an aspiring alchemist in Constantinople named Avedis created his first copper alloy cymbals. In 2018, a few hundred products from his brand, Zildjian, one of the oldest companies in the world, are eligible for Amazon Prime shipping, just like Hanes underwear or Xerox copiers or Bounty paper towels or Chanel perfume or an Eames chair or Colgate toothpaste or a brand-new PopSocket for your phone.A lot of these brands \u2014 most explicitly the Basics products and various household staples \u2014 appear to be straightforward margin plays. Others, clothing brands in particular, fill gaps left by companies that have steered clear of the platform altogether. Others, well, who\u2019s to say?Amazon-affiliated brands are promoted in search results on the site and inflated by reviews from Amazon\u2019s Vine program, in which users receive items in exchange for their feedback. And, compared to better known competitors, they tend to be priced aggressively. In creating its own brands Amazon is indeed like any other large store. But Amazon isn\u2019t any other large store. It\u2019s Amazon: the world-historical logistical experiment that happens to call itself a store. It has unlimited shelf space and a boss with an eye on global domination. It tends to try a lot of things at once.And so while there are non-Amazon brands, and there are Amazon brands, there are also brands that live in the vast in-between. Some are exclusive to Amazon, but not exclusively owned by Amazon. Basic Care, which markets a variety of over-the-counter medications, is only available on Amazon; on the product page for \u201cBasic Care Night Time Cold & Flu, Cherry Flavor, 12 Fluid Ounce,\u201d Amazon\u2019s relationship to the product is not so obvious. This arrangement, too, has decades of precedent in American retail: the trademark for Basic Care belongs to its manufacturer, Perrigo, which makes private-label products for Walmart, Kroger and others \u2014 brands that are exclusive to each store but that often do not bear the store\u2019s name. Some start as exclusive; some become exclusive. Anyone is free to create an in-between brand that is technically \u201cexclusive\u201d to Amazon, with or without Amazon\u2019s help. Large private-label manufacturers do it, as they have for other retailers for decades. Smaller companies have made Amazon their only sales channel and adopted new brand names for the site. These varied arrangements are minimally risky for Amazon, and increasingly appealing, or at least urgent, for companies watching as Amazon consolidates power. Earlier this year, the company announced an \u201cAccelerator\u201d program inviting companies to \u201cJoin the Amazon Family of Brands,\u201d and more recently a link joined the footer of Amazon\u2019s website encouraging manufacturers to \u201cSell Under Private Brands.\u201dWhat would distinguish these products from their equivalent WULFUL and YFFUSHI products, the thinking goes, is a more convincingly localized brand \u2014 a story, such as it is, tailored the market where it is meant to be sold. This is the tale of retail globalization, in miniature, told in the style of self-help. A distant manufacturer makes the product. You, the upstart importer \u2014 or massive domestic brand \u2014 rebrand it for your countrymen, and bring it to market. As you scroll through the results for \u201cthree piece suit,\u201d you\u2019ll eventually encounter a brand called Austin Mill. Austin Mill, like WULFUL, sells extremely affordable suits, as well as other men\u2019s apparel. But its name is at least vaguely consonant with a slice of American-style men\u2019s wear branding in 2018. The product descriptions are more carefully edited, and sizes are listed by measurement, not as foreign conversions. Crucially, Austin Mill has a logo.The Austin Mill contest got 251 submissions; the one that won, by the user BAROKATANFIRRIZKI_88, now represents the brand. A designer in Bulgaria named Ralitsa Hand created the winning logo for Brooke Mille, a casual women\u2019s apparel brand on Amazon. She said there was no hint that the company might have been involved. \u201cUsually the client writes some basic info in the brief in order to give directions for the designers,\u201d Ms. Hand said. \u201cI had no contact with the client.\u201d (The sliders indicated the following: more \u201cFeminine\u201d than \u201cMasculine;\u201d more \u201cOrganic\u201d than \u201cGeometric.\u201d)Likewise, restricting results to \u201cOur Brands\u201d and then searching for specific product names can direct users to Beautiful Nomad. Clicking through to \u201cWomen\u2019s Apparel\u201d in Amazon\u2019s \u201cExplore Our Brands\u201d page, however, yields 10 curated pages of products, featuring its house brands and some better-known exclusive brands, but not Brooke Mille, or others like it.An eagle-eyed discount suit shopper might notice, while browsing the WULFUL listing, an \u201cOur Brands\u201d box that promotes products by none other than Austin Mill.\u201cSome are without a doubt Amazon brands,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile others require a little research to discover that fact. Sometimes that fact is emphasized and other times it is downplayed.\u201dUnfamiliar with a new brand of socks he\u2019d been sent, a different Vine reviewer named Sanpete did some searching, found the logo contests, made the Amazon connection and shrugged. \u201cKosy Komfort appears to be a new brand,\u201d he wrote in his review. \u201cGood deal on that logo.\u201d He added: \u201cThey\u2019re very nice socks, comfortable indeed.\u201dBrooke Mille did not respond to a message sent through Amazon. Amazon declined to comment, but emphasized, as it does in some places on its site, that \u201cOur Brands\u201d include both Amazon-owned and \u201cexclusive\u201d brands.If there\u2019s a mystery here, it\u2019s just which of the many plausible and reasonable explanations are at work. Consumers are used to seeing private label brands \u2014 or packer\u2019s labels, or store brands, or house brands, or reanimated ghost brands \u2014 in stores even if we don\u2019t quite understand what they are or where they come from. Some brands are labeled \u201cfor Target,\u201d while others just don\u2019t seem to exist anywhere else, and so we make our assumptions, or don\u2019t think of them at all, and keep shopping. As is often the case with Amazon, what seem like strange or inexplicable new behaviors are often old retail strategies unfolding on the internet, quickly, and in plainer view. Brooke Mille is no more a lie than any other brand: It\u2019s just newer and faster and more online. And it has a lot more company. Advertisement"}

Their shared curiosity and desire to travel the world became an integral part of their friendship. The designers started to conceptualize the brand in 2015, when they took a trip to the southern coast of India \u2014 and brought along fanny packs to be practical. \u201cWe realized the search for a sophisticated contemporary belt bag was a task of sourcing the web and eBay, with very few options,\u201d Annece told T. \u201cThe void in the market presented an opportunity that we felt inclined to respond to.\u201dIn County Wexford, Ireland, where the fashion designer Richard Malone grew up, an art or fashion degree \u201cwasn\u2019t considered practical or useful,\u201d he says.

Since then, he has earned acclaim for his focus on unusual fabrics, sustainable craftsmanship and challenging ideas of good taste. His pieces often nod to the cultural codes of Ireland in the 1980s and \u201990s, but reimagined with unconventional silhouettes and fabrics, such as Econyl \u2014 made from recycled nylon \u2014 and tarpaulin salvaged from shipping trucks; at his first-ever show, he presented an avant-garde take on the uniform his mother wore for her job at Argos, a British catalog retailer. \u201cBeing around clothes that aren\u2019t for glamour\u2019s sake brings a unique perspective,\u201d says the designer, who last year was shortlisted for the prestigious LVMH Prize.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s New at Langlitz Leathers? Nothing", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s a motorcycle world equivalent of couture, and it\u2019s hiding in Portland, Ore.Zippers that date from the Truman presidency may not seem the most desirable hardware to most, but Tommy Lee Jones, Don Simpson and the Dylans (Bob and his son Jakob) would disagree. For bikers \u2014 or those who want to look the part \u2014 Langlitz is the equivalent of a couture house: a symbol of a value system that exists outside today\u2019s world of fast fashion, social-media-seeded drops and product placement.Langlitz jackets are still made by hand and sold exactly the same way they were when the company was founded by Ross Langlitz in 1947. It doesn\u2019t advertise, and the garments carry no external branding; while each jacket is unique, the only people who will know that it\u2019s special are other Langlitz owners, and there aren\u2019t many. Only about a thousand people will take possession of a new Langlitz this year, at prices ranging from $1,000 for a base model to over $2,000, depending on customer options. (That Crown zipper alone adds $150, when it\u2019s still available at all.)Chris Page, a Nike executive who is also the president of a local racing club, recently picked up his first Langlitz. \u201cOf course it fits, and it has the features I wanted,\u201d Mr. Page said. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to it than that. The person who cut it, the person who sewed it \u2014 they\u2019re right there. The moment I put it on, I knew I\u2019d have it for the rest of my life, and I could feel that entire trajectory.\u201dAn avid motorcyclist whose passion cost him a leg and kept him out of World War II, Ross Langlitz won dozens of races in the Pacific Northwest in the late 1940s, a hobby that introduced him to numerous returning servicemen who often wore surplus leather flight jackets while on their bikes. Mr. Langlitz found that such garments didn\u2019t fit well when he was hunched over his bike, so he took one apart and modified it, using the skills he had picked up while working in a glove factory during the war. Then he made a jacket from scratch. Portland racers pestered him to make jackets for them, too. His first style, the Columbia, is still the best seller.As demand took off, Langlitz moved to larger and larger facilities. (The company was originally named Speedway Togs; in 1950 it became Langlitz Leathers, with every jacket made to order.)By then there were a half-dozen styles, along with three basic pairs of leather trousers. Those are still the main products, although a wide range of options \u2014 Cossack or dress collars, belts, extra padding on the elbows and shoulders \u2014 ensure that no two Langlitz jackets are the same. Even the pocket lining is up to the customer; most are canvas sailcloth, but leather is also an option. (The catalog still refers to leather lining as a \u201cgun pocket.\u201d)Langlitz Leathers moved to its current location on Southeast Division Street in Portland in 1972. Ross retired in 1982 and died a few years later, leaving the business to his daughter Jackie. Ross\u2019s granddaughter Judy is the last family member actively involved in the business, and although she is rarely in the shop these days, the old ways are preserved with near-religious fervor. The current catalog still uses photos of Ross modeling his own jackets, taken around 1950, and the shop remains a shrine to the golden era of American motorcycle racing in the \u201940s, \u201950s and \u201960s. It is full of Ross\u2019s racing trophies, and motorcycles that, if you look closely, were modified so he could ride them with one leg.Customers are also welcome to sketch their own special requests. The order form also includes a box that customers can check if the jacket won\u2019t be worn on a motorcycle, so the fit can be adjusted accordingly.A cutter takes that order back to an alcove where hundreds of Ross\u2019s original cardboard patterns are archived, traces it onto kraft paper and adapts it to suit the customer\u2019s measurements. (Kota Kakutani, who has been a cutter for 14 years, called the process \u201cputting in the pluses and minuses.\u201d)The cutter then picks out hides. Nowadays, most are goatskin or cowhide, which is available in three thicknesses. There\u2019s a choice of lining material, too; nylon (which is durable) or a cotton-rayon blend (a little softer.) Both materials are milled in the United States.Once the leather and lining have been cut, they are bundled with the order form and put on a cart. A seamstress picks a bundle and does all the sewing on a vintage Pfaff sewing machine. She (they\u2019re all women) works on an entire garment from start to finish, down to the zippers, rivets and snaps. There\u2019s nothing resembling an assembly line, and no piecework.Each seamstress manufactures one or two jackets a day, depending on the complexity of the pattern and the customer\u2019s options. Job security is not an issue, because there is always a backlog of several hundred orders.For the last 20 years, Langlitz has also supplied a Japanese distributor that operates boutiques in Tokyo and Nagoya, where staff members help take measurements and translate the order form. About a third of total production is now sold to Japanese customers.Langlitz also takes jackets back for sale or consignment. Those sell for a few hundred dollars, but older jackets in very good condition have gone for upward of $5,000 on eBay.If Langlitz\u2019s business model has a flaw, it\u2019s that each jacket is built to last a lifetime, if not longer. However, there\u2019s an old motorcycle truism that goes, \u201cThere\u2019s only two kinds of riders: those who have crashed, and those who will crash.\u201d So the shop has a seamstress dedicated to repairing and reconditioning.Indeed, under one old glass counter, in among hard-core biker memorabilia, there\u2019s a handwritten note in a small frame, thanking Langlitz for \u201cyour time and patience in helping to fix and preserve my favorite jacket.\u201dIts author is Ralph Lauren.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Black Friday 2018: A Not-So-Wild Day for American Shoppers", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere we are again: Mildly annoyed by the obvious consumerism, but totally in love with the deals. It must be Black Friday.Shoppers won\u2019t want for time this year: The gap between Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 32 days if you don\u2019t count the holidays themselves \u2014 is long (next year it will be just 26 days). That means procrastinators get more time to put things off and retailers get one more shot at luring you in. But beware: Hanukkah is coming on the early side this year.We\u2019ll be covering it all here, with reporters weighing in from near and far.Just before 11 a.m. at the Fashion Island mall in Orange County, Calif., the line to see Santa Claus was about 15-people deep, including parents and grandparents. Laura Natale, who lives nearby, brought her three-year-old son Christopher to see Santa. Asked if the crowds were any larger than a typical Friday, she said: \u201cNot really.\u201dOthers had anticipated more bustle at this palm-and-Christmas-tree-laden outdoor mall near Newport Beach, saying they remembered a bigger post-Thanksgiving rush last year. \u201cIt\u2019s more empty than I expected,\u201d said Michelle Gorczyza, who also lives in the area. She did encounter a long line at Anthropologie, so she skipped the store, deciding she could just as easily buy online.Her husband Danny said that nowadays people come to the mall more for the food and the experience than the shopping. \u201cYou don\u2019t see people running around with 10 bags,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to spend $50 on lunch and just soak in the atmosphere.\u201dThat\u2019s what 28-year old Mitch Williams did on this sunny morning, sitting beneath one of the palm trees. \u201cMy grandpa is visiting from Ohio, so we\u2019re having coffee and omelets.\u201dWas he doing any shopping? He shook his head no: \u201cI do that online.\u201d\u2014 Cade MetzRetailers start marketing it months in advance. Hordes of shoppers turn out in person and online. Google even programmed it into its calendar as an official holiday.But Black Friday has competition. Lots of it.Those are just the free-for-alls, where all retailers can participate.\u201cIf we\u2019ve seen anything in retail over the last 20, 30 years, it\u2019s that consumers need to be motivated to shop,\u201d said Michael Brown, a partner with A.T. Kearney\u2019s retail practice. \u201cThey need to be provoked.\u201dFor anyone above all that crass consumerism? There\u2019s a day for them, too.\u2014 Tiffany HsuRetailers and analysts said Black Friday 2018 got off to a strong start \u2014 and all indications were that it finished strong, too.Though the cold weather in the eastern United States may have kept some shoppers home, Mastercard SpendingPulse said that generally \u201conline sales appear to be filling in any weather related soft spots in brick and mortar sales.\u201d The clothing, electronics and interior furnishing sectors were seeing especially good traction, the analysis said.\u201cStores are busy, there\u2019s good traffic, the queues are manageable and well-staffed, and inventory levels appear to be good for the time of day too,\u201d said Frank Layo, managing director of Kurt Salmon, which is part of Accenture Strategy. \u201cRetailers helped themselves by starting promotions much earlier this year to spread out the holiday shopping traffic and mitigate chaos. Their efforts appear to be paying off.\u201d\u2014 Matt StevensEarly in the day, J. Crew wrote on Twitter that it was \u201cexperiencing some technical difficulties\u201d with its website. The site appeared to be functioning fine soon afterward.Still, analysts monitoring Black Friday said online sales were chugging along, driven in part by the cold, wet weather in some parts of the country, which they said may have nudged some shoppers away from stores and toward their computers or smartphones.\u2014 Matt StevensHere\u2019s the upshot: Black Friday is a great time to buy a new video game console, a television, headphones or a smart home product like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. One of the most notable deals we\u2019ve seen: Best Buy, Amazon and many retailers are selling Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 with a new Spider-Man game for $200, down from the normal price of $300 for the console alone. So come prepared: Jot down a list of things you\u2019d like to buy in those categories and look out for price drops.\u2014 Brian X. ChenYou clearly have an insatiable appetite for The Times\u2019s Black Friday coverage! Here are a few recent stories you might enjoy about this very American \u201choliday\u201d and how it fits into the broader economy.\u2014 David EnrichBelieve it or not, not everyone is a fan of Black Friday.\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for respect and a fair wage at work,\u201d David Holt, one of the organizers of the demonstration, said in an interview on Wednesday. He added that Black Friday was an especially appealing time for labor movements to organize. \u201cOne of the things this Black Friday protest is about is consumerism.\u201dMr. Holt said he hoped that holding the demonstration in front of a Walmart would encourage shoppers to think about labor conditions for the store\u2019s employees.\u2014 Zach WichterThere is no Thanksgiving holiday in Europe, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the associated consumer bonanza from hitting shops there. French retail brands like Darty, Fnac and Monoprix joined Apple, Sephora and Uniqlo in efforts to attract bargain hunters on Friday.In Britain, where sales used to take place after Christmas, shops have added Black Friday to their promotional calendars. Offers have been trickling in for at least a week. Amazon started its sales on Nov. 16.Most other stores have joined the fray with even discount supermarkets offering money off everything from vintage turntables to legs of ham.\u2014 Amie TsangYes, Black Friday is everywhere \u2014 even Canada.The \u201choliday\u201d \u2014 in French-speaking Montreal, they call it \u201cVendredi Fou\u201d \u2014 has reportedly become Canada\u2019s busiest shopping day of the year, eclipsing Boxing Day (or Dec. 26), when the traditional post-Christmas Day sales would bring out hordes of shoppers.This Black Friday, the stores in Montreal were packed, especially in the underground, labyrinth-like malls such as Eaton Center, which was crowded with people seeking shelter from the subfreezing weather. Athletic wear, women\u2019s shoes and men\u2019s suits were marked off at 50 percent or more in the Eaton Center mall. Outside one electronics store, velvet ropes were set up to keep the queues under control.It\u2019s said that Black Friday first migrated to Canada in the early 2000s, when the American and Canadian dollars were roughly on par. These days the greenback is worth 1.32 Canadian dollars, making these discounts even greater. \u2014 Stuart EmmrichThe Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said it sold $30.8 billion worth of goods on Nov. 11, the annual online bonanza known as Singles Day. The company rang up $1 billion in sales in the first 85 seconds of this year\u2019s frenzy. It took an hour to reach $10 billion. All in all, the company says it generated more than a billion delivery orders that day.For some context: In the United States last year, online shopping from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday totaled about $19.62 billion, according to Adobe Analytics. (Yes, it\u2019s true, that doesn\u2019t include all the in-store shopping that took place on Black Friday.)In addition to inundating phone owners with coupons and deals for weeks in advance, Alibaba deploys subtler methods to gin up sales on Singles Day. This year, users of the company\u2019s Taobao shopping app could see how their spending on Nov. 11 compared to that of other people in their area.\u2014 Raymond ZhongFor many shoppers, Black Friday actually begins right in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner.\u2014 Nellie BowlesOnline shoppers, too, were busy on Thanksgiving Day. They shelled out $3.7 billion on Thursday, an increase of about 28 percent compared to last year, according to a report from Adobe Analytics, which tracks transactions from 80 of the country\u2019s top 100 online retailers.And many of those online shoppers aren\u2019t heading to their desks or even grabbing their laptops. Thanksgiving marked the first day during which $1 billion in sales came from smartphones, Adobe said. And consumers spent more on their phones, with average order values up 8 percent compared with Thanksgiving Day last year.\u2014 Zach WichterIt could help retailers offset some of the deep discounts that consumers expect on Black Friday.\u201cIf you can grab people in the inspirational moment, they\u2019re not going to be as price-sensitive and maybe they won\u2019t shop around,\u201d said Jill Standish, Accenture\u2019s global lead for retail.Another advantage? Online, Ms. Standish said, it can be easy \u201cfor a small brand to look big\u201d if they know how to present themselves, and know how to attract the right influencer profiles to promote their products. A strong social media presence can make a company seem instantly reputable.\u2014 Zach WichterThere are three reasons that Black Friday is so popular, and two of them are the deals, according to Tulin Erdem, a marketing professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.\u201cThe economic savings, feeling good about yourself having found a good deal, being a shrewd consumer,\u201d she said, all add up to one key factor. Plus, because so many stores offer Black Friday sales, it\u2019s easier to find discounts without having to search as hard as you might during the rest of the year.But, Dr. Erdem said, another reason Black Friday remains so popular is tradition.\u201cIt still has its appeal because of this ritualistic aspect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a big important baseball game or Super Bowl as an American family.\u201dConsider that the National Retail Federation surveyed 7,516 consumers about their shopping plans this year, and 26 percent of those who planned to shop on Black Friday said it was because of tradition. An additional 23 percent said they would shop because it\u2019s just something to do. (As far as we know, nobody was asked whether they\u2019re shopping just to get away from family members.)Of course Black Friday is just the start of things. If retailers don\u2019t start discounting before Thanksgiving \u2014 and most seem to \u2014 they are certainly using the holiday shopping season to push merchandise at every turn. The biggest discounts tend to come on \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d \u2014 the last Saturday before Christmas, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail analysis firm.But Black Friday does matter. Consumers surveyed by the retail federation said they planned to shop more on Black Friday than on any other day of the Thanksgiving weekend.And Black Friday maintains cultural cache, especially for \u201cnew Americans,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, as recent immigrants are more likely to take part. \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn to be an American consumer, by showing up and shopping on Black Friday.\u201d\u2014 Zach WichterAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Commonality of A.I. and Diversity", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow to create more diverse workplaces and how to use artificial intelligence ethically are among the more challenging dilemmas facing business and government.These topics were the subject of two separate task forces that met at last week\u2019s DealBook conference. Each task force, composed of about a dozen experts and industry leaders, met for an hour, emerging with some specific guidelines and focus areas that were shared with the conference and could be taken back to companies and other organizations for discussion.Companies must be aware of and recognize that algorithms are not neutral, but created by humans with biases and beliefs and make every effort to eliminate those biases.It is far too easy to assume that technology has an objectivity that humans don\u2019t. But the reality is that \u201cartificial intelligence and machine learning and algorithms in general are designed by none other than us \u2014 people,\u201d said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School.\u201cA.I. takes input data and races off to make inference and decision making about the world at lightening pace,\u201d he said, and those inferences will include unacknowledged biases unless people are willing to recognize them and invest the time and money to weed them out.Frida Polli, co-founder and chief executive of Pymetrics, which uses A.I. to recruit employees for companies, showed how biases could arise and how they could be diminished.Algorithms used in A.I. are created using training data sets. If a training data has an overrepresentation of any gender or ethnicity, the features that distinguish that group may be overweighted.To confront the problem, she said her company tested an algorithm on a reference group of people of different genders and ethnicities to check for bias. If there\u2019s an imbalance in the test run \u2014 far more men, for example, or whites are predicted to be good hires rather than women or other races \u2014 then \u201cwe can look at de-weighting features,\u201d she said, that alter the algorithm.Technology companies can and should help the government \u2014 and the military in particular \u2014 develop and use artificial intelligence, but it must be done thoughtfully and carefully.\u201cThe debate is ongoing about when and how to share technology with the government and specifically should companies share digital technology with the military,\u201d said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft.Most of the task force agreed that partnerships between technology companies and government on A.I. could be beneficial, but Serkan Piantino, founder and chief executive of Spell, a company that builds tools for those building A.I. technology, said there should be limits.\u201cAutomating the process to use lethal force is something I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable doing, given how little we know with what is going on with A.I. algorithms,\u201d he said.A.I. requires transparency within the companies building and using it and with the public.Having company employees debate and speak out on potentially controversial issues involving A.I. \u2014 such as at Microsoft \u2014 is one form of transparency. Dennis Crowley, co-founder and executive chairman of Foursquare, said his company had internal discussions when making business decisions that might have ethical implications.\u201cSometimes we have the opportunity to create more evil than good, and we need to talk about that,\u201d he said. One example, he said, was whether his company would work with fast-food chains that wanted to target those using cannabis dispensaries where it was legal. It hadn\u2019t been done before.\u201cThis was right on the edge, so we went to the ethics committee,\u201d Mr. Crowley said. In the end, \u201cwe decided to do the campaign. It was legal and clever and a good use of technology around a category where we don\u2019t see a lot of advertising.\u201dCordell Schachter, the chief technology officer for the New York City Transportation Department, noted that transparency would be crucial with those creating the city\u2019s future transportation technology, which would be driven by A.I.\u201cWe want to see the data \u2014 and not cherry-picked data \u2014 before it goes on the streets,\u201d he said.Companies should set targets and goals, along with incentives, as a way to foster a more diverse staff, but they shouldn\u2019t be used in a vacuum.\u201cAspirational goals are important, but \u201c it\u2019s just not enough,\u201d said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say you want to get the world or your company to 50-50 \u2014 there needs to be transparency around that.\u201dThat means what specifically is the goal, and what is the company doing to achieve that goal \u2014 \u201cboth good and bad,\u201d she said.\u201cThere is a growing body of evidence that suggests cognitive diversity contributes to better decision making at the board level,\u201d said Cyrus Taraporevala, president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. \u201cStudies show that diverse boards pay more attention to risk management and are less susceptible to cronyism and group think.\u201dBut there\u2019s a danger that goals become items to be checked rather than real change. Damien Hooper-Campbell, chief diversity officer at eBay, said that while setting goals and targets for diversity was important \u2014 and backing it up with real costs, such as bonus deductions, if the goals aren\u2019t met \u2014 you also have to \u201cmeet a company where it is.\u201dIf a company has just begun to focus on diversifying its work force, it needs to be educated on how to do it over time, he said. \u201cPeople talk about how businesses measure widgets and productivity, so they can measure this, too. But there\u2019s a big difference between widgets and human beings.\u201dFederal policies and legislation can play a role in promoting diversity in the workplace.Developing laws and policy to create diversity is not always a popular idea, but some say they believe that there are areas where government can help. John Hope Bryant, founder and chairman of Operation HOPE, a community organization, said there was a need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships. When the effort is aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get double credit for that double reach.\u201dA federal policy to encourage paid family leave would also play a crucial role in promoting diversity, said Sallie Krawcheck, chief executive and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial adviser for women.Federal policy could also help ensure that the information companies report on the makeup of their work forces and the compensation are truly transparent. For example, in Britain, many public-, private- and voluntary-sector companies are required to disclose average pay for men and women, including bonuses.In the United States, said Lauren Taylor Wolfe, managing partner of Impactive Capital, \u201ca lot of companies decide what they disclose and what not to disclose. If it\u2019s not done by level, it\u2019s not real transparency.\u201dTo be truly diverse and inclusive, a company must change its culture \u2014 and that has to come from the top down.\u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it, it will be an organ reject,\u201d said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase.Or as Ms. Taylor Wolfe noted, \u201ccompanies get what they celebrate, and if they celebrate diversity, they\u2019ll get it.\u201dNo one expects cultural change to happen quickly, but one of the important elements, Ms. Duckett said, is that bosses need to \u201cmanage to the difference.\u201d Don\u2019t manage everyone the same and expect the same results.After all, parents don\u2019t expect each child to be the same \u2014 they parent differently depending on a child\u2019s personality, strengths and weaknesses, she said. Managers have to do the same.She also noted that diversity was not the same as inclusion and companies must be aware of that. \u201cDiversity,\u201d she said, \u201cis being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance.\u201dFinally, change may seem glacially slow, but Mr. Hooper-Campbell said people shouldn\u2019t be surprised. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t but 100 years ago that I couldn\u2019t go to school with some of the people in this room.\u201dAdvertisement"}
