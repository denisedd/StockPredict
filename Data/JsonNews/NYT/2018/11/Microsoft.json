I do this willingly and happily, and not as a subconscious rebellion against technology, or out of obligation or some masochistic delight. This confuses friends, colleagues and even my wife, who can\u2019t fathom why I keep to-do lists, appointments, even birthdays in an academic planner instead of on Google calendar.Crazy, right?On a base level, there\u2019s a very simple reason behind my madness: I tend to retain information better if I write it down. The numbers loiter in my brain, awaiting connections like the one I made during a conversation with the football historian John Turney, who posited that 1994 \u2014 when the N.F.L. renewed its emphasis on prohibiting defensive backs from jamming receivers more than five yards downfield \u2014 would be a pivot point in examining the explosion of passing numbers.Hold on, John, let me check.

At The Dallas Morning News, two colleagues, Evan Grant and Gerry Fraley, tutored me in the art of tracking a team over a full season. And so I kept a binder filled with pages of various pitching, fielding and hitting statistics for individual players on the Texas Rangers (first half of 2005 season), the Mets (August 2005 through 2009) and the Yankees (2010 through July 2011), and also for those teams as a whole.And besides, I liked having a hard copy just in case.In case of what?

{"Headline": "Microsoft Is Worth as Much as Apple. How Did That Happen?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world.It was big and still quite profitable, but the company had lost its luster, failing or trailing in the markets of the future like mobile, search, online advertising and cloud computing. Its stock price languished, inching up 3 percent in the decade through the end of 2012.It\u2019s a very different story today. Microsoft is running neck and neck with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company, both worth about $850 billion, thanks to a stock price that has climbed 30 percent over the last 12 months. At the end of trading Friday, Microsoft was just ahead of its longtime rival.So what happened?There is a short-term explanation for Microsoft\u2019s market rise, and there is a longer-term one.The near-term, stock-trading answer is that Microsoft has held up better than others during the recent sell-off of tech company shares. Apple investors are worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Facebook and Google face persistent attacks on their role in distributing false news and conspiracy theories, and investor concerns that their privacy policies could scare off users and advertisers.But the more enduring and important answer is that Microsoft has become a case study of how a once-dominant company can build on its strengths and avoid being a prisoner of its past. It has fully embraced cloud computing, abandoned an errant foray into smartphones and returned to its roots as mainly a supplier of technology to business customers.Microsoft\u2019s path to cloud computing \u2014 processing, storage and software delivered as a service over the internet from remote data centers \u2014 was lengthy and sometimes halting.Its forerunners to cloud computing go back to the 1990s, with Microsoft\u2019s MSN online service and later its Bing search engine. In 2010, four years after Amazon entered the cloud market, Microsoft introduced its cloud service. But it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.Even then, Microsoft\u2019s cloud service was a side business. The corporate center of gravity remained its Windows operating system, the linchpin of the company\u2019s wealth and power during the personal computer era. That changed after Mr. Nadella replaced Steven A. Ballmer, who had been chief executive for 14 years.Microsoft has also retooled its popular Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a cloud version, Office 365. That offering caters to people who prefer to use software as an internet service and gives Microsoft a competitive entry against online app suppliers like Google.The financial payoff from the shift came gradually at first, but is accelerating. In the year that ended in June, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 15 percent, to $110 billion, and operating profit increased 13 percent, to $35 billion.\u201cThe essence of what Satya Nadella did was the dramatic shift to the cloud,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cHe put Microsoft back into a high-growth business.\u201dIt is the perception that Microsoft is on a high-growth track that has fueled its rising share price.Microsoft would not try to compete with the smartphone technology leaders, Apple, Google and Samsung. Instead, Microsoft focused on its developing apps and other software for business customers.Microsoft does have a successful consumer franchise in its Xbox video game business. But it is a separate unit, and though it generates revenue of $10 billion, that is still less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s overall sales.Microsoft products, in the main, are about utility \u2014 productivity tools, whether people use them at work or at home. And its Azure cloud technology is a service for businesses and a platform for software developers to build applications, a kind of cloud operating system.\u201cIt\u2019s really the coming together of the professional cloud and the professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella explained at the time.Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has loosened up. Windows would no longer be its center of gravity \u2014 or its anchor. Microsoft apps would run not only on Apple\u2019s Macintosh software but on other operating systems as well. Open source and free software, once anathema to Microsoft, was embraced as a vital tool of modern software development.Mr. Nadella preached an outward-looking mind-set. \u201cWe need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft,\u201d he wrote in his book \u201cHit Refresh,\u201d published last year.The company\u2019s financial performance \u2014 and its stock price \u2014 suggest that the Nadella formula is working.\u201cThe old, Windows-centric view of the world stifled innovation,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThe company has changed culturally. Microsoft is an exciting place to work again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Use for A.I.: Finding Millions of Unregistered Voters", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe mechanics of elections that attract the most attention are casting and counting, snafus with voting machines and ballots and allegations of hacking and fraud. But Jeff Jonas, a prominent data scientist, is focused on something else: the integrity, updating and expansion of voter rolls.\u201cAs I dove into the subject, it grew on me, the complexity and relevance of the problem,\u201d he said.As a result, Mr. Jonas has played a geeky, behind-the-scenes role in encouraging turnout for the midterm elections on Tuesday.\u201cI have no doubt that more people are voting as a result of ERIC,\u201d said John Lindback, a former senior election administrator in Oregon and Alaska who was the center\u2019s first executive director.Voter rolls, like nearly every aspect of elections, are a politically charged issue. ERIC, brought together by the Pew Charitable Trusts, is meant to play it down the middle. It was started largely with professional election administrators, from both red and blue states.But the election officials recognized that their headaches often boiled down to a data-handling challenge. Then Mr. Jonas added his technology, which has been developed and refined for decades. It is artificial intelligence software fine-tuned for spotting and resolving identities, whether people or things.\u201cEvery time you get two pieces of junk mail from the same place, that\u2019s an entity resolution problem,\u201d Mr. Jonas said. \u201cThey\u2019re missed, but entity resolution problems are everywhere.\u201dShortly after the election administrators tapped him, Mr. Jonas sketched out how his technology might be applied to their challenges. And they needed to take a very different path than another data-matching initiative, the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck System, which was already underway.Crosscheck was begun in 2005, led by Ron Thornburgh, then the Republican secretary of state in Kansas, and later championed by Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state who is running for governor of Kansas.Crosscheck was portrayed as a program to root out voter fraud. But election administrators and experts agree that voter fraud is a rarity. Voter rights advocates long argued that Crosscheck was a partisan effort to purge voter rolls of likely Democratic voters, and a recent study by the Brennan Center for Justice found a rising rate of people being removed from voter rolls.ERIC, by contrast, was meant to both increase voter access and clean up voter rolls. Member states have to agree to specific steps to do both.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t do that, ERIC would become another politicized tool,\u201d said David Becker, former head of the elections program at Pew and the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research.The organization\u2019s reach has grown gradually and its members now include the District of Columbia and 24 states, both traditionally Democratic ones like Connecticut and Illinois and Republican ones like Louisiana and Missouri.From each member, the group collects a minimum of voter registration and motor vehicle license data. The software Mr. Jonas and his team developed digests and links that data, and combines it with other information like postal change-of-address lists. Some states contribute other data.Any private personal information including date of birth, driver\u2019s license and Social Security numbers, receive a one-way encryption \u201chash\u201d for privacy \u2014 scrambled into a string of numbers and characters, which cannot be read by humans.The software finds people wherever they are. \u201cIt connects the dots for us,\u201d said Shane Hamlin, executive director of the center. \u201cIt\u2019s actionable data.\u201dAmong the actions required by member states is to mail out notifications to people identified as eligible but unregistered. Follow-up research in some states concluded that 10 to 20 percent of those contacted had later registered to vote, a high response rate for direct mailings, Mr. Hamlin said. That rate suggests 2.6 million to 5.2 million of the 26 million people notified became voters, though they could have signed up for other reasons.The software is not flawless. A couple of state administrators said determining a person\u2019s current address can be difficult, according to the Brennan Center study, and like any technology tool, much depends on how it is used, despite the safeguards.But the states using the ERIC software generally say false positives are few, and returned unopened mail \u2014 evidence of a wrong address \u2014 is much reduced. And the outreach seems to be working. Colorado had the highest percentage of eligible, registered voters in the country in 2016, at 90 percent, up from 82 percent in 2012.\u201cFor my money, ERIC is a big part of that,\u201d said Judd Choate, Colorado\u2019s director of elections. \u201cERIC has been a game changer in elections for those of us in it.\u201dOne thing Mr. Jonas finds satisfying is that ERIC has a two-person staff with one tending the constantly growing database of more than 275 million records.\u201cIt\u2019s not beholden to an army of experts,\u201d he said.Mr. Jonas is advancing the technology in a start-up, Senzing, which he founded and spun out of IBM in 2016. He joined IBM after it bought his previous start-up, Systems Research and Development, in 2005.Senzing has no headquarters. Its 20 full-time employees work from wherever they please, following their founder\u2019s lead. Mr. Jonas, 54, has long been a road warrior, but recently he decided to go further \u2014 a lifestyle experiment he calls \u201cfull nomad\u201d and \u201cextreme minimalism.\u201dHe is selling his home in Venice, Calif., and jettisoning nearly all his possessions. He has digitized family photos, papers, awards, anything that stirs memories of his experience, and stored them on Dropbox. His clothes are laundered, stored and sent ahead to him to his travel destinations by DUFL, a travel valet service. On Sunday, Mr. Jonas completed his 61st Ironman Triathlon \u2014 swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles and running a full 26.2-mile marathon \u2014 in Florida.\u201cI\u2019m unencumbered, so I can focus on stuff that matters,\u201d Mr. Jonas said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s P.R. Firm Brought Political Trickery to Tech", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Tim Miller, a longtime Republican political operative, moved to the Bay Area last year to set up a public relations shop, he brought with him tradecraft more typical of Washington than Silicon Valley.He was well versed in opposition research \u2014 the pursuit of damaging intelligence about a political enemy. He had ties to online media provocateurs. And, above all, he understood the value of secrecy.Mr. Miller had arrived at the right moment with his company, Definers Public Affairs. With customers and lawmakers questioning the avowed good intentions and power of tech\u2019s biggest companies, Facebook and others were on the defensive.Definers quickly found plenty of business, from start-ups like Lyft, Lime and Juul to giants like Facebook and Qualcomm, the influential chip company that was in a nasty legal fight with Apple over royalties, according to five people with direct knowledge of Mr. Miller\u2019s work who declined to be named because of confidentiality agreements.While working for Qualcomm, Definers pushed the idea that Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was a viable presidential candidate in 2020, according to a former Definers employee and digital records. Presumably, it was an attempt to chill the cordial relations that Mr. Cook had cultivated with the Trump administration.The campaign by Definers signaled an escalation of Silicon Valley\u2019s already brass-knuckled approach to public relations.\u201cThis type of dirty P.R.? It\u2019s always been there, but it\u2019s definitely on the upswing,\u201d said Jonathan Hirshon, who was a public relations representative for technology companies for three decades, including Apple and Sony. \u201cThe idealism is still there, but the truth is, the big companies have become a lot more authoritarian in their approach to the media.\u201dDefiners\u2019s strategy played to a target\u2019s pressure points. Most of what Definers produced for Qualcomm had nothing to do with its beef with Apple, which was a complex legal fight over the royalties Apple should pay for the Qualcomm chips it was using in iPhones.Definers employees distributed anti-Apple research to reporters and would not say who was paying for it. Definers distributed a 13-page memo titled \u201cApple Bowing to Chinese Cyber Regulators\u201d that detailed how Apple\u2019s activity in China contradicted its public stance on privacy elsewhere. It also planted dozens of negative articles about Apple on conservative news sites, according to a person familiar with the work and emails reviewed by The New York Times.Qualcomm officials did not respond to requests for comment.The feuds among the tech industry\u2019s giants have hardly been genteel over the years. Big companies often tip reporters to bad news about other companies and urge regulators to examine competitors.A campaign by Microsoft, referred to as \u201cScroogled,\u201d highlighted what it called Google\u2019s privacy violations. From 2012 to 2014, it took out print and television ads that claimed Google was reading people\u2019s emails, a charge the internet company denied.Matt Rhoades, Definers\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the firm\u2019s work \u201cis absolutely no different than what public affairs firms do every day for their clients across industries and issues across the country. We are proud of the work we do for our clients.\u201dJuul, which has been accused of marketing its e-cigarettes to children, is working with Definers to improve its public image and communicate with reporters.The ride-hailing company Lyft used Definers to help navigate regulatory challenges in statehouses across the country, including choosing which Lyft drivers to pitch to the media for interviews, according to a person familiar with the work.And the scooter company Lime hired Definers in August because it wanted an outside contractor to take a more aggressive tack against rivals, according to a person familiar with that work. Lyft and Lime have since ended their work with Definers.To promote clients and attack its clients\u2019 enemies, Definers regularly used NTK Network, a news aggregator with a conservative slant and 122,000 followers on Facebook.Definers and its sister firm, the political-opposition group America Rising, share some staff and one floor of an office building in Arlington, Va., with NTK. Joe Pounder, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns who describes himself as \u201ca master of opposition research\u201d in his biographies, is listed as a co-founder of Definers and America Rising and editor in chief of NTK.Mr. Pounder and two colleagues distanced NTK from Definers after The Times\u2019s report last week. \u201cWe do not and did not work with Facebook. We share offices with a firm that does,\u201d they wrote in a blog post.But Mr. Miller promoted how Definers used NTK in a proposal sent to a potential Definers client last year, under a section labeled \u201cDigital Platform Echo Chamber.\u201d\u201cDefiners manages NTK Network, a news aggregation platform that targets Washington D.C. influencers. Through NTK we can directly re-publish favorable news from other outlets, and work with like-minded individuals to help create an echo chamber effect,\u201d he wrote in a copy of the proposal reviewed by The Times.This year, NTK has published at least 57 articles criticizing Apple and Mr. Cook. Some of the posts needled Apple for issues at the center of the legal dispute between Apple and Qualcomm and repeated Qualcomm\u2019s complaints. Apple had also started to move away from using Qualcomm chips.Mr. Pounder said in a statement on Tuesday that NTK is regularly pitched by people in public relations and the media. \u201cWhat NTK writes and posts on is what NTK chooses to write and post on,\u201d he added.Definers also used other outlets to disseminate its work. In July 2017, Mr. Miller wrote an article that accused Mr. Cook of lying to President Trump about building Apple factories in the United States, according to an email reviewed by The Times.Mr. Miller said in a text message to The Times that Definers pitched the angle to a range of news outlets. \u201cTwo years into the administration it\u2019s clear we were right,\u201d he added.Mr. Johnson said he had a falling out with Mr. Miller because of Mr. Miller\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump.Mr. Schrage, a longtime confidante of Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, had already announced plans to leave Facebook. Ms. Sandberg, who had previously said she did not know about Definers, admitted in an online comment attached to the memo that she had been informed about the company in emails and other materials.Erin Griffith contributed reporting from San Francisco and Matthew Rosenberg contributed from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "4 Ways to Make Giving Large Donations to Small Groups Easier", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersLarge organizations like universities and hospitals are well equipped to accept a donation of just about any size, but bigger amounts could paralyze smaller nonprofit groups that provide social services, like helping the hungry or providing educational support for children in need.\u201cHats off to the great universities and the great hospitals in our country that have the fund-raising teams and balance sheets to access high-net-worth folks,\u201d said Thomas J. Tierney, the chairman and a co-founder of Bridgespan and a contributor to the report. \u201cBut if you wanted to put $1.8 billion to work to drive social change, how would you do it? It\u2019s hard.\u201dThe Bridgespan report notes that many ultra-wealthy donors struggle to find social change organizations that are large enough or mature enough to accept a sizable donation. So the donors end up giving to more established nonprofit groups instead.The report found that ultra-wealthy donors, which it defines as people worth more than $500 million, gave only 1.2 percent of their assets to charity in 2017. By comparison, the S&P 500\u2019s average annual return was 9 percent over the past two decades. The authors said that if a wealthy couple wanted to give away their fortune in their lifetime, they would have to increase their giving to 11 percent a year over the next 20 years.That level of giving would be more than double what a private family foundation is required to donate annually, which is 5 percent a year. The report said raising the giving rate to just 2.4 percent would add $45 billion in annual giving.But there\u2019s no guarantee that the money would go to social change organizations, and the authors of the report say that if social change organizations do not rethink their model, they would be left out.\u201cThere is by all indications a sign of intent by the superwealthy to increase their giving to social change,\u201d Mr. Tierney said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t invested in the pathways to let them do this in a productive way.\u201dThe report detailed four strategies to change this and make it easier to give money to social change organizations.Going it alone can be daunting. But several funds have been created that bring together both dollars and donors, who can discuss issues as equals.Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Capital Management, said he and his wife, Fiona, focused on causes like the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone, which works to educate disadvantaged children. But with a net worth in excess of $4 billion, he is also aware of the risks of giving too much money to a small organization.\u201cIf you swamp the wrong people with money, it\u2019s going to be inefficient and it might mess them up from a viable path to an unviable path,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could change their speed and lose their focus.\u201dBut if donors find the right organization, he said, their philanthropy can help the group focus on its mission and not have to worry about fund-raising.In doing so, the couple chose large partners, like the University of Chicago, that had expertise in an aspect of the project but were also able to handle large donations.The Bridgespan report argues for the creation of a \u201ccommunity foundation for America\u201d that would be able to accept large bequests and donations and then find small nonprofit groups that need the funding.But the community foundation would have a specific mandate to make grants that help social change organizations and even a time frame to spend the money.It\u2019s still in the idea phase, but there are options now. Michael Lear, a vice president and financial adviser at Bernstein Private Wealth Management, said he had advised wealthy clients who wanted to make a large gift to a social service group to consider putting the money into a donor-advised fund and parceling out the money over a few years.\u201cThey can have the tax break this year and make giving decisions in future years,\u201d he said. It also gives the client the chance to find smaller organizations that are doing good work but would be overwhelmed by a multimillion-dollar gift.Without the help of a private foundation, finding smaller nonprofit groups in the social service sector can be a challenge. \u201cIf it\u2019s a wealthy couple alone, it\u2019s simply hard to do without a large staff,\u201d said Mr. Tierney at Bridgespan.Every private bank and adviser that aims to court wealthy clients does so with an offering of philanthropic advice, but Mr. Tierney said it was not all worthwhile.\u201cDo you think anyone is going to get a giant bonus because they helped a client give away $1 billion?\u201d Mr. Tierney said. \u201cThey\u2019re not aligned for true philanthropic services. Your banker wants you to make a lot of money, not give it away.\u201dHe said that these advisers \u2014 which would arguably include Bridgespan \u2014 needed to show philanthropists that there was a need to give now, to address current problems, and not wait until later in life to give.Philanthropists need organizations working in the social sector that have proved their approach can work but also have an infrastructure in place that allows them to grow. Some groups have found areas consistent with their mission where they can grow or share what they\u2019re doing with other groups.But his bigger project is working on a collective buying program with three other large food pantries in New York. Their goal is to reduce their food costs and share storage space and transportation in order to increase the number of people they can help.Mr. Silverman says this can change the model of the food pantry. \u201cIt\u2019s about us helping New York City community members get lifted out of food insecurity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about our poundage; it\u2019s about our impact.\u201dThe collective buying program was funded with a $70,000 grant from Robin Hood and SeaChange Capital Partners, which provides grants and loans to nonprofit groups working together. But Mr. Silverman said he knew exactly what he would do if he ever received a large grant.\u201cI have a very clear vision of what I could do to replicate and fight food insecurity in New York City and across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting systems in place and having well-researched models \u2014 and stopping putting money into models that don\u2019t work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018I Don\u2019t Really Want to Work for Facebook.\u2019 So Say Some Computer Science Students.", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the tone among highly sought-after computer scientists about the social network is changing. On a recent night at the University of California, Berkeley, as a group of young engineers gathered to show off their tech skills, many said they would avoid taking jobs at the social network.\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of employees who work there don\u2019t even use it,\u201d said Niky Arora, 19, an engineering student, who was recently invited to a Facebook recruiting event at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe in the product because like, Facebook, the baseline of everything they do is desire to show people more ads.\u201dEmily Zhong, 20, a computer science major, piped up. \u201cSurprisingly, a lot of my friends now are like, \u2018I don\u2019t really want to work for Facebook,\u2019\u201d she said, citing \u201cprivacy stuff, fake news, personal data, all of it.\u201d\u201cBefore it was this glorious, magical thing to work there,\u201d said Jazz Singh, 18, also studying computer science. \u201cNow it\u2019s like, just because it does what you want doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s doing good.\u201dFacebook, which employs more than 30,000 full-time workers around the world, said, \u201cIn 2018, we\u2019ve hired more engineers than ever before.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe continue to see strong engagement and excitement within the engineering community at the prospect of joining our company.\u201d\u201cEmployees are wising up to the fact that you can have a mission statement on your website, but when you\u2019re looking at how the company creates new products or makes decisions, the correlation between the two is not so tightly aligned,\u201d said David Chie, the head of Palo Alto Staffing, a tech job placement service in Silicon Valley. \u201cEveryone\u2019s having this conversation.\u201dWhen engineers apply for jobs, they are also doing it differently.\u201cThey do a lot more due diligence,\u201d said Heather Johnston, Bay Area district president for the tech job staffing agency Robert Half. \u201cBefore, candidates were like: \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want to do team interviews. I want a one-and-done.\u2019\u201d Now, she added, job candidates \u201cwant to meet the team.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not just going to blindly take a company because of the name anymore,\u201d she said.Yet while many of the big tech companies have been hit by a change in public perception, Facebook seems uniquely tarred among young workers.\u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of clients recently say they\u2019re not as enthusiastic about Facebook because they\u2019re frustrated with what they see happening politically or socially,\u201d said Paul Freiberger, president of Shimmering Careers, a career counseling group based in San Mateo, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s privacy and political news, and concern that it\u2019s going to be hard to correct these things from inside.\u201dChad Herst, a leadership and career coach based in San Francisco since 2008, said that now, for the first time, he had clients who wanted to avoid working for big social media companies like Facebook or Twitter.\u201cThey\u2019re concerned about where democracy is going, that social media polarizes us, and they don\u2019t want to be building it,\u201d Mr. Herst said. \u201cPeople really have been thinking about the mission of the company and what the companies are trying to achieve a little more.\u201dHe said one client, a midlevel executive at Facebook, wanted advice on how to shift her group\u2019s work to encourage users to connect offline as well. But she found resistance internally to her efforts.\u201cShe was trying to figure out: \u2018How do I politic this? How do I language this?\u2019\u201d Mr. Herst said. \u201cAnd I was telling her to bring up some of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s past statements about connecting people.\u201dOn the recent evening at the University of California, Berkeley, around 2,200 engineering students from around the country gathered for Cal Hacks 5.0 \u2014 a competition to build the best apps. The event spanned a weekend, so teenage competitors dragged pillows around with them. The hosts handed out 2,000 burritos as students registered.It was also a hiring event. Recruiters from Facebook and Alphabet set up booths (free sunglasses from Facebook; $200 in credit to the Google Cloud platform from Alphabet).In the auditorium, the head of Y Combinator, a start-up incubator and investment firm, gave opening remarks, recommending that young people avoid jobs in big tech.\u201cYou get to program your life on a totally different scale,\u201d said Michael Seibel, who leads Y Combinator. \u201cThe worst thing that can happen to you is you get a job at Google.\u201d He called those jobs \u201c$100,000-a-year welfare\u201d \u2014 meaning, he said, that workers can get tethered to the paycheck and avoid taking risks.The event then segued to a word from the sponsor, Microsoft. Justin Garrett, a Microsoft recruiter who on his LinkedIn profile calls himself a senior technical evangelist, stepped onstage, laughing a little.\u201cSo, Michael\u2019s a tough guy to follow, especially when you work for one of those big companies,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cHe called it welfare. I like to call it tremendous opportunity.\u201dThen students flooded into the stadium, which was filled with long tables of computers where they would stay and compete. In the middle of the scrum, three friends joked around. Caleb Thomas, 21, was gently made fun of because he had accepted an internship at Facebook.\u201cCome on, guys,\u201d Mr. Thomas said.\u201cThese are the realities of how the business works,\u201d said Samuel Resendez, 20, a computer science student at the University of Southern California.It turned out Mr. Resendez had interned at Facebook in the summer. Olivia Brown, 20, head of Stanford\u2019s Computer Science and Social Good club and an iOS intern at Mozilla, called him out on it. \u201cBut you still worked at Facebook, too,\u201d she said.Ms. Brown said a lot of students criticize Facebook and talk about how they would not work there, but ultimately join. \u201cEveryone cares about ethics in tech before they get a contract,\u201d she said.Ms. Brown said she thought that could change soon, though, as the social stigma of working for Facebook began outweighing the financial benefits.\u201cDefense companies have had this reputation for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cSocial networks are just getting that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Overhauls Sexual Misconduct Policy After Employee Walkout", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims,\u201d he added.Mr. Pichai also said Google would overhaul its reporting process for harassment and assault, provide more transparency to employees about incidents reported to the company and dock employees in their performance reviews if they do not complete sexual harassment training.The company did not address some other demands by workers, including that it make its internal report on harassment public and put an employee representative on the board. It did not include temporary workers, vendors and contractors in the changes. Google said it would still require suppliers to investigate complaints raised among contractors.Google Walkout For Real Change, the organizers behind last week\u2019s employee walkout, said that although they were encouraged by the changes, the company did not go far enough in addressing systemic racism and other forms of discrimination.At a companywide meeting on Thursday, Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, and Danielle Brown, its chief diversity officer, presented the changes announced by Mr. Pichai, said two people who attended and who were not authorized to speak publicly.Then Ms. Naughton and Ms. Brown, along with Susan Wojcicki, chief executive of Google\u2019s YouTube, and Ruth Porat, Google\u2019s chief financial officer, answered questions from employees, the people said. Mr. Pichai attended, but not Google\u2019s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who sometimes appear at staff meetings.The meeting lasted over an hour, the people said. Some workers asked why contractors did not get the same protection from harassment as full-time employees. In an answer to another question about how to change Google\u2019s executive culture, Urs H\u00f6lzle, a senior vice president and one of the earliest employees, urged staff members to view executives as individuals and not as one group, the people said.Another employee said Mr. Pichai also seemed dismissive of the idea of an employee representative on the board. Mr. Pichai said that was a decision for the board to make, the person said.Google declined to comment on the meeting details.But their statements did little to quell growing employee anger. Many workers expressed their unhappiness on internal message boards and in meetings, as well as on Twitter and other social media. Some began to organize a walkout.On Thursday last week, around 20,000 Google employees walked out of work across the globe \u2014 including in Singapore, in London and at the company\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. \u2014 to show their dissatisfaction. They chanted slogans such as \u201cStand up! Fight back!\u201d Some also held signs that said \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be evil, protect victims, not harassers.\u201dThe employees also listed their demands. The call for more transparency was spurred by how Google often handles internal complaints through its employee relations department, which is staffed by many employment lawyers. Current and former employees have said complainants are often not told about the details of subsequent investigations, while some said they did not know they were being investigated by employee relations until questioned about what actions they had taken.Google\u2019s employment contract also required employees to deal with any grievances with the company in private arbitration. Arbitration, a common practice among technology companies, largely happens behind closed doors and can involve confidentiality clauses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Failed to Police How Its Partners Handled User Data", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook failed to closely monitor device makers after granting them access to the personal data of hundreds of millions of people, according to a previously unreported disclosure to Congress last month.Facebook\u2019s loose oversight of the partnerships was detected by the company\u2019s government-approved privacy monitor in 2013. But it was never revealed to Facebook users, most of whom had not explicitly given the company permission to share their information. Details of those oversight practices were revealed in a letter Facebook sent last month to Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, a privacy advocate and frequent critic of the social media giant.When a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the initial F.T.C.-mandated assessment in 2013, it tested Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Microsoft and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handset. In both cases, PricewaterhouseCoopers found only \u201climited evidence\u201d that Facebook had monitored or checked its partners\u2019 compliance with its data use policies. That finding was redacted from a public version of PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s report released by the F.T.C. in June.\u201cFacebook claimed that its data-sharing partnerships with smartphone manufacturers were on the up and up,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cBut Facebook\u2019s own, handpicked auditors said the company wasn\u2019t monitoring what smartphone manufacturers did with Americans\u2019 personal information, or making sure these manufacturers were following Facebook\u2019s own policies.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to just take the word of Facebook \u2014 or any major corporation \u2014 that they\u2019re safeguarding our personal information.\u201dIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \u201cWe take the F.T.C. consent order incredibly seriously and have for years submitted to extensive assessments of our systems.\u201d She added, \u201cWe remain strongly committed to the consent order and to protecting people\u2019s information.\u201dFacebook, like other companies under F.T.C. consent decree, largely dictates the scope of each assessment. In two subsequent assessments, Facebook\u2019s October letter suggests, the company was graded on a seemingly less stringent policy with data partners. On those two, Facebook had to show that its partners had agreed to its data use policies.A Wyden aide who reviewed the unredacted assessments said they contained no evidence that Facebook had ever addressed the original problem. The Facebook spokeswoman did not directly address the 2013 test failure, or the company\u2019s apparent decision to change the test in question.Because the United States has no general consumer privacy law, F.T.C. consent decrees have emerged as the federal government\u2019s chief means of regulating privacy practices at Facebook, Google and other companies that amass huge amounts of personal data about people who use their products. In letters and congressional testimony, F.T.C. officials have pointed to the decrees as evidence of robust consumer privacy protection in the United States.A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers acknowledged in a statement that Facebook defines the privacy procedures, known as \u201ccontrols,\u201d that are tested during the assessments.\u201cChanges to controls may occur as platforms evolve, such that a control tested in one period may not be identical in a subsequent period,\u201d the spokesman said.The October letter to Senator Ron Wyden details Facebook\u2019s oversight of its partnerships with device makers.While the assessment reports were publicly released by the F.T.C. in June, they included significant redactions, which Facebook and PricewaterhouseCoopers said were necessary to protect trade secrets.Mr. Wyden, whose staff had viewed the full assessments, said at the hearing that he found parts of the unredacted reports \u201cvery troubling\u201d and pressed Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, to release them in their entirety.The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based consumer rights group that helped obtain the 2011 consent decree, is currently suing the agency for release of the full assessments, arguing that the public cannot otherwise judge how effectively the F.T.C. is policing privacy violations.\u201cWhat is clear is that the F.T.C. has failed to enforce the consent order,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the privacy rights group. \u201cAnd this has come at enormous cost to American consumers.\u201dThe F.T.C. declined to comment.Facebook\u2019s compliance with the consent decree is the subject of a new F.T.C. investigation opened in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.In the letter last month, Facebook\u2019s vice president for United States public policy, Kevin Martin, noted that the assessors\u2019 findings had not caused Facebook to fail PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s overall evaluation: The assessors concluded that Facebook was operating \u201cwith sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance\u201d that it was protecting its users\u2019 privacy.It remains unclear whether Facebook has ever scrutinized how its partner companies handled personal data. A spokeswoman declined to provide any examples of the company\u2019s doing so.A BlackBerry official, who declined to discuss details of the companies\u2019 data-sharing agreement, said BlackBerry did not think that Facebook had ever audited its data use, but noted that BlackBerry\u2019s business model relies on protecting users\u2019 personal information.Advertisement"}

Blankfein was still defending the firm he now chairs.\u201cI would say that we\u2019re pretty compliant,\u201d he said late Thursday afternoon at the DealBook conference in Manhattan. He was responding to a question about federal criminal charges filed hours earlier against two former Goldman investment bankers over their role in helping to finance a Malaysian government fund from which about $4 billion went missing. \u201cBut here in this case, at the very least, and this part I know, one of our people lied to us and evaded our systems and our controls.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d he added.On Oct. 1, the longtime investment-banking chief David M. Solomon succeeded Mr. Blankfein as C.E.O. Mr. Blankfein, 64, has stayed on as senior chairman of the board through the end of this year. Beyond joking about the idea of unfettered tweeting, he has said little so far about his future plans.On Thursday afternoon, looking relaxed in a navy suit and blue tie, he reminisced about his more than twelve years running Goldman and addressed some of the c-suite mysteries that had enveloped his tenure. As to whether longtime firm president Gary D. Cohn could have ever succeeded him as C.E.O., he was equivocal.\u201cI think his leaving coincided with a new administration,\u201d said Mr. Blankfein, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t done him the favor of telling him when I was leaving at that point.\u201dAs to whether he would have done anything differently to help Goldman weather the financial crisis, he said more proactive public relations would have helped burnish the firm\u2019s image.\u201cOur mantra was our clients should have the exposure, not us. We\u2019re in the background,\u201d he said of the firm\u2019s approach to publicity in the pre-crisis years. \u201cThat hurt us a lot.\u201d\u2014 Kate KellyMaking a rare public appearanceThursday at the DealBook conference, the 47-year-old executive discussed the family\u2019s latest round of deal making and what it could mean for the family\u2019s other assets. In particular, he spoke about the newspaper business under News Corp, a roster that includes The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, as well as The Times and The Sun in Britain.The sale of Fox\u2019s film and TV studios to Disney prompted a question about whether his father would ever sell The Wall Street Journal, which Mr. Murdoch acquired in 2007 for over $5 billion.\u201cI never thought we\u2019d sell the TV studio, the film studio, so who knows?\u201d Lachlan responded. In the next breath, he said of his father, \u201cHe loves journalism. He loves The Wall Street Journal and what it represents.\u201dThe businesses that will remain under the control of the Murdochs after the close of the Disney deal early next year will center on news and sports. That means Lachlan will run Fox News, the Fox Broadcasting network and the FS1 cable sports network.Fox News, in particular, has come under heavy criticism for its close ties to the Trump administration. That has led to charges from critics that Fox News, and the larger Murdoch TV business, is actually a red state media organization.Lachlan disagreed. \u201cI think about it as an all-state media organization,\u201d he said, later adding that, \u201cwe program to everyone. It\u2019s to the coasts. But also everywhere in-between.\u201dHe cited figures that showed more Fox viewers are tuned to its sober news segments than the fiery opinion hours. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d he said.\u2014 Edmund LeePadma Lakshmi believes in redemption for men brought down amid the #MeToo movement.But that redemption should come from genuine remorse and understanding of the impact of one\u2019s actions, as Ms. Lakshmi said Thursday, and shouldn\u2019t be driven by a man\u2019s being good at a certain job.It was one of the lessons that Ms. Lakshmi and her fellow panelist, Lisa Borders, sought to impress on their audience. The women discussed how the #MeToo movement continued to revolutionize gender dynamics across the workplace, culture, in social circles and in sports and education. Both have become vocal leaders.The op-ed was published as two women came forward to detail accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and President Trump questioned why one of the women, Christine Blasey Ford, didn\u2019t report the incident when it happened more than 30 years ago.The conversation was wide-ranging as Ms. Borders and Ms. Lakshmi described the need for a cultural shift, not just in the workplace, but particularly in how men are socialized and boys are raised.\u201cWe need to stop equating aggression and masculinity because I think that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d Ms. Lakshmi said.Ms. Borders said there needed to be more transparency, particularly on the issue of salaries, so women would know if they were being underpaid. She said that companies should understand that policies and practices that empower women also help organizations as a whole.\u201cWe add value,\u201d Ms. Borders said.Both women said the ability to share stories through social media had helped strengthen the #MeToo movement and create a time of real social change. Ms. Borders said there was a recognition among what she called survivors of sexual abuse that their stories were not \u201cour burden to bear but society\u2019s burden to bear.\u201d\u201cAnd it lit fire,\u201d she said.Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, the maker of the disappearing-message app Snapchat, said broadcasting regulations offer a framework for how to think about the dangers of social media.\u201cIf you look historically at America, a place that\u2019s always celebrated things like free speech, we\u2019ve actually always thought about broadcasting really differently than how we thought about communication,\u201d he said.While Americans have long accepted most forms of speech, even the distasteful kind, they have been less tolerant when that speech is widely distributed, he said, noting that broadcasters are subject to regulations on what they can and can\u2019t say or show.\u201cI think we\u2019re in this weird moment in time where this behavior\u2019s been enabled technically and the regulatory framework actually hasn\u2019t caught up to that reality,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.When asked if he was suggesting that social media should be regulated, Mr. Spiegel said only that there was much to learn from how Americans have thought about the responsibility of broadcasters in the past. The challenge, though, is identifying what, exactly, broadcasting is, he said.\u201cWe understand what one-on-one communication is, but let\u2019s say your Uncle Joe, for example, has some very extreme, maybe not so accurate, views on the world and he wants to reach 500 people. Is that OK? If he wants to reach 50,000 people, is that OK? If he wants to reach 100,000, is that OK? Where do we draw the line in terms of where broadcasting is versus communication with friends?\u201dSome have argued that social media has enabled social change, but Mr. Spiegel said that view is overly simplistic.\u201cOne of the more dangerous things that I\u2019ve seen is this idea that just using your voice is going to make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of it, that\u2019s half of it, but the other half is really taking action to implement that change.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiTo address corporate America\u2019s diversity problem, Ken Frazier sees a lesson in his own past.The chief executive of Merck is one of only three black chief executives in the Fortune 500. But growing up as the son of a janitor in inner-city Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier faced an opportunity gap. Fortunately for him, a desegregation policy and a 90-minute daily bus ride that gave him time to read helped to overcome it.\u201cI look back at my own life and I realize that I was treated in an extraordinary way in this country,\u201d he said.As the nation increasingly self-segregates, Mr. Frazier said, the workplace is one of the few remaining places that offers that same opportunity for people of different backgrounds to interact \u2014 and business leaders, he says, have a responsibility to uphold that basic American value.That conviction led Mr. Frazier to step down last year from President Trump\u2019s manufacturing advisory council, the first of many executives to do so after the president equivocated in his response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\u201cFor me, it was a very clear personal decision as a matter of conscience,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cI happen to believe that political discourse, political speech, has consequences.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiMary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said that the company plans to roll out a ride-sharing service that would rely on autonomous vehicles in 2019, a development that would advance the already-heated race to bring self-driving cars to market.\u201cWe\u2019re on track, with our rate of learning, to be able to do that next year,\u201d Ms. Barra said, adding that the company had a strategy to show how its vehicles are safer than human drivers. The vehicles can currently run safely at speeds of up to about 30 miles per hour, and the service will be limited to a small geographical area, Ms. Barra said.She did not say where the service would operate, but noted that the company has been testing in San Francisco.Autonomous vehicles rely on what Ms. Barra described as \u201ca suite of sensors,\u201d including radar, cameras and a technology known as lidar. G.M. is focused on advancements to lidar, which will drive down costs and enable the vehicles to travel at higher speeds, she said.\u201cWe do believe in an all-electric future,\u201d she said.\u2014 Niraj ChokshiNancy Dubuc, the newly installed chief executive of Vice Media, announced at the conference today that the company will be profitable by \u201cthe next fiscal year.\u201d That would be an important milestone for a business that was most recently valued at $5.7 billion.\u201cIt actually was profitable a couple years ago, and then with all the expansion and investment, we made it not profitable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut very, very quickly it\u2019ll be profitable again.\u201dCost cutting will help. But Ms. Dubuc characterized the forthcoming changes as a way to become more efficient. \u201cWhen you have expansion everywhere, you\u2019re obviously going to have duplication everywhere too,\u201d she said.Vice started as a free punk magazine in Montreal in 1994 and has traded on its irreverent, brash tone to become a global media company with about 3,000 employees. Backed by media giants like the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, Vice now includes an advertising agency, a TV network, a film-production business and programs on HBO.Vice founder Shane Smith responded to the article by pledging a series of changes, including pay equity and reaching gender parity within the work force. In a statement, he said, \u201cfrom the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.\u201dMs. Dubuc praised Mr. Smith for his response.\u201cShane did a powerful thing and that was to take seriously the changes that needed to happen at Vice,\u201d she said, later adding that her being named aschief executive was an important signal for the company to send.\u201cI could have a pretty dramatic impact,\u201d she said.\u2014 Edmund LeeFor someone who speaks often and loudly about taking a stand and doing good, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock spends a lot of time thinking about gray areas.\u201cThese things are not black or white,\u201d he said on Thursday at the DealBook conference in New York.BlackRock has $6.5 trillion under management, giving it great influence over many of the world\u2019s top public companies. In a conversation that ranged from tariffs to bitcoin, Mr. Fink returned repeatedly to ideas about corporate accountability.\u201cI\u2019m not a nanny either,\u201d Mr. Fink said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not telling companies what their purpose should be. But I do believe it\u2019s up to the company to identify what their purpose is.\u201dOther executives \u2014 including Mr. Dimon, Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone and Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber \u2014 also dropped out of the event. Despite his refusal to attend what he called a \u201cvery public showcase\u201d of the kingdom\u2019s strengths, Mr. Fink said that BlackRock would continue to conduct business in Saudi Arabia, adding that he \u201cnever believed that decision would cost us all the business.\u201dBut he stressed that his attention to social responsibility is not a passing fad.\u201cI certainly never did this to be in vogue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re being asked.\u201d\u2014 Tiffany HsuSteve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, concluded his presentation on Thursday with the results of a poll he recently helped run: 61 percent of the people surveyed cared about using researched facts to help form their opinions on policy, beating the 54 percent who said their values shaped their opinions.For Mr. Ballmer, that is central to a project he has been working on since he retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014 and has poured millions of dollars into: USAFacts, a nonpartisan database of federal, state and local government revenue and spending.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the better part of four years trying to understand where government gets its revenue, where it spends its revenue,\u201d Mr. Ballmer told the audience on Thursday.In a wide-ranging presentation, Mr. Ballmer ran through some highlights of the types of data his website provides, hitting on hot-button issues in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.Mr. Ballmer has called USAFacts \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual financial filings that companies make. In charts, Mr. Ballmer showed how he believes USAFacts can help Americans filter the increasingly convoluted noise.On immigration, for example, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States rose from about 10.5 million to 12.1 million in recent years, according to USAFacts\u2019 analysis of government data. The number of border agents has risen sharply from about 4,000 to 19,000 over the same period, while border apprehensions have decreased from roughly 1.7 million to 300,000, Mr. Ballmer said.The numbers raise natural questions, Mr. Ballmer said. Why are there more border agents today, fewer apprehensions, but more undocumented immigrants?\u2014 Mihir ZaveriDavid Gelles, Corner Office columnist at The New York Times, presented the findings of a DealBook conference task force on diversity in the workplace, characterizing it as a \u201creally lively discussion\u201d that could have gone on for hours. Nonetheless, \u201cwe made a remarkable amount of progress in an hour,\u201d he said.Among the conclusions of the report:\u2022 Aspirational goals are in general a good thing, but they\u2019re not enough, said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. Companies also need to be transparent in how they\u2019re achieving those goals. In addition, there can\u2019t be separate business and diversity scorecards \u2013 diversity needs to be part of the business.\u2022 Legislation and federal policies need to play a role. John Hope Bryant, founder and chief executive of Operation HOPE spoke about the need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships, and when the effort is especially aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get a double credit for that double reach,\u201d he said.\u2022 Companies have to realize diversity is a long-term goal, and it has to be baked into its culture. \u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it,\u201d it won\u2019t work, said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JP Morgan Chase. And everyone has to join the conversation, she said.\u2014Alina TugendRebecca Blumenstein, the deputy managing editor of New York Times, described the conversations of a DealBook conference task force, intended to establish guidelines on how to ethically implement A.I., as one of the \u201chighest level discussions she has ever seen\u201d about the technology.Among the conclusions of the panel:\u2022 Companies should take care to scrutinize their machine learning initiatives (and algorithms in general) for biases that may be passed on from their creators, said Dipayan Ghosh, a Pozen Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. These technologies should be developed with greater consideration for the public interest.\u2022 In New York City, when considering artificial intelligence in transportation, companies should be transparent with the data they use in order to ensure the technologies are a benefit to society, said Cordell Schachter, the chief technology officer of the New York City Department of Transportation.\u2014 Mihir ZaveriA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified the people shown.

Dance of the NYT:When a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the initial F.T.C.-mandated assessment in 2013, it tested Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Microsoft and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handset. In both cases, PricewaterhouseCoopers found only \u201climited evidence\u201d that Facebook had monitored or checked its partners\u2019 compliance with its data use policies. That finding was redacted from a public version of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report released by the F.T.C. in June.\u201cFacebook claimed that its data-sharing partnerships with smartphone manufacturers were on the up and up,\u201d Mr. Wyden told the NYT. \u201cBut Facebook\u2019s own, handpicked auditors said the company wasn\u2019t monitoring what smartphone manufacturers did with Americans\u2019 personal information, or making sure these manufacturers were following Facebook\u2019s own policies.\u201dStocks dropped again yesterday as investors worried about the future of big technology companies.

{"Headline": "The Election Has Already Been Hacked", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven if not a single voting machine has been compromised, we\u2019re in trouble.Dr. Tufekci is the author of \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest.\u201d As the 2018 midterm election nears, an ominous question looms: Will this election be hacked?The answer is: Yes, it has already been hacked.This election has already been hacked even if not a single voting machine has been compromised. It has already been hacked even if not another ruble has been spent on spreading disinformation. It has already been hacked even if voter registration information has been undisturbed and no vote tallies are altered.Why? Because the legitimacy of an election depends on the electorate accepting that it was fair, that everyone who tried to vote got to vote and that every vote counted. Lose that, and your voting system might as well have suffered a devastating technological attack.Unfortunately, in much of the United States, we are no longer able to assure people that none of those things has happened. A recent poll shows that 46 percent of the American electorate do not think their votes will be counted fairly, and about a third think it is likely that a foreign country will tamper with the results.That loss of trust has itself become a form of voter discouragement. Why vote, when you feel it may not matter? Why register, when you fear you may be tossed off the rolls?Creating or allowing the loss of trust in democratic institutions is a great facilitator of authoritarianism. It works though a vicious cycle: The more that you can convince people that democratic institutions aren\u2019t working, the less that people will fight to protect and improve them \u2014 and the less that people fight to protect and improve democratic institutions, the worse they will perform.The actual problems in the electoral infrastructure are considerable. For example, just three companies produce all the voting machines. Such centralization would be dangerous even if the machines weren\u2019t so vulnerable \u2014 which, unfortunately, they are.But apart from such clearly urgent concerns, there is a bewildering array of concerns of a less valid nature, ranging from the uncertain to the dubious to the exaggerated to the outright baseless. On social media, I regularly come across all of these. I can\u2019t blame people even for the baseless concerns. As someone who has studied electoral infrastructure for years, I, too, sometimes struggle to differentiate the grounded worries from the ungrounded ones. If experts have to scramble to stay abreast of the latest news, how are most voters supposed to know what\u2019s what?We have done something even worse than letting our electoral infrastructure crumble, something even worse than allowing the instruments of the voting process (voter registration data, polling places) to become political weapons. We have gotten ourselves into a place where the mechanisms of accountability and transparency that are the bedrock of any sensible election process no longer operate in many parts of the country.This has all the makings of a political crisis. It needs to be stopped now, before the vicious cycle spins beyond our control.Stopping it will require embracing every democratic institution that is failing to some degree (electoral infrastructure, media, local government) and trying to fix it. That means fighting cynicism \u2014 standing up for important institutions even as they are letting us down.It also means voting, even in an imperfect system. Voting remains the key tool of legitimacy for any government. If it didn\u2019t matter, it wouldn\u2019t be so much under attack. Even dictatorships hold mock votes, because \u201cwe won the election\u201d remains the strongest argument for legitimacy of rule. Voting is so powerful that even a hollowed-out version holds sway.Paradoxically, the crumbling, mismatched and patchwork nature of our electoral infrastructure makes it unlikely that we will see large-scale computerized hacking that alters the political landscape. The failure to vote because of cynicism and mistrust is the bigger threat to the integrity of our elections.To fix that, we need to elect politicians whose platforms include the need for demonstrably fair elections. And that requires voting \u2014 warts, failings and everything else aside. Sometimes, working with what you have, rather than surrendering to cynicism, is the only strategy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Making Gains for Women in STEM Fields Will Take More Effort", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 If the world of STEM is looking for more women role models, V\u00e9na Arielle Ahouansou and Alejandra Estanislao are candidates.Both are young and have degrees in a field involving science, technology, engineering or mathematics \u2014 the disciplines where women are significantly underrepresented.Ms. Estanislao, 31, originally from Venezuela, also wanted to be a doctor but got a degree in mathematics and finance at a top French engineering school, and she is now a software engineer at Google in Paris.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad at the engineering faculty, where we were about 25 percent,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said. \u201cIt was later, at work. When you find yourself one woman in a room of 30 people, that is when you feel lonely.\u201dDr. Ahouansou, whose company employs 15 people, said men still have a blind spot \u2014 not about women in management, but about women in technology. \u201cThey need to change their mind-set that science is just for them,\u201d she said.No one disputes these days that STEM remains mostly a man\u2019s world. Much has been written about the male geek culture that dominates Silicon Valley and other technology hubs. But numerous speakers at the conference agreed that needs to change soon if women are to adjust to fast-changing job markets that increasingly require technological skills, or scientific proficiency.The study found that in the developed world, women account for just 25 percent of graduates in information and communications technology, and 24 percent in engineering \u2014 even though women outnumber men in graduate schools over all.As jobs change around the world, technology \u2014 and the flexibility it promises \u2014 could offer women a chance to choose how, when and where they work. But these opportunities are lost without the skills to access them, which is why many said at the global women\u2019s forum, in which The New York Times is a partner, that giving women the skills to master technology is a social, moral and economic necessity.\u201cFixing that is the right thing to do,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said.\u201cWhat the study found is that girls want more role models,\u201d Ms. McKinley said. \u201cWhere are the women STEM teachers? Girls are more interested in hands-on experience; they want to see the life applications of what they are learning. We need to focus on this.\u201dAngel Gurria, Secretary General of the O.E.C.D., speaking at an opening event at the organization\u2019s headquarters, said a recent effort in his native Mexico \u2014 \u201cmacho Mexico\u201d as he put it \u2014 to expose girls in high schools to celebrated women in science and technology has had a positive affect. But, he acknowledged, fighting stereotypes is an uphill battle.\u201cThey happen naturally, starting in families,\u201d he said. \u201cParents often don\u2019t have enough information. We are fighting centuries and centuries of tradition and culture.\u201d One answer, some experts say, is to encourage paternity leave after the birth of a child, which allows their wives to keep working, and the men to become more involved in family life and to offer their daughters in particular another role model at home.Paternity leave has been catching on in some countries, particularly those facing a declining birthrate and an aging population, as a way to encourage women to stay in the work force.In Iceland and elsewhere, fathers\u2019 share of paid leave dipped during the financial crisis, as men stayed at work to boost the family income.But in many countries, cultural biases can trump even the most progressive legislation. Generous paternal leave policies in Japan and Korea are rarely used for both economic and cultural reasons, Mr. Adema said.In Russia, legislation that allows fathers to take up to three years off after the birth of a child is widely shunned, according to Svetlana Lukash, a member of Russia\u2019s presidential staff. \u201cIt is still badly perceived by society,\u201d she said.According to O.E.C.D. statistics, women are still eight times more likely to care for children than men, even though 86 percent of men agree they should do more to share the burden at home. As several speakers admitted, attitudes toward shared responsibilities at home have changed, but behavior has not.\u201cWe need to make the women\u2019s agenda a family agenda,\u201d said Gabriela Ramos, chief of staff at the O.E.C.D.Attracting girls and women to STEM studies is just one issue. Another, perhaps more significant, is encouraging them to stay the course. \u201cIt is all about retention,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said. \u201cIt is useless to bring in women if you can\u2019t keep them.\u201dAccording to Ms. Nefesh-Clarke, more than 50 percent of women in information and communications technology, or ICT, leave, mainly because of a hostile environment. That helps explain why women hold only 3 percent of the top management jobs in ICT, she said.\u201cWe can\u2019t just address the external pipeline,\u201d she said later. \u201cWe have to address the internal pipeline, and why it is leaking. What is it about the culture of ICT that makes women not want to stay?\u201dA new danger is that the low level of women\u2019s participation in STEM may become self replicating. A number of speakers at the three-day forum noted that women are woefully underrepresented in the high-tech start-up world. Only 9 percent of apps are created by women; 10 percent of innovative start-ups were founded by women; and women-only teams account for just 6 percent of popular open source programming language for data analysis.In other words, all-male teams are writing algorithms that reflect their attitudes and biases, which inadvertently or not can exclude women.\u201cAlgorithms are built by humans,\u201d said Emanuela Aureli, of Spencer Stuart, a consulting firm. \u201cIf women don\u2019t participate in their creation, they won\u2019t have a voice.\u201d Pronouns flagging the sex of applicants have been found inserted in job search programs, she said.\u201cThe message is we should not reproduce the biases and stereotypes of the analog world,\u201d said Ms. Ramos, the chief of staff of the O.E.C.D.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of women in information and communications technology who leave, mainly because of a hostile environment. It is 50 percent of women, not 50 women.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Business Leaders\u2019 Breakthrough Moments", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the annual DealBook conference last week, business leaders joined a lunchtime conversation to talk about the state of innovation today. Before the event, The New York Times asked them to answer one of three questions about their careers. Their responses have been edited and condensed.Peggy JohnsonI\u2019m naturally more introverted, but early in my career I was told that to be a leader I\u2019d have to speak up and be more assertive in meetings. My breakthrough moment came when I decided that, for better or worse, I was going to be myself at work. That\u2019s when my career started to take off. I learned that who I am matters more than how I\u2019m supposed to be, and that to succeed on my terms, I had to define my own brand of leadership.Jake SchwartzThink impossibly big. You should feel embarrassed by the size of your vision. That kind of thinking can have its own gravitational pull and, as weird as it sounds, makes you more likely to succeed. Big thinking then has to be followed up by an obsessive attention to the tiny little details that will make or break your success.Tony SchwartzFounder and chief executive, the Energy ProjectAt the age of 47, eager to move from chronicling the work of others as a journalist to making a more direct difference in the world myself, I joined with a partner to launch a business that helps organizations to systematically build the capacity of their people physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. I realized that contributing creatively to address a huge problem was the purest joy I had ever experienced. I still feel that way 20 years later.Steve StouteWhen I discovered the power of cultural currency, the trajectory of my career completely changed.In 2002, I was with Paul Fireman, the founder of Reebok, who told me that Reebok was once bigger than Nike but had lost its way because young adults didn\u2019t think it was cool anymore. I said, there is an insight you can tap into. All rappers want to be basketball players and vice versa. We\u2019ve signed athletes, so we should partner with musicians who use Reeboks as a lifestyle shoe.Despite everyone telling Paul this would fail (sneakers were about \u201cperformance\u201d), he listened to me and I created a platform for Reebok called the Sound and Rhythm of Sport with Jay-Z as our first artist. Within one hour, all 10,000 pairs of the S. Carter Collection sold out. By realizing that hip-hop culture and basketball had a shared audience, we changed the landscape of footwear forever.Afsaneh M. BeschlossFounder and chief executive, RockCreekFind work you like, and passionate people who take an interest in you! They will be the mentors and positive forces in your life.John Hope BryantIt is not about you. Being a leader even means being prepared to take yourself out. If you can get out of your own way, repeatedly, and are the personality type that can reimagine everything, and never give up \u2014 then you will win. On the worst days, this kind of leader remembers that rainbows follow storms.Stephanie CohenChief strategy officer, Goldman SachsIf your goal is to innovate, then you have to be comfortable with failure. As a manager, that means setting the direction but allowing your people to explore, to try new things, to be creative and ask tough questions. Maybe things get done a bit differently than if you\u2019d been making every single decision, but that\u2019s part of the job description \u2014 teach people to think like entrepreneurs, and to own the results. It\u2019s a more engaging way for people to work, it\u2019s inspiring, and I think, ultimately, it leads to better outcomes.Thasunda DuckettBe your unapologetic, authentic self. Build a brand that makes others want to trust you, partner with you and advocate on your behalf. Make meaningful connections with those around you. That doesn\u2019t just mean looking up the hierarchy. Look to your left and right at your peers and to those who are up-and-coming.Joelle EmersonFounder and chief executive, ParadigmMy biggest piece of advice would be, do it! Companies have a significant impact on our world and play a powerful role in shaping our future. They influence what happens in our homes, our neighborhoods, our cities. They affect legal and policy outcomes. And they inform access to opportunity. Now more than ever before, companies have incredible potential to drive positive social change. But it matters who is at the table. When companies are more diverse and inclusive internally, they will drive more positive social change externally. By building more equitable companies, we can create a more equitable world.Audrey GelmanCo-founder and chief executive, the WingRemember, \u2018no\u2019 is a complete sentence. I have found that this is especially challenging for women who are starting their own businesses, given the structural and systemic barriers that we face in our journeys toward success. But saying no is often an act of self-care, and setting limits and boundaries is crucial. If you can\u2019t say no, as a leader, your yes has very little meaning.Brad KatsuyamaCo-founder and chief executive, IEXMy best advice to \u201cgroundbreakers\u201d would be to experience firsthand the problems that they are trying to solve. That experience becomes critical whenever things get more difficult, or you are faced with a very tough decision, or doubt starts to creep in. Having conviction that your company is needed and can solve a problem, big or small, is necessary to succeed and to convince others to join your mission.Steph KoreyCo-founder and chief executive, AwayIf you\u2019re looking to start a business, know that you don\u2019t know everything, and be comfortable with taking calculated risks and embracing mistakes you\u2019ll make along the way. Don\u2019t be afraid of setbacks, because if you\u2019re not failing, you\u2019re probably not meaningfully winning either. You\u2019ll make mistakes, sure, but you should view them as your competitive advantage \u2014 these moments will be the biggest opportunities for you and your team to iterate and improve and, ultimately, succeed.Tom PattersonFounder and chief executive, Tommy JohnThe best advice I can give fellow entrepreneurs trying to build a business is to always listen to your gut, the data will only take you so far. As entrepreneurs, we\u2019re confronted with countless decisions every single day that have the power to redefine the business. If you let it, your gut will become your most valuable asset.Rich PiersonCo-founder and chief executive, HeadspaceStarting a new concept like Headspace has been a huge undertaking and has required considerable commitment, time and resilience, so my biggest piece of advice is to make sure that when you build something new, you are deeply passionate about it and make sure it solves a real problem. Our vision to improve the health and happiness of the world has enabled me to keep going through the tougher moments.Dov SeidmanFounder and chief executive, LRNFrom my experience, it\u2019s how you do things \u2014 even more than the opportunities you choose to pursue \u2014 that will determine whether you succeed long-term. So, rather than focus only on scaling the business, think about how to scale your values so you build an organization that is focused on the mission, passionate about the work and resilient. You will be much more effective if you earn the moral authority to lead, rather than rely on the formal authority that goes with your title.Tien TzuoFounder and chief executive, ZuoraYou need to edit your relationships. Choose your people carefully. With every new employee that you onboard, every V.C. you decide to partner with, every new board member you bring on and especially every new customer you acquire, you are building your identity. All these decisions add up. Surround yourself with good people \u2014 not just people that you want to be with, but people that you want to be.Edward W. StackYou can\u2019t do it yourself. You need to bring people along with you to grow the business.David GorodyanskyStay loyal to your goals and dreams, and be ready to fight hard and never give up or change your values and mission \u2014 but be flexible on the plans to get there. The path to your goals and dreams will likely be different from how you plan, but as long as you stay loyal to your goals and dreams you\u2019ll be able to reach them through ways that you might not have imagined.Sara MenkerDon\u2019t let the fear of failure stop you from pursuing what could potentially be the most meaningful and fulfilling work you do.Rosie RiosNever let power overtake you to the point of feeling compromised in what you value. Money and power wield a very surreal influence over some people, for better and for worse and regardless of background and political affiliation. I think Tolkien had it right. You have to be a really good Hobbit to resist the ring of power. Be that Hobbit. Andy DunnSenior vice president of digital consumer brands, Walmart U.S. eCommerceI would postpone the multibrand dream until after we did the deal with Walmart. By trying to do it when we were a stand-alone company, I risked the entire business. It\u2019s important to stay foolish, but it\u2019s also important to know when to stay focused.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook to Drop Forced Arbitration in Harassment Cases", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook said on Friday that it would no longer force employees to settle sexual harassment claims in private arbitration, making it the latest technology company to do away with a practice that critics say has stacked the deck against victims of harassment.Facebook acted one day after Google announced similar plans. Last week, 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout from the company\u2019s offices around the world to demand that it change the way it handled sexual harassment incidents. Microsoft changed its arbitration policy about a year ago, as did the ride-hailing company Uber six months ago.The technology industry, known for its groundbreaking products as well as its trendsetting office culture, has gone to considerable lengths in recent years to keep work-force disputes out of the court system. Forcing employee complaints into arbitration has become as common as free lunches and shuttle buses to the office.In arbitration, employment experts say, the playing field shifts toward businesses. Cases are decided by arbitrators instead of judges, and the more cases that companies take to arbitration, the better they fare, according to a 2011 analysis by Alexander J. S. Colvin, a professor at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\u201cThis is a pivotal moment for our industry and corporate America more broadly,\u201d Lori Goler, a Facebook vice president, said in a statement. \u201cWe think this is the right thing to do and hope other companies do, too.\u201dThe use of arbitration clauses, embedded in the fine print of contracts, has soared in the last decade, as corporations try to keep disputes away from public scrutiny.Chris Baker, an employment lawyer and partner at the law firm Baker Curtis & Schwartz, said arbitration cases were often heard by a retired judge who may not be as empathetic as a jury to a harassment victim. They are often shrouded in confidentiality, and arbitration awards tend to be less than those in a jury trial.Mr. Baker said the moves by the tech firms could chip away at arbitration in all kinds of employee disputes because it would be hard for companies to draw the line at sexual harassment.\u201cI think it\u2019s the pebble that starts the avalanche,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very meaningful.\u201dBecause the claims are often kept under wraps in confidential arbitration hearings, critics say harassers often move easily to other jobs without warning to future victims.It has become a significant issue in Silicon Valley, where gender imbalance is stark and tales of sexual harassment are rampant. Critics of arbitration requirements have pushed companies to do away with arbitration and confidentiality clauses that often help companies keep the public and their own employees in the dark about bad behavior.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has noted that forced arbitration \u201ccan prevent employees from learning about similar concerns shared by others in their workplace.\u201dFacebook said it would now make arbitration an option, but not a requirement, for employees reporting a sexual harassment claim. Facebook said it had been planning to make the changes to its arbitration policy for \u201ca while\u201d but did not specify a time frame. There is no indication the company was facing specific pressure to alter its policies.Lyft, Uber\u2019s top competitor, made a similar policy change around the same time.In December, as Microsoft faced a proposed class-action lawsuit by female technical staff claiming discrimination, it vowed to end the arbitration requirement for harassment claims. The women lost the case and are appealing.Microsoft\u2019s policy change was largely symbolic because the company rarely used arbitration clauses in its employment agreements. However, Microsoft also said it would support federal legislation making the requirement of arbitration in harassment cases unenforceable.Apple has never arbitrated a harassment or discrimination claim, said Kristin Huguet, a company spokeswoman. It had a forced arbitration requirement for new employees until earlier this year, but it made arbitration optional and then eliminated the clause from employment contracts altogether. She did not specify when. Ms. Huguet said that even Apple employees who had agreed to such an agreement were no longer bound by it.Companies large and small have figured out how to use arbitration to prevent employees from taking disputes to court and to prevent others, including customers, from banding together in a class action. Some state judges have called the ban on class actions \u2014 one of the few ways that ordinary citizens can fight deep-pocketed corporations over unfair business and employment practices \u2014 a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card for employers.In recent years, it has become tough to apply for a credit card, get cable service, rent a car or shop online without agreeing to settle any disputes in arbitration. The same is true for getting a job.The use of arbitration clauses can be traced back to a coalition of credit card companies and retailers that came up with a plan to shield themselves from expensive lawsuits. Starting around 1999, the group\u2019s legal teams began discussing how to use the fine print of contracts to stop class actions. Bank of America, Chase, Citigroup, Discover, Sears, Toyota and General Electric all attended.Arbitration clauses that don\u2019t allow class-action suits are used by a wide variety of companies, including Macy\u2019s and Kmart. In 2016, when Gretchen Carlson sued Roger E. Ailes, her former boss at Fox News, over allegations of sexual harassment, his lawyers pushed for the case to move into arbitration.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg from New York. Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle, and Mike Isaac and Jack Nicas from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Small Companies Avoid I.P.O.s, Sapping U.S. Economy\u2019s Vitality", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Smith spent years planning to sell shares of his software company, Qualtrics, on the stock market, meeting with bankers, carefully auditing financials and shaping a Wall Street-friendly narrative about the company\u2019s prospects. Two weeks ago, the finish line was close, with a listing on the Nasdaq just a few days away.But shortly before a staff meeting to update Qualtrics\u2019 employees about the public listing, Mr. Smith received a phone call from Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d Mr. McDermott told Mr. Smith.Mr. Smith then stunned Qualtrics\u2019 workers with a totally different message: SAP had agreed to buy the company for $8 billion in cash, nearly double the valuation bankers had set for the company\u2019s public listing. It was a decision, Mr. Smith said in an interview, that he did not second-guess one bit.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more peace in my life,\u201d he said.That kind of last-minute deal, an increasingly common occurrence in the tech industry, is contributing to a major reshaping of the American financial landscape that has been underway for years.Small and midsize companies are fading from stock markets, leaving far fewer publicly traded companies. Many of the smaller companies are bought by larger organizations or are enticed to stay private by the sharp rise in venture capital money, both of which allow them to avoid the volatility and scrutiny that come with going public. The number of listed companies peaked in the late 1990s, before the dot-com bust, plummeting 52 percent by 2016.Some economists say the buyouts of early-stage companies by large dominant players help explain why, by many measures, the American economy has been less dynamic in recent years. Less competition can contribute to sluggish rates of entrepreneurship, business creation, wage growth and productivity, they say.Even some companies that do go public can find that their time there is short-lived. In March, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, a software integration company, just a year after its public offering.\u201cCompanies like Qualtrics are saying, \u2018Huh, why bother the fighting in the public markets if I can do just as well by presenting myself for acquisition in sort of a premarket sale?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a Cornell University finance professor who has studied the decline of publicly traded companies.The traditionally vibrant American small business sector was long viewed as a strength for the economy. Small businesses are more likely to develop innovative new technologies, forcing large companies to reinvest significant amounts of profits to keep pace. The economy benefits from that competition, improving productivity and generating new and higher-quality products and services for consumers.The ability of large, cash-rich companies to buy smaller businesses before they have the chance to emerge as formidable competitors has altered the corporate landscape, said Thomas Philippon, a professor of economics at New York University, who has studied the increased dominance of large companies in many American industries.From 2001 to 2017, the median age of a venture-backed start-up going public was 11 years, according to a study by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. That\u2019s three years older than in the 1980s and 1990s, excluding the dot-com boom.Big tech companies like SAP and Cisco are attracted to the reliable revenue streams of the new class of cloud-based software providers, which charge monthly subscription fees for their offerings.\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for some of these big companies that need to adapt to a new way of doing business,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of I.P.O.-related research and services.\u201cThe public markets would not have awarded these companies those kinds of multiples,\u201d Ms. Smith said.While Qualtrics is growing quickly, its $290 million in annual revenue will not make an immediate difference in the earnings of SAP, which brought in more than $20 billion in 2017. But Mr. Smith of Qualtrics said that joining with SAP would help him accomplish in two years what would have taken five.\u201cOur only reason to go public was not for the financial side. It was to go take this to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got that in one swoop.\u201dTraditional investors in early-stage companies that used to go public have had to adjust to the new reality. For instance, the asset manager and mutual fund company T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, has increased its investing activity in pre-I.P.O. companies, including Airbnb and Uber, as well as Snap, the social media company, before it went public in 2017.\u201cWe are seeing opportunities to invest in companies with very similar characteristics to what would have been early-stage public market companies decades ago \u2014 only these companies are oftentimes raising money through private markets instead,\u201d Corey Shull, an analyst who leads early-stage internet investments at T. Rowe Price, wrote in an email.Investing in hot private start-ups is not generally available to the public. Retail investors seeking to ride the wave of hot cloud companies, for example, have had numerous opportunities to jump on an enterprise tech public offering this year. But some of the most notable ones, including Qualtrics, Adaptive Insights and Mulesoft, are now under the umbrella of much larger conglomerates.\u201cIf they don\u2019t have to tap the public markets to raise money, then why would you?\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who focuses on I.P.O. advisory work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Survive the Next Era of Tech (Slow Down and Be Mindful)", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIn his final State of the Art column, Farhad Manjoo reflects on the industry\u2019s changes and presents a new guide for navigating the future of technology.At the time, technology felt thrilling and world-changing. You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d \u2014 and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder. But tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things \u2014 every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps \u2014 that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.So to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.Now the time has come to amend and update that advice \u2014 which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I\u2019m not going far: I\u2019ll be writing for The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section starting next year.)How should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.Not long ago \u2014 in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn\u2019t work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?Something strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.But ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?But you don\u2019t have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too \u2014 and for a better, healthier tech industry, it\u2019s best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.Best of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry. There are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices \u2014 so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple\u2019s service but not from Spotify. But it\u2019s precisely this sort of mischief that I\u2019m hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.One reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.The lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.That\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.Are these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful. Go slow.Advertisement"}

And to deliver on that strategy, many have created jobs with titles like chief consumer officer, chief experience officer, and chief digital and client officer.Such consumer-centric positions have been around for years in industries like banking and hospitality but they only recently started popping up in the luxury sector. \u201cLuxury and fashion brands are finally starting to concentrate on what customers expect from them,\u201d said Jean R\u00e9vis of MAD Network, a luxury consultancy and headhunting firm in Paris.And the new focus is, he added, \u201ca radical change from their previous top-down view of the world, when they got away with simply imposing their creative vision without taking into consideration customers\u2019 expectations.\u201dThose expectations are Mr. Sala\u2019s job. \u201cWe are not aiming for a one-shot sale but to make the customer feel that he or she is part of the maison,\u201d he said. So, for example, he has helped sales assistants learn how to build customer relationships, and sees his mission as making \u201csure that the customer gets a personalized service both online and offline and that there is no point of friction between the two.\u201d\u201cThese are new jobs,\u201d said Mr. Sala, who previously was watch marketing manager at Van Cleef & Arpels and its high jewelry product manager. \u201cSo, of course, when I started my career, I never expected to do this job today, and I am sure that my job as it is today will be completely different in a few years.\u201dSome of the executives filling these new \u201cC\u201d (or \u201cchief\u201d) level positions have luxury retail, e-commerce and technology backgrounds, dovetailing well with the brands\u2019 new and future customers, who are glued to their cellphones and routinely browse the internet before buying. But others come from very different fields.Givenchy, for example, has a new global customer experience director, Guillaume Desjardins, who previously worked at Ralph Lauren and the five-star Le Bristol hotel in Paris. Francesca Danzi, a customer experience and luxury retail consultant, became chief client officer at Tory Burch in July.And in June, Kenzo appointed a chief client and digital officer, Bruno Alazard, whose experience included jobs at Est\u00e9e Lauder, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Yahoo.Yet Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, the wine and spirits group that is part of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, hired Laure Baume as its chief consumer officer, although she had no luxury experience. She previously worked for Club Med; A\u00e9roports de Paris, which operates the three Paris airports; and Kraft Foods.In the brand\u2019s description of the Wooster Street store that opened in New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood in May, it said store connectors would \u201cconnect clients to Gucci in a new, emotional way to discover the house\u2019s latest products and collaborations\u201d \u2014 along with in-store features like a Gucci app whose augmented reality features allow customers to experiment with product customization on the spot.\u201cBeing able to connect the online and physical customer journey,\u201d said Luke Timmins, the store experience manager at Browns East in London, \u201cis key in creating a seamless experience that puts the customer first by being personal, efficient and inspiring across all channels.\u201dFarfetch, the online luxury retailer that owns Browns, is using the store to test technology that includes an app to track everything customers touch or try, which it plans to roll out at the Browns flagship in Mayfair and at some Chanel stores next year, thanks to a partnership the two companies signed earlier this year.Yet even as luxury houses expand their ranks with customer service hires \u2014 as well as data analysts to manage and interpret the information, like shopping and travel habits, that they now are gathering \u2014 some industry experts say the transitions could be difficult. \u201cI am wary of catapulting people from the technology and engineering worlds to executive positions as they come from a different corporate culture, which means that they might not be easy to integrate,\u201d said Marie-Aude Stocker, director of people, development and prospective at Van Cleef & Arpels, where she also is a member of the executive committee.Most luxury brands have hierarchical lines of command and long decision-making processes, the kind of traditional organization that can be difficult for outsiders to navigate, especially those from the more freewheeling corporate cultures of Silicon Valley, start-ups and consultancies.Challenging entrenched management could become frustrating, industry insiders say, leading to a loss of motivation and, in the end, preventing new executives from delivering on the changes they were hired to make.\u201cMiddle managers all say they want change but \u2018not in my department,\u2019\u201d said Antoinette Lemens, an executive search specialist in Paris. \u201cIt is too early days to know if people in such new positions as chief digital officer will be successful as it is certainly not an easy job!\u201dIn all these new positions, \u201cI think brands are experimenting,\u201d said Grace Nida, managing director of the global luxury sector at Korn Ferry International, an organizational consulting firm. \u201cBut one thing is clear: they need the full support of the C.E.O.; otherwise they will not be able to drive the transformation for which they were hired.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The companies\u2019 own workers are another matter.However Google responds, little at the internet search giant \u2014 and, perhaps, little in Silicon Valley \u2014 will be the same again.For two years, regulators, lawmakers, academics and the media have pushed Silicon Valley to alter its world-swallowing ways. But outsiders have few points of leverage in tech; there are few laws governing the industry\u2019s practices, and lawmakers have struggled to get up to speed on tech\u2019s implications for society. Protests by workers are an important new avenue for pressure; the very people who make these companies work can change what they do in the world. But the Google walkout suggests something bigger could be afoot. The walkout\u2019s organizers told me that they were aiming to keep that movement alive \u2014 to ask the most important questions about how their company operates in the world, and to inspire those in other parts of the tech industry to take up similar arms.\u201cSomething we\u2019ve discussed as a group, something we\u2019ve locked arms over, is that we\u2019re assembled now,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, a marketing manager at Google-owned YouTube who created the internal discussion forum in which organizers planned the walkout. \u201cWe have an incredibly engaged group of people, and we aren\u2019t going to stop escalating this,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe group isn\u2019t really going to back down from this or a host of other things. The walkout was not like a blowing-off-steam exercise.\u201dThe walkout was sparked by a specific grievance: a report in The New York Times that Google gave a $90 million exit payment to Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, after he was accused of coercing a woman to perform oral sex in a hotel room (a charge that he denies but that the company found credible). The organizers said their aims were far larger, though, than sexual harassment and abuse.\u201cOur discussions expanded very quickly,\u201d Ms. Stapleton said. \u201cWhat is it that we want the company to be, and what should we do with the power that we very quickly see we are harnessing? Is Google for good? Do we think that technology is toxic? Are we navigating through a host of complex issues online in a positive way?\u201dSpeaking to Ms. Stapleton and several of her fellow organizers, I was struck by their intoxicating optimism. They brimmed with confidence about their capacity to push for a new moral, ethical and social framework in tech. And because Google\u2019s culture is a model for the industry and much of corporate America, they saw the idea of changing the company as part of a larger social and political struggle to make a dent in the universe.\u201cI think what we did was disprove the myth that it\u2019s too hard to take collective action,\u201d said Celie O\u2019Neil-Hart, who works in YouTube\u2019s marketing department. She described the meticulous way that she and other organizers of the walkout distilled the thousands of discussions flowing through their group into a list of demands. Their secret? Google\u2019s own technology.\u201cI was getting hundreds of pieces of feedback on these demands, but ironically thanks to Google\u2019s products, like Google Groups and Docs and comments, I was able to get this constant stream of real-time feedback from a collective group of hundreds of Googlers, all while doing my day job,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neil-Hart said. She noted, too, that many Googlers had been hired for their work-endless-hours drive; now that drive was marshaled in the service of a movement.Stephanie Parker, a policy specialist at YouTube, described organizing the protest in a way that sounded to me like designing and releasing a new Google product, only with a group that was more passionate and personally invested.\u201cIt was really fun to see my fellow employees flex the skills that a lot of them had developed at Google \u2014 their program management skills, their marketing skills, their P.R. skills, but in the service of this movement,\u201d she said.A lot about the walkout was particular to Google\u2019s culture, which has always encouraged a more open form of debate than many tech peers. Companies more consumed with secrecy \u2014 Facebook, for instance, or Amazon or Apple \u2014 may be less tolerant of a large number of employees who use their tech skills to go rogue.But such a prospect is not out of the question. Tech workers have endless options when it comes to employment; the tight labor market gives them greater leeway in voicing their concerns, and the promise that their voices are valued gives them an expectation that they can effect change.\u201cI didn\u2019t think this would happen, but it\u2019s amazing to see,\u201d said Ellen Pao, a venture capitalist who sued her former firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, for sexual harassment and now works at the nonprofit group Project Include. \u201cIt\u2019s another point of pressure \u2014 maybe the most powerful one yet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd until recently, there really hasn\u2019t been much pressure at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Past Is Present: Strategies for Bringing Current Events Into the Social Studies Classroom", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial Studies SkillsWhy do we insist that students study history?Perhaps because the study of history promotes critical thinking, creates a shared cultural literacy or encourages responsible citizenship. Certainly one of the most important reasons is because history continues to matter.Why has North Korea developed a nuclear arsenal that threatens the United States? Why are thousands of Hondurans camped out on the southern border of the United States? Why have many athletes decided to kneel during the national anthem? To answer any of these questions \u2014 or the myriad others posed by the news every day \u2014 students will need to understand what happened in the past.In this teaching resource, we suggest different methods teachers can use to easily facilitate these connections. Each method is illustrated with two examples, one from global history and another from United States history, and each ends with a classroom challenge. The goal is to help this kind of thinking become a habit of mind for your students._________Essential questions are, by definition, open-ended and big-picture, and using them in the history classroom encourages students to relate history to current events.Here are two examples.Global | How do geography and climate affect human life?Let\u2019s say you\u2019re studying the significance of geography in shaping the development of civilizations, perhaps in relation to the rise of ancient river valley civilizations._________If students are connecting the role of past presidents such as George Washington, Andrew Jackson or Franklin D. Roosevelt to our current president, there is a constant stream of related Times articles for them to explore. These lesson plans link to some of the best:_________Like essential questions, themes in the history classroom encourage students to make connections across time periods and places. They are also relatively easy to use to identify related current events. Here are two examples you might consider using.Global | Human Rights Violations (or Religious Conflict)If you\u2019re studying 20th-century human tragedies like the Holocaust or the Rwandan genocide, students learn that human rights violations are unfortunately an enduring issue. The current persecution of the Rohingya clearly highlights that reality._________U.S. | ImmigrationOnce they find a piece that interests them, they can identify what argument the writer is making and then decide if they agree or disagree. For balance, they can look for another opinion piece that argues a different position, either in The Times or elsewhere, and decide which point of view they agree with most and why. What issues that we\u2019re still debating today were issues in the era they are studying? What images, quotes, data or other kinds of information can they find that might make interesting paired texts to link the two eras?_________Global | World War IThe world just commemorated the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I. Katrin Bennhold writes about the unsettling similarities between 1914 and today:Now as then, Europe\u2019s political center is weak and the fringes are radicalizing. Nationalism, laced with ethnic hatred, has been gaining momentum. Populists sit in several European governments._________U.S. | ReconstructionReconstruction has long been misrepresented, or simply neglected, in our schools, and unlike Confederate generals and founders of the Ku Klux Klan, few if any monuments exist to the black and white leaders of that era._________Since social studies students spend a great deal of time exploring historic places, one easy way to make that study relevant to them is to have them discover what those places look like today, and how life there has either changed or stayed the same. What remnants of the past are still present? Why?Global | China (Silk Road)China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.China envisions a vast global network of trade, investment and infrastructure that will reshape financial and geopolitical ties \u2014 and bring the rest of the world closer to Beijing._________U.S. | HarlemFor nearly a century, Harlem has been synonymous with black urban America. Given its magnetic and growing appeal to younger black professionals and its historic residential enclaves and cultural institutions, the neighborhood\u2019s reputation as the capital of black America seems unlikely to change soon.But the neighborhood is in the midst of a profound and accelerating shift. In greater Harlem, which runs river to river, and from East 96th Street and West 106th Street to West 155th Street, blacks are no longer a majority of the population \u2014 a shift that actually occurred a decade ago, but was largely overlooked._________Historians\u2019 understanding of the past is typically grounded in what they glean from analyzing texts and artifacts. How are these still relevant today? Regular readers of The Times know that works of art, texts and structures created long ago are often featured in stories from the Politics, Travel or Arts sections as new generations discover them or reconsider their power and significance.Global | The Ruins of Ancient RomeIslamic State propagandists considered Palmyra a bonanza for promoting their vision of a strictly religious caliphate devoid of homage to other cultures or religions. They publicized the work of their demolition teams with graphic photographs._________U.S. | The Constitution_________Global | Fascist LeadersEven though the rise of fascist leaders like Hitler and Mussolini pulled the world into the most destructive conflict in human history, World War II, the end of the war marked the end of fascism.Right?_________U.S. | Robber BaronsAmerican industrialists and business magnates in the late 19th century, like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt and John D. Rockefeller, were called robber barons by critics because of ruthless business practices that helped make them incredibly wealthy._________When School Gets Real: Teachers Connect Classroom Lessons to Current EventsMaking It Relevant: Helping Students Connect Their Studies to the World TodayMaking Connections: 50 Teenagers Suggest Creative Ways to Link Classic Texts to the World Today50 Ways to Teach With Current Events_________How do you embed current events in your social studies classroom?

Lael Brainard, a fellow Fed governor, said they would \u201cweaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system.\u201d But Greg Baer of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said they don\u2019t go far enough.More details from Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner of the NYT:\u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel that we\u2019re unequal or we\u2019re not respected anymore,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, 33, a product marketing manager at Google\u2019s YouTube who helped call for the walkout. \u201cGoogle\u2019s famous for its culture. But in reality we\u2019re not even meeting the basics of respect, justice and fairness for every single person here.\u201dIt\u2019s the latest sign of how the tech industry\u2019s rank and file employees are embracing activism \u2014 and pushing back against their leaders. Workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies have recently spoken out about their employers\u2019 willingness to work on military projects, the gender pay gap and other issues.Last month was painful for investors. At its worst, the S.&P. 500 was down more than 9 percent, though it rebounded in the last few days to finish October with losses of around 7 percent.Only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. The S.&P. 500 has been dragged down disproportionately by smaller, domestically focused companies, cyclically sensitive industrial firms and global manufacturers like Caterpillar.And he also lists the issues that spooked investors:President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.The streaming service has changed its stance on not showing movies in theaters before streaming them. It will screen three movies that it wants to be considered for Oscars, including Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d in theaters for several weeks before they go online.Netflix\u2019s modified distribution approach should persuade more theaters to participate. But the move is really about winning Oscars and wooing Hollywood talent.Academy Awards voters \u2014 unlike the Emmys electorate \u2014 have been cool to Netflix. Heavyweights like Steven Spielberg, for instance, have chafed at the company\u2019s policy of streaming movies immediately, suggesting that the service\u2019s original films should be considered television. Top directors like Mr. Cuar\u00f3n, who won an Oscar in 2014 for directing \u201cGravity,\u201d also want their work to be seen on big screens, which has made it harder for Netflix to compete with studios for projects.But the move will give Netflix a new headache: explaining to its other filmmakers why their productions didn\u2019t get a theatrical release.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "May A.I. Help You?", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "Intelligent chatbots could automate away nearly all of our commercial interactions \u2014 for better or for worse.\u201cTwo-thirds of people will never get in front of a clinician,\u201d says Darcy, who talks in an exuberant flow. \u201cAnd that\u2019s in the United States! The rest of the world? More than half the world doesn\u2019t even have access to basic health care. The idea of mental health care is just completely out of reach.\u201dDarcy happened to be a former computer programmer, so she was able to dream up a very unusual solution to this problem: Woebot, a text-chatbot therapist. Working with a team of psychologists and Andrew Ng, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, Darcy wrote a set of conversational prompts that walks users through the practice of C.B.T. In a chipper style, the bot helps users challenge their \u201cdistorted thinking\u201d; it coaxes users to describe their moods more clearly. Since Woebot is just software, it could be made freely available worldwide, and it could, in Silicon Valley terms, \u201cscale\u201d \u2014 or converse with thousands of people simultaneously. It could check in and nudge users with superhuman diligence; it would be available at all hours. \u201cWoebot can be there at 2 a.m. if you\u2019re having a panic attack and no therapist can, or should be, in bed with you,\u201d Darcy says.Woebot does not pretend to be human; it appears as a cartoon robot when it chats with you on Facebook Messenger, and it acknowledges its own artifice (as when it declares, for example, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a little bit about how I like to work with humans\u201d). But its personality is otherwise upbeat, its conversations peppered with emoji and animated gifs (like the cheering Minions from \u201cDespicable Me\u201d) to congratulate you for doing psychological work.In a study with 70 young adults, Darcy found that after two weeks of interacting with the bot, the test subjects had lower incidences of depression and anxiety. They were impressed, and even touched, by the software\u2019s attentiveness. \u201cWoebot felt like a real person that showed concern,\u201d one of them told Darcy\u2019s team. Last spring, when Darcy put Woebot online, free to all, its use immediately exploded; in the first week, more than 50,000 people talked to it. (\u201cDo you realize,\u201d Ng told Darcy, \u201cthat Woebot spoke to more people today than a human therapist could in a lifetime?\u201d) Nowadays, Woebot exchanges between one and two million messages a week with users, ranging from divorc\u00e9es to the bereaved to young men, a population that rarely seeks treatment. Many tell Darcy that it\u2019s easier to talk to a bot than a human; they don\u2019t feel judged.Darcy argues this is a glimpse of our rapidly arriving future, where talking software is increasingly able to help us manage our emotions. There will be A.I.s that detect our feelings, possibly better than we can. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see robots for weight loss, and robots for being more effective communicators,\u201d she says. It may feel odd at first; indeed, when people email her to say Woebot helped them feel better, nearly every one begins the note by sheepishly explaining, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that this would be helpful.\u201d But there\u2019s something about talking to software that is powerful, they discover, when it responds and seems alive.\u201cIt\u2019s conversation,\u201d Darcy says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been conversing for, what is it, 200,000 years?\u201dThe rise of \u201cconversational agents\u201d is the next great shift in computer interfaces \u2014 one arguably as significant as the \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d interface that emerged in the \u201980s. Before the Apple Macintosh, the first computer to popularize point-and-click, people using home computers had to familiarize themselves with abstruse text commands. The advent of the visual interface opened up computing to the masses, producing a generation fluent in word processing, email and, eventually, web surfing. The next great shift, the mobile phone, put computing \u2014 and nonstop internet access \u2014 into our pockets, and unleashed a tsunami of social media. These sorts of changes don\u2019t come along very often, and when they do, they create new and unexpected behaviors.Talking software gives us computers that not only ride along with us but also socialize with us. Being humanlike \u2014 saying \u201chi,\u201d telling self-deprecating jokes \u2014 is their interface metaphor, much as the first point-and-click computers used the trappings of office life (a wastepaper basket, a tiny pad of paper) to help orient us to the screen. Meaghan Keaney Anderson, a vice president of HubSpot, a marketing and sales software firm, has seen firsthand how voice commands have become second nature in her household, particularly for the next generation: \u201cMy daughter is 22 months old now. At 9 months she said her first word, which was the dog\u2019s name, and then at 13 months she learned to walk, and then by 15 months she started giving Alexa commands.\u201d She added: \u201cI think my daughter is growing up in a world where you just speak what you want into the universe and it provides.\u201dFor years, A.I. programmers fixated on passing the Turing Test \u2014 the famous challenge floated by Alan Turing in 1950 to produce a machine that can fool a human into thinking it is also human. Sci-fi has made dystopic hay of this in movies like \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and \u201cEx Machina.\u201d But the world that\u2019s emerging is simultaneously more mundane and stranger. None of this software is trying to fool us. Bots like Siri or Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are, like Woebot, openly artificial, even proudly so. (When I asked Alexa \u201cAre you alive?\u201d it responded: \u201cArtificially, maybe, but not in the same way that you\u2019re alive.\u201d) We are thus heading into a post-Turing world, one in which we\u2019ll banter all day to software, always aware that it is software.Emma Coats, the \u201ccharacter lead\u201d for Google Assistant, describes the emotional affect of her company\u2019s artificial life form as \u201ca friendly companion that is trustworthy.\u201d She and her team strenuously avoided giving the Assistant even a hint of snark. \u201cYou\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want to ask a stupid question if it\u2019s going to give me a hard time about it,\u2019\u2009\u201d Coats says. Some of their personality writers have backgrounds in improv. Coats herself worked at Pixar on the animated film \u201cBrave.\u201d \u201cPixar is all about finding an emotional reality in a car or a fish,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that\u2019s something we\u2019ve really used with the Assistant. We don\u2019t want it to ever be a human being, right? That\u2019s not what it is. But that doesn\u2019t mean that A.I. or software can\u2019t have a perspective on the world.\u201dAs a literary endeavor, the field of bot creation is booming. The bots need to be equipped to answer the wide variety of weird, playful queries that people lob at them, which requires lots of writers. Coats and her co-workers have found that people like to simply shoot the breeze with their devices \u2014 probing their personalities, searching for the puppet strings. \u201c\u2009\u2018Do you fart?\u2019 is always a popular question,\u201d Coats says dryly.There\u2019s another reason botmakers are embracing a post-Turing mind-set: They\u2019ve realized that the public tends to feel wounded when someone (or something) tries to fool them. This spring, Google gave a demonstration of Duplex, a new voice-chat A.I. When Duplex called a hair salon to book an appointment, it sounded so human \u2014 it even said \u201cum\u201d a few times \u2014 that the salon receptionist apparently never realized it was A.I. The reaction online was harsh. \u201cPeople value authenticity,\u201d says Kate Darling, a researcher who studies the ethics of robotics at M.I.T. \u201cIt matters a lot. It matters hugely.\u201dThis is how computers have always made themselves at home: by offering improved efficiency, vanquishing dull tasks. At TD Bank, coders are building experimental bots \u2014 using tech created by the A.I. firm Kasisto \u2014 to encourage customers to probe their financial life. Rizwan Khalfan, the company\u2019s chief digital and payments officer, told me he imagines customers asking a bot something like, \u201cO.K., tell me about my expenses last weekend.\u201d A question this specific isn\u2019t easy to answer on a website, where the customer might need to hunt through a database. But, Khalfan hopes, a person could one day ask this bot conversationally: \u201cI want to go out to the theater this weekend. Can I actually afford it?\u201dThere are some things audio can\u2019t handle as effectively as screens \u2014 long lists of data, for instance. But in a world where people worry that they\u2019re staring at their phones too much, chat might offer a respite. In \u201cHer,\u201d the voice assistants murmur in people\u2019s ears as they move through the world, functioning as something like E.S.P. The chatbot designer Emily Withrow, who is the director of the Quartz Bot Studio, imagines conversational A.I. working that way soon. \u201cYou turn on N.P.R. midinterview, but you can\u2019t for the life of you figure out who Terry Gross is talking to. You could say out loud: \u2018Who\u2019s she talking to? Who is it? What book are they talking about?\u2019 You can extend it to even seeing someone at a dinner party and saying privately, \u2018Remind me what Jill\u2019s husband\u2019s name is.\u2019\u2009\u201d The elderly might find these efficiencies particularly appealing, because aging eyes and reduced mobility can make screens harder to use. Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease might find A.I. voice assistants happy to endlessly answer repeated questions, in a way that few human attendants could.There\u2019s another allure for businesses, of course: Talking bots don\u2019t need to be hired and then paid. Once coded, your bot can handle millions of customers simultaneously. We\u2019re already seeing this in customer service, when text chatbots answer rote questions or take orders. Yamato Transport, one of Japan\u2019s largest courier firms, uses a chatbot to schedule deliveries and answer questions about where packages are. Domino\u2019s Pizza runs a chatbot to take delivery orders online. American Eagle Outfitters has a bot that customers can converse with to figure out the perfect gift to buy for someone.Conversational bots thus could bring on a new wave of unemployment \u2014 or \u201creadjustment,\u201d to use the bloodless term of economics. Service workers, sales agents, telemarketers \u2014 it\u2019s not hard to imagine how millions of jobs that require social interaction, whether on the phone or online, could eventually be eliminated by code. Some economists argue that this might not necessarily result in a net loss of jobs, pointing to the example of automatic-teller machines. When A.T.M.s took off in the \u201980s, many predicted that bank-teller jobs would be decimated; indeed, individual bank branches did begin employing fewer tellers. But with those savings in pocket, banks greatly expanded the overall number of branches, so that the total population of tellers nationally rose for years. Of course, as economic history shows, the profits of automation are seldom shared with workers. Even if individual humans keep their jobs, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be paid more. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict,\u201d TD Bank\u2019s Khalfan told me, before adding that the company has committed to retrain workers when their jobs become redundant.Whatever impact talking software has on the labor market, it will surely extend the reach of algorithms more deeply into our lives. Ask Alexa or Siri a question, and you don\u2019t get a page of search results; just one Solomonic answer, selected by the A.I. After all, this is how spoken communication works: Just as nobody wants to listen to a voice mail message, nobody wants to hear a chatbot recite three minutes of data. Algorithms must narrow the field. So for anyone who has watched the inscrutable algorithms of Facebook or YouTube narrow our feeds by \u201crecommending\u201d outr\u00e9 conspiracy theorists, the notion of A.I. finding a new toehold in our cognitive life can be disturbing.\u201cI will literally buy whatever option Alexa puts first for me for paper towels,\u201d Keaney Anderson, the HubSpot V.P., told me. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to search through a million of them. I ask her for paper towels, she delivers. And that may be fine for paper towels, but is it fine for music? Is it fine for news sources?\u201d Talking to bots will also mean new opportunities for tech firms to collect data on what we\u2019re thinking, what we\u2019re doing, all day long. That includes our feelings: Researchers are working on \u201caffective\u201d sensing that enables chatbots to recognize our emotions. These are the familiar trade-offs that tech exacts in return for convenience; they\u2019re never value-free, as Evan Selinger, a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, notes. \u201cWhere are these things now appearing? They\u2019re appearing in our homes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe home has traditionally been the locus of privacy, right? This is where I shut out the rest of the world. This is where I look for my breathing room. This is my sanctuary, you know?\u201dIndeed, the home is where life happens, and that includes its traumas. Those have sometimes caught the large A.I. botmakers \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Microsoft \u2014 off guard. They expected their bots to be asked for jokes; they didn\u2019t, apparently, expect so many different cries for help. In 2016, a study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that, though most popular voice assistants responded to suicidal thoughts by providing help lines and other appropriate resources, when they were told \u201cI am being abused\u201d or \u201cI was raped,\u201d they generally replied with some variant of \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Human conversation being what it is, the list of personal crises one might confide is massive, likely outpacing the ability of botmakers to keep up.One person who bought a Jibo was Erin Partridge, an art therapist in Alameda, Calif., who works with the elderly. When she took Jibo on visits, her patients loved it. They laughed at its jokes; they asked it to sing tunes from the past. One man with advanced dementia called his daughter to describe Jibo in great detail. She found this remarkable, because he could rarely remember any single event so well and rarely initiated calls. Somehow Jibo had made an impression on him. Another resident declared that she \u201cloved\u201d Jibo, and put her arms around the robot. \u201cJust talk to me, don\u2019t talk to anybody else,\u201d she\u2019d tell it, asking, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m beautiful?\u201dTalking bots connect to us in ways that point-and-click software doesn\u2019t. For some technology critics, including Sherry Turkle, who does research on the psychology of tech at M.I.T., this raises ethical concerns. \u201cPeople are hard-wired with sort of Darwinian vulnerabilities, Darwinian buttons,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd these Darwinian buttons are pushed by this technology.\u201d That is, programmers are manipulating our emotions when they create objects that inquire after our needs.The precursor to today\u2019s bots, Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s ELIZA, was created at M.I.T. in 1966. ELIZA was a pretty crude set of prompts, but by simply asking people about their feelings, it drew them into deep conversations. Ordinary household appliances can now pull off the same trick. \u201cYour fridge will know if you\u2019re eating H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and if you sound sad, it\u2019ll say, \u2018Sherry, what\u2019s really going on?\u2019\u2009\u201d Turkle says. \u201cIs that what we want?\u201dWorse, she argues, talking bots could become a social crutch. Rather than pay humans to help the poor and powerless \u2014 students in overcrowded schools, elders in understaffed facilities, customers looking to speak to someone in huge institutions \u2014 we might instead provide software that pretends to care. \u201cThese places are so deprived that it\u2019s easy to argue that putting in some robots is better than nothing,\u201d Turkle says. \u201cThe harder thing is offering actual human support.\u201dA future in which only the wealthy have the luxury of being attended to by actual humans, while everyone else makes do with bots, would certainly be a dystopia. But botmakers themselves \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 are more sanguine. Cynthia Breazeal thinks the coming A.I. wave will actually help level the playing field between the well-off and everyone else. \u201cThe social-justice angle of this wave,\u201d she says, \u201cis that everyone will be able to afford a fabulous personal tutor because it\u2019s an A.I. tutor.\u201d Bots that help the elderly control their home and their lives will let them \u201cage in place\u201d at their own house, something that most older Americans would far prefer to a retirement home. \u201cWhen we talk to assisted-living facilities, they will tell us point blank, there is no way we can build enough facilities and hire enough people to meet the demand,\u201d Breazeal adds. \u201cThey call it the \u2018Silver Tsunami.\u2019\u2009\u201dPerhaps interacting with A.I.s will mean atrophy for our social muscles. If they\u2019re just machines, why bother with pleasantries? The scientific research on that is still unclear: Some studies have found people can actually be remarkably cordial to robots, while other research suggests we\u2019re liable to be rude and curt when we know our conversational partner isn\u2019t human. We could get used to bossing things around, a behavior that could bleed into everyday life. (Amazon, after fielding precisely these concerns from parents, created a politeness mode for its Echo devices that gently reminds its users to say \u201cplease.\u201d)Yet dealing with bots could also make life less prickly for humans on all sides of these small interactions. After all, today\u2019s customer-service calls are pretty bleak, even when you do talk to a live person. Call tech support for your laptop, and odds are you\u2019ll be talking to an employee who\u2019s required to read only from scripts \u2014 a human who is thus, paradoxically, forced to behave exactly like a bot.\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d says Steve Worswick, who worked for years providing I.T. support, talking people through problems like \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten my password.\u201d To keep himself engaged, in the evenings he taught himself to create bots, using an online tool made by an A.I. company called Pandorabots. Over 13 years, he coded a bot called Mitsuku, and wrote fully 350,000 lines for it; Mitsuku has won the annual Loebner Prize competition for the most \u201chumanlike\u201d bot four times.Soon enough Worswick had a new job: In 2018, he was hired by Pandorabots. Now Worswick, as a senior A.I. developer, imagines a world where the bots take over the spirit-crushing sort of conversational work that he used to do, releasing human beings to do something better with their time. Let the bots fix people\u2019s passwords. Real people, he says, have more interesting questions to answer.Clive Thompson is a contributing writer.

{"Headline": "Be Afraid of Economic \u2018Bigness.\u2019 Be Very Afraid.", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the 1930s it contributed to the rise of fascism. Alarmingly, we are experimenting again with a monopolized economy.Mr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust.In the aftermath of the Second World War, an urgent question presented itself: How can we prevent the rise of fascism from happening again? If over the years that question became one of mostly historical interest, it has again become pressing, with the growing success of populist, nationalist and even neofascist movements all around the world.Common answers to the question stress the importance of a free press, the rule of law, stable government, robust civic institutions and common decency. But as undoubtedly important as these factors are, we too often overlook something else: the threat to democracy posed by monopoly and excessive corporate concentration \u2014 what the Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201d We must not forget the economic origins of fascism, lest we risk repeating the most calamitous error of the 20th century.It is a story that should sound uncomfortably familiar: An economic crisis yields widespread economic suffering, feeding an appetite for a nationalistic and extremist leader. The leader rides to power promising a return to national greatness, deliverance from economic suffering and the defeat of enemies foreign and domestic (including big business). Yet in reality, the leader seeks alliances with large enterprises and the great monopolies, so long as they obey him, for each has something the other wants: He gets their loyalty, and they avoid democratic accountability.There are many differences between the situation in 1930s and our predicament today. But given what we know, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that we are conducting a dangerous economic and political experiment: We have chosen to weaken the laws \u2014 the antitrust laws \u2014 that are meant to resist the concentration of economic power in the United States and around the world.From a political perspective, we have recklessly chosen to tolerate global monopolies and oligopolies in finance, media, airlines, telecommunications and elsewhere, to say nothing of the growing size and power of the major technology platforms. In doing so, we have cast aside the safeguards that were supposed to protect democracy against a dangerous marriage of private and public power.Unfortunately, there are abundant signs that we are suffering the consequences, both in the United States and elsewhere. There is a reason that extremist, populist leaders like Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Xi Jinping of China and Viktor Orban of Hungary have taken center stage, all following some version of the same script. And here in the United States, we have witnessed the anger borne of ordinary citizens who have lost almost any influence over economic policy \u2014 and by extension, their lives. The middle class has no political influence over their stagnant wages, tax policy, the price of essential goods or health care. This powerlessness is brewing a powerful feeling of outrage.After the fall of the Third Reich, the Allies broke up the major Nazi monopolies specifically so that they could not be \u201cused by Germany as instruments of political or economic aggression,\u201d in the words of the law used to do so. The United States took its medicine, too: In 1950, Congress passed the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 to curb politically and economically dangerous concentrations. It empowered the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to block or undo mergers when the effect was \u201csubstantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly.\u201dIt would be understandable if you assumed that the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 had been repealed. But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary. Consequently, over the last two decades we have allowed successive waves of mergers that make a mockery of the 1950 law, and have concentrated economic power in ways that are dangerous to the polity.We need to figure out how the classic antidote to bigness \u2014 the antitrust and other antimonopoly laws \u2014 might be recovered and updated to address the specific challenges of our time. For a start, Congress should pass a new Anti-Merger Act reasserting that it meant what it said in 1950, and create new levels of scrutiny for mega-mergers like the proposed union of T-Mobile and Sprint.But we also need judges who better understand the political as well as economic goals of antitrust. We need prosecutors willing to bring big cases with the courage of trustbusters like Theodore Roosevelt, who brought to heel the empires of J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, and with the economic sophistication of the men and women who challenged AT&T and Microsoft in the 1980s and 1990s. Europe needs to do its part as well, blocking more mergers, especially those like Bayer\u2019s recent acquisition of Monsanto that threaten to put entire global industries in just a few hands.The United States seems to constantly forget its own traditions, to forget what this country at its best stands for. We forget that America pioneered a kind of law \u2014 antitrust \u2014 that in the words of Roosevelt would \u201cteach the masters of the biggest corporations in the land that they were not, and would not be permitted to regard themselves as, above the law.\u201d We have forgotten that antitrust law had more than an economic goal, that it was meant fundamentally as a kind of constitutional safeguard, a check against the political dangers of unaccountable private power.As the lawyer and consumer advocate Robert Pitofsky warned in 1979, we must not forget the economic origins of totalitarianism, that \u201cmassively concentrated economic power, or state intervention induced by that level of concentration, is incompatible with liberal, constitutional democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She said she was appreciative of the heft of the position, and hoped to lift up different types of journalistic voices and perspectives.\u201cIt\u2019s your job, no matter what stage of leadership, to make sure you are imparting knowledge to younger writers, but also reporting on things especially pertinent in today\u2019s climate with cultural sensitivity,\u201d Ms. Guillaume said.Born to a Chinese mother and Haitian father, both physicians, Ms. Guillaume, 20, said she took an interest in journalism while growing up in Queens. On Sundays, with her mother on hospital duty, her father took her and her younger sister \u2014 along with the weekend edition of The Times \u2014 to a diner for breakfast. As part of the ritual, he would ask his daughters to read columns by David Brooks and Paul Krugman \u201cto get a conservative and a liberal view,\u201d Ms. Guillaume said.\u201cBoth of my parents have a strong emphasis on education and knowing what\u2019s going on in the world around us,\u201d Ms. Guillaume said. \u201cThey were always very encouraging of us to break out of our middle school or high school problems and think about larger forces at play.\u201dBut Ms. Guillaume\u2019s parents did not want her to spend so much time at The Crimson, hoping she would pursue medicine or law. \u201cIt\u2019s the classic immigrant parent narrative,\u201d Ms. Guillaume said.

She cited the author Ta-Nehisi Coates as a role model.At Townsend Harris High School in Queens, Ms. Guillaume edited the literary magazine, The Phoenix, which had a rivalry with the school\u2019s newspaper, The Classic, where her younger sister, Isabelle, now serves as editor in chief.\u201cShe is able to command a room, but also be a really friendly, approachable presence,\u201d said Leah Yared, a senior who has mentored Ms. Guillaume at The Crimson, including discussing coverage and writing articles with her at Tasty Burger on Harvard Square.Ms. Yared, one of the few black women in the paper\u2019s top echelon, helped with the process of choosing the Crimson president this year. The students involved in the Turkey Shoot followed a process that included implicit bias training.\u201cThe Crimson has historically had problems attracting underrepresented minorities and retaining those people,\u201d Ms. Yared said.\u201cOne of the significant reasons that trust in newsrooms has declined is simply because we don\u2019t reflect the audiences we\u2019re trying to reach, which means we\u2019re missing stories,\u201d said Raju Narisetti, a journalism professor at Columbia University.Derek Xiao, the current president of The Crimson, said Ms. Guillaume\u2019s vision to make the paper into a nimbler, more digitally oriented publication, as well as her work as chairwoman of the paper\u2019s diversity and inclusivity committee, made her pitch stand out at \u201c14 P\u201d \u2014 Harvardese for 14 Plympton St., the location of The Crimson\u2019s redbrick offices.\u201cThe Crimson is a volunteer organization, so making people feel like their work is valuable and that they themselves are valuable in this building is important,\u201d Mr. Xiao said.On a recent Sunday night, Ms. Guillaume had been reading a book for her class on mass incarceration and listening to Rihanna when Mr. Xiao and the rest of the Crimson masthead called to tell her she had gotten the job.\u201cI screamed into the phone,\u201d Ms. Guillaume said. \u201cIt was a very, very shrill scream.\u201dMs. Yared told her friend and mentee to brace for an onslaught of attention. \u201cPrepare to be embarrassed,\u201d she texted her.An earlier version of this article misstated the French city in which Kristine E.

{"Headline": "Another N.F.L. Owner Is Gone in a Year That Has Diminished the Old Guard", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro FootballEvery professional sports league is filled with owners who are doers, those who are followers and some silent types who speak up only when they must. In a relatively short period, the N.F.L. has lost a collection of all three types of owners.The five belonged to a fast-diminishing group of owners who were self-made business owners and more often than not came from humble beginnings. They made their fortunes in industries that boomed in the 1960s and 1970s, when they built their empires \u2014 in energy (McNair), car dealerships (Benson), fast-food franchises (Richardson) and home building (Spanos). Only Allen, who started Microsoft with Bill Gates, staked his claim in what might be considered a cutting edge industry.Given how much it costs to buy a team (the Panthers sold for $2.3 billion), it\u2019s hard to imagine many car dealers or fast-food franchisees being able to purchase an N.F.L. team in the future. The league now is increasingly dominated by billionaires capable of paying nine- and even 10-digit sums for teams, not the start-from-scratch entrepreneurs who cobbled together ownership groups.Maybe this is inevitable. In decades past, sporting events were analog affairs. Tickets were printed and sold, sponsors were asked to pay for signs in stadiums and fans turned on their televisions on Sunday afternoons to see their teams play.As the price of sports franchises has skyrocketed, so too have the challenges of running them. Owners these days need to be familiar with concepts like streaming, mobile ticketing and virtual reality, or at least have smart people around them, to understand how the league can continue growing.And to get an adequate return on their huge investments, they need to look for ways to wring money out of their franchises in increasingly complex and controversial ways, like ripping teams out of their communities and taking them to more profitable locations.Yet in varying ways, the departed owners made an imprint on the financial and social behemoth that the N.F.L. has become.Richardson and McNair did more than just bring teams to the Carolinas and to Houston (which lost its Oilers to Tennessee before the Texans were assembled as an expansion team). They were heavyweights in a group that included more than its share of powerful men.McNair was the chairman of the influential finance committee, and Richardson was the only owner to have played in the N.F.L. As veteran owners, they were trusted confidants of Commissioner Roger Goodell. Both played key roles in helping the N.F.L. return to Los Angeles, and at various times were on the compensation committee, which determines how much the commissioner and other top league executives were paid.Benson, an accountant by trade, was another stalwart on the finance committee.Each went about his business differently. McNair rarely shied away from a reporter\u2019s notebook or microphone, using folksy language that was both blunt and charming. Richardson avoided the media spotlight, but spoke with conviction in smaller settings.Allen almost never attended league meetings, but when he did, everyone took note, such as the time he flew to a special session in Houston in 2016 and threw his weight behind the Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who had ambitious plans to build a stadium in Los Angeles.Some of the changes have been subtle. Spanos\u2019s son, Dean, has run the Chargers for years. Gayle Benson, Tom\u2019s widow, has grabbed the reins of the Saints. McNair\u2019s son, Cal, is the Texans\u2019 chairman and chief operating officer, and likely to stay atop the franchise. Allen\u2019s sister, Jody, is in charge of the Seahawks, at least for now.In other ways, real turnover is afoot. Richardson\u2019s departure, amid a league investigation into the accusations against him, reflected a changing environment. So did his replacement. He sold to David Tepper, a hedge fund mogul.Advertisement"}

That was the future Silicon Valley\u2019s greatest claim to fame in the 1920s, when it was a sleepy landscape of fruit orchards and farms far removed from the nation\u2019s industrial might. Seattle was a city of fishing and timber, where a young entrepreneur named Bill Boeing had so few customers for his airplanes that he briefly pivoted to making furniture. The most innovative companies in the world clustered in the ferociously inventive cities of the East and Midwest \u2014 cars in Detroit; cash registers in Dayton, Ohio; light bulbs in Cleveland.The high-tech geography began to flip in the 1950s, as electronics and aerospace boomed. Before the Eisenhower era was over, cities across the country and across the globe had started racing to capture some of the West Coast\u2019s high-tech magic. Silicon Valley and Seattle are now a long way from biplanes and prunes.So what can the new HQ2 city or cities learn from high-tech history?First and foremost: Yes, tech companies are a prize worth chasing. They offer jobs that are well-paying and productive, and attract a highly educated work force. Under the right conditions \u2014 the presence of strong research universities, access to capital and a quality of life that draws people in and keeps them there \u2014 a well-rooted tech community can seed several successive generations of companies, with the entrepreneurs of one era becoming mentors and investors and civic philanthropists in the next.This is what happened in Boston, in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, whose tech scene includes not only Amazon and Microsoft but also a wide variety of spinoff companies, as well as Facebook, Google, Alibaba and Baidu.San Francisco and Seattle were ill prepared for the tech wave that hit in the past decade. Current responses range from the promising but piecemeal (Amazon subsidizing additional city bus service in Seattle) to the impractical and divisive (San Francisco considering a ban on employee cafeterias in new office buildings to force tech workers to patronize local restaurants). Although tech companies and cities often find themselves fiercely opposed in these debates \u2014 most hotly in the recent attempt by Seattle to tax large employers like Amazon to pay for homeless services \u2014 there is some recognition on both sides that the current patterns are unsustainable.This means breaking out of the bubble and redefining the corporate bottom line to include measures that reduce inequality, sustain existing small businesses and protect housing affordability, and, yes, even supporting cities in raising the tax revenue they need.This isn\u2019t an impossible dream. The secret of Silicon Valley wasn\u2019t tax breaks and cheap real estate; it was a postwar era of generous public spending on research and education, as well as on affordable housing and public infrastructure. These investments were designed to help everyone, but they were critical to helping tech flourish.No place or industry rules forever. Ask Detroit, once the most innovative place in America. The new capitals of tech should not take this prosperity for granted.Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Learning to Attack the Cyberattackers Can\u2019t Happen Fast Enough", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 In a technology lab full of graduate students huddled over laptops, Prof. Marios Savvides flipped through photos on a computer screen searching for one full of people whose faces were barely recognizable to the human eye.\u201cHow about a riot?\u201d Professor Savvides asked. He had just come upon an image of police officers wearing helmets and gas masks and rioters covering their mouths and noses with bandannas \u2014 all trying to shield themselves from the tear-gas- and smoke-filled air.Professor Savvides was delighted. It was a perfect example of where, with the facial recognition skills of artificial intelligence, \u201cwe can now recognize a face from very few pixels,\u201d he said.CyLab, which includes the center, was founded in 2003 to expand the boundaries of technology and protect people when that technology \u2014 or the people using it \u2014 poses a threat.Based in the university\u2019s 25,000-square-foot Collaborative Innovation Center, CyLab works in partnership with roughly 20 corporations \u2014 like Boeing, Microsoft and Facebook \u2014 and government agencies to do research and education in internet privacy and security.The subject has become one of the hottest areas of research and training in the United States these days as increasingly sophisticated hackers threaten not only personal computer security but also the operation of everything from banking systems to water purification plants to nuclear arsenals. While the threats mount, the number of people qualified to confront them is far too low, experts say, and educational institutions and government agencies are scrambling to fill the gap.More than 300 researchers and graduate students are working or studying at CyLab this year, making it among the largest cybersecurity training centers in the world. It offers more than 50 courses in security and privacy and has trained more than 75,000 people.Biometrics, the science of using hard-to-mask physical attributes \u2014 like facial characteristics, fingerprints, retinal scans and DNA \u2014 is just one specialty. CyLab is also engaged in broader uses for A.I., cryptography, network security and an array of other cybersecurity skills.One of the first times Professor Savvides and his group used his facial-recognition technology for something besides research was just after the 2015 Boston Marathon bombing. His lab took the blurry, low-resolution, surveillance image of the suspected bomber released by the F.B.I. and, using A.I. technology, reconstructed the image and sent it to the bureau.The next morning, the identity of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of the bombing, was revealed. Professor Savvides doesn\u2019t know whether his reconstruction helped the F.B.I., but \u201cwe were extremely surprised to see the resemblance to Tsarnaev that was constructed from the very low resolution, pixelated face that even our human brain cannot comprehend,\u201d he said.Like fingerprints, each person\u2019s iris is unique; it stays the same as we age, and unlike fingerprints, cannot be scratched or covered up in some way short of removing the eye altogetherAnd fingerprints can\u2019t be taken from a long distance.Then police would know whether the person was driving a stolen car, had a criminal record or was on a terrorist list \u2014 and might be dangerous \u2014 before walking up to the car.It could also help speed up endless security lines at airports. Instead of a human agent taking a passport or a driver\u2019s license and running it through a security check, the irises of travelers could be quickly scanned.Professor Savvides gets annoyed with such talk.\u201cWe all want better computer and human relations \u2014 we\u2019ve craved it for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cBut biometrics and facial recognition are stigmatized by Hollywood.\u201dSome of the CyLab work is focused on the threats that most affect people in their daily lives: password security.\u201cA password that\u2019s long and just slightly complex is stronger than a password that\u2019s very complex but short,\u201d said Mr. Bauer, an associate professor of computer science and electrical and computer engineering.Just changing a few words or adding numbers in a password already used does very little to stop hackers, who can easily try thousands of variations of a password in rapid succession, he said. As everyone has been told repeatedly, the worst thing to do is reuse passwords from different accounts. That may be how many people\u2019s accounts have been hacked.Other research from CyLab has discovered that, contrary to common assumptions, older people are less likely to be a target of phishing than 18- to 25-year-olds, perhaps because younger people are more likely to take risks, said Jason Hong, a professor at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Human-Computer Interaction InstituteMuch of cybersecurity is, as Kathleen Carley, a professor at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s School of Computer Science, put it, \u201cemploying computer techniques to better understand society and employing our knowledge of society to better understand computer techniques.\u201dHer work is social cybersecurity \u2014 that is figuring out how to make social media \u201ca free and open place without undue influence.\u201dIt\u2019s a subject that has become a major societal issue with the suspected Russian hacking of the 2016 election in the United States.Most people, she said, don\u2019t realize the impact of bots, which are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. The role of bots is to convince and direct individuals; it could be for relatively innocuous reasons such as marketing, but increasingly bots are used by organizations or governments to run schemes or sow discord on social media by creating or amplifying an existing conversation, making it more virulent and divisive.The bots exploit how human brains are wired. People hear something repeated over and over, seemingly from many sources, and it soon seems like the truth.\u201cThey are affecting the country\u2019s values and beliefs,\u201d she said.One example, which Professor Carley and her team discovered in 2015, was a bot used to persuade Syrians and those in the Syrian diaspora to go to a website to donate to charity for Syrians.\u201cWe believe it was actually a money-laundering site for ISIS,\u201d she said.In that case, the bots, or botnet, which are bots connected together and controlled as a group, were identified simply through human detection. But A.I. researchers have now created algorithms to identify bots.The one Professor Carley and her team created is called bot-hunter.Perhaps even more insidious are bots that generate and magnify discord on social media, \u201cwarping the information environment,\u201d Professor Carley said, and affecting everything from how people vote to what they buy to how they view others in society.There are relatively few bots compared with real human accounts, but they are so active that their effect is far out of proportion to their size, she said.One popular example is the big role bots played in the civil unrest in Ukraine in 2013 believed to be fomented by the Russians, Professor Carley said.She and others are developing technological fixes, such as using A.I to do automatic fact-checking, to identify bots and to identify posts with abusive language. But, she said, \u201cthe tools are in their infancy,\u201d and technology alone won\u2019t solve this problem \u201cPolicymakers and the public have to be educated,\u201d she said.And while fun, it is also a way to encourage young people to think about a profession they may never have considered before.\u201cThere\u2019s a dramatic shortage of people in cybersecurity,\u201d said Martin Carlisle, a professor and director of academic affairs at Carnegie Mellon who oversees the contest. \u201cAnd we know the vast majority of students have picked their major by the time they get to college.\u201dSo targeting middle- and high-school students, he said, is a way to get them excited about a career in cybersecurity before they\u2019re already in college.This year\u2019s winner? Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, Calif.

{"Headline": "U.S. Declines to Sign Declaration Discouraging Use of Cyberattacks", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Reflecting reluctance by the Trump administration to limit its options for using offensive and defensive cyberweapons, the United States declined on Monday to sign a vaguely worded international call to protect civilians against cyberattacks and discourage digital meddling in elections.The United States was one of only a few Western nations that chose not to sign on to the nonbinding declaration, which was released by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, during the Paris Peace Forum, timed to the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.The declaration, the \u201cParis Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace,\u201d was signed by 51 countries, more than 130 companies and 90 universities and nongovernmental groups, and was the latest in a series of efforts to move toward what some call a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention.\u201dJust as the original Geneva Convention prohibits aiming attacks at civilians, the Paris statement would prohibit \u201cindiscriminate or systemic harm to individuals and critical infrastructure,\u201d such as shutting down an electric grid.It also included a call to \u201cprevent malign interference by foreign actors aimed at undermining electoral processes though malicious cyberactivities.\u201dAll members of the European Union signed the agreement. Australia and Turkey joined the United States in declining.Mr. Macron aimed the accord largely at democracies, which meant that the countries most often accused of conducting state-sponsored attacks \u2014 Russia, China, North Korea and Iran \u2014 did not participate in the process.Israel, which along with the United States conducted the most sophisticated cyberattack in history, the Stuxnet attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program, also declined to sign.The United States did not say why it did not sign the accord, and one diplomat, who would not allow the use of his name because he is not authorized to speak publicly on policy issues, said that it was possible that Washington may sign the principles at a later date.But if past debates over setting norms of behavior for cyberspace are a guide, American officials are leery of any kind of agreement that might make illegal the types of activity \u2014 like espionage, data manipulation or attacks on infrastructure \u2014 that the United States may want to use in a future conflict.Elections are an interesting example. Congress and many others have condemned the 2016 Russian attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the private email accounts of senior officials in Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. But the United States has interfered in foreign elections before, including Italy in the 1940s and Iran and Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s, and some officials say that no American president should be forced to give up that tool if it could prevent a war.Similarly, the Pentagon worries about commitments to avoid using cyberattacks as a prelude to military action. The United States had a secret program, code-named \u201cNitro Zeus,\u201d which called for turning off the power grid in much of Iran if the two countries had found themselves in a conflict over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Such a use of cyberweapons is now a key element in war planning by all of the major world powers.Still, the fact that companies and governments came together on any kind of vision for keeping the internet free of malicious activity was viewed by some key players as a step forward.\u201cMost of the world\u2019s democracies are rallying around the need to protect all democracies from cyberattacks,\u201d said Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, who has been among the most vocal in arguing for a digital Geneva Convention. \u201cYou have to start by building a strong coalition among the democracies themselves.\u201dMuch of the statement of principles calls for restrictions on actions Washington has also condemned in the past: the theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets and industrial designs, and attacks on \u201cthe public core of the internet.\u201dThe United States has indicted Chinese, North Korean, Iranian and Russian hackers for offenses including theft of industrial secrets and for attacking Sony Pictures Entertainment to prevent the distribution of a movie that North Korea found offensive. Nonetheless, the administration\u2019s aversion to international agreements in general may have made it leery of joining the announcement on Monday.Governments were outnumbered by companies and nongovernmental groups as signatories. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and I.B.M. all signed on. Three of the five countries that are part of what is known as the \u201cFive Eyes,\u201d \u2014 the English-speaking victors of World War II who share intelligence information \u2014 also signed: Britain, Canada and New Zealand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It Means to Be \u2018Latinx,\u2019 and What That Means for America", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.For many Latinos, stories like these are all too familiar. In \u201cLatinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,\u201d Ed Morales fills in that blank as well as the long, painful, complex and intersectional struggle for identity that has shaped America\u2019s Latino community. As Morales notes, Latinx is just the latest in a series of terms, from Hispanic to Latino/a and even Latin@, employed to refer to individuals of Latin American heritage in an inclusive way.Morales, an adjunct faculty member at Columbia University who describes his own identity as that of a \u201cracialized person living in a U.S. megacity, who has a somewhat ambiguous phenotypical appearance,\u201d proves refreshingly introspective, weaving enough personal biography into the book to pull the work back from veering too far into inaccessible academic jargon. \u201cIn my own extended family, there is generally a disdain for blackness,\u201d he writes, and tells of his father, who \u201ctraded on Anglo-Americans\u2019 perceptions of his whiteness if it helped him in financial or social transactions, yet sought to avoid complete identification with whiteness when it came to his \u2018real\u2019 identity.\u201dAccording to the 2010 census, there were 55 million Latinos in the United States, and they made up 23 percent of Americans under the age of 18. Today, although Asian-Americans are now growing more quickly in percentage terms, Latinos are still growing fastest numerically. That means the destiny of the United States and the destiny of the Latino community are powerfully intertwined.\u201cThe American identity will never be fixed and final; it will always be in the making,\u201d Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote a quarter century ago in \u201cThe Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society.\u201d While Schlesinger\u2019s observation may be true, it is much easier asserted than accepted.With his boogeyman approach to electoral politics, Donald Trump has deftly exploited anxieties about the impact of America\u2019s changing demographics on our national identity, and no group has been more vilified by Trump for political purposes than Latinos. After declaring in his announcement speech that Mexico was sending rapists and drug runners to our country, months later Trump dismissed questions about the legitimacy of fraud claims against Trump University by insisting that the American-born judge of Mexican descent who was presiding over the case could not do his job right because \u201che\u2019s Mexican!\u201d His administration has been even worse, cruelly separating families apprehended at the Southern border, failing to adequately respond to Hurricane Maria and then dismissing the deaths of 3,000 Puerto Ricans as mere fantasy concocted by political opponents.It is no surprise, then, that the Latino community is widely misperceived and is especially in need today of voices to defend and humanize it. In this way, \u201cLatinx\u201d couldn\u2019t be timelier. For one thing, Morales shatters Americans\u2019 view of the community as monolithic. Although nearly two-thirds of Latinos claim Mexican heritage, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and a growing community of Latinos from Central and South America each have unique cultural and political experiences in the United States.Morales explores these to varying degrees, and, importantly, makes clear that Latinos have been integral to America\u2019s progress for generations, even as they have grappled with relative invisibility, outright rejection of their place in America and internal struggles about their own identity. He reminds us that it was Gonzalo and Fel\u00edcitas M\u00e9ndez, the Mexican-born father and Puerto Rican mother of daughter Sylvia Mendez, who challenged California\u2019s separate and unequal \u201cMexican schools,\u201d winning an appellate court victory in 1946 that paved the way for the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Brown v. Board of Education that struck down racial segregation in schools eight years later.Morales\u2019s writing can be hyperbolic at times. \u201cFor an American economy that has been largely stagnant, the opening of Cuba is a last-ditch opportunity to stave off looming worldwide economic disaster,\u201d he writes of President Obama\u2019s efforts to open up Cuba to American investment. Still, the book\u2019s deep dive into the crosscurrents of Latinx identity is a powerful reminder that, as Americans wrestle with questions about who is and who is not \u201cAmerican\u201d \u2014 and, indeed, questions about what it means to be an American in the 21st century \u2014 the nation can benefit immensely from the robust inclusion and understanding of a community that has spent generations grappling with nearly every facet of its own identity.Julian Castro was the mayor of San Antonio and the secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2017.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Business With No End", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "Where does this strange empire start or stop?Part I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InPart I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InWhere does this strange empire start or stop? Recently, one of my students at Stanford told me a strange story. His parents, who live in Palo Alto, Calif., had been receiving mysterious packages at their house. The packages were all different shapes and sizes but each was addressed to \u201cReturns Department, Valley Fountain LLC.\u201dI looked into it and found that a company called Valley Fountain LLC was indeed listed at his parents\u2019 address. But it also appeared to be listed at 235 Montgomery Street, Suite 350, in downtown San Francisco.There was little pattern or theme to what these Amazon shops sold. They had everything from hemorrhoid cream to desk lamps, and there were varying levels of inventory. On sale at DeepOceanStoreuk (a storefront on Amazon.uk associated with Bropastures LLC), I found a book on industrial electricity, a set of fake facial wounds and a \u201cNo Stress Tech Guide to Microsoft Works 8 & 8.5.\u201d Another storefront called Kingdom Kber, this one on Amazon.de and associated with Agapao LLC, advertised a miniature whale, nail gel and a copy of \u201cUndocumented Immigrants and Higher Education.\u201d When I clicked on these items, though, none of them were currently available. A good number of the storefronts were completely empty.One thing these LLCs had in common was that their registered agent was named Jonathan Park.Even though the packages being sent to my student\u2019s parents\u2019 home were addressed to Valley Fountain LLC, one of the packages had a return label taped to it that indicated it came from an Amazon store called Sendai Book Store. I looked it up and found that it was on several cautionary lists of unauthorized resellers, and had more than 400,000 things for sale. But once again, the offerings seemed chosen at random.I decided to order something: L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick (3 pcs) for $25.63. (I pretended not to see that the same item was listed at $10.74 by another reseller.)  Amazon informed me that the lipstick would come in two weeks; there was no tracking information. In this case, it seemed that Valley Fountain LLC and other companies were posing as traditional retailers \u2014 usually by setting up Amazon storefronts like Sendai Book Store \u2014 and were just reselling items from other Amazon storefronts at inflated prices. It sounds confusing, but ultimately, it\u2019s pretty similar to scalping concert tickets: A middleman makes money by ratcheting up the price.The items in many of the storefronts associated with 235 Montgomery, Suite 350 had an unusually long shipping time and consistently low stock, so it made sense that items purchased from them might be coming from elsewhere.While I waited for my lipstick, I returned to the list of LLCs, and noticed that there was something else that the companies had in common. According to LinkedIn and Facebook, at least a handful of the listed agents were alumni of Olivet University, a Bible college based in California.If Olivet University sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it has been in the news lately. Earlier this year its offices were raided as part of a fraud investigation being conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. As it also happens, here is where the story converged with another of my interests. My boyfriend had worked at Newsweek as an editor for a year. He was let go in April 2017.Newsweek\u2019s journalists also found that their company had offered about $149,000 worth of free advertising in the print magazine to New York\u2019s Dutchess County, where Olivet was turning an abandoned psychiatric hospital into a satellite campus of Olivet University. The deal \u2014 which resulted in 10 full-page ads promoting local tourism and the Hudson Valley Regional Airport \u2014 was facilitated by Marian Rebro, the president of the company overseeing the construction.\u201cOlivet University was not the subject of the visit,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything from the campus.\u201dSeveral of the Newsweek journalists who had worked on the investigation of their company and its relationship with Olivet University were fired earlier this year. A spokesperson for Newsweek Media Group declined to comment. I went to 235 Montgomery Street to check it out, and found a set of locked double doors outfitted with a camera, a blinking light and a card reader. On the building\u2019s directory, Suite 350 was listed as IBPort, Inc.Who could this cosmopolitan shopper be? It\u2019s hard to say.Until recently, Marian Rebro, the president of the Olivet-affiliated management company that is developing the abandoned psychiatric facility in New York, was listed on business websites as the manager of Everymarket Inc. But Mr. Rebro said, in a statement: \u201cI am not the founder of Everymarket.com. I may have advised the company at one point many years ago, but have never been an employee there.\u201d He also said: \u201cI am not, nor have I ever been, a manager or employee of Everymarket.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to see the oddly overpriced Essy Beauty peel-off mask or Asavea hair straightener as a kind of product version of clickbait. After all, what is the experience of clickbait other than realizing we have vastly overpaid, even if only with our attention?News, information and products are simply someone\u2019s inventory.This is what I thought a countless number of times!This has gotten some of the companies listed at 235 Montgomery in trouble.In another legal dispute, from February of this year, Adult Printed Diapers LLC sued Faithfulness LLC, another one of Mr. Park\u2019s companies, for selling \u201cAww So Cute\u201d diapers, which are an Adult Printed Diapers trademark. It\u2019s not clear where Faithfulness LLC got the Adult Printed Diapers diapers, but the lawsuit alleges that Faithfulness LLC\u2019s co-defendant in the lawsuit, Rearz, Inc., made an unauthorized purchase of diaper inventory directly from Adult Printed Diapers\u2019 supplier in Shandong, China.  On a recent visit to Leez, recognizable brands were mixed in with disconcerting objects, like a $59 hat that said \u201cOslo Iceland\u201d on it and something called \u201cGranny Attic Bubble Foam.\u201d Both items appeared to be made by JNG Korea Co. Ltd.Products from Little Martin\u2019s Drawer and Asavea were prominently displayed.A sorry assortment of wooden furniture haunted the second floor, while the third floor remained dark, empty and forbidding; visitors were informed that it is now an event rental space.Business cards displayed at Leez named Chris Liu as the Chief Operation Officer there. Chris Liu\u2019s Linkedin profile lists a previous position in Business Development at IBTimes Australia.Amid all of this, my lipstick arrived! Inside the package was an invoice for $10.75 from \u201cCrispy Beauty,\u201d an unfortunately named Amazon seller that was decidedly not Sendai Book Store, the store on Amazon I paid $25.63 for the lipstick. When I went back to Amazon and generated a return label, the address was for Valley Fountain LLC. I was not prepared for the way a simple question about some mysterious packages would spiral into a dizzying network of Amazon storefronts, web domains and badly written \u201cAbout us\u201d pages. But the more I looked into it, the more it seemed they were being run by a handful of people, each operating in different capacities depending on the needs of the moment. More surreal was how these websites were linked to the physical world. Chris L. also made sure to throw in a plug for the third floor: \u201cThe 3rd floor of the store is open for rent. It\u2019s quite spacious and bright. Good for all kinds of event.\u201d I decided I had to go to the San Francisco store.In what sounds like a thick Eastern European accent, he says that \u201cStevens\u201d is the last name of a man who was in the bookstore business for 60 years. \u201cThis gentleman is actually my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to work a couple years together, and this is in memory of him.\u201d There\u2019s a cut in the video, and then: \u201cHe\u2019s still alive, but this is like a tribute to him. That\u2019s why it is called Stevens Books.\u201d\u201cDo you want to check out those books?\u201d the guy asked. No, I said. I wanted to buy them. \u201cOh!\u201d he said, and then laughed to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2026 we\u2019re not a library.\u201d In an email in response to request for comment, Mr. Volansky wrote \u201cP&J Health anti-snoring devices and Piero Lorenzo wallets are not sold in Stevens Books.\u201d He said he was not the owner, and that the store and the brand were owned by the Stevens Books Group. \u201cI go by my own name, Stevens is a nickname because of Stevens Books,\u201d he wrote.Trying to map the connections between all these entities opens a gaping wormhole. I couldn\u2019t get over the idea that a church might be behind a network of used business books, hair straighteners, and suspiciously priced compression stockings \u2014 sold on Amazon storefronts with names like GiGling EyE, ShopperDooperEU and DAMP store \u2014 all while running a once-venerable American news publication into the ground.Indeed, at some point I began to feel like I was in a dream. Or that I was half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real, the local from the global, a product from a Photoshop image, the sincere from the insincere.Still harder for me to grasp was the total interpenetration of e-commerce and physical space. Standing inside Stevens Books was like being on a stage set for Stevens Books, Stevens Book, Stevens Book Shop, and Stevensbook \u2014 all at the same time. It wasn\u2019t that the bookstore wasn\u2019t real, but rather that it felt reverse-engineered by an online business, or a series of them. Being a human who resides in physical space, my perceptual abilities were overwhelmed. But in some way, even if it was impossible to articulate, I knew that some kind of intersection of Olivet University, Gratia Community Church, IBPort, the Newsweek Media Group, and someone named Stevens was right there with me, among the fidget spinners, in an otherwise unremarkable store in San Francisco.Speaking with Jonathan Park, and reaching out to Olivet, provided some kind of clarification. Mr. Park said: \u201cI currently own and operate several businesses that I started while I was at Olivet,\u201d but added that he does not operate many of the entities that he helped incorporate, and that some entities have been spun off and are not related to him anymore.He said he mentored students, including interns and graduates of Olivet, and helped them set up businesses from time to time: \u201cMy collaboration with Olivet was one of my life\u2019s best experiences because the University and its students have an entrepreneurial spirit and great aspirations. It is truly a privilege to work together with these bright and gifted individuals.\u201d The school and students, he said, \u201cpartnered and envisioned an incubating program similar to those of the leading research universities; including Stanford and Cornell. While Olivet and my businesses are of a different scale than that of Stanford\u2019s and Google\u2019s, this type of collaboration is commonplace today and has proven to be very successful and rewarding for the economy at large. Our results and volumes are not odd, but, I believe, are rather impressive and something to be proud of.\u201dOlivet was more vague in its statement, made through its spokesperson Ronn Torossian. He wrote, in full:\u201cFollowing the legacy of our (late) Honorary Chairman Dr. Ralph D. Winter, Olivet University has always looked for ways to encourage growth in mission frontiers. This influence shaped the founding vision from Dr. Jang, who, as a devout Christian, believes a Biblical worldview can be applied across all varieties of fields. In that same spirit, the University has always been happy to help evangelical business owners, and we\u2019ve had a good working relationship with IBTimes over the years. We are also proud of our business-as-mission network with various entrepreneurs going into the marketplace as part of our ongoing exploration into models about how to best plant churches and expand mission frontiers. We will continue to explore this paradigm. These are challenging times for Christian and secular higher education institutions alike. Olivet is continually learning the best ways to provide high quality education to raise leaders while developing sound and diversified income sources. One model is Stanford University, which derives 85% of its revenues from non-tuition sources including sponsored research. Olivet similarly recognizes the importance of finding new models for supporting education, and therefore the school encourages innovation and entrepreneurship for its student and alumni base. Many of our alumni are successful entrepreneurs in the U.S. and other countries and contribute to and partner with the University by donating, partnering on research projects, providing internship/training opportunities, and in other ways. We will continue promoting these values that have made America into the great country it has become. And we are proud of all our successful alumni and are thankful to all the friends, benefactors and partners of Olivet University.\u201d In the end, I decided to return the lipstick.The alleged schemes include fictitious auditors (named \u201cKaren Smith\u201d and \u201cLynn Chen\u201d) who came complete with their own fictitious emails, phone numbers and websites; networks of corporate bank accounts; and the computer server company, Oikos Networks, that is listed at 22 Cortlandt Street, which also happens to be the address where Olivet Institute, Stevens Books and Christian Media Corporation are all registered.The indictments include charges against Etienne Uzac, a co-owner of IBT (and one of the original founders of International Business Times); William Anderson, an Olivet trustee, former chief executive of Christian Media Corporation (and husband of Yen-Yi Anderson); and John Xiao, Olivet\u2019s finance director and dean of Olivet Business School. The general manager of Oikos is named only as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator.\u201dI wondered about the fate of my overpriced L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick and who, at the New Jersey warehouse, would be there to receive it. I imagined a person sitting surrounded by rejected dinosaur costumes, butane fuel canisters and butt-enhancing creams. Soon they would receive my lipstick, neither a return nor quite a gift, purchased, at one point, from a faraway place called Crispy Beauty. I wondered if they knew their place in this vast and vertiginous network \u2014 if they knew that they were helping to achieve Everymarket\u2019s dream: A dream of being a marketplace \u201coffering practically everything from everywhere for everyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "End Forced Arbitration for Sexual Harassment. Then Do More.", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf tech companies really want to be cutting-edge, they should get rid of the policy in all employment-related disputes. Ms. Gerstein the director of the Project on State and Local Enforcement at the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program.On Nov. 1, more than 20,000 Google employees walked off the job in protest of the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct. A week later, Google capitulated to some of the protesters\u2019 key demands and announced the end to forced arbitration for its employees in relation to sexual harassment and assault claims. The very next day, Facebook followed suit with regard to sexual harassment claims. Microsoft, Uber and Lyft have taken similar steps in the past year.Technology companies pride themselves on their cutting-edge, visionary nature. Now that they\u2019ve taken the first step, here\u2019s an opportunity for them to be early adopters, and national leaders, by making an even more impactful move: ending forced arbitration in relation to all employment-related disputes, not just sexual harassment. And given the extensive reach of these companies through their multitude of contractors, they should prohibit their contractors from forcing employees into arbitration, as well.Of course, workplace violations of different types are often intertwined: The same employers that permit or perpetrate sexual harassment also commit a host of other violations \u2014 underpaying workers, discriminating in other ways or preventing workers from organizing. A case I handled long ago captures this. A group of women who worked for a dry cleaner came to our office because they were underpaid, working 56 hours a week for subminimum wages and no overtime.As I investigated, I quickly learned how interrelated their problems were. The women, who were Latina, were paid less than their male co-workers. All of the Latino workers, male and female, made less than their non-Latino counterparts. No one made enough to live on, and everyone there was surely exposed to highly toxic chemicals. Over repeated meetings, another story also emerged: The boss routinely made leering comments to the women workers, told them to wear short skirts and, as I later learned, had sex with one of them in a La Guardia Airport hotel \u2014 consensually, he insisted. When I questioned him in sworn testimony about his behavior toward his female employees, he said, \u201cSpanish women like it.\u201dHow do you tease apart the sexism, racism and economic exploitation in this situation? You can\u2019t. They\u2019re inseparable. What brought the women to our office was their unlawfully low pay. But this was partly a result of discrimination against them based on their sex and national origin, and from an even broader viewpoint, it was a result of their lack of power or a voice on the job.So why would it make sense to end forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment only? Why should any company still block people from filing in court when they\u2019re racially harassed or underpaid or paid less because of their national origin? All are offenses against human dignity, and in all of these cases, there is the same tremendous power differential that makes it so hard for people to speak up.The workers who walked out at Google have lives very distinct from the immigrant women who spend their days pressing clothes. But at the root of sexual harassment, or any kind of workplace abuse, is abuse of power. Even a Hollywood legend like Gwyneth Paltrow didn\u2019t speak up about Harvey Weinstein because she thought she would be fired.Even if these companies stop using forced arbitration, their workers will still have plenty of reasons not to speak up: fear of retaliation (even though it\u2019s illegal), fear of being blacklisted, difficulty finding a lawyer to take the case. And with President Trump remaking the judiciary in his image, federal court may soon not be such a great option, either. But at the very least, working people should have the chance to have their day, together, in court.By ending forced arbitration only in cases of sexual harassment, Google, Facebook and their fellow technology companies have responded to public pressure, to the day\u2019s news cycle. But it\u2019s time to be proactive, not just reactive. There\u2019s no logic to ending forced arbitration for sexual harassment only and leaving it intact for so much else.In the end, the most compelling reason for a company to foist arbitration on its work force is to avoid liability and public exposure that might result from a court case. But if a company wants to avoid liability, blocking workers from court isn\u2019t the best way to do that. The answer is to create a fair and lawful workplace, the best possible workplace, for everyone who contributes to a company\u2019s success and to give workers a voice. That, and not a new phone or new app, is the kind of vision and disruption we need more of.Terri Gerstein is the director of the Project on State and Local Enforcement at the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Already Email Like a Robot \u2014 Why Not Automate It?", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyIn 1996, Microsoft unleashed Clippit, better known as Clippy, on users of Microsoft Office. The legendarily irritating mascot-helper spent the following years hovering around the edges of documents, blinking dumbly under his lascivious eyebrows and blurting out, \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re writing a letter,\u201d until he was sidelined by the company in 2001, officially recognized as a mistake. Clippy\u2019s problems were manifold. He announced his presence, via a personified avatar, to tell us something that we already knew (or that should have been obvious in the first place) and then proudly offered us little in the way of actual help. He sat and watched us and learned nothing, and repeated himself. He said too much and did too little.Nevertheless, over 20 years later, the spawn of Clippy are hiding everywhere, guessing what we\u2019re trying to do and offering to help. But Clippy\u2019s successors are doing their best to avoid his mistakes. Most of the time they are faceless, and if they speak, they do so in a disembodied but humanlike voice. They tend to wait to be asked for help, rather than telling us what they think they know unprompted. And when they do offer help, they tend to be more subtle, more accurate or both. They have perhaps more in common with Clippy\u2019s unassuming partners, like Spelling and Grammar Check or AutoCorrect, which spoke through red underlines or small actions carried out on reasonable assumptions (who would intentionally type \u201cteh\u201d?). These tools have followed us and our clumsy fingers to our new smartphones, where they have become both more assertive and more useful, correcting us and only occasionally requiring us to correct them back, and learning all the while.What does the tech industry want to assist us with now? Email. If you use Gmail, you\u2019ve probably interacted with either Smart Reply or Smart Compose, whether or not you know them by name. Google introduced Smart Reply in 2015, and Smart Compose began rolling out this year. Both, in execution, are self-explanatory. Smart Reply suggests canned responses to inbound emails, based on the company\u2019s best guess at what most emailers might be about to type. The suggestions are short, peppy and often adequate, at least as a start. Sometimes their tone prompts unhappy realizations about what Gmail sees in us. The frequency with which they use exclamation marks emphasizes just how peculiar the language of professional email communication has become (\u201cSounds great!\u201d \u201cVery cool!\u201d \u201cLove it!\u201d). Smart Compose, in contrast, offers word and phrase suggestions, based on similar judgments, as the user types in real time. You write \u201cTake a look,\u201d and ghostly text might appear to its right: \u201cand let me know what you think.\u201d Its assumptions are more personalized, and they feel that way because it is constantly, visibly, guessing what you\u2019re thinking.Smart Compose and Smart Reply are, at their core, artificial-intelligence technologies: They are programmed to perform tasks, but also to adapt. To start, Smart Reply was trained on publicly available bodies of email text. (Among the most widely used for such projects is the cache of some 500,000 emails collected during the discovery phase of the Enron investigation.) \u201cWhat makes machine learning different from regular programming is you look at corpuses of data to make guesses about things,\u201d says Paul Lambert, a product manager for Gmail. \u201cYou create a model.\u201dOnce that model was trained to deal with some of the more obvious idiosyncrasies of email communications \u2014 corporate disclaimers and phrases like \u201cSent from Outlook\u201d \u2014 Google began training it on anonymized text from actual Gmail users. Phrases that appear frequently enough come under consideration for inclusion in Smart Reply. This, too, requires cleanup. Early testers reported seeing \u201cI love you\u201d as a suggested response to work emails.Armed with this catalog of phrases \u2014 currently more than 20,000, according to the company \u2014 the model can then start incorporating more contextual clues: What was the subject of the email? Is the email asking a question? Is it expressing a happy sentiment, or is it offering condolences? Phrases are scored based on their utility \u2014 how much typing they save, basically \u2014 as well as the A.I.\u2019s confidence in the prediction.Both features then take into account how people use them. If, for example, it suggests a certain completion, and enough users take it, that one will be more likely to appear in the future. If a canned reply is never used, this is a signal that it should be purged; if it is frequently used, it will show up more often. This could, in theory, create feedback loops: common phrases becoming more common as they\u2019re offered back to users, winning a sort of election for the best way to say \u201cO.K.\u201d with polite verbosity, and even training users, A.I.-like, to use them elsewhere. Such a dynamic would take root only where a behavior is already substantially automated \u2014 typed, at work, more as a learned performance rather than as an expression of will, or even an idea. Smart Compose is, in other words, good at isolating the ways we\u2019ve already been programmed \u2014 by work, by social convention, by communication tools \u2014 and taking them off our hands.Using these features is a bit like minding a machine that is trying to learn how to do what you do for a living. And even if it\u2019s the part of the job you wish you didn\u2019t have to do, it still prompts uncomfortable thoughts of replacement \u2014 or, if not replacement, then something close to it. It is not remotely implausible that in the near future, a tremendous amount of communication could be conducted in tandem with an A.I.But constant sweeping changes in office communication \u2014 from speaking and writing to phones and printing to emailing and instant messaging \u2014 do not tell a tidy tale of increased efficiency or decreased workload, even as they represent progress. Already, an undefined but undeniable portion of workplace email amounts to human self-automation: an uncanny form of communication where clich\u00e9s aren\u2019t shunned so much as recognized for their usefulness; where a tone of polite enthusiasm is taken to its exclamatory extreme to mash any ambivalence you may have about, say, \u201ccircling back later.\u201d One can visualize in the near future hundred-email chains between colleagues unfurling from a single human starting point, composed of nothing but routinized replies.Depending on what your current inbox looks like, this might not require much imagination at all. A study conducted in 2016 by researchers at Carleton University\u2019s Sprott School of Business in Canada tried to understand the role email had come to play in the modern office. They surveyed \u201chighly educated baby boomer or Gen X\u201d subjects who were mostly \u201cmanagers or professionals\u201d working in office jobs and found that they spend on average a full third of their workweeks \u201cprocessing\u201d email. Whatever their titles, they are \u2014 like many office workers \u2014 to a large extent professional emailers. Even if their roles are otherwise highly specialized, in this significant way they are not. They are their own assistants.In 1930, John Maynard Keynes wrote that, thanks to new efficiencies, workers of the future could expect \u201cthree-hour shifts or a 15-hour week.\u201d He guessed that this would happen within a century. Automation and the abundance it produced has indeed led to countless economic changes, but it did not negate or replace the entire order. Asked for evidence of the success of this newest tool, Google says that Smart Compose is already \u201csaving people a billion characters of typing each week.\u201d This statistic supports one half of what Keynes might have predicted at the dawn of automated communication \u2014 the abundance and the glut \u2014 but is tellingly silent on the other half, the same half he couldn\u2019t quite see the first time. Self-automation can free us only to the extent that it actually belongs to us. We can be sure of only one thing that will result from automating email: It will create more of it.Advertisement"}

They pop up on your computer screen with ominous warnings like, \u201cYour computer has been infected with a virus. Call our toll-free number immediately for help.\u201dOften they look like alerts from Microsoft, Apple or Symantec. Sometimes the warning comes in a phone call.Most people ignore these entreaties, which are invariably scams. But one in five recipients actually talks to the fake tech-support centers, and 6 percent ultimately pay the operators to \u201cfix\u201d the nonexistent problem, according to recent consumer surveys by Microsoft.Law enforcement authorities, working with Microsoft, have now traced many of these boiler rooms to New Delhi, India\u2019s capital and a hub of the global call-center industry. On Tuesday and Wednesday, police from two Delhi suburbs raided 16 fake tech-support centers and arrested about three dozen people. Last month, the Delhi authorities arrested 24 people in similar raids on 10 call centers.In Gautam Budh Nagar, one of the suburbs, 50 police officers swept into eight centers on Tuesday night. Ajay Pal Sharma, the senior superintendent of police there, said the scammers had extracted money from thousands of victims, most of whom were American or Canadian.\u201cThe modus operandi was to send a pop-up on people\u2019s systems using a fake Microsoft logo,\u201d Mr. Sharma said. After the victims contacted the call center, the operator, pretending to be a Microsoft employee, would tell them that their system had been hacked or attacked by a virus. The victims would then be offered a package of services ranging from $99 to $1,000 to fix the problem, he said.Such scams are widespread, said Courtney Gregoire, an assistant general counsel in Microsoft\u2019s digital crimes unit.Microsoft, whose Windows software runs most personal computers, gets 11,000 or so complaints about the scams every month, she said, and its internet monitors spot about 150,000 pop-up ads for the services every day. The company\u2019s own tech-support forums, where people can publicly post items, also see a steady stream of posts offering fake tech-support services.\u201cThe success of the legitimate industry has made it easier for the illegitimate industry there,\u201d Ms. Gregoire said. As in any con, experience helps. \u201cYou have to convince them they have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to have the touch.\u201dFor tech companies, combating the impersonators is complicated by the fact that many legitimate tech-support operations, including some of Microsoft\u2019s, operate from India.Najmeh Miramirkhani, lead author of the research paper, said the network of entities involved in the scams was complex, with some making their own calls and others running the sites but outsourcing the calls to India. Many of the scammers also share data with one another.\u201cThis is an organized crime,\u201d she said.Microsoft said it was working with other tech industry leaders such as Apple and Google, as well as law enforcement, to fight the scourge, which is migrating beyond the English-speaking world to target other users in their local languages. In the 16 countries surveyed by Microsoft, people in India and China were the most likely to pay the con artists.Mr. Sharma said that in a similar con broken up by his department, call-center agents had impersonated Canadian tax authorities.Like the I.R.S., Microsoft and other legitimate technology companies do not call their users out of the blue. Nor do they send security alerts to the screen telling customers to call them.Ms. Miramirkhani had some simple advice to avoid being conned: Don\u2019t pick up the phone.Vindu Goel reported from Mumbai, and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

The S&P 500 fell 2 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.3 percent.Apple\u2019s stumble seemed to weigh on other previously high-flying technology companies.

Worried about rising interest rates, trade tensions and a potential peak in corporate profits, investors briefly pushed the broader market down nearly 10 percent below its late-September peak and into negative territory for the year.More recently, stocks had regained much of that ground. Wall Street jumped after last Tuesday\u2019s contentious midterm elections were resolved, with the S&P 500 finishing the next day up more than 3.5 percent.Monday\u2019s pain wasn\u2019t exclusively due to tech stocks.General Electric\u2019s stock fell 6.9 percent in its fourth straight decline after comments by its new chief executive failed to calm investors\u2019 worries.But Apple remains a key concern.

{"Headline": "Manufacturers Remain Slow to Recognize Cybersecurity Risks", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhether they come from ransomware, phishing or more arcane, highly sophisticated means, manufacturers are increasingly vulnerable to attacks that can shut down production and have ramifications throughout a supply chain.And it is not just the giants that get hacked; external threats can be agnostic, affecting manufacturers regardless of size.But the company was lucky. A full recovery took only a few days, and while initially it seemed that third-quarter revenue would be off by 2 percent, Elizabeth Sun, a company spokeswoman, said in an email that the revenues did not suffer because Taiwan Semiconductor fulfilled some of the delayed orders, while \u201cincreases in demand in other areas\u201d helped to offset the losses.Mondelez International and Merck suffered much more significant losses after the 2017 Notpetya attack, although they described them differently in filings.Unlike Taiwan Semiconductor, neither Merck nor Mondelez described how the malware infected their operations.While manufacturers weren\u2019t traditionally at risk when hackers sought troves of individual data that could be sold for financial gain, motives have become more complex.Some using ransomware hope to extort money \u2014 sometimes in the form of cryptocurrencies \u2014 from companies whose systems are shut down. Others seek to steal intellectual property \u2014 a host of trade secrets including patent information and formulas, as well as blueprints and schematics.Irrespective of method or motive, the costs can be high, whether resulting from the ransom demands or the ensuing business disruption. Michael Tanenbaum an executive vice president of insurer Chubb, said attacks \u201chave gone from being a nuisance to significant, with some demands exceeding seven figures.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t need to be that way, Mr. Siebel said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can do with off-the-shelf cybersecurity products. Ninety percent of penetration can be stopped with fundamental practices that most people aren\u2019t following, like employee training, two-factor authorization, changing passwords and fixing USB ports so they can\u2019t download.\u201dThe vulnerabilities run from the mundane to the high-tech. Despite training and repeated warnings, employees still open phishing emails that can disrupt a company. Mr. Tanenbaum said that, according to a Chubb index, 50 percent of manufacturing losses in 2018 had resulted from phishing attacks or those known as \u201cspear phishing,\u201d which used some specific information to trick the recipient.\u201cIt means that individuals are clicking on links more readily in manufacturing than other industries,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can cause real harm.\u201dBut there\u2019s much more. A manufacturer\u2019s exposure exists throughout a facility. Rare is the employee who punches a clock at the beginning of the day; instead, workers log in with passwords or biometrics.The vulnerabilities can be surprisingly simple and can emanate even from outdated equipment. John Reed Stark, president of John Reed Stark Consulting, a cybersecurity advisory firm, said a company, could, for example, have an old printer remain on a network even if it\u2019s not used. A hacker could, through a phishing scheme, pick up the administrative passwords and then gain network access through the obsolete, but still connected printer. \u201cAnd it can be difficult to know exactly what\u2019s been exfiltrated \u2014 or stolen \u2014 from the network.\u201dSo-called ntracontrol systems can connect aging as well as newer equipment, and frequently it\u2019s difficult to shut some down without disrupting production. But if a manufacturer doesn\u2019t take equipment offline to update security, there\u2019s a risk that a ransomware attack, for example, could take an entire production line down, Mr. Tanenbaum explained.The growth of the Internet of Things \u2014 the direct connecting and communicating of disparate pieces of equipment \u2014 makes the potential for abuse even worse. While it is not yet considered an immediate concern, as hackers develop more sophisticated methods, the exposure could grow exponentially.\u201cManufacturing equipment is getting smarter, and we\u2019re now moving into the information technology world in the manufacturing space,\u201d said Manesh Patel, the senior vice president and chief information officer of the Sanmina Corporation, a Fortune 500 maker of optical, electronic and mechanical products based in San Jose, Calif. Many I.T. organizations, he added, focus on operations such as human resources, but still aren\u2019t as well connected to the manufacturing side of the business.While comparing information seems at odds with companies that often compete, Mr. Patel, for one, stressed the importance of superior cybersecurity measures over a perceived competitive advantage.Mr. Patel, who said his company\u2019s investment in cybersecurity measures has \u201cincreased 100 percent over the past three years,\u201d also recommended segmenting, which means keeping systems on a network separate from each other. This can permit vendors to regularly update its equipment without having access to other parts of the system.Segmenting, he explained, secures a network so that it is not exposed to a potential breach from the vendor. It\u2019s a relatively new area and if done incorrectly, can cause its own headaches. \u201cWe\u2019re at the early stages of getting the grips of it.\u201dMr. Siebel has also asked known hackers to test his system by trying to infiltrate it. \u201cWe have hackers beating up our systems, and so far only one guy has gotten through, and we paid him a reward. He found a vulnerability, and we fixed it.Another approach is to adopt something called whitelisting. For years, Mr. Patel said, most companies had software that excluded known viruses, essentially blacklisting potential problems. But that was too reactive and sometimes exposed systems to unknown attackers. Now, he said, the better approach is to whitelist \u2014 that is specify approved software applications that are permitted to be active on a computer system. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly become one of the most important types of defenses.\u201dManufacturers also need to know the precautions that others \u2014 whether suppliers or customers \u2014 are taking, especially as they have increased access to equipment.\u201cYou are only as strong as your weakest link,\u201d Mr. Stark said. \u201cHackers will find that weakest link and can break in and attack others in the supply chain. Companies are connected in ways that are extremely complex, and anyone in the supply chain can be vulnerable and could be the source of an attack.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Google\u2019s top leaders were skeptical, but they told him that he could go ahead if he could find 15 \u201cGoogle-worthy\u201d software developers in the city.\u201cThe attitude was that pretty much all the good software engineers were in Silicon Valley,\u201d Mr. Nevill-Manning recalled. \u201cIt seems crazy in retrospect.\u201dMr. Nevill-Manning found his developers and opened the engineering office in New York. Today, Google employs 7,000 people in the city, and more than half are engineers and technical staff.[Do you live or work near Amazon\u2019s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]\u201cThis solidifies New York\u2019s importance and significance in tech,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the dean of New York\u2019s venture capital community and co-founder of Union Square Ventures.Amazon, like most big tech companies, is no stranger to New York. It already has over 2,000 workers in New York, from e-commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers.Facebook has over 2,000 New York employees, including Yann LeCun, its chief artificial intelligence scientist and a pioneer in the field. Salesforce employs more than 1,000 at its new offices in New York. And tech stalwart IBM chose the city as the headquarters for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Most technology work in New York has traditionally been in service of other industries. That market, too, is growing briskly as banks, retailers, advertising and consulting firms \u2014 major employers in New York \u2014 are all getting digital makeovers and hiring. Goldman Sachs, for example, employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including data analysts, app developers, digital security and blockchain experts. Manuela Veloso, head of the machine-learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, joined JPMorgan Chase this year to lead its A.I. research team.The five companies with the most tech-related job listings in New York over the last three months on Indeed.com, the jobs listing site, are Amazon, BNY Mellon, Capgemini, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.Measurements of tech sector jobs vary, depending on definitions. But the broad picture is a growing labor market for well-paying jobs. From 2010 to 2017, according to government statistics, tech sector employment grew by 53,000 in the city, or 65 percent, to an estimated 134,700. And the average salary of $147,300 in 2016, the most recent estimate available, was far higher than the citywide average of $89,100 for all private employers.Types of tech jobs in New York City, 2016Manufacturing15%TelecommunicationsIncludes internet serviceproviders like Verizon22Internet-relatedIncludes Google andsimilar companies48Computer systems design12OtherTypes of tech jobs in New York City, 2016Manufacturing15%TelecommunicationsIncludes internet serviceproviders like Verizon22Internet-relatedIncludes Google andsimilar companies48Computer systems design12OtherSource: Office of the New York State ComptrollerBy The New York TimesThe Bay Area, to be sure, remains the nation\u2019s high-tech epicenter. New York is growing impressively, but its tech work force, according to most analyses, is less than half and perhaps one-third that of the Bay Area.But the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Silicon Valley, took in $12.8 billion. Start-ups in the Washington, D.C. region, where Amazon plans to put another large headquarters, received $575 million in the third quarter.In the past, New York start-ups typically sold out to larger tech companies. That, too, is changing. Mr. Wilson, the venture capitalist, pointed to MongoDB, a database supplier, and Etsy, an e-commerce seller, as examples of start-ups that held out and went public in recent years.MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share.\u201cNew York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.The rise of New York\u2019s tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education \u2014 a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city\u2019s work force, whose progress enhanced New York\u2019s appeal to Amazon.After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition.The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazon\u2019s board.For technologists who have recently come to New York, part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked: New York\u2019s huge and diverse economy, and its culture.\u201cEverything is tech-driven on the West Coast,\u201d said Jeannette Wing, who left Microsoft Research last year to become the director of Columbia\u2019s Data Science Institute. \u201cBut the East Coast is more well rounded. It is about technology, but not just technology for its own sake.\u201dKeith Collins contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Google employs around 7,000 in New York, and a space that size could allow it to more than double its local work force.Amazon\u2019s so-called HQ2 effort, a search for a second corporate headquarters outside of Seattle, has dragged on for about a year. Many were surprised when word leaked last week that the e-commerce company could end up with two new big offices instead of one. The other would be in Northern Virginia, outside of Washington.Google opened its first office in New York 18 years ago, but the company\u2019s ever-expanding work force has driven demand for larger offices and more staffing in the city.In March, Google spent $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices. The Chelsea office is Google\u2019s main workplace in the city, housing product and business teams for web search, ads and sales. A Google spokeswoman said it was also planning to add an additional 320,000 square feet of space with the redevelopment of Pier 57.The search for local real estate is part of a general expansion in the United States for Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Last month, Alphabet said it had hired 9,000 employees in the United States this year, raising its total to 94,372 as of September. That was an increase of more than 16,000 from a year earlier.St. John\u2019s Terminal is being developed in Hudson Square by Oxford Properties, a Toronto-based developer. The 12-story building will incorporate a former freight terminal for the High Line and showcases rail beds as a central design feature.As tech companies expand in New York, they are likely to compete with Wall Street for engineering talent.New York has always had a significant technology industry of its own, though it has been dwarfed by the financial industry. For years, the city has ranked second or third among communities in the United States in total tech venture capital investment \u2014 with Silicon Valley and its surrounding area far and away the leader.But one thing the city has not been able to claim in a long time is a technology powerhouse of its own. The closest home of a tech heavyweight is Armonk, N.Y, about 40 miles away, where IBM is based. (IBM also has major offices in Manhattan.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Games Are a Waste of Time? Not for Those With E-sports Scholarships", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind a glass partition at the Microsoft store at the Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island, 10 teenage boys settled into seats in a rectangular formation. Each sat behind a laptop computer, ears warmed by a bulky headset.Parents and grandparents circled the room, peering over shoulders at screens. One mother used her iPhone to live-stream to social media.The room had the feel of a sporting event, and it was \u2014 a group of competitive video gamers on the Bay Shore High School e-sports team were competing in a scrimmage and playing their way toward college scholarships.In higher education, e-sports live in various departments. Sometimes they are part of student affairs; some schools place them within an engineering or design program; and, more rarely, they have their place in athletics.\u201cThe games that are competitively viable in the collegiate sphere have real depth, have deep levels of strategy, and require strategic teamwork and require real mastery to be successful \u2014 and not just by yourself, within a team environment and through using tactics,\u201d said Kurt Melcher, who runs the program at Robert Morris.A few years out of college, Mr. Melcher was the soccer coach and associate athletic director for Robert Morris By 2013, he noticed a college community emerging. Students were organizing themselves, creating their own opportunities for gaming. So he took a proposal to the university administration: What if game play were an athletic endeavor?\u201cIf you look at sports, how do you define what is more of a sport? Is football more of a sport than men\u2019s tennis or women\u2019s tennis, and is golf more or less of a sport than hockey?\u201d he said.Today, almost 90 Robert Morris students play, and about 80 of them receive e-sports scholarships, Mr. Melcher said. Varsity-level players can receive scholarships that cover up to 70 percent of their tuition; reserve players receive 35 percent tuition coverage.E-sports players at U.C.I. devote 15 to 20 hours a week to the sport, Mr. Deppe said. Players scrimmage other teams, watch Video on Demand footage to evaluate performance, participate in team meetings, sit for biweekly sessions with a team psychologist and work out once a week with a personal trainer. The physical workout is e-sports-inspired: aside from general cardio, routines emphasize strengthening core muscles, arms, shoulders and wrists.\u201cThere\u2019s discipline involved, there\u2019s practice involved, there\u2019s teamwork and collaboration involved, but also the physical aspect,\u201d said Mark Candella, known as Garvey, the director of strategic partnerships for the streaming platform Twitch. \u201cThese young people can do up to 360 controlled precise actions per minute. Their fingers and hands and their eyes move so quickly in exact coordination.\u201dOrganized competitive gaming on both the high school and university levels lives in purposeful defiance of the gamer stereotype: as Mr. Melcher said, \u201ca kid locked in a basement, antisocial, angry, drinks 50 Mountain Dews and doesn\u2019t sort of become a valuable person in society.\u201d In the educational sphere, game play often brings students out of basements and bedrooms.At Bay Shore High School, Ryan Champlin, a senior, started the team with the help of his father, Chris; younger brother, Kyle; and computer teacher, Mike Masino. The team is part of the school\u2019s computer club.Unlike traditional sports, e-sports recruitment is complicated by the nature of online gaming. Players are identified on leader boards only by user names. Details like age, gender and location are not listed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if they\u2019re 12 years old or 30 years old,\u201d said Mr. Deppe of the University of California. \u201cPeople have to kind of reveal themselves to schools and groups.\u201dMany players create online profiles through universities or organizations like the high school league so that schools might find those students who both meet academic requirements and play the desired positions on their high school teams.\u201cThe last thing you want to do is you spend a lot of time talking to a person in game, only to realize that they\u2019re a 50-year-old doctor in Cambodia,\u201d Mr. Brooks said.Generally, recruiters look for high school juniors and seniors, Mr. Brooks said. The industry is in its infancy and changes quickly \u2014 by the time middle school students are ready for college, the games they are playing might not even exist.The Silicon Valley school is offering \u201calmost a full ride,\u201d Ryan said, in the form of an athletics scholarship for e-sports and a leadership scholarship that would make him assistant director of the e-sports program.\u201cThe same scholarship if I was playing football or lacrosse,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Commonality of A.I. and Diversity", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow to create more diverse workplaces and how to use artificial intelligence ethically are among the more challenging dilemmas facing business and government.These topics were the subject of two separate task forces that met at last week\u2019s DealBook conference. Each task force, composed of about a dozen experts and industry leaders, met for an hour, emerging with some specific guidelines and focus areas that were shared with the conference and could be taken back to companies and other organizations for discussion.Companies must be aware of and recognize that algorithms are not neutral, but created by humans with biases and beliefs and make every effort to eliminate those biases.It is far too easy to assume that technology has an objectivity that humans don\u2019t. But the reality is that \u201cartificial intelligence and machine learning and algorithms in general are designed by none other than us \u2014 people,\u201d said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School.\u201cA.I. takes input data and races off to make inference and decision making about the world at lightening pace,\u201d he said, and those inferences will include unacknowledged biases unless people are willing to recognize them and invest the time and money to weed them out.Frida Polli, co-founder and chief executive of Pymetrics, which uses A.I. to recruit employees for companies, showed how biases could arise and how they could be diminished.Algorithms used in A.I. are created using training data sets. If a training data has an overrepresentation of any gender or ethnicity, the features that distinguish that group may be overweighted.To confront the problem, she said her company tested an algorithm on a reference group of people of different genders and ethnicities to check for bias. If there\u2019s an imbalance in the test run \u2014 far more men, for example, or whites are predicted to be good hires rather than women or other races \u2014 then \u201cwe can look at de-weighting features,\u201d she said, that alter the algorithm.Technology companies can and should help the government \u2014 and the military in particular \u2014 develop and use artificial intelligence, but it must be done thoughtfully and carefully.\u201cThe debate is ongoing about when and how to share technology with the government and specifically should companies share digital technology with the military,\u201d said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft.Most of the task force agreed that partnerships between technology companies and government on A.I. could be beneficial, but Serkan Piantino, founder and chief executive of Spell, a company that builds tools for those building A.I. technology, said there should be limits.\u201cAutomating the process to use lethal force is something I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable doing, given how little we know with what is going on with A.I. algorithms,\u201d he said.A.I. requires transparency within the companies building and using it and with the public.Having company employees debate and speak out on potentially controversial issues involving A.I. \u2014 such as at Microsoft \u2014 is one form of transparency. Dennis Crowley, co-founder and executive chairman of Foursquare, said his company had internal discussions when making business decisions that might have ethical implications.\u201cSometimes we have the opportunity to create more evil than good, and we need to talk about that,\u201d he said. One example, he said, was whether his company would work with fast-food chains that wanted to target those using cannabis dispensaries where it was legal. It hadn\u2019t been done before.\u201cThis was right on the edge, so we went to the ethics committee,\u201d Mr. Crowley said. In the end, \u201cwe decided to do the campaign. It was legal and clever and a good use of technology around a category where we don\u2019t see a lot of advertising.\u201dCordell Schachter, the chief technology officer for the New York City Transportation Department, noted that transparency would be crucial with those creating the city\u2019s future transportation technology, which would be driven by A.I.\u201cWe want to see the data \u2014 and not cherry-picked data \u2014 before it goes on the streets,\u201d he said.Companies should set targets and goals, along with incentives, as a way to foster a more diverse staff, but they shouldn\u2019t be used in a vacuum.\u201cAspirational goals are important, but \u201c it\u2019s just not enough,\u201d said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say you want to get the world or your company to 50-50 \u2014 there needs to be transparency around that.\u201dThat means what specifically is the goal, and what is the company doing to achieve that goal \u2014 \u201cboth good and bad,\u201d she said.\u201cThere is a growing body of evidence that suggests cognitive diversity contributes to better decision making at the board level,\u201d said Cyrus Taraporevala, president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. \u201cStudies show that diverse boards pay more attention to risk management and are less susceptible to cronyism and group think.\u201dBut there\u2019s a danger that goals become items to be checked rather than real change. Damien Hooper-Campbell, chief diversity officer at eBay, said that while setting goals and targets for diversity was important \u2014 and backing it up with real costs, such as bonus deductions, if the goals aren\u2019t met \u2014 you also have to \u201cmeet a company where it is.\u201dIf a company has just begun to focus on diversifying its work force, it needs to be educated on how to do it over time, he said. \u201cPeople talk about how businesses measure widgets and productivity, so they can measure this, too. But there\u2019s a big difference between widgets and human beings.\u201dFederal policies and legislation can play a role in promoting diversity in the workplace.Developing laws and policy to create diversity is not always a popular idea, but some say they believe that there are areas where government can help. John Hope Bryant, founder and chairman of Operation HOPE, a community organization, said there was a need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships. When the effort is aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get double credit for that double reach.\u201dA federal policy to encourage paid family leave would also play a crucial role in promoting diversity, said Sallie Krawcheck, chief executive and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial adviser for women.Federal policy could also help ensure that the information companies report on the makeup of their work forces and the compensation are truly transparent. For example, in Britain, many public-, private- and voluntary-sector companies are required to disclose average pay for men and women, including bonuses.In the United States, said Lauren Taylor Wolfe, managing partner of Impactive Capital, \u201ca lot of companies decide what they disclose and what not to disclose. If it\u2019s not done by level, it\u2019s not real transparency.\u201dTo be truly diverse and inclusive, a company must change its culture \u2014 and that has to come from the top down.\u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it, it will be an organ reject,\u201d said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase.Or as Ms. Taylor Wolfe noted, \u201ccompanies get what they celebrate, and if they celebrate diversity, they\u2019ll get it.\u201dNo one expects cultural change to happen quickly, but one of the important elements, Ms. Duckett said, is that bosses need to \u201cmanage to the difference.\u201d Don\u2019t manage everyone the same and expect the same results.After all, parents don\u2019t expect each child to be the same \u2014 they parent differently depending on a child\u2019s personality, strengths and weaknesses, she said. Managers have to do the same.She also noted that diversity was not the same as inclusion and companies must be aware of that. \u201cDiversity,\u201d she said, \u201cis being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance.\u201dFinally, change may seem glacially slow, but Mr. Hooper-Campbell said people shouldn\u2019t be surprised. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t but 100 years ago that I couldn\u2019t go to school with some of the people in this room.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "WeWork\u2019s Rise: How a Sublet Start-Up Is Taking Over", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookCritics have derided WeWork as overvalued and vulnerable to the next downturn. But the company holds so many leases in so many cities, it might hold more power than its landlords.Real estate titans have long scoffed at WeWork, which in eight short years has managed to attain a $20 billion valuation by selling short-term leases for shared office space with a mixture of stylish design and free-flowing alcohol. The naysayers argue that WeWork\u2019s business model looks brilliant only in a rising economy that has allowed it to lock in long-term leases and then re-rent that space to other businesses at a premium. The enormous valuation it has obtained is higher than that of Boston Properties and Vornado, two of the country\u2019s biggest office-space landlords \u2014 companies that actually own the kind of space that WeWork usually rents.Now, with interest rates creeping higher, residential real estate prices flattening and fears of an economic slowdown coming, real estate insiders are gleeful at the notion that a downturn could be an existential threat for the company.But a funny thing happened as WeWork has scaled up all over the globe: It may have become too big to fail.WeWork has gobbled up leases for so much space in so many cities, there\u2019s a compelling case to be made that its landlords wouldn\u2019t be able to afford for it to go under.Because of WeWork\u2019s size, \u201cthey have more power in a down market,\u201d said Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the longtime real estate investor and founder of Colony Capital. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter financial results on Tuesday. A WeWork spokesman, citing the coming report, declined to comment. The conventional wisdom is that when the economy turns south, WeWork\u2019s customers \u2014 many of which are start-ups and may be the most vulnerable \u2014 will simply walk away. The flexibility of WeWork\u2019s short-term leases is part of its appeal, after all. Even those who are bullish on WeWork count changing economic conditions among the dangers it faces. \u201cWhile the company\u2019s flexible contracts may be ideal for small companies, WeWork would inevitably face trouble leasing their spaces if start-ups began to dry up or if the real estate market experiences a downturn similar to the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d the research firm CB Insights wrote as it articulated the criticisms of WeWork in an otherwise upbeat case for the company\u2019s sky-high valuation.But WeWork has been building a more durable business than most real estate executives seem to appreciate. The company was once marketed to individuals and small businesses on month-to-month lease agreements, but large companies like IBM and Microsoft are now using it and signing significantly longer leases. The company says its average customer has a lease of seven to eight months and new customers are signing leases that average 20 months.Underneath all the branding and wide-ranging aspirations \u2014 which include a for-profit elementary school called WeGrow \u2014 it\u2019s still a real estate company. \u201cAt the end of the day, it is about leasing space,\u201d Mr. Barrack said. And WeWork has leased a lot of it.WeWork projects to have about 400,000 individuals using its office space by the end of the year, which would put it ahead of the entire employee base of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway \u2014 one of the largest employers in the nation.Another sign of just how large WeWork\u2019s ecosystem has become: It employs 1,300 people in architecture, interior design, engineering and related activities \u2014 an employee roster that would make it one of the biggest architecture firms in the world. That means when the next economic downturn comes \u2014 and it will \u2014 WeWork\u2019s landlords will actually be less likely to evict the company if it doesn\u2019t pay its rent. If they were to let WeWork fail, those landlords would risk depressing commercial real state prices to such a degree that it would create a serious sense of pain for the country\u2019s largest real estate owners.More likely, landlords would swallow hard and renegotiate the lease agreements on more favorable terms to keep WeWork from creating a full-on panic.The idea of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d has long applied to banks and whether the government would come to the rescue to prop them up, but in this case, landlords all over the world might find themselves in the uncomfortable position of having to help save a failing tenant simply because the tenant is so large.That isn\u2019t necessarily the only solution if WeWork were to end up unable to pay its rent. Rather than kick out WeWork or lower its rent, a landlord could have the company act as a property manager. A big part of WeWork\u2019s value proposition is in its management of properties. It\u2019s possible that WeWork could become the equivalent of Marriott, which manages hotels but doesn\u2019t own or lease them. WeWork also has a cushion that most real estate companies don\u2019t: SoftBank. The Japanese investor has already plowed $4.4 billion into the company and just last month discussed taking a majority stake. Given SoftBank\u2019s deep pockets \u2014 it has a $100 billion fund aimed at start-ups \u2014 it is quite possible that WeWork could weather financial difficulties without any help from its landlords.When the next downturn comes, we\u2019ll find out who was right: real estate traditionalists, or the ones trying to upend them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In China, Bill Gates Encourages the World to Build a Better Toilet", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Bill Gates believes the world needs better toilets.Specifically, toilets that improve hygiene, don\u2019t have to connect to sewage systems at all and can break down human waste into fertilizer.So on Tuesday in Beijing, Mr. Gates held the Reinvented Toilet Expo, a chance for companies to showcase their takes on the simple bathroom fixture. Companies showed toilets that could separate urine from other waste for more efficient treatment, that recycled water for hand washing and that sported solar roofs.Mr. Gates said in an interview that \u201cit will be at least a decade\u201d before the reinvented toilets reach tens of millions of people in the poorest areas, and they will have to prove both practical and economical. \u201cNobody wants overnight solutions\u201d in sanitation, he added.Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s top leader, has called for a \u201ctoilet revolution.\u201d (Incidentally, the Reinvented Toilet Expo is called \u201cToilets in the New Era\u201d in Chinese.) Having clean toilets, Mr. Xi said in 2015, is an important goal in \u201cadvancing the revitalization of the countryside.\u201dLi Shuangxin, a 41-year-old stay-at-home mother who lives on the outskirts of Beijing, walks about 100 meters to an outhouse several times a day from her shack. About 20 people share the \u201ctoilet,\u201d which is little more than two planks over a mud pit.\u201cWhen you do your business, you just don\u2019t look down,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with such a toilet, but you don\u2019t really have a choice. Our economic conditions are such.\u201dBut China\u2019s toilet revolution has led to excesses \u2014 a problem that critics say could plague the Gates effort as well.Though the products on display on Tuesday were nowhere as flashy, Mr. Gates has drawn criticism for giving thousands of dollars to universities in developed countries to create high-tech toilets that will take years to pay off \u2014 if they ever do.\u201cIt might be a thing like the space program where people have fantasies about colonizing the moon and Mars, but it\u2019s really not that practical,\u201d he said.Mr. Gates acknowledged that some reinvented toilets, in small volumes, could cost as much as $10,000, but added, \u201cThat will pretty quickly come down.\u201d\u201cThe hard part will be getting it from $2,000 to $500,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say we are more confident today that it was a good bet than where we started, but we are still not there.\u201dThe Gates Foundation said the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank would commit $2.5 billion in financing for sanitation projects that provide people in all parts of a city \u2014 including the poorest neighborhoods \u2014 with safely managed sanitation services.\u201cWe see ourselves on the cusp of a sanitation revolution,\u201d Mr. Gates told expo attendees on Tuesday.At a showroom in an art center in Beijing, companies including China\u2019s Clear, Ecosan and CRRC, Sedron Technologies of the United States, India\u2019s Eram Scientific and Switzerland\u2019s Blue Diversion Autarky displayed toilets that could separate urine and recycle water for hand washing.During his opening remarks, Mr. Gates said he had started getting interested in sanitation after he stopped working full time at Microsoft and began traveling more frequently to poor countries with his wife, Melinda.Holding up a beaker of fecal matter, Mr. Gates reminded the audience that human waste is disgusting, containing 200 trillion rotavirus particles and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs, among other organisms.Mr. Gates\u2019s efforts to bring the discussion of toilets into the mainstream have legitimized a topic that many have avoided talking about for decades, said Jack Sim, the founder of the World Toilet Organization, a Singapore-based nonprofit organization committed to improving toilet and sanitation conditions worldwide.\u201cThe subject of toilets has been a neglected subject for some time,\u201d Mr. Sim said. \u201cThe Gates Foundation is part of this momentum of breaking the taboo.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Bill Gates\u2019s remarks on human waste at the Reinvented Toilet Expo in Beijing, based on erroneous information provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Facebook\u2019s Three Big Problems", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello, old friends! It\u2019s Kevin Roose, tech columnist and erstwhile newsletter writer.Facebook\u2019s eventful week in Europe got me thinking about how to categorize the many, many problems the company has faced over the past several years.They can be grouped in three buckets, I think, and it\u2019s worth spelling out what each of them is, because it might help illuminate the enormous complexity of Facebook\u2019s challenge in the coming years.So far, this hostility has manifested mostly in the form of a few shouty hearings and a lot of angry letters, and hasn\u2019t seriously impeded Facebook\u2019s ability to conduct its business. But it could produce real consequences in the coming months, as a Democratic House takes over in the United States and lawmakers in Europe and other countries start rolling out new rules around online ads, privacy and other core Facebook concerns.The second bucket consists of perception problems \u2014 external P.R. crises, dwindling user satisfaction numbers and low employee morale.I\u2019d argue that of these issues, the third really matters most. Tech companies live and die on their ability to attract and retain talented workers, and morale problems can quickly turn into business problems if they result in a less competitive work force.Product problems are the most worrisome ones for Facebook by a large margin, because they flow into other issues and they\u2019re the hardest to solve.Making political problems go away is not rocket science \u2014 companies spend billions of dollars every year lobbying lawmakers to great effect. And perception problems, while painful in the short term, can be overcome over the long term, as news cycles move on and other companies\u2019 sins bump you out of the spotlight. (Exhibit A: Uber.)But product problems can be excruciatingly hard to solve \u2014 especially when, as in Facebook\u2019s case, they live at the core of a lucrative business model.I\u2019m not the first to point out that many of Facebook\u2019s issues stem from its embrace of targeted advertising, which has made it an insanely profitable behemoth and created an unending series of headaches.But it\u2019s not clear yet that Facebook can meaningfully change the engagement patterns on its apps \u2014 which are, after all, built on giving users more of what they want, even if what they want is hateful or misleading \u2014 without unraveling its business.So the big questions for Facebook now are: Can the company first acknowledge that it has product problems, in addition to political and perception problems? If it can agree on the product problems, how much money is Mr. Zuckerberg willing to lose in order to fix them? And how much damage will the company absorb in the meantime?In other tech news of the week:This is a great case for taking them more seriously, starting with Red Dead Redemption 2, which Mr. Suderman calls \u201ca game about both making choices and living with them, about taking responsibility for how you\u2019ve lived.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mystery of the Midterm Elections: Where Are the Russians?", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Shane Huntley has seen every form of state-sponsored cyberattack, first as an Australian intelligence officer and now as director of Google\u2019s most advanced team of threat detectors.So when he was asked what surprised him the most about the 2018 midterm elections, his response was a bit counterintuitive. \u201cThe answer is surprisingly little on the hacking front, at least compared to two years ago.\u201d He paused, and added: \u201cAnd that reassures some people, and it scares some people.\u201dHe is right. From the cyberwar room that the Department of Homeland Security runs round the clock in a bland office building in Arlington, Va., to Microsoft\u2019s threat-assessment center at the other end of the country, in Redmond, Wash., every form of digital radar is being focused on America\u2019s election infrastructure \u2014 and particularly on the Russian military intelligence agency once known as the G.R.U.This weekend, some of those radars began to sound a few warnings \u2014 but faintly, and in strange places. Cybersecurity firms and some election officials reported seeing an increase in cyberattacks on websites and infrastructure surrounding the vote, but not on systems that are part of the voting process. Hackers have targeted websites across the United States \u2014 including in Georgia, Florida and California \u2014 that allow voters to look up the location of their local polling stations or to verify that they are registered to vote.It is unclear where the attacks are coming from, but the sources appear to be a mix, everything from other countries to lone hackers looking to make a name for themselves, investigators say. \u201cThe attackers are trying to make a lot of noise,\u201d said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, a cybersecurity firm that is tracking the action.He said the incursions were not an effort to disrupt the vote, but merely to bolster rumors of election fraud and interference. \u201cThey are going after anything that can undermine the process itself,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir aim is to put the outcome in doubt,\u201d which could enable President Trump or losing candidates, come Wednesday, to declare that the outcome was rigged.There is no evidence yet that the Russians have had anything to do with this latest set of malicious activities, and many experts say they believe that President Vladimir V. Putin is sitting out this election. After all, the argument goes, the scrutiny is intense, and 470 House and Senate races make it just too hard for the Russians to figure out their interests, much less manipulate the outcome. But after the 2016 debacle, suspicions run deep, and some think that the Russians just haven\u2019t played their hand yet.Whether a Russian change of tactics is unfolding is just one of many mysteries surrounding this first national election in the United States after the most sophisticated effort ever discovered to divide Americans, and ultimately seek to alter the outcome, by a foreign power.If there is a lesson from 2016, it was that America was constantly taken by surprise \u2014 by the hacking of the D.N.C. and prominent Democrats, by the publication of internal emails, by efforts to get inside the voter-registration rolls of 20 states. In 2018, there are new and different warning signs: The Iranians have shown up, and states and local governments have done surprisingly little to harden their infrastructure. The Chinese are players, but not in the ways that President Trump and Vice President Pence have suggested.And the Russians haven\u2019t exactly gone away. While there are few signs of pre-election intrusions into voter-registration systems, the social media campaigns never ended; some accelerated immediately after the 2016 elections. When the United States indicted Maria Butina, a Russian who was accused of running influence campaigns while an American University student, the government suspected Russian groups budgeted millions of dollars for continuing influence campaigns.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised by any of this,\u201d Mr. Huntley said last week at a Zeitgeist, an annual gathering of the company\u2019s leadership and many of its customers outside of Phoenix. \u201cIt\u2019s like fighting the last war. When I was in the military academy people told us all the next wars were going to look like the first Gulf War. They didn\u2019t. And in cyber, the next war won\u2019t look like 2016.\u201dSo in the last days of the campaign, here are six points from the 2018 cyberpolitical battlefield:In 2016, the Iranians were nowhere to be seen in the American election process. This year, they showed up in such force that Facebook announced last Friday that it was taking down a series of Iranian posts, mostly, it seemed, to demonstrate that the company\u2019s radar, switched off two years ago, is now on high alert.Intelligence officials and cybersecurity companies say the Iranians mostly appear to be copying techniques that they learned from watching the Russians, especially in social media. But there is a twist: The Russians and the Iranians are clearly not in political agreement here. While both have sought to exacerbate political and social divides, the Russians clearly showed a preference for Mr. Trump as Election Day approached, according to the conclusions published after the election by American intelligence agencies.The Iranians are playing the other side. \u201cThey don\u2019t like what happened to the nuclear deal,\u201d Yasmin Green, the director of research and development for Jigsaw, a unit of Alphabet, which is Google\u2019s parent company. Speaking at a TimesTalks event held by The New York Times and Deloitte on Tuesday night in Washington, Ms. Green, one of the country\u2019s leading experts on the uses and abuses of social media, noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and his reimposition of drastic sanctions, has made the Iranians determined to cripple him.\u201cNot only are they anti-this administration,\u201d she said, they are \u201cpro-liberal.\u201dBy comparison to the Russians, the Iranian hackers are still pretty unsophisticated and are largely inept at imitating down-the-street-neighbors when posting to Facebook and Reddit. One ad showed a frowning Mr. Trump, and declared him \u201cThe Worst, Most Hated President in American History,\u201d the kind of extreme declaration one might expect of Mr. Trump himself. Others sought to undercut American confidence in the way Washington operates, by showing two men shaking hands above a conference table and passing money below it. (\u201cWe call it bribery \u2014 they call it lobbying.\u201dSo it is no surprise, said Tom Burt, the vice president for customer security and trust at Microsoft, that the most active battleground is, once again, Ukraine. In the Microsoft Cybercrime Center, a giant digital map of the world shows cyberattack activity, but the number of attacks are adjusted for the size of the population. Ukraine shows up in bright red. The United States, with 330 million people, or seven times the population of Ukraine, shows up in white, a sign of relative calm.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing activity in the U.S., but we\u2019re seeing it at levels less than we saw in 2016, said Mr. Burt, cautioning that Microsoft, with its network of machines using Office software and its Azure cloud computing services, is more likely to see hacking of accounts than social media activity.Still, Mr. Burt\u2019s group alerted two senators last year that a hacking group long linked to the G.R.U. had attacked their Capitol Hill offices, unsuccessfully. It was unclear if the goal was to affect their re-election campaigns or get into emails, because both sit on national-security-related committees. One of the senators was Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who is considered highly vulnerable. Microsoft also detected intrusions on two politically conservative think tanks in Washington in August.To get a sense of what is coming to the United States, Ms. Green and Jigsaw\u2019s chief executive, Jared Cohen, a former State Department official, visited Ukraine in recent weeks and found that it was still Mr. Putin\u2019s petri dish, a place where sophisticated new experiments were underway to deluge separatist parts of the country with disinformation ahead of military actions and a presidential election next March. Ukraine is \u201calways on the leading edge,\u201d she concluded.The question of China\u2019s involvement was raised first by Mr. Trump and then by Mr. Pence, who said in a speech that \u201cBeijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans\u2019 perception of Chinese policies,\u201d and said a \u201csenior career member of our intelligence community recently told me what the Russians are doing pales in comparison\u201d to Chinese interference.But Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were borrowing the terminology of cyberattacks to describe something very different: Efforts by China to publish policy arguments, often in newspaper supplements that have been paid for by the Chinese government for years, to make its case. There is no evidence, officials and outside experts say, of the kind of hacking that Russia has engaged in, or even much social-media use. (In Asia and Australia, in contrast, the Chinese have been busy on social media.)When three Democratic senators asked Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, for an unclassified letter explaining what the Chinese were doing in the 2018 election, to truth-test the administration\u2019s arguments, Mr. Coats avoided any potential contradictions with his boss by sending a classified answer.\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said. Mr. Coats, he said, \u201chas an obligation to the American people to provide a public response to our questions, particularly since this is about America\u2019s elections and the security of our democracy.\u201dIf awards were handed out for most-bungled-election-machine-management, Texas would be a strong contender for the top prize. It\u2019s just that the problem is the machines or the voters, not Mr. Putin\u2019s hackers.Bad publicity followed, and Texas blamed voters who couldn\u2019t keep their hands off the machines, which were decades old. But in these nervous times, the incident underscored how susceptible many election machines are to quirks. That is another reason that paper backup for electronic voting machines is so important, so that voters can look over their selections, and so vote-counters have a nonelectronic way of conducting a recount, if the machines cannot be trusted.One would think that after all the concerns in 2016, states and counties would have been racing to update their systems. \u201cMost did almost nothing,\u201d Douglas Lute, a former American ambassador to NATO and Army general, who has taken up the cause of reforming the election infrastructure, said in an interview. The $380 million that Congress allotted recently mostly went to funding assessments of vulnerabilities.Yet while states and counties made changes, New Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana still use no paper backup, and parts of Pennsylvania, a vital swing state, do not either. That has not changed since 2016, and it is unclear that it will be solved by 2020.The vulnerabilities of voting machines have gotten a lot of attention, especially at the Def Con conference over the summer in Las Vegas, which drew 25,000 hackers. At the conference\u2019s Voting Village, it took an 11-year-old just minutes to hack into a voting machine using a simulation of Florida\u2019s system. (The machine\u2019s manufacturers called it a stunt, noting that physical security of the machines at Def Con was nonexistent. Still, the speed of the intrusion was impressive.Almost all voting machines in the United States are off-line and come in many varieties, making it hard to hack them unless you are sitting in front of the machine. But the computers that prepare the ballots are not, and at the conference, J. Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan professor who has published devastating work on the vulnerability of voting machines, held a mock vote that pitted George Washington against Benedict Arnold. Thanks to manipulation of the ballot software, America\u2019s most famous traitor trounced the man who was, until the software was rigged, first in the hearts of his countrymen.That is only part of the problem. Many counties use old, insecure websites for their voter registration; it would be relatively simple to create \u201cspoofed\u201d alternative sites or break into them, to manipulate data or post notices that polls have been closed or Election Day moved. That could be the next move in the county-by-county activity seen in recent days.There is also room for mischief as votes are tabulated and reported to the state, and ultimately to media outlets.The Department of Homeland Security said there had been little evidence this year of the kind of \u201cprobes\u201d into the voter registration systems that created such fear in 2016. But Election Day hasn\u2019t arrived yet.It wouldn\u2019t take much to disrupt Tuesday\u2019s vote in a few important swing districts, and that\u2019s what the United States government \u2014 and many private security experts \u2014 are worried about.The Department of Homeland Security says it will be deploying small teams of cyberexperts to important states \u2014 presumably those that are most vulnerable, or have close races \u2014 just before the election. But it is not hard to imagine different scenarios that could cause disruption, or just create the illusion of disruption.A last-minute attack on county or state voter-registration systems, just to knock them off-line, would create an uproar from voters who might show up at the polls and find they could not vote. A strike at power grids, turning out the lights at polling places, or just disrupting transportation systems could suppress turnout and lead to charges of manipulation.Mr. Rosenbach\u2019s group simulated such events in a series of scenarios with election officials, piling one attack upon another in an effort to get them to think ahead about how they would respond, all part of an election \u201cplaybook\u201d that the Defending Digital Democracy program has given to campaigns and officials.And then there is another fear: Come Wednesday, if there are still races that are too close to call, just a rumor campaign about possible election manipulation might be enough to cast doubt about the integrity of the results. And in the end, that\u2019s what election disruption is all about \u2014 undermining the citizens\u2019 confidence that their vote counts.In 2016, the evidence of the extent of Russian operations on social media did not become clear until months after the election was over \u2014 and then, time and again, Facebook had to admit it missed all the warning signs. Mark Zuckerberg, a company founder, moved from arguing that to think fake news and divisive posts \u201cinfluence the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea\u201d to ordering the hiring of thousands of Facebook monitors to make sure it never happened again.But there are no guarantees. Months after the midterms are over, evidence of covert internet action that is currently going unnoticed may well surface. As the Russians and others embrace artificial intelligence techniques, and get better at targeting messages, they may well find ways to route around the phalanx of new social-media police. Ms. Green says that is unavoidable.\u201cIt\u2019s still retroactive,\u201d she said of monitoring social media. \u201cWe haven\u2019t figure out how to do this in real time.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misidentified the state that Senator Ron Wyden represents. He is from Oregon, not Washington.An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which some social media campaigns accelerated immediately after elections. It was 2016, not 2018.David E. Sanger is a national security correspondent for The New York Times and author of \u201cThe Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age.\u201dAdvertisement"}
