{"Headline": "Theresa May Takes Her Case for Brexit to the People", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 With British lawmakers having given her Brexit plan a scathing review, Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday began a last-ditch appeal to a constituency she hoped might save it: voters so fed up with negotiations that they would back whatever is on the table.Not that Mrs. May wants to give them an actual vote on the matter, a prospect that could kill her plans to extract Britain from the European Union altogether.But the prime minister, estranged from much of her own party and dealing with scorn even from supposed allies in business, is trying to apply pressure to reluctant lawmakers by building public approval for the deal.Mrs. May ducked the thorniest questions put to her by radio callers on Friday, in a preview of what looked likely to be a week of public campaigning for the deal after European leaders vote on it in Brussels on Sunday.She refused to discuss a backup plan if lawmakers in Parliament were to reject the draft deal in a vote expected by mid-December. She refused to say whether she would resign in that case. And she groped for a response to one of the most provocative questions conservative lawmakers have been wrestling with in recent days: Would the country be better off under Mrs. May\u2019s plan or if it never left the union at all?\u201cWhat will make us better off is not so much about whether we\u2019re in the European Union or not,\u201d she finally said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what we can do for our economy; it\u2019s about what we can do for our prosperity.\u201dThe feeling that Mrs. May\u2019s deal was worse than remaining in the bloc was reported to be spreading among Conservative lawmakers. On Friday morning, Dominic Raab, who resigned as the prime minister\u2019s Brexit secretary over his opposition to the deal, said after some hemming and hawing that the terms of Mrs. May\u2019s agreement \u201cwould be even worse\u201d than the terms of European Union membership.\u201cWe\u2019d effectively be bound by the same rules,\u201d he said, \u201cbut without the control or voice over them.\u201dNegotiators were still working on Friday to settle lingering questions about how British and European leaders would decide on the status of Gibraltar \u2014 a British overseas territory claimed by Spain \u2014 once Britain leaves the union.Spain wants a say in any future trading arrangements concerning the territory, but Mrs. May maintained on Friday that it would be covered by whatever deal British negotiators work out for the United Kingdom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Dreamers\u2019 Win Round in Legal Battle to Keep DACA", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a nationwide injunction against the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to revoke deportation protections for some 700,000 young \u201cDreamers\u201d who were brought into the United States illegally as children.The court consolidated three separate cases that were brought on behalf of the State of California, the University of California system and the beneficiaries of the program themselves. The judges rejected the arguments of government lawyers who contended that DACA had been introduced illegally by President Obama in an act of executive overreach.Instead, the court found there was a good chance the plaintiffs could succeed in their claim that the Trump administration\u2019s abrupt attempt to rescind the program violated the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, based on its disproportionate impact on Latinos.\u201cThe Executive wields awesome power in the enforcement of our nation\u2019s immigration laws. Our decision today does not curb that power, but rather enables its exercise in a manner that is free from legal misconceptions and is democratically accountable to the public,\u201d the court wrote.Janet Napolitano, a named plaintiff in the case brought on behalf of the University of California system, which she oversees, signed off on DACA as secretary of Homeland Security under President Obama when the program was introduced.Ms. Napolitano said Thursday that DACA was needed because the current immigration system was \u201cterribly out of date and it doesn\u2019t match up well with that the country needs now.\u201d She estimated that about 4,000 undocumented students are enrolled in the California system, most of whom, she believes, are enrolled in DACA.In order to qualify for protections, participants are required to have a clean criminal record and to have finished high school or obtained a G.E.D. The status must be renewed every two years. Because of the injunction, renewal applications are still being accepted, though new candidates cannot apply.Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer for Public Counsel, the nonprofit group that represented some of the plaintiffs, called the administration\u2019s attempt to bypass the lower courts unprecedented.\u201cIt is a rare and obvious act of disrespect to the whole federal court system to say that \u2018We don\u2019t need to wait for the appellate courts.\u2019 It\u2019s never been done in a case that did not involve some sort of national security interest.\u201dMr. Rosenbaum said he hoped that the administration would give up on dismantling the program. \u201cNobody in the country is suffering because of the presence of the young people. There\u2019s no imperative. This is just cruelty that serves no national purpose,\u201d he said.The court decision brought temporary relief to people like Dulce Garcia, a 35-year-old beneficiary who is named as a plaintiff. Ms. Garcia is a lawyer in San Diego whose parents brought her to the United States from Mexico when she was 4 years old.In an interview Thursday, she described the difficulties of growing up undocumented. Her family, she said, shared living spaces with other families and was homeless for a time.For holiday breaks during law school in Cleveland, Ms. Garcia would have to ask someone to drive her from their home in San Diego to Los Angeles or Las Vegas, where she could catch a Greyhound bus \u2014 she could not fly without a passport, and the buses that leave from San Diego often travel through check points where border agents review the documents of the passengers inside.The circuit court\u2019s opinion, written by Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw, took note of her story. \u201cIt is no hyperbole to say that Dulce Garcia embodies the American dream,\u201d it said. \u201cWhether Dulce Garcia and the hundreds of thousands of other young dreamers like her may continue to live productively in the only country they have ever known is, ultimately, a choice for the political branches of our constitutional government.\u201dMs. Garcia said the decision \u201cgives me hope.\u201d\u201cIt just acknowledges that we\u2019re American,\u201d she said. \u201cThat we are here and that we have value, not just because we contribute so much to society or the economy or through our labor and taxes, but because we\u2019re human and we dream.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He reached out to his boss [Alex Stamos, then the company\u2019s security chief]. Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. \u201cIts leadership squirmed over Russian meddling investigations:\u201cMr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of [Sheryl] Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal. \u2018You threw us under the bus!\u2019 she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.\u201dThe company hadn\u2019t prepared for the worst on its platform:\u201c \u2018We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u2019 Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.\u201dBut pushed its messaging hard:\u201cFacebook also expanded its work with [the P.R. firm] Definers.

Tim] Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users.\u201dAnd Mark Zuckerberg was apoplectic about the criticism:After Mr. Cook publicly derided Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg was so furious that he later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.The bottom line:\u201cAs evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view.\u201dThose moves will be important when the company tries to convince public-market investors that it\u2019s worth a sky-high valuation when it files for an I.P.O. But it remains to be seen if investors will believe that argument.More from Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT:\u201cI\u2019m very happy about the state of the economy now,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cThere\u2019s pretty good reason to think we\u2019re going to continue in a positive vein like that.\u201dHe added that the Fed deserved credit for its role in the long and steady expansion. \u201cOur policy is part of the reason the economy is in such a good place now,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell also noted that Congress \u2014 not the White House \u2014 oversees the Fed, and added that the central bank would continue to raise rates for now.China, Germany and Japan have all seen their economies struggle in recent months.

Kobach, a Republican known for fiery warnings about election fraud and illegal immigration, and instead elected State Senator Laura Kelly, a Democrat, as governor of their red-leaning state.Ms. Kelly captured about 48 percent of the statewide vote to about 43 percent for Mr. Kobach. The result suggested a thirst for political moderation in a state Republicans have dominated. Democrats also flipped a Republican-held congressional seat in suburban Kansas City.\u201cThere will be a lot of talk around America about the blue wave, but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s what\u2019s happened here in Kansas,\u201d Ms. Kelly said as she declared victory on Tuesday night. \u201cWhat happened in Kansas was a wave of common sense, a wave of bipartisanship.\u201dMs. Kelly, 68, a longtime legislator from Topeka, focused her campaign on issues like Medicaid expansion, school funding and highway construction, winning endorsements from many prominent Kansas Republicans and votes from across the political spectrum.She managed to win by large margins in several populous counties that favored Mr. Trump in 2016. She was leading by 16 percentage points in Johnson County, in the Kansas City suburbs, and by 23 percentage points in Shawnee County, which includes Topeka.\u201cI just feel like we need more Democrats in office to get our government back under control,\u201d Melody Ross, 67, said on Tuesday outside her polling place in Topeka. Ms. Ross said she was a longtime registered Republican who was persuaded to vote for Ms. Kelly in part because of those Republican endorsements.During his campaign for governor, Mr. Kobach, 52, presented himself as an effective policymaker who did not yield to opposition. He promised to crack down on undocumented immigrants, cut the size of state government and reduce taxes.\u201cSome people on the left may disagree with some of the things I say,\u201d Mr. Kobach told a crowd at a debate last month. But, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll deliver and I\u2019ll get it done.\u201dAt his watch party in Topeka, the mood turned somber soon after the polls closed. Mr. Kobach circulated through the crowd early in the night, pausing to pray with a group of supporters. But the crowd dwindled as Ms. Kelly ran up large margins and news agencies started to call the race for her.Shortly before 11 p.m. local time, Mr. Kobach told the crowd that he had called to congratulate Ms. Kelly. \u201cIt was a tough, tough race,\u201d he said. \u201cWe battled close to the very end. But this one just wasn\u2019t God\u2019s will.\u201dMr. Kobach, who tried to distance himself from that policy on the campaign trail, said Mr. Brownback\u2019s mistake was reducing taxes without first making large cuts to the size of state government.Ms. Kelly, who has blamed the Brownback tax cuts for many of the state\u2019s problems, reached out to Kansas\u2019 sizable contingent of moderate Republicans and promised to work with members of both parties when elected.\u201cPartisanship was put above all else, and it tore our state apart,\u201d Ms. Kelly said in her victory speech. \u201cThat ended today.\u201dKansas is firmly Republican territory, but this election cycle brought an unusual amount of national attention and close races. Democrats, who had been shut out of the congressional delegation, had hoped to flip two of the state\u2019s four seats in the House of Representatives.Democrats came up short in the Second Congressional District, which includes most of eastern Kansas outside the Kansas City area. Their nominee, Paul Davis, who once served in the Kansas Legislature, narrowly lost to the Republican, Steve Watkins, a military veteran and political newcomer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Powell Says Fed Deserves Credit for Economic Growth", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDALLAS \u2014 Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, on Wednesday countered President Trump\u2019s loud and repeated attacks on the Fed without mentioning Mr. Trump by name.Mr. Powell hammered on two simple themes during an hourlong question-and-answer session in front of several hundred people at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.The Fed is doing its job, he said, and the economy is doing really well.\u201cI\u2019m very happy about the state of the economy now,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cThere\u2019s pretty good reason to think we\u2019re going to continue in a positive vein like that.\u201dHe added that the Fed deserved credit for its role in the long and steady expansion.\u201cOur policy is part of the reason the economy is in such a good place now,\u201d he said.Asked about those attacks, Mr. Powell did not respond directly. Instead, he made a point of saying twice that Congress is the Fed\u2019s overseer.\u201cOur accountability is really to Congress,\u201d he said, driving home the Fed\u2019s independence from the executive branch. Independence from presidential criticism has long been a hallmark of the Fed\u2019s existence, and a contributor to its ability to maintain monetary policy that aims to keep inflation stable and the economy running at maximum employment.He returned to the same theme later in the evening.Mr. Powell answered questions posed by the Dallas Fed president, Robert S. Kaplan, and from members of the audience. Most of those who asked questions said they worked in financial services and asked about the economic outlook, the Fed\u2019s plans and regulatory policy.Mr. Powell acknowledged signs that global growth might be slowing, but played down concerns about volatility in equity markets, describing stock prices as \u201cone of many factors\u201d the Fed evaluates in making policy decisions.He said the Fed was hearing a \u201crising chorus of concern\u201d from businesses about the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s trade restrictions. Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and on a wide range of Chinese imports, and those actions have prompted retaliation by America\u2019s trading partners on goods like metals, peanut butter and whiskey.Mr. Powell cautioned that the Fed still sees little evidence of a broad impact from the trade war in the economic data, but he said the concerns about protectionism made sense in theory.\u201cIf it winds up, perhaps inadvertently, in a place where we have more widespread protection, that would be bad for our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that more and more products are subject to tariffs you could see a little bit higher inflation and a little bit slower growth.\u201dHe also said the Fed was well aware that the benefits of the economic recovery have not been distributed evenly and that there are pockets of America that have yet to rebound from the recession.\u201cWe know there are a lot of people around the edges who have not benefited yet from the recovery,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cThe best thing we can do is to try to sustain this expansion for as long as possible.\u201dBut he said there was a broad consensus among Fed officials that the central bank should keep raising its benchmark interest rate in the near term.The Fed also is expected to continue raising rates during the first half of 2019.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to me that we would need to go up again in December and at least a couple of times next year,\u201d Mary Daly, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday.Mr. Powell did not comment on the timing of future rate increases, but his upbeat economic outlook is consistent with expectations that the Fed will continue to raise rates.Mr. Powell has announced that he will hold news conferences after each of the Fed\u2019s eight policymaking meetings next year, replacing the current pattern of quarterly news conferences. In recent years, the Fed has fallen into a pattern of announcing policy changes at meetings with a news conference. Mr. Powell said Wednesday that the Fed was reclaiming its ability to act at every meeting.\u201cThe market is going to have to get used to that,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly all meetings are live now. There\u2019s no question about it now. I think over time folks will get used to the idea that we can and will move at any meeting.\u201dAsked for closing thoughts, Mr. Powell returned to his two themes.\u201cI want to leave on a note of optimism about our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a difficult time and we\u2019ve faced difficult times before. We\u2019re in a good place now. I do believe our economy can grow and grow faster.\u201dAnd, he added, the Fed is doing a good job.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

Neither company wants a repeat of 2016, when Russian operatives used their platforms to influence voters.Perhaps more than ever, Beijing is interested in how Americans vote.

There\u2019ll be less room for chest-thumping bravado and more need for rational policy making and diplomacy.

David Goodman of the NYT on Amazon\u2019s reasoning:Picking multiple sites would allow it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area.

But knowing which day to buy is not as clear. Those looking to score the cheapest airfares around this Thanksgiving holiday shopping season may have their patience tested.\u201cWe were initially exploring Cyber Monday patterns when we stumbled upon this date that offered a greater volume of sales,\u201d Patrick Surry, Hopper\u2019s chief data scientist, said.Hopper notifies its users when it finds what it considers to be a \u201cbreaking fare\u2019 sale. \u201cLast year, we sent more deal notifications on Travel Deal Tuesday than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined,\u201d Mr. Surry added. The company believes that many airlines offer deals this time of year because demand for travel typically slows following Thanksgiving. It believes many travelers have already made bookings for the holidays, but have yet to determine where they may go for a winter getaway, or even a New Year\u2019s holiday.\u201cThe fall and winter is traditionally a slower travel time other than Thanksgiving and Christmas, so airlines are looking for ways to keep planes full,\u201d Mr. Surry said.Hopper also said that more airlines are getting behind the idea of Travel Deal Tuesday, with international carriers like Icelandair, South African Airways and Philippine Airlines agreeing to offer special rates this year.But not all who analyze airfare data agree that the Tuesday after Thanksgiving is necessarily worth waiting for.But Kelly Soderlund, Hipmunk\u2019s content manager, said that the idea of Tuesday being a particularly good day for deals, \u201cdoes seem to hold some weight.\u201dShe compared economy booking prices for Hipmunk\u2019s 30 most popular domestic routes and found that Tuesday offered 11 of best deals \u2014 when matched against the median booking price for November \u2014 compared to the other two days. These routes included flights between New York and Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles and Boston and Philadelphia and Orlando.\u201cMy advice is that if you find a sale that piques your interest on Black Friday or Cyber Monday, pull the trigger,\u201d Ms. Soderlund said. \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting for a lowered price to a particular destination \u2014 and a sale fails to manifest \u2014 Travel Tuesday could be your best bet.\u201dEven Skyscanner found that travelers who booked on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving in 2017 saved an average of 11 percent compared to those who bought airfare on the Friday after the holiday.There may not be a consensus on the best day to book, but all of these studies do indicate that, in general, the holiday shopping season does offer significant savings on flights, which hasn\u2019t always been the case.\u201cIn general, the holiday sale period certainly appears to have changed over the past few years,\u201d Mr. Surry said. \u201cWith the growth of Cyber Monday, consumers are increasingly expecting nonphysical goods and services available for purchase in the post-Thanksgiving sales, which could in part contribute to the increase in travel deals in the past few years.\u201dHopper and Skyscanner also agree on several of the same destinations that are likely to save travelers the most, with perennial international favorites like London, Paris and Tokyo expected to be among the most popular destinations booked during the week after Thanksgiving.For example, Hopper predicts that travelers can book a trip to Tokyo for 40 percent less than normal on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving and Skyscanner expects fares to be at a 20 percent discount on the Friday. Domestic cities cited by both Hopper and Skyscanner as bargain destinations include Tampa, Las Vegas and Denver.To make bargain hunting less of a headache, Hopper, Skyscanner and Hipmunk all offer tools via their websites and mobile apps to track fares and be alerted of special deals.Mr. Surry expects the trend of airlines offering bargain fares for the holidays, \u201cwill only become more prevalent as consumers demonstrate their willingness to purchase travel as part of their holiday savings strategies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.But for Democratic organizers, civil rights activists and African-American elected officials, Mike Espy\u2019s loss in the Mississippi Senate race on Tuesday cut deep.As several African-American Democrats now weigh campaigns for the presidency in 2020, it\u2019s worth pausing to consider how 2018 turned out for leading black candidates and some of the challenges they faced.Across the country, black candidates broke records this election cycle. A historic number of African-Americans will enter the House this year, including the most black women ever. Their ranks include eight black candidates who won in majority white districts.In Nevada, the incoming attorney general, Aaron Ford, is the first African-American to win a statewide executive office. And in Wisconsin, Mandela Barnes will be the state\u2019s first black lieutenant governor.But in some of the highest-profile races, mostly in the South, efforts to elect black Democrats came up short. Along with Mr. Espy, in Florida, three other contenders \u2014 Andrew Gillum in Florida, Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Ben Jealous in Maryland \u2014 fell shy of winning the governor\u2019s mansions. In Michigan, a black Republican, John James, lost in his bid for the Senate.Mr. Gillum, Ms. Abrams and Mr. Jealous would have been their states\u2019 first black governors \u2014 and the only black governors in office in the United States. And had Mr. Espy won in Mississippi, he would have been the first African-American to represent his state in the Senate in nearly 150 years.Race was an inescapable factor in three of the races. Mr. Gillum\u2019s opponent, Ron DeSantis, opened his campaign by warning voters not to \u201cmonkey this up,\u201d by electing Mr. Gillum. In Georgia, Ms. Abrams and her campaign complained vociferously about voter suppression tactics by her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, that they said disproportionally impacted minority voters, and likely cost her the election.And in Mississippi, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, who defeated Mr. Espy, came under fire for saying of a supporter, \u201cIf he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201d She later apologized to \u201canyone who was offended\u201d by the comment.President Trump added to the racial undercurrent, eagerly lobbing insults packed with innuendo at all three candidates. He called Mr. Gillum \u201ca thief\u201d and said Ms. Abrams was \u201cnot qualified.\u201d Of Mr. Espy, the president wondered: \u201cHow does he fit in with Mississippi?\u201d \u2014 a strange question about a man whose grandfather built the state\u2019s first black-owned hospital.Organizers and political strategists who are working to build the infrastructure to promote black candidates say that gains were made, even as they fell short of victory. Yvette Simpson, the incoming executive director of the progressive group Democracy for America, says the campaigns of all three candidates will make it easier for black and brown candidates in the future.\u201cThey won the hearts of the country,\u2019\u2019 said Ms. Simpson. \u201cThey got as close as anybody\u2019s ever gotten. It wasn\u2019t a win but it was certainly a victory.\u201dThe outlook for minority candidates is likely to get clearer next year, when multiple black Democrats could be running for president.Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Kamala Harris of California have been traveling the country, making fairly overt steps toward launching 2020 campaigns. And friends of Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Eric Holder, the former attorney general, say they are seriously considering bids.What will that look like? Seems like we\u2019re about to find out.____________________Frankly I\u2019m struggling to know where to start. President Trump continues to heap his plate with a head-spinning amount of press interviews and tweets, even as he heads to Argentina today for talks with leaders of some of the world\u2019s largest economies.In some ways, though, it\u2019s just another Thursday at the White House. Staffers have told many of us that they\u2019ve become so conditioned to taking incoming that not much shakes them. If anything, a trip to Argentina gives those back at the ranch a momentary breather.Of course, other craziness looms.Anyway, that\u2019s what I have for you as of 3:29 p.m. Trump Standard Time._________________________________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

Then took a train to Guangzhou where you also stayed overnight, before flying to Beijing if the weather permitted,\u201d he said.He described how men and women wore Mao suits, how workers were assigned places of work, and bicycles \u2026 bicycles everywhere. Cities were rundown and the people poor.Goh said China back then was still halfway through the \u201ccultural revolution\u201d (1966-76) and its economic impact on the world was \u201cminimal\u201d.Since Deng Xiaoping introduced his reforms 40 years ago, the opening up of China has had \u201ca big impact on the world, positively\u201d, Goh said.\u201cMen and women wear the latest fashions and cars have replaced bicycles. Cosmetic sales flourish. People now travel freely in search of jobs, motivated by profit and wages rather than being bound to assigned places of work. Social habits have changed.\u201dIn terms of education, Goh said the biggest change has been in the large number of students now going overseas to study.\u201cEnglish is now more widely spoken. Admission to university is now based on academic merit rather than ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has raised the standard of education, intellectual discourse and research.\u201dHe said in diplomacy, China is now more active and has a presence in \u201call parts of the world.\u201d\u201cBefore, it conducted diplomacy from behind a \u2018bamboo curtain\u2019, so-called by Western journalists.\u201dAsked whether he had thought China would emerge as the great nation it is today, Goh thought about the question, leaned back in his chair and said, \u201cFrankly, no.\u201d\u201cMy father came to Singapore (from Yongchun county in Fujian province) at the age of 7. I grew up in Singapore so my knowledge of China at that time was one of poverty. My grandmother would describe how cold the winters were and how difficult life was in China. My grandmother sent old clothes to relatives in China. So my impression was one of a poor country.\u201dGoh\u2019s first meeting with Deng was in 1978 when he was part of an official Singapore delegation led by Lee. The meeting was in November, just one month before Deng announced his historic reform and opening-up policy that would propel China into the 21st century as an economic powerhouse and a major global power.\u201cWhat was my impression? Very positive,\u201d Goh said. \u201cMr Lee Kuan Yew noted the meeting in one of his books when he said: \u2018Here was this small man sitting on a chair and his feet could hardly touch the ground. But he had tremendous presence. He was curious. Asking all sorts of questions. You could sense the tremendous presence he had. He had a wide knowledge of China and a vision of what China should do and could be.\u2019\u201dSingapore officially recognized China in 1990 and was the last member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to do so. A large part of the reasoning was the fact that Singapore is mainly of Chinese heritage.\u201cIt was a balancing act,\u201d Goh said. \u201cIf Singapore had recognized China before Malaysia, it would have sent the wrong signal. Likewise with Indonesia. It was diplomacy.\u201dAsked what lessons developing countries in Asia can draw from China\u2019s reforms, Goh said: \u201cThe first lesson is how to grow the economy. China has done it by opening its economy and creating the right economic environment for investments.\u201d\u201cThis is a continuous process and we note that President Xi Jinping has promised that China will continue to open up even more.\u201d\u201cThis means political stability, a conducive policy framework and consistency of policies.\u201dHe said China\u2019s pro-growth policies had \u201creleased the entrepreneurial spirit of the people and harnessed their energy.\u201dGoh recalled a meeting he had with a senior Chinese official in the 1990s.\u201cIn the 1980s and early \u201990s, China was sending its best and brightest people overseas to study and to learn new ideas. I asked the official, \u2018Aren\u2019t you afraid they won\u2019t come back?\u2019\u201d\u201cThe official said, \u2018If 50 percent come back, it will make a big difference to our country and our people.\u2019 China knew the country would keep on growing. It was like a big magnet.\u201dWith rapid urbanization, demographic shifts, and rising incomes and costs of production, China is continuously restructuring its economy as it moves from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth.\u201cOther countries can also learn from China the importance of building an integrated, nationwide network of modern infrastructure to both stimulate and support economic growth and the demands of the population,\u201d Goh said. \u201cThe point is investors must have political stability and a consistency of policies to invest. If they don\u2019t, they will not invest.\u201d\u201cWith China, you don\u2019t have to agree with its mode of government, but it has stability, consistency of policy and the right pro-growth framework for growth.\u201dDespite China\u2019s many achievements following Deng\u2019s reform and opening up, which have seen 700 million people lifted out of poverty, there are some who still deny China the recognition it deserves.\u201cIt is true China has not been given the recognition it deserves for its monumental achievements over the last 40 years,\u201d Goh said.He said Asia largely accepts the Chinese model of government and the way its society is organized, \u201cbut not liberal Western democracies\u201d.\u201cThe fact that China, with its centralized government, has achieved so much in such a short period of time is an economic miracle,\u201d Goh said. \u201cWe do not have to agree with the model, but we should recognize China made the right strategic decision in the late 1970s when it decided to open up without undermining the role of the Communist Party (of China).\u201d\u201cThat centralized system enabled them to push through tough reforms and implement decisions quickly.\u201dGoh said that if China had followed former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s strategy of perestroika (reform of the party and economy) and glasnost (openness) at the same time \u201cthe country would have probably broken up\u201d like the Soviet Union did on Dec. 25, 1991.He said China had taken the right path by restructuring its economy.\u201cWhat I find is that the U.S. and Europe currently have a genuine domestic political problem with globalization,\u201d Goh said.\u201cMany countries in the West have grown significantly by exporting goods to emerging countries. These emerging countries have now become very competitive.\u201d\u201cThe supply chain is such that they (Western countries) have lost jobs in many manufacturing industries, giving rise to anti-globalization sentiments when the correct solution is to try to restructure the economy.\u201d\u201cWe have had to do it in Singapore. Restructure and move forward. If you take the U.S., it says no to restructuring and says it will bring the jobs back. But the jobs won\u2019t go back.\u201d\u201cThis is short-term politics with no long-term gains. This is the economic fear many of the developed countries now face.\u201dHe said China\u2019s opening up was not just a domestic development, but it also had an external dimension to it.\u201cThe fact that it has benefited from a rules-based multilateral system means it must also support a rules-based order going forward,\u201d he said.\u201cThe point is China has done everything right. It joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 as a developing nation,\u201d Goh said. \u201cAt the time, its gross domestic product was about 5 percent of world GDP.\u201d\u201cToday, it is an advanced developing economy, the world\u2019s second-largest, and contributes a share of 15 percent to world GDP.\u201dGoh said China should now start to consider proposed changes in the WTO rules that will require it to reform its economy even further.\u201cCrucially, China was a friend to regional countries when it was fast rising,\u201d he said.\u201cThat goodwill and friendship is a valuable strategic asset, which must be nurtured with mutual trust and respect.\u201d\u201cThe rest of the world now has higher expectations of China as a global economic leader.\u201d\u201cIt will watch what China is doing to liberalize its economy and markets further and how it will contribute to the multilateral trading system.\u201dHe said Singapore supports China\u2019s policy announcements to reform the financial sector, open up foreign investment rules, protect intellectual property and increase automobile imports.\u201cA lot has changed since Deng\u2019s reforms,\u201d Goh said.\u201cWhen Deng visited Singapore in 1978, I sat in at his meeting with Lee Kuan Yew as a young and relatively new minister,\u201d he said.Deng had stayed in Singapore for two days in 1920 on his way to France. He saw what Singapore was like then and was astonished by what had changed, Goh said.\u201cEven as a young man, Deng could see what was possible,\u201d he said.During his Southern Tour in 1992, Deng cited Singapore as a model for China\u2019s development.At the time, Singapore proposed the establishment of an industrial park in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, as a vehicle to transfer Singapore\u2019s experience in building, attracting investments to and managing an industrial park.After some initial difficulties, the joint project proved successful.Goh helped initiate the Tianjin Eco-city in 2008 with then premier Wen Jiabao.\u201cThis project was proposed because China then was rapidly urbanizing and emphasizing sustainable green development,\u201d Goh said. \u201cWe wanted to develop a model eco-city to demonstrate that it could be done and replicated in other parts of China.\u201dThe city was built on abandoned salt pans and polluted water bodies. It celebrated its 10th anniversary this year as a green, thriving city with more than 80,000 residents.\u201cWhen you sit back and look at China today, you see a country that invests in people and in projects that are ahead of their time. China is connecting the country, integrating provinces so you have one country \u2026 one China,\u201d Goh said.Ending the interview, Goh used this analogy in a veiled reference to the current state of play between the United States and China over trade: \u201cChina is like a huge elephant. And fortunately for us, it is a gentle elephant. When that elephant moves into the pool, we smaller animals have to adjust. However, China must give us some warning first. But if you try to stop China from growing, that\u2019s when it turns into a rogue elephant, and when that happens you better watch out.\u201dBy Karl WilsonThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}
{"Headline": "Evelyn Y. Davis, Shareholder Scourge of C.E.O.s, Dies at 89", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvelyn Y. Davis, who spent more than 50 years haranguing American executives at shareholder meetings as she pushed companies to be more frugal and transparent, died on Sunday in Washington. She was 89.A spokesman for her charitable foundation confirmed the death, at a hospital, but did not specify the cause.Ms. Davis, who lived in Washington, spent much of each spring traveling to New York, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh and other cities to attend the annual meetings of numerous public companies in which she was an investor.One of a handful of well-known corporate gadflies, she often cut a distinctive figure, appearing in costumes that she thought would underscore her messages to company leaders. For an American Broadcasting Company meeting in 1966, not long after the network\u2019s campy series \u201cBatman\u201d had its premiere, she wore a Batman mask; for a meeting of U.S. Steel shareholders in 1968, she wore an aluminum dress.Her comments regularly drew catcalls, laughter, groans or shouts \u2014 or some combination thereof \u2014 from ballrooms full of men in suits gathered to hear company presentations.Ms. Davis thrived on the attention, even when it was negative.A shareholder at one Eastern Air Lines meeting in the 1970s grew so enraged, he pushed her into a flower pot. She once nominated Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and b\u00eate noire of the automobile industry, to be a director on the General Motors board \u2014 then left the room to do a television interview before she could cast a vote for him, returning only after the voting had ended. (Mr. Nader was not elected.)For all her antics, Ms. Davis could be effective. Her relentless questions about why chief executives were paid as much as they were, whether companies had donated money to political groups overseas, and how board elections were carried out were credited with helping to advance stricter rules for corporate governance.\u201cThe issues she raised were almost always excellent \u2014 they were well researched,\u201d Ms. Minow added. But, she said, Ms. Davis\u2019s personality sometimes got in the way. She could be flirty, flamboyant and long-winded. At times, she talked so long or interrupted proceedings so often that she was escorted out of the room.\u201cIt was kind of two steps forward, one step back with her,\u201d Ms. Minow said. \u201cIt made it too easy to marginalize not just Evelyn herself but anyone who wanted to raise those issues.\u201dIt was impossible to ignore Ms. Davis completely, however, and many chief executives adopted a strategy of placating her by giving her special attention, hoping she would agree not to show up at the next year\u2019s meetings. Occasionally, she would agree.Some executives courted her good favor by subscribing to her newsletter, \u201cHighlights and Lowlights of Annual Meetings,\u201d typically a slim booklet containing a jumble of her thoughts printed in italic font on thick, cream-colored paper, at $600 a copy. (She published it from 1965 to 2011.)In December 2008, Ken Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, escorted Ms. Davis as his date to a black-tie dinner at which he received the Banker of the Year award from the newspaper American Banker.Ms. Davis sometimes sounded like a voice from Main Street when she questioned chief executives at shareholder meetings. But at the 2008 gala with Mr. Lewis, she carried none of Main Street\u2019s anger at the country\u2019s biggest banks.The financial crisis was raging at the time, and Mr. Lewis was under fire for Bank of America\u2019s purchases of two teetering financial firms, Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch. But Ms. Davis said she still thought he was all right.When asked about the wave of foreclosures that were then pushing the United States economy into a deep recession, she said, \u201cI feel bad for all of these people who lost so much, but you have to expect that Wall Street is not a one-way street.\u201dEvelyn Yvonne DeJong was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in Amsterdam, the daughter of Herman H. and Marianna (Witteboon) DeJong. Her mother was a psychologist, her father a neurologist. The family was wealthy; Ms. Davis liked to say that she had been born on the wrong side of the Atlantic Ocean but on \u201cthe very right side of the tracks.\u201dThe DeJongs\u2019 Jewish roots made them a target of the invading Nazis after World War II began. Evelyn and several other members of her family were arrested. She was imprisoned for a time in a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia before she was released. Making her way to the United States, she, her parents and her brother, Rudolph, settled near Washington in 1942.After graduating from high school she attended Western Maryland University and George Washington University but did not graduate. She later moved to New York and began investing in companies and public bonds, using money she had inherited from her father when he died in 1956.Though she bought shares in more than 80 companies, Ms. Davis kept a significant portion of her money in safe, low-yielding bonds, which helped her weather several stock market slumps. Tax filings show her charitable foundation had assets of more than $11 million at the end of 2017.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018She married William Henry Davis, an accountant, a few months after her father\u2019s death. The marriage ended, after just 18 months, in divorce, as did three subsequent marriages \u2014 to Marvin Knudsen, Walter Froh Jr. and James Patterson. She kept Mr. Davis\u2019s surname.\u201cMoving fast is a habit with me,\u201d she wrote in 1970 after her second divorce. \u201cMy last marriage lasted only two months.\u201dOne stone boasts that she had been recognized \u201cby several presidents\u201d at White House news conferences. (She obtained White House press credentials because of her newsletter.)Ms. Davis saw to it that she would be remembered after her death in other ways as well. A spokesman for her foundation said she had left instructions to distribute most of its millions to a list of universities, hospitals and arts centers.She also directed that a portion of the money be used for something else: the maintenance of the plaques the charities would install in recognition of her donations. She asked that they remain intact and that they be polished in perpetuity.\u201cThe executor of my estate will check on this every six months,\u201d she told The Washington Post in 1995, \u201cto make sure I don\u2019t get double-crossed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia Likely to Block Hong Kong Company\u2019s Bid for Gas Pipeline", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY \u2014 Li Ka-shing may be one of the most influential businessmen in Asia, but that reputation \u2014 and fear of Chinese influence \u2014 is working against his company\u2019s ambitions to buy a critical gas operation in Australia.The Australian government, seeking to balance national security interests and economic growth, said on Wednesday that it was likely to block CK Group, a company led by Mr. Li, a Hong Kong billionaire, from acquiring APA Group, the country\u2019s largest gas and pipeline company. A final decision is expected in two weeks, according to a Treasury statement.In February, Australia\u2019s Treasury announced it was tightening rules on investments in electricity and agriculture because of questions about China\u2019s influence on such deals. As much as $90 billion in Chinese investment has flowed to Australia since 2007.Australia\u2019s treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said his \u201cpreliminary view\u201d of CK Group\u2019s bid of 12.98 billion Australian dollars ($9.6 billion) was to turn it down because it \u201cwould be contrary to the national interest.\u201d\u201cI have formed this view on the grounds that it would result in an undue concentration of foreign ownership by a single company group in our most significant gas transmission business,\u201d Mr. Frydenberg said in a statement.CK Group said in a separate statement that \u201cthe preliminary view is not an adverse reflection on the CK Group, and that the Australian Government welcomes CK Group\u2019s investments in Australia and its broader contribution to the Australian economy.\u201dMr. Li\u2019s companies already have substantial interests in Australia, but their attempts at acquiring utilities have had mixed results. The Australian government cleared the group\u2019s takeover of gas and electricity distributor Duet Group in 2017; a year earlier it had blocked a joint bid for a state electricity distributor.This year, as the bid for the gas pipeline was under review and scrutiny over foreign acquisitions increased, CK Group attempted to allay concerns about the Chinese government\u2019s influence.The bid was cleared by the Australian competition watchdog but needed approval from by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Treasurer.The review board was unable to reach a unanimous recommendation, according to Mr. Frydenberg\u2019s statement. While the competition watchdog approved the bid, it hadn\u2019t considered \u201cthe concentration of foreign ownership.\u201dMr. Frydenberg said that APA Group\u2019s size, which accounts for 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) of pipelines, representing 56 percent of Australia\u2019s gas pipeline transmission system, was among his biggest concerns regarding the bid. The operation also includes three-quarters of all pipeline along the country\u2019s eastern coast.Government officials said at the time that the law was not aimed at any single country but the decision came months after newly released Australian electoral returns showed businesses with links to China had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to political parties in 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America Is Rejecting More Legal Immigrants Than Ever Before ", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump says he wants more immigrants to come in legally. The economy needs them. So why are we making it so hard? Mr. Bier analyzes immigration issues for the Cato Institute.

{"Headline": "The Fight Against Malaria Has Reached a Standstill", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthDeaths from the disease plummeted from 2000 to 2013, but are now stuck at over 400,000 a year. Donor giving is flat, and some countries are not doing enough to protect their citizens.Without openly criticizing any particular country, officials made it clear that some are doing too little to protect their citizens. \u201cThe past year has seen lights and shadows,\u201d said Dr. Pedro L. Alonso, the W.H.O.\u2019s malaria program director.Pakistan, Ethiopia, Rwanda and India did well, he said. India had 3 million fewer cases in 2017 than in 2016, a 24 percent drop.By contrast, Nigeria, Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Mali, Niger, Indonesia, Burkina Faso and a few others are losing ground to the disease.Nigeria, which has a quarter of all the world\u2019s malaria cases, reported 1.3 million more last year than in 2016, the report said.Latin America sees only a few hundred malaria deaths each year, but they increased last year, especially in Venezuela, where the economy has collapsed.For the first time, China reported zero cases transmitted within its borders. Donor governments, Dr. Alonso said, must double what they now give if they hope to push new infection rates down fast enough to meet targets for 2030 set by the United Nations.But global contributions to the fight against malaria \u2014 and against AIDS and tuberculosis as well \u2014 have been essentially flat since the 2008 financial crisis. Of the roughly $3 billion a year spent to turn back malaria, the United States is by far the biggest contributor, giving almost 40 percent of all funding. That has not changed under the Trump administration.\u201cThere is bipartisan support in Congress, not specifically dependent on any administration,\u201d Dr. Alonso said.The chief vehicle for donations is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis; its next tri-annual fund-raising round will take place in October in Paris.But donors have complained that some countries have become too dependent and must spend more of their own money.Success, both doctors said, depends chiefly on strong political leadership in each country.Even though malaria cases in Nigeria have doubled since 2010, according to the report, it spends far less per capita on the disease than many other African countries.Asked why Nigeria did so poorly even though it is a major oil exporter, Dr. Alonso said he would not blame any individual country. Nigeria is a \u201chotbed of transmission,\u201d he said, with a decentralized government and a fast-growing population.Technical problems have not yet dragged down the modern campaign against malaria as they slowly destroyed the one that began in the 1950s. That drive fell apart when mosquitoes developed resistance to DDT and the parasites became immune to chloroquine, the miracle treatment rolled out after World War II. Although resistance to the modern miracle drug, artemisinin, has appeared, it is still largely confined to Southeast Asia.   Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Views of Angela Merkel\u2019s Legacy: Stoic Leadership, and Economic Malpractice", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut many economists take a less generous view of the German chancellor\u2019s place in modern European history. Far from a hero who anchored the bloc under profound challenges, she played a leading role in amplifying an economic crisis, allowing it to erupt into an existential threat to the European Union and its shared euro currency. The resulting distress has undermined faith in the European bloc while fueling anti-establishment grievances across the Continent.Like many national leaders, Ms. Merkel, time and again, catered to domestic political interests at the expense of broader European concerns, dismissing calls that Germany\u2019s prodigious savings be put on the line to rescue debt-saturated members of the bloc. She impeded measures aimed at coordinating banking rules and public spending across national boundaries.She adamantly opposed debt forgiveness to Greece, even as it teetered toward insolvency, and even as joblessness exceeded 27 percent \u2014 a special source of outrage given that German banks were primary lenders in Greece\u2019s catastrophic explosion of borrowing.\u201cShe was at the heart of the design of the flawed Greek program, which not only imposed austerity, but most importantly resisted restructuring the debt in order to save the German and French banks,\u201d said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist at Columbia University in New York. \u201cThe rhetoric that she used suggested that the crisis was caused by irresponsible behavior by Greece, rather than irresponsibility on the part of the lender.\u201dIn place of public spending to soften the edges of the crisis, Ms. Merkel used Germany\u2019s power as the largest economy in Europe to force troubled governments to slash support for pensions, health care and education. In the process, the moves helped lengthen and deepen a devastating economic downturn.\u201cThis is what history will remember, a complete mismanagement,\u201d said Amandine Crespy, a political scientist at the Institute for European Studies at the Free University of Brussels. \u201cAusterity very clearly has deepened or even created this great gap, political fragmentation between the north and the south, between the debtors and the creditor countries that is very, very difficult to fix, and has had dramatic political consequences in terms of fueling the populist forces.\u201dSifting through history is a complex exercise open to divergent interpretations. One can never know how events might have transpired absent some variable. Anyone in Ms. Merkel\u2019s position would have found the going difficult. She oversaw Europe\u2019s most powerful country during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, then the European debt crisis, and then the surge of immigrants from some of the poorest, most troubled nations on earth.Some argue that no German chancellor could have held on to the office while behaving much differently in the realm of economic policy. Given a deep cultural proclivity toward thrift, moral revulsion over debt and a fear of rising prices dating to the hyperinflation after World War I, Germans were aghast at any arrangement in which their savings were on the hook for the recklessness of Greeks and Italians.\u201cShe had to sell German voters on the idea that Germany would send resources to bail out European countries that were already engaged in irresponsible policies,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at Luiss, a university in Rome. \u201cThat was the problem. Politically, it\u2019s really hard to criticize Merkel.\u201dIn Mr. Borri\u2019s view, Italy and other nations on Europe\u2019s southern periphery did receive a significant infusion of wealth from the north when the euro was created nearly two decades ago. Investors began lending money to Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal at rates that were practically the same as those in Germany, no longer demanding a premium for extra risk. Here was a choice dividend from sharing a currency with Germany and its rock-solid credit.\u201cThese are de facto transfers from rich to poor countries,\u201d Mr. Borri said. \u201cRather than use this money to reform their economies, these countries increased their spending.\u201dBut other economists say Ms. Merkel squandered an opportunity to use the crisis as a teachable moment that could have altered German public opinion. She might have fostered a sense of responsibility in Germany to see the nation as a primary beneficiary of the European Union, with the responsibility to aid those in distress.Europe\u2019s economic troubles have frequently centered on a dearth of faith in the endurance of the euro, the currency shared by 19 members of the bloc. Since the euro\u2019s inception, critics have warned that it is structurally unsound \u2014 a currency union lacking an accompanying political apparatus to coordinate policy and collective aid when trouble emerges.Under the guidance of Ms. Merkel and her famously unsentimental finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany effectively used the crisis as an elaborate demonstration of the euro\u2019s foundational defects. As they bickered with European counterparts over the principles that should apply to the Greek rescue, they delayed help and exposed global markets to the possibility that none might be forthcoming. A currency championed as a source of European solidarity was exposed as an impetus for discord.As the crisis mounted in the early part of this decade, reformists called for collective action. Europe needed rules governing all of its banks along with insurance for depositors to lift confidence in the financial system. The worst-hit countries needed relief from European rules limiting deficit spending.Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble maintained a hard line aimed at protecting German taxpayers from having to pay for the supposed sins of profligate spenders in sunnier climes. In tones of moral admonishment, they prescribed structural adjustment \u2014 rules making it easier to fire workers \u2014 along with more cuts to public budgets.\u201cThere is no crisis of the euro itself,\u201d Ms. Merkel declared in a 2012 speech delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cThere is a debt crisis.

Indebtedness is the biggest danger and the greatest risk to prosperity on this continent.\u201dBut these measures happened with Ms. Merkel\u2019s reluctant assent. The delays and dysfunction that played out publicly along the way instilled no confidence in the sanctity of the euro or the solidarity of Europe\u2019s leaders.\u201cThe euro crisis started getting better the moment Europe decided to go against what Merkel said the policies should be,\u201d said Christian Odendahl, Berlin-based chief economist at the Center for European Reform, a research institution. \u201cThe euro crisis got better not because of but despite Merkel.\u201dUltimately, Ms. Merkel fueled the notion that Europe\u2019s crisis was a morality play in which prudent nations in the north would school their reckless counterparts in the south on the virtues of living within their means.Such depictions seem likely to outlast Ms. Merkel herself, making it difficult to imagine Europe\u2019s summoning the unity to bolster itself against the next crisis.\u201cShe helped shape the mind-set of the Germans,\u201d said Mr. Stiglitz, the Nobel-laureate economist. \u201cShe shifted it in a very ugly way, and that makes it very difficult to change the framework of the eurozone. She could have reframed it. That would have been leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran Sanctions and Oil Prices: Who\u2019ll Feel the Pain? ", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarkets have taken the Trump administration\u2019s move in stride so far. But experts differ on whether a reduction in output could yet prove disruptive.HOUSTON \u2014 The world\u2019s oil producers and their customers entered a new period of uncertainty on Monday as renewed American economic sanctions against Iran took effect. It is a gamble that could eventually cost American consumers at the gasoline pump. But the initial impact has been relatively benign. Oil prices have been declining in recent weeks, even with sanctions on the horizon. The sanctions take aim not only at Iranian oil exports, but also at international shipping companies, banks, insurers and port operators doing business with Iran. United States trade with Iran is already tightly controlled, but the administration is threatening to exclude international companies from the American financial system if they trade, finance or otherwise serve the interest of Iranian oil exports.Companies are effectively given the choice of doing business with Iran or with the United States, which has a much bigger economy and a more lucrative market.The Trump administration has given waivers to eight countries, including such major buyers of Iranian crude as China, India and Japan, permitting them to continue imports. American officials say the waivers are temporary and conditioned on steady reductions of imports.The oil market has been surprisingly resilient, and prices ended a bit lower on Monday. Many energy experts had expected oil prices to soar, as they did when the Obama administration led an international sanctions effort in 2011 and 2012 to force Tehran to the nuclear bargaining table and pushed oil above $100 a barrel. This time, the international price is around $73 a barrel \u2014 West Texas intermediate, the American benchmark, trades about $10 cheaper \u2014 after falling by more than $10 over the last month. All told, the sanctions would then cut roughly 2 percent of global oil supplies.Oil traders have been calmed by the administration\u2019s waivers, signaling a more gradual approach that allows European and Asian customers to find suppliers to replace the Iranian crude. The prospects of a tightening oil market sent prices higher earlier in the year, which encouraged producers to pump more oil. As a result, the lost Iranian barrels have been replaced by oil from the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The United States and Russia have both reached output records of over 11.3 million barrels a day, while members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have increased production to the highest levels in two years despite declines in Venezuela and Iran. As more oil pipelines and export terminals are built in Texas and along the Gulf of Mexico, American exports could increase considerably. At the same time, demand for oil has slackened in China and around the developing world because those economies are slowing. Both developments are restraining prices.So far, drivers have been spared major pain.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Monday was $2.76, according to the AAA auto club, 5 cents less than a week ago and 15 cents lower than a month ago. Still, the average is 24 cents higher than it was a year ago.But some experts think that oil supplies could become tighter over time, especially during the driving season next summer, pushing prices higher.More expensive oil also means higher prices for aviation fuel, which frequently are passed on to the traveling public. They also can mean higher prices for plastics \u2014 and for natural gas, which can affect electricity rates.Much will depend on how Iran responds to the sanctions, and how successful it is in smuggling oil through Kurdistan and Turkey. If Iran threatens to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial passage for Persian Gulf oil, prices would probably jump. Any military moves or cyberattacks against Saudi Arabia or Israel could have a similar effect. An escalation of hostilities in Yemen, where Iran backs a militia force in a proxy war with the Saudis, could threaten other oil-shipping choke points.Some oil experts say world supplies are ample enough to keep the sanctions from driving prices higher. Barclays analysts expect Brent crude, the global benchmark, to sell next year for an average of $72 a barrel, near the current level. But some Western experts foresee a much higher price. \u201cThe market is overestimating the amount of oil that could come on,\u201d said Mr. Badiali of Banyan Hill. \u201cCan the world produce an extra 500,000 barrels a day? I don\u2019t see it.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Drives the Russian State", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo understand what makes Putin and his allies act the way they do, you need to look beyond the myths.Mr. Baunov is a policy analyst and journalist. MOSCOW \u2014 Since Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, analysis of Russia, both inside and outside the country, has largely focused on two interpretations of his regime. The first argues that Russia is a mafia state in which the main aim of the ruling elite is to steal money at home to conceal and spend abroad. The second states that Mr. Putin is a hostage of his own popularity and that whatever is done in or by Russia is done for the sake of his approval rating.These theories provide a convenient framework for making sense of Russia; they are also tinged with moralism. For these reasons, many politicians, analysts and scholars both in Russia and in the West have embraced them. But these explanations fundamentally clash with reality. To truly understand what motivates the Kremlin, we must see how the Kremlin itself undermines those myths.So what does this all tell us? Why does the Russian regime risk, again and again, taking actions to threaten the personal wealth of Mr. Putin\u2019s associates or damage the president\u2019s popularity? Because Russia is not the Philippines or Guatemala. The Russian elite has global ambitions. Mr. Putin and his associates believe that Russia should project its power across the world, economically, militarily and politically.These ambitions, rooted in Russia\u2019s size and its history, have existed for centuries. They were weakened by Moscow\u2019s defeat in the Cold War, when a major sector of the Russian elite decided that the best choice was simply to join the winning team \u2014 the West. But that was only temporary.Consequently, Russia has been flexing its muscles around the world in recent years, deploying troops to Ukraine and Syria, undertaking cyberoperations and trying \u2014 sometimes successfully \u2014 to find allies in its struggle for a \u201cmultipolar world\u201d among political forces in the Philippines, Africa, Europe and Latin America. Sometimes this engenders pushback from the West, but it is all part of a strategy.Put together, these are the factors that analysts and policymakers need to understand, especially these days as Russia \u2014 and Mr. Putin \u2014 occupy so much of the Western imagination. Other Soviet leaders declared that their ambition was to \u201ccatch up and overtake the West.\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s goal is something else. He and his backers among the Russian elite have found that it\u2019s not only impossible to catch up with the West but also impossible to overtake it. They want to build an alternative.Alexander Baunov is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center and the editor in chief of Carnegie.ru.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Brazil Chose Similar Leaders. It May Lead to Smoother Relations.", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The United States and Brazil have been uneasy allies during the best of times.\u201cWe might be on the verge of a golden era of relations,\u201d said Fernando Cutz, a former senior White House official who worked on Latin America policy in the Obama and Trump administrations. \u201cTrump and Bolsonaro will really hit it off. Their personalities are almost identical and their policy views are very similar.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro\u2019s enthusiasm for closer ties with the United States is among the starkest signs that Brazil\u2019s foreign policy is about to undergo profound changes.As a candidate, the incoming president denounced the alliances and foreign policy of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, which governed Brazil from 2003 to 2016. During that period, Brazil fostered close commercial ties with China, championed Cuba\u2019s authoritarian government and was a pillar of multilateral alliances that excluded the United States.In recent interviews, Mr. Bolsonaro has suggested that Brazil could relocate its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, following a similar move by Mr. Trump, and raised the possibility of severing diplomatic relations with Cuba.His team\u2019s priority, though, is clearly to build a strong partnership with the Trump administration. Key surrogates have begun a charm offensive that appears designed to burnish the international image of Mr. Bolsonaro, who became notorious as a lawmaker by insulting minorities and praising Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship.One of the president\u2019s sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a federal lawmaker, plans to travel to the United States soon for what he called \u201ca preliminary effort to reach out and generate good will between Brazil and the United States, two friendly nations that drifted apart in recent years for ideological reasons.\u201dBrazil\u2019s new president and his son are certain to get a warm reception in Washington. Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Trump both rose to victory by running social-media-powered insurgent campaigns that took aim at the political establishment. Both were initially regarded by political analysts as too inexperienced and boorish to pull ahead. And both appear to relish escalating, rather than defusing, political fights.Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, recently applauded the election of Mr. Bolsonaro, whom he called a \u201clike-minded\u201d leader. The Trump administration has expressed hopes that a crop of new conservative heads of state in Latin America will help the United States undermine the leftist governments of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, which Mr. Bolton called \u201cthe troika of tyranny in this hemisphere.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro\u2019s rise comes as the patchwork of alliances of leftist governments created at the turn of the century in a bid to end Washington\u2019s hegemony in the region have largely disintegrated. Venezuela, which was a key axis of that network, has become a regional pariah under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whose mismanagement of the economy has led to an acute shortage of food and medicine.The humanitarian crisis there, which has caused an exodus of more than three million people, is likely to be at the top of the agenda with the United States when Mr. Bolsonaro takes office.\u201cIf prodded by the United States, Brazil could take a stronger public stance against the Maduro regime, using the influx of refugees as its excuse to act,\u201d said Jana Nelson, a former State Department official who worked on Brazil policy. \u201cThe main challenge would be convincing other countries in Latin America to work with the Bolsonaro administration, whose reputation as a harsh non-politically correct leader precedes him.\u201dAnd as a candidate, Mr. Bolsonaro visited Taiwan, angering Beijing, which considers the island part of its territory. He also raised alarm at China\u2019s growing influence in Latin America, expressing unease at the prospect of letting Chinese companies buy significant stakes in Brazilian state companies.That wariness puts him in sync with the Trump administration, which is pushing back on the approach China has taken to investing in and lending money to developing economies.However, analysts said Mr. Bolsonaro would have limited leverage in blunting China\u2019s interests in Brazil without angering key constituencies that have come to depend heavily on the Chinese market. China overtook the United States as Brazil\u2019s top trading partner roughly a decade ago; Brazil\u2019s economic growth hinges largely on expanding and diversifying its commercial relationship with Beijing.Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas university in S\u00e3o Paulo, predicted that Mr. Bolsonaro will come to recognize that maintaining close relations with China is crucial for Brazil.\u201cClose ties to the U.S. don\u2019t promise the same financial rewards,\u201d Mr. Stuenkel said. \u201cChina won\u2019t make Brazil choose Washington or Beijing as long as certain lines aren\u2019t crossed. The Chinese don\u2019t want love or open admiration, but someone they can count on not to be hostile.\u201dA new era of closer cooperation between the United States and Brazil could create \u201ca big opportunity to do things with a government that walks and talks and sounds like the one here,\u201d said Thomas Shannon, a former top State Department official who served as ambassador to Brazil.That could include a significant expansion of trade, broader security partnerships and increased cooperation on medical and scientific research, Mr. Shannon said. But he said there was good reason to be skeptical that the Trump administration would seize the opportunity.\u201cWhat worries me, quite frankly, is that we won\u2019t do things in a big strategic way,\u201d he said. Instead, the United States could \u201cjust try to get them to help us on Venezuela or Nicaragua and then walk away.\u201dThe White House and the State Department did not respond to a request for an interview about the Trump administration\u2019s outlook on the Bolsonaro era.Matias Spektor, another international relations professor at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas, said Brazil and the United States had last forged a strong and durable partnership in the 1940s, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt persuaded the Brazilian government to turn on Nazi Germany and join the alliance that won World War II.After democracy was restored in Brazil in the mid-1980s, following a 21-year military dictatorship that began with a coup backed by Washington, much of the political left in Brazil regarded the United States with suspicion and resentment.Over the years, attempts to improve relations have faltered because the matter was either not a priority for the American government or politically expedient in Brazil.\u201cHistorically it has been very hard,\u201d Mr. Spektor said. \u201cYou have to have conditions for alignment that are very specific.\u201dSince Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, Washington and Bras\u00edlia have expanded cooperation in security matters, particularly counternarcotics, said Mr. Cutz, the former White House official.\u201cWe have better relations than we used to have, more capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can only improve.\u201dA full-throated endorsement by Mr. Bolsonaro might have given past American administrations pause because of concerns about his commitment to democratic principles and human rights. But Mr. Cutz said there was little reason to believe the Trump administration would have reservations.\u201cThere is an argument to be made that if the United States quickly embraces Bolsonaro, we can help shape him,\u201d said Mr. Cutz, who was born in Brazil. \u201cIf we keep our distance, he is on his own.\u201dErnesto Londo\u00f1o reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Shasta Darlington from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Zealand Blocks Huawei, in Blow to Chinese Telecom Giant", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 New Zealand has blocked Huawei from supplying technology for a next-generation mobile data network in the country, joining the United States and other developed countries that see the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker as a security threat.\u201cThe U.S. advocates for secure telecoms networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence,\u201d the United States Embassy in Australia said in a statement on Wednesday.It added, \u201cWe routinely urge allies and friends to consider such risks and exercise similar vigilance in ensuring the security of their own telecoms networks and supply chains.\u201dHuawei said it was looking into the matter. \u201cAs the G.C.S.B. has noted, this is an ongoing process,\u201d the company said in a statement, referring to the Government Communications Security Bureau of New Zealand. \u201cWe will actively address any concerns and work together to find a way forward.\u201dHuawei says that it is a private company and is not controlled by Beijing.New Zealand\u2019s rejection further solidifies a wall that is increasingly dividing the world into two. There are places that will accept Chinese technology in sensitive areas like telecommunications, and places that won\u2019t. The United States government has long deemed Huawei and another Chinese hardware maker, ZTE, to be potential menaces to security and privacy. And American lawmakers have voiced concerns about the two companies\u2019 business in other wealthy countries such as South Korea.Elsewhere, especially in the developing world, Huawei\u2019s affordable equipment looks too good to turn down.On Tuesday, Papua New Guinea said that it would uphold an agreement with Huawei to build domestic internet cables, turning down a joint counteroffer from Australia, the United States and Japan.\u201cWe have an existing agreement,\u201d William Duma, the state investment minister for the Pacific island nation, told reporters. Huawei has already completed 60 percent of the $200 million project, which is financed by the Export-Import Bank of China. Mr. Duma said that made the 11th-hour effort from the Western powers \u201ca bit patronizing.\u201dThe competing offer comes as concerns have grown in Australia and allied nations about China\u2019s investments in the resource-rich island countries of the Pacific Ocean. This year, Australia agreed to fund an undersea communications cable linking Sydney with the Solomon Islands, following a similar deal with Papua New Guinea.Australian officials were worried that if the project went to Huawei, as the Solomon Islands had agreed in 2016, the Chinese company might gain access to Australia\u2019s internet infrastructure. In 2012, Huawei was barred out of security concerns from bidding on projects for Australia\u2019s national broadband network. The company has, however, sold equipment to Australian cellular operators.Last year, New Zealand became the first advanced economy to join China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious infrastructure program stretching through much of Asia that is widely seen as an effort to extend Beijing\u2019s political influence.But in a region in desperate need of infrastructure, officials may take funding where they can get it, said Mr. Duma, the Papua New Guinea minister.Security concerns are \u201cfor the big boys to worry about,\u201d he said.The joint offer that Papua New Guinea rejected on Tuesday came too late, said Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific islands program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. Still, he said, it was meant to show that the United States and its allies remain a viable alternative to China\u2019s money and influence.\u201cWe\u2019d like to show that we\u2019re still in this game,\u201d Mr. Pryke said, referring to the position of the three allies. \u201cWe wanted to maintain our position as a partner of choice.\u201dOfficials from Pacific island countries have also complained about the West\u2019s paternalistic approach in providing aid packages. Still, the United States and its allies are trying to adapt.This month, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Japan said they would help Papua New Guinea significantly expand its electrical grid.

{"Headline": "Visions of a Tech Hub? Landing Amazon Is Just a Start", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Amazon announced plans to build a second headquarters somewhere in North America, it set off a competition for a sort of new-economy golden ticket, a chance for one city to become, almost overnight, a magnet for the high-paying jobs and entrepreneurial spark that are hallmarks of urban success in the 21st century.Critics were just as quick to highlight potential downsides: soaring housing costs, clogged roads and strained public resources.A year later, Amazon appears poised to transform two communities, not just one. But the central question \u2014 will that transformation be for the good or the bad? \u2014 has not changed. Economists, urban planners and other experts say the answer could hinge on decisions in the coming months by the company and by the state and local officials who worked so hard to woo it.\u201cThis is not about a one-time deal,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThis is about whether Amazon and these winning communities are going to create a long-term partnership to minimize the negative impact of supersonic growth.\u201dAmazon may have made that job a bit easier. Splitting the project, known as HQ2, between two cities should ease the pressure on housing and infrastructure that critics have feared. And the company seems to have zeroed in on places able to handle an influx of workers.\u201cThose two markets were in the leading edge of rental slowdowns,\u201d said Aaron Terrazas, a Zillow economist. \u201cThere is definitely a lot more supply in those markets than there was in Seattle a decade ago.\u201dThe specter of Seattle has loomed over the HQ2 debate. Its economy has boomed since Amazon moved into the South Lake Union neighborhood in 2007. But many residents complain that growth has come at the cost of affordability and livability. Although Amazon has never said so explicitly, its tense relationship with its native city may have contributed to its decision to search for a second home.In New York and Virginia, Amazon has a chance for a fresh start. And those places have an opportunity to learn from Seattle\u2019s mistakes.\u201cWhen Amazon moved into its South Lake Union headquarters, no one knew that it was going to become the global phenomenon that it is today,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said. \u201cIn Seattle there was a lot of catch-up in housing development, catch-up in infrastructure.\u201dNew York and Virginia, by contrast, can start planning immediately to build housing, expand infrastructure and improve transit systems. If they do, Amazon could be the nudge that regions needed to address longstanding challenges, said Sarah Rosen Wartell, president of the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\u201cThere is a way that something like this focuses the mind,\u201d Ms. Wartell said. \u201cAmazon or no Amazon, all of our major housing markets and communities that are thriving are dealing with the consequences of growth.\u201dThe key is ensuring that policies benefit all residents, not just highly paid tech workers that Amazon will employ directly, Ms. Wartell said. That means building housing for low- and middle-income families, not just luxury condominiums, and improving transit options in poorer neighborhoods.Critics are skeptical of that prospect. Lauren Jacobs, executive director of the Partnership for Working Families, a network of local advocacy organizations, said Amazon should make specific promises to train and hire workers locally, rather than just bringing them in from out of town.\u201cMany of our neighbors are still struggling in this economy, and this could be an amazing transformational thing to have 25,000 jobs come to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to ensure we don\u2019t see another wave of mass displacement of working-class residents.\u201dTimothy J. Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has studied tax incentives, said comments such as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s were concerning. He and other economists worry about a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d where state and local governments compete to offer ever-bigger subsidies.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to hand out cash, and it\u2019s especially easy to hand out cash if it\u2019s going to be the next governor\u2019s problem,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.But not all incentives are created equal, he noted. Efforts to streamline regulatory and permitting processes, for example, can make projects more attractive to companies without costing taxpayers much if anything. And investments in infrastructure or job training can reap benefits for the community even if they are initially promised as a way to help a specific company.\u201cI would be trying to leverage this into improvements that wouldn\u2019t just benefit Amazon but benefit you more broadly,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.New York and Washington, of course, are a far cry from the rural Southeast. And white-collar tech jobs at Amazon require different skills than the factory jobs created by Mercedes and BMW.But Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, pointed to parallels. Amazon and other technology companies employ not just hotshot graduates of Stanford and Caltech but also thousands of lower-level programmers, data analysts and other workers who have technical skills but not advanced degrees.Amazon\u2019s decision could change the pecking order among technology hubs, in which New York and Washington have lagged behind San Francisco, Seattle and Boston.\u201cI think it does set these cities up to be rivals to Silicon Valley a generation or two down the road,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt could be the catalyst.\u201dAmazon\u2019s arrival will also mean more demand for the pool of tech workers in New York and Washington. That worries some start-ups, who already compete with Google, Facebook and other giants that have set up offices there.But Sam Mandel, senior vice president at Betaworks, a company that develops and invests in start-ups, said Amazon would be a net benefit for the tech sector.\u201cThere will be more people leaving Amazon and wanting to do earlier stage start-ups than there will be people leaving start-ups to go work at Amazon,\u201d Mr. Mandel said.Erin Griffith contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taiwan\u2019s President Quits as Party Chief After Stinging Losses in Local Races", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 The president of Taiwan resigned as leader of her party Saturday night after it suffered stunning local election defeats to the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China.The self-ruled island\u2019s political landscape was shaken up by voters who delivered a sharp rebuke to President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s governing Democratic Progressive Party, or D.P.P., in elections contesting more than 11,000 seats from city mayors to neighborhood wardens. The results of the election, which was seen as a referendum on Ms. Tsai\u2019s first two years in office, have given the Kuomintang a new lease on life and complicated Ms. Tsai\u2019s bid for re-election 14 months from now.Shortly after it became apparent that the D.P.P. would lose crucial mayoral races, Ms. Tsai resigned her position as party leader, raising the possibility that she would be challenged for her party\u2019s nomination for the presidential election in January 2020.\u201cAs this party\u2019s chair, I take full responsibility for the outcome of today\u2019s local elections,\u201d she said at a hastily assembled news conference at D.P.P. headquarters in Taipei. \u201cPeople believe in democratic values \u2014 today democracy taught us a lesson.\u201dOpposition Kuomintang mayoral candidates won in Taiwan\u2019s three largest cities \u2014 New Taipei City, Taichung and Kaohsiung. The Kaohsiung contest was especially stinging for the D.P.P., which has held the mayor\u2019s office for 20 years and considered the southern city a political stronghold.Han Kuo-yu, the Kuomintang\u2019s candidate for mayor in Kaohsiung, emerged as the story of the election, defeating his D.P.P. opponent, Chen Chi-mai, who at the outset of the election campaign had been expected to win easily.\u201cAll of Taiwan, all of the ethnic Chinese worldwide, can see the change in Kaohsiung,\u201d Mr. Han said in his victory speech at a large rally. Before the election, he attained celebrity status for his populist and occasionally politically incorrect style. In the final weeks of campaigning, he took that popularity on the road, stumping for Kuomintang candidates around Taiwan, which may have helped decide several close races.Ko Wen-je, the independent mayor of Taipei and one of the most popular politicians in Taiwan, appears to have barely defeated his Kuomintang opponent, Ting Shou-chung. The close outcome may make Mr. Ko less likely to throw his hat into the ring in the presidential campaign. Mr. Ting has contested the result.Mayors in Taiwan are similar in stature to governors in the United States, and the Kuomintang mayors offer potential new dialogue partners for Beijing, which refuses to engage with Ms. Tsai and could use them to further isolate her and increase China\u2019s involvement in Taiwan politics.The Communist Party of China seeks to annex Taiwan, which it has never ruled, and refuses to speak with Ms. Tsai unless she accepts the stance held by her Kuomintang predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, that Taiwan and China are both part of the same country, with potentially different interpretations of what that country is on either side of the Strait.While China is always a factor, Taiwanese voters also had plenty of local concerns in this election, including stagnant wage growth and severe air pollution in the island\u2019s south.Several referendum questions concerned same-sex marriage, with voters expressing overwhelming opposition to it. They also supported the removal of gender equity content from school textbooks, which is seen as a major factor behind the strong support for gay rights among Taiwanese youth.Speaking at an election result viewing party in the Wenshan district of Taipei, a Kuomintang volunteer, Lin Mei-chuan, said she disapproved of the Tsai administration\u2019s handling of the economy as well as relations with China.\u201cPeople want a change,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for someone else to run things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The phones even come pre-loaded with campaign apps.\u201cThey are misusing state machinery for personal gains,\u201d said one worker._____The intelligence agency had always been hesitant to definitively point fingers in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.But two sets of communications swayed the agency: intercepts of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s calls in the days before the killing, and calls by the kill team to a senior aide immediately after.The agency\u2019s new assessment adds pressure on the Trump administration to punish the kingdom, a longtime American ally and the centerpiece of its Middle East policy._____\u2022 Developers circle a rural patch of Hong Kong.The wetlands, hemmed by the skyscrapers in Hong Kong and the Chinese city of Shenzhen, are home to rare birds, traditional shrimp ponds and eucalyptus trees \u2014 a lush respite from the city\u2019s bustle.For decades, landowners have sought \u2014 and failed \u2014 to develop the area, as preservationists pushed back.But the people who visit the area, often cyclists and nature lovers, fear that the development companies will eventually win out.\u201cPeople in Hong Kong only care about the economy,\u201d said one cyclist.__________Tips for a more fulfilling life.Today, China leads the world in its number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent of the population. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.This kind of reporting isn\u2019t easy. It requires having people on the ground with the smarts and experience to ask the right questions, and the tenacity to keep asking until they get to the truth. That can be especially tough in a place like China, where the government is both secretive and thin-skinned.So I hope you\u2019ll enjoy this project and discuss it with your friends. You can also write in with your comments. A global conversation about what China\u2019s rise means for the world is long overdue.Sincerely,Philip P. PanThe Grammys have revoked an award only once.They also admitted to lip-syncing at their many shows, and blamed their producer for putting them up to it.The scandal cost them the 1989 Grammy for Best New Artist \u2014 and their careers.Since then, Milli Vanilli has become pop culture shorthand for fraud. Last month, Nicki Minaj referenced the group in a thinly veiled shot at her rival, Cardi B.We\u2019ll never know if Milli Vanilli was actually years ahead of its time.Andrew R.

{"Headline": "House and Senate Latest, Obama Asks a Question, Beto Video: 3 Days to Go", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Tip SheetWelcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters.\u2022 A consensus is emerging among Democratic and Republican strategists \u2014 based on public and private polling, early voting and likely turnout \u2014 that Democrats are on track to pick up about 35 seats in the House of Representatives in Tuesday\u2019s elections. Republicans now have a 23-seat House majority.\u2022 There\u2019s anxiety about that number on both sides. Democrats don\u2019t want expectations rising for a massive wave which many in the party still doubt is coming. And Republicans don\u2019t want a mood of despair to set in when they believe there\u2019s still a chance they could hang on.\u2022 But the number does reflect the reality of polls in suburban districts as well as the tenacity of some Republicans in exurban districts, who would have to lose in order for Democrats to win more than 40 seats.\u2022 Both parties\u2019 projections are more bullish for Democrats than they were two weeks ago, when the consensus was that Democrats were on track to win between 25 and 35 seats. But many Republican lawmakers remain mired in the mid-40s or lower in the polls, a warning sign for incumbents this late in the campaign.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.\u2022 Even some of the most cautious Democratic strategists have come around to saying the House is moving their way.\u2022 Caveat! The election is Tuesday. The best predictions are sometimes wrong. And despite the projections, neither side is convinced that a Democratic majority is inevitable.By the fourth or fifth heckler, former President Barack Obama had an observation.\u201cWhy is it,\u201d he began, at a campaign rally Friday in Miami, \u201cthat the folks who won the last election are so mad all the time?\u201dAfter his own victory, \u201cat least my side felt pretty good,\u201d Mr. Obama continued. \u201cIt tells you something.\u201dOf course, Mr. Obama also found cause to ridicule Republicans for taking credit for the strong economy.\u201cWhere do you think that started?\u201d he asked, noting that the same people had insisted the economy was in terrible shape while encouraging numbers were rolling in on his watch.The migrant caravan was the talk of the Texas Senate campaign on Friday, a day after the conservative group Project Veritas released a video purporting to show staffers for Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic candidate, \u201cusing campaign resources to buy supplies and help transport Honduran aliens.\u201dSenator Ted Cruz cited the report at a morning rally in Fort Worth, saying Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign was using campaign funds to illegally aid the migrants. He recounted a joke about Mr. O\u2019Rourke wanting to cross the border to \u201cwelcome\u201d the migrants in Mexico.\u201cMaybe the welcome baskets and foot massages were not a joke,\u201d he said, to a cheering crowd of supporters.Keep in mind:\u2022 Led by President Trump, Republican efforts to make the caravan an issue in the midterm races may be working. Several Cruz supporters said they believed the migrant caravan poses an imminent threat to the state. When Mr. Cruz asked how many in the crowd of several hundred had already voted, nearly all raised their hands. Early voting in Texas ended Friday.For Representative Chris Collins, the 2020 election may be the second-most important day of that year; his insider trading trial is to begin on Feb. 3.But before Mr. Collins, a Republican from western New York, needs to worry about either 2020 date, he must first contend with his re-election this year \u2014 an off-again, on-again campaign that bears little resemblance to other incumbents\u2019 efforts.He is also suffering among donors: Mr. McMurray\u2019s campaign raised roughly $520,000 in the most recent quarterly reporting period, compared with Mr. Collins\u2019 $33,000. Of that, only $80 came from people in his district.Still, Mr. Collins may be a slight favorite. Mr. McMurray, the town supervisor of Grand Island, N.Y., has had to go through a crash-course transition from sacrificial candidate to one carrying the burden of unseating an indicted incumbent \u2014 albeit a Republican incumbent in a district that President Trump carried by 25 points in 2016.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned with Mr. McMurray in Lancaster, N.Y., last week and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee started spending money on his campaign in mid-October.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article said Beto O\u2019Rourke had never led Senator Ted Cruz in a public poll this year. Mr. O\u2019Rouke had a lead in three online polls this fall.Lisa Lerer and Tyler Jakes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Students Are Saying About: Housing the Homeless, Pimple Positivity and a Giant Machine", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationThis week, we received the most comments on our writing prompts of the school year so far \u2014 and some of the best. With students\u2019 excellent writing, interesting personal stories and smart insights, it gets harder and harder to choose our favorite comments.We especially enjoyed reading about their solutions to homelessness, their attitudes about acne and social media, and their creative interpretations of an Op-Art illustration. Read on to see what they had to say.Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.__________As usual, they impressed us with their thoughtfulness, honesty and empathy. They told us why they would and wouldn\u2019t let a stranger live in their backyards and offered even more solutions for how to help the homeless.I would let a homeless person live in my backyard. Often times in our society people do not think about helping anyone except themselves. It is this type of attitude that can hold people back. Although my city has a low homeless population, it is still present. By providing a home for someone out of luck you could change their life. Allow them to feed their family, to not have to chose between clothing and a house over their head. You take away the stress of finding shelter and safety for the night, and allow them to build their life up again. To help other people is to help ourselves. What type of society would we live in if we only cared for people when they were rich? Just because they are without a home does not mean they don\u2019t deserve to be treated like a human.If I were given the opportunity to let a homeless person live in my backyard, I would most definitely help them and let them live there. I feel as though being there for others in your community who are struggling is a responsibility that you must accept as a member of the community. Opening up my backyard to the homeless would be my way of helping out in the community.Most Definitely I would let a homeless person live in my backyard. Growing up I have always been taught to treat others how you want to be treated and that would come in to play if I was ever faced with this situation. The statement in the article \u201c I believe that when God blesses you, it\u2019s to bless someone else \u201d really hits home because I know how blessed I am to have a roof over my head, clothes on my body, and food to eat because there are so many people out there who are not as fortunate and I want to be able to provide things for them. If I can have all these things but I don\u2019t share them then what is is the point of having them?I definitely would. The reason I would do this is that just because someone doesn\u2019t have as much money as you to afford a home, does not mean that they should be living on the streets with no food or water. Each and every person should have an equal opportunity to get a job to earn money, even if they have been down the wrong path in the past.Questions of safety and privacyI, personally, would not want a homeless person to live in my backyard unless I knew their situation and knew they were doing everything in their power to help themselves. It might just be that I haven\u2019t witnessed it a lot and I don\u2019t grasp completely how much of a problem homelessness is, but there are safety precautions that I would need to know are keeping me safe. In Ames, IA we don\u2019t have many homeless people that you see on a day to day basis. The only time I\u2019ve seen a homeless person is off the interstate exits, asking for money. Just because I don\u2019t experience it everyday, that doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t a problem for larger cities.I do not feel that I would let a homeless person live in my backyard. I think that the concept is great and for the people that are receiving the help they need it\u2019s great for them. I am one of those people that would be more than happy to share a lunch with them, or give them money or something but to me my home is my personal space and I would not want someone that I don\u2019t know living in my personal space \u2026 In my community, homelessness is not as big of a factor that it maybe is in other communities and so maybe that is why i don\u2019t feel such affection for having homeless live with me. I feel that if I can help in other communities, I would, but the living with me part is just a little too much for me to do at this time right now.How to help the homelessYes, I would let a homeless person live in my backyard, provided that they are using the house to work toward solving other issues in their life, such as seeking help for illnesses/addictions, finding a job, raising their family in a stable environment, etc. I would not give a house to someone who is simply using it as a free place to stay, while not addressing the issues that made them homeless in the first place.The problem of not having shelter is foremost in the minds of people experiencing homelessness, as shelter is one of the basic needs for survival. While this problem persists, homeless people are unable to devote energy to other matters. The first step toward solving homelessness is to give homeless people a home\u2013once this basic need has been met, a person can devote energy to other matters (seeking counseling, applying for jobs, etc.) that will eventually make the person self-sufficient.This is why I believe giving a stable, permanent housing situation to homeless people will be a successful solution. It recognizes that the base upon which all other solutions to homeless can be built is simply having reliable shelter. Traditional approaches that tout self-reformation first (getting help for addictions, finding a job) fail to recognize that people can\u2019t address those issues without having a stable place to stay first.In my town, homelessness is present but also assisted. We have multiple outlets for food, shelter, and supplies to aid homelessness in the area. There are a lot of good connections through these, however, I understand that it can be much more difficult in rural areas, and in larger cities, where supply and demand of help don\u2019t work out as nicely. Because not every area has the community organizations for diminishing the effects of homelessness, the incentive-based pilot programs are a great idea in my opinion.I agree with the article that homelessness is a problem that needs to be fixed however, there are other solutions to help that do not involve sharing your property with someone that you do not know. Instead of paying someone $1,500 a month to someone who opened up their backyard, that money could be used to help build establishments and create programs for people who face this problem.__________They told us about their experiences with breakouts, as well as the shame that often accompanies them. Some commenters said the trend has made them feel more comfortable in their own skin, while others were less convinced. But all showed a remarkable awareness of how social media influences their sense of self-worth.The power of the mediaI have definitely noticed a change in the way people view acne, especially with the rise of these body and skin positivity movements through social media. Seeing celebrities like Kendall Jenner post photos with no makeup and imperfect skin shows people that even celebrities, the most famous and well-regarded people in the world, have flaws just like the rest of us.Humans inherently compare ourselves to others, it\u2019s part of our need to fit in. When the media only shows us perfection, we feel worse about ourselves and our looks. Seeing others embrace their acne on social media for the world to see helps induce confidence to those who are too scared to do the same. Personally, it has helped me feel more confident in my own skin, and I don\u2019t feel the need to cover up every minor blemish or pimple with makeup in order to be confident.The quality of content on the internet has evolved to the point where anything less perfection is ridiculed heavily. To combat the negative ridicule many influencers and celebrities have embraced not being perfect through posting pictures of them having acne, makes ugly faces, and posing in unflattering poses.These influencers have a lot more power than people might think because many kids and adults idolize them. When they show their imperfections it can help the people who idolize them think \u201cthey are perfect, but they do have their moments as well\u201d. This helps everyone put into perspective that these influencers are people too when it can be hard to notice through the heavily filtered and edited content they post.The skin positivity movement I don\u2019t think has reached teenagers and is only present on social media by a few big-name celebrities. I think that what they are trying to do and promote is amazing, however, acne and pimples are still somewhat of a taboo or shaming topic. Tabloids write headlines about a picture of a movie star with a pimple or blotchy skin. These news outlets shaming celebrities for not wearing makeup to cover \u201cflaws\u201d catches the attention of teenagers way more. Negativity trumps positivity in most people\u2019s brains. Media as a whole needs to make this movement larger in order for it to have a larger impact.Changing attitudesI can hands down say that the skin positivity movement has really changed the way I think about my own acne. I used to be so insecure about the way my face looked and the red pimples that would pop up every morning. I wanted to be seen as one of those \u201cperfect\u201d girls on Instagram who have flawless skin. But as this movement became a trend, I started to realise that no matter how perfect people may seem, they still have imperfections and insecurities. We are human after all. It should not be embarrassing or shameful to have acne. Almost everyone in the world will experience a pimple or two in their lifetime. It is just part of the process of growing up. Although it is hard to get rid of the societal pressure to be perfect, I feel like this movement is slowly making others feel more comfortable and confident in their own skin.As a someone that struggles with persistent acne I am thankful that society is trying to erase the stigma behind my biggest insecurity. Although at times I still feel the self criticism when I have a pimple, and the first instinct is to cover it up and find some remedy to get rid of it. There is still a cycle of shame because everyone around me seemed to have perfect skin; I was never made fun of because of my skin, but the internal warfare in my brain made me feel like everyone was staring at my acne.I am so glad that nowadays society has accepted the truth: almost everyone has acne. This push towards self care and embracing your flaws has created a larger conversation about how to improve skin and overall healthy habits. I feel now that I can discuss acne and we commiserate over the same types of problems. As we embrace reality, we learn that these flaws are actually part of the human condition; no one is alone in their acne struggles.Cultural shift? Not so muchWhile the online skin positivity movement is admirable, I don\u2019t believe that my generation is quite ready to be pioneers when it comes to accepting acne. As someone who attends high school and deals with acne at a higher magnitude than most of my peers, I can safely say that blemishes are not close to being considered cool.Acne is primarily associated with adolescence, a period in life that is associated with the awkwardness and immaturity. It is associated with uncleanliness and shame. From teen media peppering acne on the faces of undesirable stereotypes to magazines insisting that you\u2019re one diet-cut away from clear pores, it is difficult for anyone to see acne as anything but undesirable. Attitudes around acne can evolve in social media, but it is going to take a cultural shift to effectively change the associations that firmly root acne as something embarrassing.It is common knowledge that dealing with acne is a typical ritual for teenagers worldwide; Its like a right of passage. I will be honest, acne is something I have really been struggling with lately, and I believe that many can relate. There seems to be a social expectation for someone to have clear skin, and look \u201cpretty\u201d, but that is not always an easy feat \u2026Hailey Wait\u2019s bare faced pictures were different; she was confident, but with her acne. I\u2019m not sure that there has been a great shift in the bravery of teens to face their pimple problems, but I do hope that her message acts as a call to action for kids my age to increase their confidence, and maybe go make-up free once in a while. I would love for a more welcoming and accepting community to be instilled for both teens and their pimples.__________Big governmentIn this picture prompt, I believe that the machine represents the American government. It is controlled entirely by itself, and there is no outside influence whatsoever. There appear to be three figures atop the machine, but they are truly apart of it even if they seem to be in control.The machine is marching forward and destroying all protesters, and the bystanders who ignore the destruction aren\u2019t harmed at all. There are a few people who are attempting to climb the machine and destroy it, and there are others who are in front of it prepared to fight. They are standing up to the machine and its destruction, but they will most likely be destroyed as well. If enough people stand up to the machine, eventually they will take it down. To me, the machine is a great symbol for our government because it shows how powerful our \u201cdemocracy\u201d actually is.For me atleast this is a representation of the government taking control while all the people try to stop it but they are too small to make a difference. Notice how small the people look trying to stop it, this probably symbolizes how little the people can do to take try and take over or stop the machine. It would take everyone to even try and make as difference.One way i think the machine represents the government is the three heads. One head is the legislative, the middle one is judicial and the final head is executive. the people dont want the government to be in control. they want their own beliefs to stand tall and they are trying to stop the government because the government puts their own filters on these beliefs.In this picture prompt, most people seem to be ignoring the machine and its destruction. Some are standing and just watching without raising a fight, while others completely have their backs turned. This could symbolize the amount of people who refuse to vote, so they technically are ignoring the destruction of other people and the country. If people don\u2019t get out and vote, the machine of a government we have will keep destroying our people and our nation. The government is too powerful for its own good.Powerful technologyI believe the picture of the machine represents more of technology than anything else. I see it as it\u2019s taking over. Kind of like in the transformer movies. Its coming into are world and taking over our everyday lives. Ruining our worlds. In the picture you can see the machine has no expression, because it doesn\u2019t care.Technology is destroying the human race. Killing us every day, weather it be distracted driving, or people sitting on the couch all day and not getting exercise. It\u2019s horrible. You phone isn\u2019t ever going to care for you so why do we treat them like our best friends. Its taking over the world and we are sitting back letting it happen.This picture to me is showing how people are sometimes more obsessed with bells and whistles than actual technological progress. Take Apple for instance, they consistently brag up new features such as battery life or pressure sensitive screens, however they don\u2019t have wholey new things. For example, they can\u2019t defend against cyber attacks or hacking better than anyone else \u2026Money and statusI think the image is representing the higher class of people with more money in their financial state. I only believe this because the statues is gold and underneath there are people trying to climb to get to the top and be as wealthy as the higher class. Some are struggling to climb and some have a good grip, but the statue is sturdy.I also think this also shows how corrupt the world can be. People can try so hard to be part of something (the people climbing) and still fail to reach to the top. And instead they all have to live in the small houses that are around the statue. Most of the houses look like barns or run down homes, they are all about the same design. All of the people can represent the lower class.I think this picture represents the 1% having a majority of the wealth. While the minority has the majority, the majority is trying to climb up the ladder to become rich. While the rich \u201cplow over\u201d the people below them. While the rich sit on a throne of gold and have golden suits the normal people are stuck on the ground. The rich sit there on a golden car that\u2019s extravagant and over the top the people are stuck, with nothing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Woozy With Moderation", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCan Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado run for president as a centrist?Contributing Opinion Writer\u201cHow do I get from here to there?\u201d I asked a cop. I thought it was a reasonable question.\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he replied, summing up the Trump era in a single phrase.So I stood there, along with a score of other New Yorkers, waiting for Mr. Trump to pass. At last his motorcade appeared, and as it did, people on both sides of the street spontaneously raised their arms and flipped our chief executive the bird.Governor Hickenlooper, an optimistic, pro-business, pragmatic centrist, might seem, at first, like a long shot for the Democratic nomination. But then, in considering a post-Trump era, it is hard to imagine anything.He and I had been aspiring to a conversation for years now, as part of a tiny cohort of people (about 15 since 1970) who attended the same high school and the same college \u2014 the Haverford School, in Pennsylvania, and Wesleyan University, in Connecticut. Six years apart, we did not know each other when we were young. But as I\u2019ve grown older, I\u2019ve sometimes wondered: To what extent are we \u2014 a brewery owner turned governor and an English teacher turned transgender activist \u2014 the result of the educations we received?We both arrived at Haverford feeling uncertain, self-conscious. We both left Wesleyan with a sense of purpose.Haverford helped, a little. It was getting to play sports, he said, that first gave him some confidence, even though his dyslexia made the classroom difficult. (This was the exact opposite of my own experience, where I loved learning Latin and German and reading Thomas Mann, but found sports in general, and the locker room in particular, an endless mortification.)Wesleyan helped, too. Like me, Mr. Hickenlooper majored in English. But it was a final semester course in geology that changed his life: \u201cI took six pages of notes, more notes than I had ever taken in any English class, and just became enraptured. That\u2019s when I really came alive.\u201d After graduation, he returned for an extra year as a special student. \u201cI took calculus and chemistry and physics \u2014 all that stuff I\u2019d never done before but I was really good at,\u201d he said. \u201cI just kind of discovered a new part of myself. And that was my road to self-confidence.\u201dThat road would lead to working for a petroleum company in Colorado, and after that, to opening a brewery in Denver. He became the city\u2019s mayor, and in 2011, the governor.It\u2019s been a long time since anyone spoke about \u201cthe politics of joy\u201d in America, a phrase once associated with Vice President Hubert Humphrey. But there\u2019s a gentle ebullience to Mr. Hickenlooper. \u201cThere\u2019s a word called topophilia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means love of place. Isn\u2019t that a form of joy, a sense of belonging? Isn\u2019t it one of the ingredients that creates a happy, fulfilled life \u2014 loving where you are? Well, part of that is knowing where you are, knowing the wonderfulness of your history.\u201dWhat\u2019s the ultimate goal? I asked. \u201cWe want to create joy, to a certain extent,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut quality of life starts with a good job.\u201dI took my leave of the governor and headed out into the New York morning, my head woozy with moderation. True, he hadn\u2019t left me with the same sense of wonder I\u2019d felt after being in a room for the first time with Barack Obama. But I was left with something else: a generousness of spirit, a sense of humor. Is that enough to carry John Hickenlooper all the way to the White House?It might be.As I headed west, I saw that the barricades erected for the passing of Donald Trump had been dismantled. Two hours earlier, I\u2019d stood there with New Yorkers, our progress impeded.But now President Trump was gone, and nothing barred the way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SoftBank Chief Won\u2019t Shun Saudi Arabia Despite Killing", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chief executive of the SoftBank Group of Japan denounced the killing of a prominent dissident in a Saudi consulate in Turkey \u2014 but said he would not cut ties with the Saudi Arabian government.The remarks by the SoftBank chief, Masayoshi Son, on Monday were his first public comments on the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who entered the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and never emerged. Turkey has said Mr. Khashoggi was beaten and tortured before being beheaded and dismembered.But Mr. Son\u2019s comments also highlight a basic fact: Despite the outrage directed at Saudi Arabia over the killing, big companies are unwilling to cut off the kingdom as a lucrative client.For SoftBank in particular, Saudi Arabia is a crucial part of its future.The company, a Japanese internet, energy and financial conglomerate, has increasingly staked its future on its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund. The biggest technology investment firm in the world, the Vision Fund owns stakes in Uber, the co-working space provider WeWork and more.The success of the Vision Fund has bolstered its parent\u2019s earnings. SoftBank on Monday reported a second-quarter profit of 526.4 billion yen, or $4.6 billion, up fivefold from the same time a year ago, thanks to the Vision Fund\u2019s sale of its stake in the Indian e-commerce company Flipkart to Walmart.Mr. Son said on Monday that he predicted the Vision Fund to propel even more growth at SoftBank. \u201cNext year, we will far exceed the scale we are seeing this year and maybe a scale that Japanese economy has never experienced before,\u201d he told analysts.Mr. Son said on Monday that he had raised his concerns about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing with Prince Mohammed and other senior Saudi officials, asking for \u201cfurther clarity on this tragic case.\u201d\u201cThey said they are taking this very seriously,\u201d Mr. Son said.But he made it clear that he would not abandon his business interests in Saudi Arabia.\u201cWe want to see those responsible held accountable,\u201d Mr. Son said during a news conference at his company\u2019s earnings presentation in Tokyo. \u201cAt the same time, we have also accepted responsibility to the people of Saudi Arabia, an obligation we take quite seriously to help them manage their financial resources and diversify their economy.\u201d\u201cAs horrible as this event was, we cannot turn our backs on the Saudi people, as we work to help them in their continued efforts to reform and modernize their society,\u201d he said.Mr. Son said companies have not refused to accept money from his fund because of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing.He said \u201cthere are complicated issues\u201d in the relationships between the United States and Saudi Arabia as well as between Japan and Saudi Arabia.He added that \u201cas a businessman, I believe I should not be involved in the political side of such a case.\u201dLiz Alderman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nissan and Renault Wrestle With the Fallout From Carlos Ghosn\u2019s Arrest", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProsecutors in Japan are investigating claims that Mr. Ghosn, who is also chairman of Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, underreported his taxable income by half for several years.Following an emergency meeting of the Renault board on Tuesday, the company said Mr. Ghosn would remain chairman and chief executive, but described him as \u201ctemporarily incapacitated.\u201d The chief operating officer, Thierry Bollor\u00e9, will assume Mr. Ghosn\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities until the situation is resolved, and the board\u2019s lead independent director, Philippe Lagayette, will temporarily take over as chairman.One of the auto industry\u2019s most prominent executives, Mr. Ghosn was arrested on Monday in Japan and held for questioning, but has not yet been charged. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Tokyo said it could hold him for 72 hours but, with a court\u2019s approval, could extend the detention an additional 20 days before it decided whether to indict him.Mr. Ghosn created the alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, and has been hailed for rethinking how vehicle manufacturers could share technologies and innovate in a competitive global market. His arrest stunned the sector and sent Nissan\u2019s share price falling to a two-year low on Tuesday.The French economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Tuesday that Mr. Ghosn was \u201cno longer in a position capable of leading Renault\u201d because of his troubles in Japan.But Mr. Le Maire said France had no evidence of the crimes that Mr. Ghosn has been accused of committing in Japan, and would not call for his removal from the board of Renault, a French corporate icon.In a joint statement released Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Le Maire and Hiroshige Seko, the Japanese economic minister, said that they had spoken by phone and \u201creaffirmed the strong support of the French and Japanese governments to the alliance formed between Renault and Nissan.\u201dMr. Ghosn was detained on his private jet at Haneda Airport, which serves Tokyo, after a whistle-blower at Nissan made allegations that he had underreported compensation to the Japanese government. Another executive, Greg Kelly, whom authorities described as the architect of the scheme, was also arrested.Neither Mr. Ghosn nor Mr. Kelly could be reached for comment.After a monthslong internal inquiry, Nissan said it was planning to strip Mr. Ghosn of his position as chairman when its board meets on Thursday.Ratings agencies warned of the scandal\u2019s financial impact. Standard & Poor\u2019s said it could downgrade Nissan\u2019s credit rating over the allegations, a move that would raise the company\u2019s borrowing costs.Nissan\u2019s profitability could \u201cweaken substantially\u201d in the fiscal years 2018 and 2019 if it turned out that Mr. Ghosn\u2019s alleged misconduct had hurt sales or the company\u2019s alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, the S & P said in a statement.Moody\u2019s Investors Service said that the scandal raised questions about Nissan\u2019s compliance and control systems \u201cgiven such an incident occurred and seemingly went unreported for some time,\u201d and that it could affect the company\u2019s credit rating.Mr. Ghosn instituted sweeping changes at Nissan beginning in 1999 and created a working arrangement between Nissan and Renault that allowed them to operate like a single carmaker. In 2016, that agreement included Mitsubishi and all three shared the cost of developing models and cooperated on their supply chains. In 2017, the alliance accounted for the sale of 10.6 million cars.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s swift downfall raised questions about the stability of the alliance as well as of the individual carmakers.That prospect is particularly worrisome in France, where Renault has more than 47,000 workers.Renault has a 43 percent stake in Nissan, and Nissan holds a 15 percent share of Renault \u2014 the same size as that of the French government. As one of Japan\u2019s best-selling carmakers, Nissan is the heavyweight partner in the alliance.President Emmanuel Macron of France, who is facing political challenges at home and plunging poll numbers, can ill afford to see Renault stumble. He called on Monday for the alliance to stick together, saying that the state would be \u201cextremely vigilant\u201d about its future.France\u2019s influential CFE-CGC labor union said it was worried about Renault\u2019s future, and urged that \u201call measures be taken to preserve the interests of the Renault group and the alliance.\u201dIn Japan, Mitsubishi announced that it was planning to conduct an internal investigation into whether Mr. Ghosn might have also \u201cengaged in misconduct\u201d there by similarly underreporting his compensation.Mr. Le Maire said the authorities in France had found nothing suspicious in Mr. Ghosn\u2019s activities in that country. \u201cThere is nothing special to report on the fiscal situation of Mr. Ghosn in France,\u201d he said. But, he added, if the allegations by Nissan in Japan were true, \u201cit would be of considerable gravity.\u201d\u201cConcealment and tax evasion is particularly troubling when one holds an influential position and a very high salary,\u201d he said.In an internal memo to employees on Monday, Mr. Bollor\u00e9 expressed \u201cfull support\u201d for Mr. Ghosn and said management would defend Renault\u2019s corporate interests.Neither Nissan nor Mitsubishi signaled a possible successor. But S. & P. said in its note that rebuilding Nissan\u2019s management structure could be a challenge.\u201cAlthough Nissan said it aims to identify its governance issues and hammer out preventive measures, we think rebuilding its management culture swiftly will not be easy,\u201d the ratings agency said.Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

Or, at least, cover him far less? He thrives on the attention. Withhold your coverage and starve him of oxygen.Liberals, frustrated by Trump and his dominance of the news cycle, often make this case to me.Why don\u2019t we in the media focus on other things, important policy issues, rather than on the last intemperate thing that Trump said or did?I understand the frustration, but I also know that what people are asking is, on the one hand, impossible and on the other hand, particularly in print, already happening, but not necessarily being elevated.There is no way for the media \u2014 define media however you will \u2014 to simply ignore a sitting president of the United States. That would not only be a dereliction of duty, it would also be folly.As for the policy machinations, those stories are often covered, but they are rarely splashy news because by their very nature they are technical and bureaucratic.There is always room for the news media to do better, to tweak and adjust its allocation of resources, its areas of coverage and its promotion of stories.But there is another side to the news equation: not those who deliver the news but those who consume it. The other side is you and I as readers, watchers, clickers, listeners, posters, likers and retweeters.On the consumption side, we have also become governed by the gravity of the moment, and are so outraged by the dishonesty, villainy, corruption and divisiveness that we appear to be attracted, to a large degree, to that which underscores and feeds our fury.But I also think that steadfast determination to resist and rebuke the improprieties of this administration doesn\u2019t mean that our lives have to be dominated by stress and negativity. That to me seems self-immolating.As was the case in late 2016, Trump is a more frequent topic of conversation for liberal Democrats than for other Democrats or among Republicans. Currently, 42 percent of liberal Democrats say Trump\u2019s presidency comes up in conversations very often; that is double the share of conservatives and moderates who say this.This column, ironically, only adds to this Trump-focused dialogue and illustrates the issue, but I digress.The same survey found that 63 percent of liberals say talking politics with people they disagree with is \u201cstressful and frustrating,\u201d compared with 51 percent of conservatives and moderates.Trump is dominating liberal discussion in a way that I think could be damaging to us in the long term.When you obsess about a problem, you have less energy and passion to pursue solutions. When you fret over every outrage, you elevate those outrages. Stories trend because consumers engage with them, clicking and sharing them, not because the news media dictates that they trend.I think it would be a solid and beneficial step for us all to simply come to the realizations: Trump is going to Trump. He\u2019s going to lie. He\u2019s going to wink at the racists and Nazis. He\u2019s going to demean women. He\u2019s going to embarrass this country. It\u2019s all going to happen.Nevertheless, we can take this stand unequivocally: It is all unacceptable and we stand in opposition to it. It is not normal and must never be met as such.But we must also focus on the future.There is an exciting new class of left-leaning legislators joining Congress who bring with them fresh blood and fresh ideas. Democrats will control the House, all of its committees and its legislative calendar.The underlying shifts in the electorate suggest President Trump may have to walk a precarious path to re-election in 2020, as several Midwestern states he won in 2016 threaten to slip away, and once-red states in the Southwest turn a purpler hue. The president\u2019s strategy of sowing racial division and stoking alarm about immigration failed to lift his party, and Democratic messaging about health care undercut the benefit Republicans hoped to gain from a strong economy.The 2020 presidential election promises a veritable smorgasbord of options on the left.Lastly, Robert Mueller is still on the job.Trumpism is a disease, and cursing it won\u2019t cure it. It has to be overwhelmed, and that can be done as the left began to do it this month: With diligence, policy-focused messaging, increased engagement and participation, and demand for decency.There is no easy way out of the Trump era, but there is a way forward, and it is not through hopeless pessimism.Remember that you can be thoroughly anti-Trump without being completely Trump-obsessed.Trump not only wants to control media coverage, he wants to control your attention. If he can\u2019t have your adoration, he\u2019ll settle for your anger. Either way, you are emotionally engaged with the egotist.Trump wants to grab you by the passion. Don\u2019t let him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bloomberg\u2019s Gift to College Students ", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byletterSThe $1.8 billion gift to Johns Hopkins is praised for its generosity, but some readers suggest that such a sum could be better spent to boost less elite institutions and students.To the Editor:In fact, it is a wonderful thing that is already happening at the City University of New York, where tuition is less than $7,000 per year at the four-year colleges, compared with more than $50,000 per year at Hopkins. The Bloomberg gift seeks to make elite colleges accessible to underserved populations. Why are these colleges \u201celite\u201d? Largely because they have money. At City College, where I work, we have incredible faculty who provide an education every bit as good as I got at Hopkins. But our classrooms and lab spaces are in need of repair and the latest technology, we lose some of our best faculty to wealthy schools that make offers with which we can\u2019t compete and we struggle with every tiny expenditure.Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s gift is a wonderful thing and transformative for students at Hopkins. Imagine the lives we could transform with an investment like that into our own city\u2019s engine of social mobility.To the Editor:This means that despite being one of the most economically diverse, selective institutions in the country, we are unable to offer admission to all of the well-qualified, highly deserving applicants to Smith. These students, from families with fewer economic resources, were rated highly by our admission staff even though they may have attended poorly performing high schools, did not have access to SAT prep courses, did not have paid tutors to edit their college essays, did not even dream about an overseas service learning experience during high school, and did their college tours online.Mr. Bloomberg hopes that his substantial gift to Johns Hopkins University will inspire his fellow alumni and those of other colleges to support financial aid. Let us pray that it is so. In today\u2019s knowledge economy, without college access there is no level playing field, there is no equity, there is no American dream. To the Editor:This donation could have been much more effective by targeting small businesses and entrepreneurs with low-interest loans and free or subsidized financial literacy classes, or by helping working-class folks go to trade schools and get out of government housing by teaching them the skills and creating the funding to build and own their own homes.There are so many more effective alternatives than covering the tuition to a single elite, extremely expensive institution. His worst suggestion was his request that others make similar donations, when they should be investing in their communities and encouraging entrepreneurship. To the Editor:There will be time enough to talk about the limited impact of even this historic gift, time to talk about systemic inequality, privilege and broken systems. And we should have those conversations.

{"Headline": "In Luxury, What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpeakers at The New York Times International Luxury Conference, held Nov. 12-13 in Hong Kong, were asked what will be the luxury industry\u2019s greatest challenge in the next five years, and what will be its greatest focus. Here\u2019s what they said. (Comments have been edited for length.)It is indeed a turbulent world but one that also brings opportunities. Looking out five years, we continue to see both challenges and opportunities in e-commerce. Digital innovation, globalization and changes in consumer spending habits will continue catapulting the fashion industry into the midst of further seismic shifts.The challenges we foresee will center on the decline of brand loyalty, due largely to market fragmentation. With large e-platforms dominating the space, consumers will continue to gravitate to the fastest, broadest or cheapest, hence why the experiential aspect of e-commerce will become more explored. One of the key strategies at Fosun is called C2M, customer to maker \u2014 essentially a digital connection between consumer needs and smart manufacturing.The greatest challenge for the luxury industry over the next five years is keeping up with the rapid pace of change in new retail technologies which will enable luxury brands to engage their consumers in new and innovative ways.Biggest challenge in next five years: global recession driven by a slowdown in China and withdrawal of central bank support in the United States and Europe.At Nike, we are privileged to begin every project through the lens of sport. It is intrinsically human. It is universal. We believe, and we always have, that Nike\u2019s strength is in accessing the inherent empathy of our playing field.The future of luxury will be defined by the strength of that relationship. Nike\u2019s greatest opportunity is to leverage emerging technologies and data-driven craft to forge a new vision of bespoke \u2014 one where all athletes are able to collaborate directly with Nike to solve their discrete problems, however big or small. With sport as focus, this reimagined bespoke is democratic and holds up emotional connection as a critical component.As time is perceived as being ever more critical and precious, the brick-and-mortar shopping experience is in danger, particularly as millennials embrace the online shopping experience with which they are so familiar. A quick poll of millennials with whom I interact indicated that they generally purchase 80 percent to 90 percent of non-grocery goods over the internet, including luxury items.As consumers become more impact-oriented and demand transparency into the way their items are created, the luxury industry will have to prove the provenance of goods and verify they are ethically and sustainably produced. Blockchain can be used to bring efficiency and transparency to supply chains, while eliminating corruptibility, as records cannot be improperly changed or deleted. Beyond benefits to supply-chain processes, blockchain can also be used to create new incentive structures for both consumers and producers of luxury goods.Luxury\u2019s greatest challenge in the next five years will be to address the impacts of technology, as technology will lead younger generations of consumers away from traditional expectations of retail.Luxury\u2019s greatest new focus during this same period will be a renewed commitment to outstanding retail experiences.The rate of change in terms of customer expectations has become increasingly rapid. We always ask ourselves: \u201cHow will the world shop for fashion in five, 10, 20 years?\u201d I think this has to be the focus for all of us in luxury.Today\u2019s digital-first customers have been exposed to ultra-personalized experiences. Our favorite apps and internet companies know us, our preferences and give us an experience that is truly personalized. It is what consumers expect and demand. Offline retailers know nothing about us and learn nothing about us when we come in and after we leave.I think the most challenging part of our jobs is to figure out how to keep our brands relevant and meaningful for the future generation of clients.Digital has gone from being on the horizon to being where the growth in our industry will come from. Twenty-nine billion dollars in e-commerce today will become $150 billion by 2022, and that\u2019s just the direct sales \u2014 even our in-store transactions are influenced by interacting with brands online.As the luxury consumer is taking a new form, the ability to manage a brand\u2019s accessibility \u2014 while maintaining its exclusivity \u2014 will be the key to capturing and nurturing these clients. With this shift, now more than ever, influencers play an essential role in helping brands engage with this customer, acting as the middlemen to build relationships on behalf of the brands and serving as the trusted voices that consumers look to.Worldwide markets and consumer habits are changing radically and at an unprecedented pace. Our industry is changing more rapidly than ever before and companies must be ready to react at digital speed. In my view, to continue to play a leading role in the industry today, means to be as flexible as possible while keeping a strong vision and remaining faithful to the company\u2019s DNA.There is no reason to fight the change: Change must be embraced and welcomed. I believe that you must be open to change even when you are successful, without waiting the problems to come along. It\u2019s key to evolve rather than merely adapt.The greatest challenge is how to exploit the latest in technology to connect to consumers globally.In the long run, the Chinese consumer will continue to be a major growth engine for the global luxury industry, but their tastes and preferences are changing. We at J.P. Morgan believe that the greatest challenge the international luxury sector will face in the near future is maintaining the attention and interest of the growing Chinese wealthy class. Chinese consumers are starting to show a preference for local brands that offer high-quality products with designs tailored for unique domestic tastes. They are also beginning to hold back on spending as the markets become more volatile.Global luxury brands still have significant potential for growth in China, but global brands will have to continue to find new ways to attract consumers and maintain their loyalty.As Gen-Z consumers become increasingly important in terms of buying power and social influence, luxury players have to understand their psychologies, develop unique products and build authentic communications to engage with them.It is very important to embrace the benefits technology can provide and the tools to capture trends and data effectively. Data-driven analysis linked to e-commerce channels will be very powerful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May, Onetime Business Foe, Finds Corporate Embrace Amid Brexit Debate", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 From the purple-lit stage of a London ballroom on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain pitched her draft deal for leaving the European Union to an audience of business leaders who, not long ago, hardly hid their distaste for the prime minister.She had taken office two years ago complaining about corporate greed, threatening a crackdown on excessive pay and condemning free-market acolytes as \u201ccitizens of nowhere.\u201d This summer, her then-foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, poisoned relations further when he wielded a four-letter expletive to tell businesses how little he cared for their interests.Her deal was, well, a deal, and it granted businesses some certainty.That was enough for the business leaders sitting before her, though some urged the prime minister to soften proposed immigration restrictions after Britain\u2019s split from the union.\u201cShe put a deal on the table, which is the first time in two-and-a-half years that\u2019s been true,\u201d said Craig Beaumont, the director of external affairs and advocacy for the Federation of Small Businesses, who was in the audience. \u201cBusiness is accepting she\u2019s in a tough position but appreciating the progress she\u2019s made.\u201dCarolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said business leaders remained concerned about parts of Mrs. May\u2019s plan, particularly restrictions that the prime minister said would keep European Union migrants from \u201cjumping the queue\u201d to work in the United Kingdom after Brexit.Ms. Fairbairn said businesses worried about where new workers would come from, and rejected \u201cthe idea that anyone earning less than 30,000 pounds can\u2019t contribute to our economy.\u201d That amount is the equivalent of about $38,500.How much businesses\u2019 support will matter on these issues is a different question.Business leaders saw their political stock sink after trying in vain to warn people of the risks of leaving the union in 2016.Now they face having to make virtually the same pitch to conservative members of Parliament who, while sympathetic to business interests on the whole, tend to pay them little heed on the decades-old question of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with Europe.\u201cThere is an ideological attachment to Brexit that can supersede other stuff,\u201d said Professor Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe, a think tank. He described it as an \u201cissue that transcends the normal rules of politics.\u201dStill, Monday\u2019s meeting of the Confederation of British Industry was a soft launch for a business-oriented campaign on behalf of Mrs. May\u2019s deal, which will likely kick into high gear after the deal gets ratified by European leaders, as it is expected to on Sunday.That will set the stage for a mid-December vote on the deal in British Parliament, so long as the deal survives that long.Mr. Beaumont said his group would soon be delivering the results of a survey of small business owners to members of Parliament.The group plans to advocate, among other things, for government vouchers allowing small businesses to seek the help of consultants as they prepare for post-Brexit trade arrangements.With small business owners having only narrowly backed remaining in the union, Mr. Beaumont said he hoped his group would have more clout than most among politicians also needing to balance a split electorate.\u201cWhen we go into Parliament,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll be giving a view that doesn\u2019t come from either wing of this quite ideological debate.\u201dImperfect as Mrs. May\u2019s draft deal may be in the eyes of the majority of business leaders who opposed Britain\u2019s leaving the union, it met their tests for an orderly departure, business groups have said in recent days.It provided for a nearly two-year transition after the March split during which businesses could operate almost as if nothing had changed. It guaranteed that the entire United Kingdom would stay in a customs territory with Europe until leaders worked out a longer-term trade agreement, avoiding internal tariffs or quotas.Above all, it offered some clarity, a point Mrs. May stressed in her speech as she eschewed the bravado of the hard-line Brexiteers in her party and appealed to practical concerns.\u201cBecause we are not talking about political theory, but the reality of people\u2019s lives and livelihoods,\u201d Mrs. May said. \u201cJobs depend on us getting this right.\u201dIt was a measure of how desperately businesses are trying to avoid a so-called cliff-edge Brexit \u2014 in which Britain crashes out of the union without any arrangements being made for crucial supplies to cross the border \u2014 that the audience mostly embraced her draft plan.Few in the audience had likely forgotten their run-ins with the prime minister during her early months in office.It helps her cause with business interests that the opposition Labour party is led by Jeremy Corbyn, who wants to nationalize some industries.Analysts wonder, though, whether the government\u2019s campaign of late to scare people about the calamitous economic effects of leaving the union without a deal may have proved too persuasive. With the help of some businesses, Mrs. May and her team tried to make leaving without a deal look so unpalatable that some worry people began writing off the possibility.\u201cThey painted a picture of no-deal which is so bad that nobody credibly believes we will be allowed to fall into a no-deal situation,\u201d said Joey Jones, a former spokesman for Mrs. May who is now strategic counsel at Cicero, a consulting firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Washington State, 3 G.O.P. Districts That Could Flip", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 One district had been a Republican heartland of freight-haulers and timber-workers before a shift toward suburbs and tech. Another was historically Democratic from the power of the railroad unions, then veered toward the Republicans. A third is liberal on its western side, conservative to the east, and locked in a battle over which side will prevail.Washington State as a whole leans left these days, from the dominance in population of the Seattle area \u2014 both senators are Democrats, as are six of the 10 House members. But the state\u2019s three in-play districts do not fit that pattern, or really any pattern. All are starkly different from one another in economics, demographics, history and in the pitches that the candidates are making to voters.Here is a look at three key races that could be pivotal on Tuesday \u2014 though the results may not be known until the wee hours of Wednesday or later, given that ballots in the state\u2019s vote-by-mail election can be postmarked as late as Election Day itself.Railroads and a perfect climate for soft white winter wheat have shaped the huge Fifth District that stretches across Washington\u2019s east side from Canada to Oregon. Once, in another political era, Representative Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat and the former speaker of the House, dominated the district, but most of the current century has belonged to Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers.Ms. Rodgers, a Republican first elected in 2004, is the highest-ranking female Republican in the House, as chair of the Republican Conference, which articulates policies for the majority, and has mostly batted away challengers in recent elections like pesky flies.But the district, anchored by Spokane, Washington\u2019s second largest city after Seattle, has also been changing, becoming more urban and more politically and ethnically diverse. Some rural corners of the district have struggled, with about one in eight residents living below the poverty line, and some counties, in losing young people, have become among the fastest aging in the state. The power of the railroad unions that once backed politicians like Mr. Foley faded long ago.President Trump carried the district by 13 percentage points in 2016, while losing Washington as a whole, but his divisive brand of politics has not been considered helpful to Ms. Rodgers, making her district part of a huge swath of the nation \u2014 the entire Pacific Coast, much of the Northeast and large interior cities like Chicago and Minneapolis \u2014 where Republican lawmakers do not want to be seen with him.Early voting patterns suggest that both sides are energized, said Ben Stuckart, the Spokane City Council president, who supports Ms. Brown.\u201cThe more solid D\u2019s are turning out high and the more solid R\u2019s are turning out high, which kind of goes to the hardening of divisions,\u201d he said.Scanning a map, the Eighth District looks like it could be one of those gerrymandered snake districts, winding around to find certain kinds of voters. But the reality is that by winding through central Washington, the district captures much of the demographic drama that rolls through the Pacific Northwest in general. It has affluent Democratic-leaning voters from the techie eastern suburbs of Seattle, union workers from Boeing around the company\u2019s huge airplane factory in Renton, and conservative farmers and retirees to the east, many of whom have left the bigger coastal cities.As a measure of its divisions, the Eighth has a higher percentage of foreign-born residents than the state as a whole, many of them agricultural workers in the fruit industry, but also more rich people, with a higher percentage of households earning more than $200,000 than the state as a whole, according to the census.A voter-registration drive this fall on the campus of Central Washington University in Ellensburg, one of the district\u2019s biggest towns, might make a difference in a close race, said Ellensburg\u2019s mayor, Bruce Tabb. Or not. College students are inconsistent voters, at best.\u201cI\u2019ve talked to students who seem to be more engaged,\u201d said Mr. Tabb, who has a nonpartisan office and has not endorsed either candidate. \u201cBut it\u2019s a very, very challenging thing, I think, to actually determine what that impact is going to be.\u201dA key thing to know about the Third District is that a significant chunk of it is actually part of the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. While Portland is in another state, on the south bank of the Columbia River, and is famously liberal, the northern bank suburbs in the Third District, in and around Vancouver, Wash., in Clark County, are traditionally conservative.But Portland\u2019s little brother suburb has been growing up.\u201cClark County is the housing pressure release valve for the tri-county Portland region,\u201d said Thomas Kimpel, a senior analyst at the Washington State Office of Financial Management, which prepares demographic and economic research.Vancouver was the fourth fastest growing city in the state over the last decade, partly from Portlanders crossing the river to find cheaper housing, or perhaps for the taxes. (Washington has no income tax.) The economy of the district has also moved away from its old base of timber, agriculture and shipping toward a more Portland-like economy of tech and services.Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler \u2014 a Republican and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Ms. Rodgers in the Fifth District, for whom she worked as a legislative aide before running for office herself \u2014 is facing Carolyn Long, an associate professor of politics, philosophy and public affairs at Washington State University Vancouver.The 2016 presidential election map provides another clue to the shifting dynamics in Washington State. All the counties won by Mrs. Clinton except two were clustered in the state\u2019s northwest corner, in Seattle and its neighboring counties. One of two Clinton outliers was Whitman County in Ms. Rodger\u2019s district \u2014 home to Washington State University. The other was Clark County, in Ms. Beutler\u2019s district.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.When focused, Gov. Andrew Cuomo can be a nearly unstoppable force for progress.May that be the governor New Yorkers re-elect on Tuesday. New York needs nothing less to meet its biggest challenges: investing in a dangerously out-of-date subway system; supplying housing that more residents can afford; making it easier to vote, and passing ethics and voting reforms to enhance state politics and government. After two terms in office, the governor\u2019s list of accomplishments is substantial. It also includes\u00a0increasing the minimum wage, implementing paid family leave and setting to work rebuilding some of New York City\u2019s most essential infrastructure. But New Yorkers have reasons for disappointment in Mr. Cuomo as well. Faced with a deteriorating subway system, a threat to the region\u2019s work force and economy, the governor has refused to take full ownership of the problem and has instead let endless squabbling with Mr. de Blasio get in the way of substantial progress. While in the State Assembly, from 2007 to 2011, Mr. Molinaro voted against limiting access to firearms for domestic abusers. He voted against sensible rent regulations several times. He voted against a measure that would have stopped the shackling of pregnant prisoners while in labor. He opposed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s signature gun safety law. He says he has evolved on gay marriage, which he voted against while in the State Legislature but now sees as a civil right. He also voted against a proposal to allow unmarried partners to adopt a child. There\u2019s no doubt that Mr. Cuomo seeks to leave a lasting legacy in New York. To do so, he will need to keep his campaign promises. In a time of rising voter suppression nationally, New York also has the opportunity to serve as an example to the nation by making it easier to vote instead. That, however, will require Mr. Cuomo putting his considerable political muscle behind reforms, including early voting and no-excuse absentee ballots. Finally, there is the question of corruption. The governor has long said that he wants change, that he is as outraged by the dirty tricks in Albany as the public is. He needs, then, to do something about it. Creating an independent anticorruption body, providing for public financing of campaigns and closing the loophole that allows businesses called limited liability companies to bypass limits on corporate donations are all good places to start. To help ensure that the governor delivers on these important promises, it would behoove voters to also cast ballots to elect a Democratic State Senate. That\u2019s the best way to keep New York moving forward, and push all the politicians in Albany to lead with no more excuses.Advertisement"}

The profiles of the Democrats who made that swing happen.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]Many of the candidates for the House who turned red seats blue were women. A record number of them ran for Congress this year, and it seemed likely early Wednesday morning, even before all the counting of ballots was done, that the next Congress would also contain a record number of them: more than the 107 currently there. So a president who has acted and spoken with such vulgar disregard for women will deal with more female lawmakers than any of his predecessors did. That\u2019s a measure of sweet justice.Many of the candidates for the House who turned red seats blue were people of color. I think of Antonio Delgado in New York, whose blackness was something that Republicans dwelled on. I think of Colin Allred in Texas, who defeated a previously invincible Republican, Pete Sessions, who has been in Congress for two decades. I think of Lauren Underwood in Illinois, who was making her first bid for political office and wasn\u2019t initially given much of a chance. She proved the naysayers wrong.In a bellwether House race in Kansas, Sharice Davids defeated the Republican incumbent, Kevin Yoder. She\u2019s 38, openly gay and will be one of the first Native American women in Congress. The other, also elected on Tuesday, is Deb Haaland, a New Mexico Democrat.Ah, Kansas: Trump won the state in 2016 by more than 20 points, but on Tuesday, in the governor\u2019s race there, Kansans rejected a far-right candidate who was a darling of the president\u2019s \u2014 Kris Kobach \u2014 for a Democratic woman, Laura Kelly.She won handily, and Democrats picked up other governorships that had belonged to Republicans, for instance in Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin, where Scott Walker was denied a third term. Democrats will now govern all three states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 that handed Trump his margin of victory in the Electoral College.But on Tuesday, in House elections, Democrats prevailed among independents. They prevailed in suburbs. They prevailed in swing districts with candidates who showed plenty of prudent moderation.And they prevailed despite low unemployment numbers, wage growth and an overall economic picture that most Americans find positive. It wasn\u2019t \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d that drove what happened on Tuesday. It was Trump.He repeatedly told his supporters in the days leading up to the midterms that he was essentially on the ballot, and for once he wasn\u2019t boasting idly. Americans weighed in on him, and if it wasn\u2019t quite the spanking he had coming, it certainly wasn\u2019t a hug.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Economy and the Trump Rump", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy we went from regional divide to political chasm.Opinion ColumnistBut not everyone was in the running. From the beginning, Amazon specified that it would put the new facility only in a Democratic congressional district.Over the past generation, America\u2019s regions have experienced a profound economic divergence. Rich metropolitan areas have gotten even richer, attracting ever more of the nation\u2019s fastest growing industries. Meanwhile, small towns and rural areas have been bypassed, forming a sort of economic rump left behind by the knowledge economy.Amazon\u2019s headquarters criteria perfectly illustrate the forces behind that divergence. Businesses in the new economy want access to large pools of highly educated workers, which can be found only in big, rich metropolitan areas. And the location decisions of companies like Amazon draw even more high-skill workers to those areas.In other words, there\u2019s a cumulative, self-reinforcing process at work that is, in effect, dividing America into two economies. And this economic division is reflected in political division.In 2016, of course, the parts of America that are being left behind voted heavily for Donald Trump. News organizations responded with many, many, many profiles of rural Trump supporters sitting in diners.But this was, it turns out, fighting the last war. Trumpism turned America\u2019s lagging regions solid red, but the backlash against Trumpism has turned its growing regions solid blue. Some of the reporters interviewing guys in diners should have been talking to college-educated women in places like California\u2019s Orange County, a former ultraconservative stronghold that, come January, will be represented in Congress entirely by Democrats.Why have lagging regions turned right while successful regions turned left? It doesn\u2019t seem to be about economic self-interest. True, Trump promised to bring back traditional jobs in manufacturing and coal mining \u2014 but that promise was never credible. And the orthodox Republican policy agenda of cutting taxes and shrinking social programs, which is basically what Trump is following in practice, actually hurts lagging regions, which depend a lot on things like food stamps and disability payments, much more than it hurts successful areas.Can this chasm be bridged? Honestly, I doubt it.But restoring these regions\u2019 dynamism is much harder, because it means swimming against a powerful economic tide.So the bitter division we see in America \u2014 the ugliness infecting our politics \u2014 may have deep economic roots, and there may be no practical way to make it go away.America, then, is a divided nation, and is likely to stay that way for a while.

Rather than end the conversation, it has invited a new one that could go on for months, if not years.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a staunch Trump backer, said the crown prince wouldn\u2019t get \u201ca pass\u201d if he was making the world a more dangerous place. And Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said it was a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d for Mr. Trump to ignore the C.I.A.\u2019s assessment.\u201cIf the President does not reconsider what actions our government should take toward the Saudi Government & MbS, Congress must act instead,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.And House Democrats, fresh off their midterm triumphs, are also rattling their sabers.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he had been briefed by the C.I.A. and believed the president was being dishonest.\u201cI think, in part, he feels that by saying that we don\u2019t know or that the world is a dangerous place or everybody does it, he thinks it makes him look strong,\u201d Mr. Schiff said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIt actually makes him look weak.\u201dNot only has Mr. Trump increased the chances that Congress will enact restrictions on the Saudi royal family or make it harder to do business with the kingdom, he has prompted Democrats to question his financial ties to Saudi Arabia. Mr. Schiff, who is expected to take over as chairman of the Intelligence Committee when Democrats take control of the House in January, has promised to investigate those, too.\u201cIs his personal financial interest driving U.S. policy in the gulf?\u201d Mr. Schiff said on CNN. An investigation that examines not only the activities of the crown prince but any financial links that Mr. Trump may have with the kingdom would almost certainly be a ponderous affair, and cast a lingering cloud that would chill business leaders\u2019 enthusiasm for investment in, and from, the Saudis.Mr. Trump may think he has gained the loyalty of the crown prince by standing by him, but if Congress moves to enact sanctions, the economic fallout could be serious for the kingdom, which the president has been encouraging to hold down oil prices.Between the economic pressures that Saudi Arabia is increasingly facing \u2014 the price of oil is hovering around $50 a barrel when the kingdom needs it to sell for $70 to maintain its budget \u2014 and the executives who are rightly skittish about investing there, Mr. Trump may have pushed Congress toward taking actions that create more problems.In more normal times, the president of the United States would publicly condemn the crown prince and the kingdom, and extract some kind of concession that was meant to reflect American values. Such a response could have mollified critics of the kingdom and made possible a return to business as usual in six months.There\u2019s an argument to be made that by throwing his support behind the kingdom without any half-measures or virtue signaling, Mr. Trump is in a way being straight with the American people and the world. Even if there is something honest about his overtly candid approach in this case, diplomacy is in many ways about outcomes rather than honesty. And Mr. Trump has done more than just leave him and the United States open to criticism that we embrace despots as long as there is a buck to be made. He has inadvertently created more economic uncertainty for the business community that he says is so important to him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Singles Day Sales Top $30 Billion. The Party May Not Last.", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 After 24 hours of frenzied buying and selling, and weeks of advertising and promotions before it, the Alibaba Group announced that its sales hit another titanic high on Singles Day, the Nov. 11 shopping festival that the Chinese e-commerce behemoth cooked up a decade ago.This time, as China\u2019s vast economy slows, the party was held with icebergs in sight from the deck.But all around China, gloom and uncertainty are the word.Meanwhile, some young Chinese shoppers seem less enthused this year about celebrating manic consumerism.Yang Sun, a 26-year-old from the northern city of Xi\u2019an, said that the Singles Day discounts were no longer good enough to persuade her to wait all year to buy the things she wanted. Wang Xin, 24, an engineer in Shanghai, said he had rediscovered the joys of shopping offline.\u201cSingles Day just doesn\u2019t hold that much appeal for me,\u201d Mr. Wang said.Asked about the current mood among Chinese consumers, Joseph C. Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, told reporters on Sunday that Alibaba should be understood in the context of the epochal rise of China\u2019s middle class.\u201cThat trend is not going to stop, trade war or no trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cAny kind of short-term economic effects, we believe, will be cyclical.\u201dAlibaba is not like Amazon in that it is not a retailer. It merely provides the digital shelves and aisles for other merchants to sell their goods. But in its relentless ambition, Alibaba may be Amazon\u2019s only global equal. Both companies want to fulfill their customers\u2019 every desire and need.The business case for all this empire-building, Alibaba says, is that the company\u2019s lakes of commercial data give it a leg up in anything that requires understanding customers or merchants.But Wall Street is still waiting for results, and has grown skeptical in the meantime of the costs of expanding into new areas. Alibaba\u2019s shares have lost nearly one-third of their value since June.Singles Day 2018 showed that Alibaba remains, if nothing else, China\u2019s king of hype. During the broadcast event, the M.C.s periodically encouraged people watching at home to open up their phones and check out the great deals. As acrobats with Cirque du Soleil twirled in midair, the logo of Kukahome, a Chinese furniture maker, shone brightly behind them.At one point, the performer Liu Wei rapped out the specs of a new model of Skoda sport utility vehicle.Anna Lin, a 25-year-old who works in finance in Shanghai, said she was feeling more lukewarm about the whole thing than in years past. Singles Day is now just one of many big shopping festivals each year, she said.Plus, Ms. Lin said, the Singles Day promotions have become increasingly baroque. This year, there were coupons for specific items and brands, coupons that were available only at certain times of day, and coupons that appeared randomly and could be grabbed only by playing a game. Gathering friends into a team could help you collect even more coupons.\u201cThat\u2019s too much work,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cIt also isn\u2019t worth it when you realize that after you\u2019ve done all that, all you\u2019ve got is 10 to 15 percent off, or even less.\u201d\u201cMy time is more valuable than that,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cI honestly think all the math is a way to hide the fact that there isn\u2019t much of a discount.\u201dAlibaba does not lack for other methods of subtle persuasion on Singles Day. If you had opened your Taobao shopping app on Sunday, you would have seen how your spending that day ranked against that of other people in your area.The company\u2019s methods for ginning up excitement have come under scrutiny before. Two years ago, Alibaba said that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating it for the way it reports Singles Day sales. The company\u2019s preferred metric, gross merchandise value, is supposed to represent the amount of money that changes hands on its platforms. But there is no standardized way of calculating it.The company has since de-emphasized the number. But the episode illustrated the way that Alibaba sees itself \u2014 as a company that breaks the mold.Ever since Alibaba listed its shares in New York four years ago, the company has used a sense of manifest destiny to beguile investors, stock analysts and an eager news media. China was on the long road to middle-class prosperity, the company said, and Alibaba had the biggest tollbooth. A bet on Alibaba was a bet on China itself.Now, though, it is clear that Alibaba\u2019s privileged place in China\u2019s rise is not guaranteed.In takeout delivery, for instance, Alibaba is facing off against several wealthy rivals.

{"Headline": "Scandals Catch Up to Private Chinese Hospitals, After Fortunes Are Made", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "The Putian network of 8,000 facilities, which expanded rapidly with little government oversight, is facing national outrage and scrutiny over a death and fraud allegations.Supported byPUTIAN, China \u2014 Chen Deliang, wearing an orange tunic, a gold watch and fluffy bedroom slippers decorated with snowflakes and the word \u201cLove,\u201d stood proudly in the 130,000-square-foot temple he had built. He had filled it with pagodas, Buddhas and a towering statue of a local goddess. There were several wings, with bedrooms and an office where he practiced calligraphy.A chain smoker with a wispy beard, he initially hesitated talking about his path to unimagined wealth, but eventually relented with a matter-of-factness that betrayed no sense of smugness: \u201cI was the first person to create everything.\u201dNearby his family and friends owned mansions, many several stories tall, rising above the unpaved roads and sweet potato fields of the village of Dongzhuang in southern China. They exuded a gaudy opulence \u2014 elevators, minarets, gilded gates, fountains with Greek gods. Just days before the Lunar New Year, the most important festival in China, Ferraris and Lamborghinis lined their driveways.Even in a country where multimillionaires are minted daily, Mr. Chen and his brethren are unlikely testaments to the Chinese dream. A middle school dropout turned martial arts performer turned itinerant salesman, Mr. Chen parlayed a remedy to treat scabies into a chain of clinics for sexually transmitted diseases and then into the country\u2019s largest network of private hospitals. Along the way, his relatives and neighbors in Dongzhuang and the surrounding area of Putian got into the same business and also made lots of money.\u201cAll of us were from Dongzhuang, and one by one, we started engaging in medicine,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cIt was your relatives, his relatives \u2014 all of us were relatives.\u201dThe Putian system, a loosely affiliated network that traces back to Mr. Chen\u2019s initial forays into medicine, accounts for eight of every 10 private hospitals in the country, some 8,000 facilities. Although they don\u2019t all have the same owners, all were started by people with connections to the area of Putian and are members of the same trade group.They offered a vision of the future of medicine, promising everything the old state hospitals lacked, like well-trained specialists, quick appointments at the click of a mouse and state-of-the-art equipment. Public officials praised the hospitals, while big Wall Street firms invested billions of dollars in them.Then came the scandal. A university student died after a doctor at a Putian-linked hospital tried to treat his cancer with a discredited form of immunotherapy. The case prompted nationwide outrage and protests. Shares of Putian-linked hospitals plummeted. The government announced an investigation into Putian ads.For the Chinese leadership, the death has exposed weaknesses in the country\u2019s health care system. While public hospitals are subject to tighter scrutiny at the national level, private hospitals like those in the Putian network are largely overseen by local governments, many of which don\u2019t have the resources and expertise to police the medical profession.Some hospitals in the Putian group fabricated patients\u2019 testimonies and doctors\u2019 credentials. Others listed false certifications or used outdated treatments. The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, called them \u201charmful hospitals.\u201dWu Xidong, executive president of the Putian health industry association, which oversees the group of private hospitals, defended its practices and operations. The public anger at Putian hospitals reflected dissatisfaction with poor regulation and the entire health care system, he said.\u201cThe patients still give us recognition, isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cThis proves that we have no problems. The state has also not taken any measures against us, right? Because our hospitals themselves are very good.\u201dMr. Chen, 67, lives a quiet life in Dongzhuang after retiring in the 1990s from the health care empire he created. He drives his golf buggy around the temple complex, which has a statue devoted to Chen Jinggu, a woman who is revered in the area as the goddess of the land. None of the pilgrims seemed to recognize him.Like other Putian tycoons, Mr. Chen has been keeping a low profile. He doesn\u2019t want to talk about the scandal but rails against the \u201cmisinformation\u201d out there.\u201cThe reports were nonsense. They were a mess,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cNow, when people go and see a doctor, they\u2019ll ask: \u2018Is this a private hospital? Should we go in?\u2019 There\u2019s a question mark. Will they be deceived? It\u2019s making things difficult for us.\u201dDuring the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, doctors were scarce and medicine was limited. Scabies, an itchy, highly infectious disease caused by mites, afflicted many Chinese. \u201cIt spread like wildfire,\u201d Mr. Chen said.Mr. Chen saw an opportunity, coming up with a homemade remedy \u2014 a combination of nitric acid, mercury and vinegar. Traveling throughout China, he sold it for 30 cents a bottle, 10 times the cost. Mr. Chen made about $2,200 a year, at a time when public servants earned about $5 a month.\u201cThe country\u2019s medical system was so backward,\u201d Mr. Chen said. He attracted a core group of disciples, training them in his practice. \u201cNone of us had any medical background.\u201dFor decades, the Communist Party provided the basics. In the countryside, legions of so-called barefoot doctors, medical professionals with limited training, treated farmers, with the government picking up most of the costs. In cities, most Chinese workers received coverage through their employers, state-owned companies.When China\u2019s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, started to open the economy in the late 1970s and introduce market reforms, he took away government subsidies for health care. \u201cBarefoot doctors\u201d lost their source of income, and hospitals were left to fend for themselves.Mr. Chen and his apprentices started renting rooms in small hotels across from bus stations, where there was a lot of foot traffic. They posted ads on utility poles to target more customers.In the decades that followed, Mr. Chen and his partners branched out, starting clinics to treat sexually transmitted diseases. Prostitution was on the rise, and people were embarrassed about going to public hospitals to be treated. The clinics allowed patients to register anonymously.\u201cS.T.D.s are embarrassing. You don\u2019t want anyone else to know,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cYou could write down any name \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t care.\u201dHe and others in the Putian network soon developed a signature style, expanding widely with clinics in nonemergency fields like infertility, dermatology and cosmetic surgery. After clinics, they opened entire hospitals.Mr. Chen bowed out of the business in the 1990s, after a car accident. The network continued to flourish.The group got a major boost from the government in 2003, when China granted private hospitals tax-free status for three years. Severe acute respiratory syndrome had swept the country, forcing the authorities to scramble to get more hospital beds and build more quarantine facilities. And officials realized the public hospitals were insufficient to care for the rapidly swelling population.A decade later, the government, at a meeting of the top party leadership, said it would further encourage the development of private hospitals. Chen Zhili, former vice chairwoman of the National People\u2019s Congress, wrote a letter to the Putian network in 2014, thanking it for \u201cmaking positive contributions to the development of private medical care in China.\u201dThe government backing attracted interest from Wall Street. American financial firms like Sequoia Capital and Morgan Stanley have invested billions of dollars in health care companies in the Putian network. Several of the companies listed their shares on the stock exchanges of Shanghai and Hong Kong.Steven Wang, founder of HighLight Capital, a private equity fund in Shanghai, said he had first heard about the Putian network from his parents, both doctors in public hospitals. When Mr. Wang visited the city of Putian in 2001, he found a place still mired in poverty, but he was impressed by the spirit of the locals.Centuries earlier, the city had been invaded by Japanese pirates. A massacre followed, and people fled to the mountains. They were a people, Mr. Wang said, who could \u201ceat bitterness,\u201d referring to an expression used by Chinese to describe the ability to endure hardship.Mr. Wang invested $150 million in the Putian-linked Angel Group (China) Holding Company, which runs a maternity hospital in the southwestern city of Chengdu. He said the second generation of entrepreneurs from Putian, who followed Mr. Chen and the initial founders, were mostly university educated. So their \u201cknowledge, insights and vision\u201d are different from those of their forebears, Mr. Wang said.\u201cThey are full of vitality, are keen to learn, are open-minded and want to improve,\u201d he said.Xing Jiaming was excited in 2015 to start his internship at a marketing firm for Putian hospitals in the cities of Nanjing and Jinan. As an economics student, he thought it would be useful to gain some other experience, especially at a fast-growing business. Over the previous decade, more than 9,000 private hospitals had opened in China, most connected to the Putian group.During his first week at work, he got a plum assignment. A doctor had recently left one of the hospitals, and Mr. Xing was assigned to write up the credentials of the doctor\u2019s replacement. The r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the replacement was identical to his predecessor\u2019s. When the intern asked about the similarities, his boss told him to finish.For the Nanjing Brain Hospital, Mr. Xing said, he was told to promote its treatment success rate as 100 percent. He also made up testimonials, including one of a woman in Nanjing who was cured of anxiety after going to a Putian-related hospital.\u201cEverything was fabricated by us,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of them was a real case.\u201dMr. Xing said he and his colleagues had been given templates. \u201cWe had to exaggerate the harm caused by the disease,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more exaggerated, the better.\u201d The company, he said, had a \u201cprofessional art team\u201d that would steal online photographs of other people and stick them onto testimonials.Mr. Xing resigned after two weeks.\u201cThis phenomenon doesn\u2019t only pertain to the Putian network, right?\u201d Mr. Wu of the Putian health association said. \u201cAll over the internet, it\u2019s likely that there are many other businesses who engage in that.\u201dPutian tapped the power of the internet to expand, plowing profits into marketing. Liang Jianyong, a former Communist Party secretary in Putian, said the network invested $1.8 billion in advertising on the Chinese search giant Baidu in 2013. It amounted to nearly half the search engine\u2019s advertising revenue that year, according to the National Business Daily. Baidu declined to comment.Many of the online marketing materials have a similar feel. They feature dozens of specialists, with lengthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9s promoting \u201cabundant clinical experience\u201d and \u201cpraise from peers within the industry.\u201d There are glowing testimonials from satisfied patients with emotional narratives.One details the case of a father who \u201cknelt down\u201d pleading with the chief doctor at the Putian-linked Edward Hospital, in the far western region of Xinjiang, to treat his 5-year-old daughter. She received treatment that was \u201cthe most advanced technology in the world.\u201dSome Putian hospitals promoted credentials they didn\u2019t have. Two of the nine doctors advertised on Shenyang Metropolis Hospital\u2019s website are not accredited to work there, according to an analysis of a doctor database run by the National Health and Family Planning Commission, the government agency.Others tried to make it seem they were affiliated with some of the country\u2019s top hospitals.Weining He Mu Jia, one of the 8,000 hospitals in the Putian network, had the patina of legitimacy. He Mu Jia was the Chinese name of Beijing United Family Hospital, China\u2019s first foreign-owned hospital and one of its most respected.President Barack Obama and Gary F. Locke, a former United States ambassador to China, graced the covers of Weining He Mu Jia\u2019s magazines. A photo of Roberta Lipson, the founder of Beijing United Family Hospital, hung in the Weining hospital\u2019s lobby. The photo, which was doctored, featured Ms. Lipson at the grand opening of the emergency room expansion of the \u201cWeining United Family Hospital and Clinics.\u201dThe connections were purely show. Despite no relation, more than 20 hospitals in the Putian network have used the Chinese name He Mu Jia or similar variations, according to Ms. Lipson. Her company, Chindex International, has sued six Putian hospitals for trademark infringement, including Weining He Mu Jia.\u201cEvery single day in the news, there are people on the internet complaining about them, complaining about malpractice, and it\u2019s our name,\u201d Ms. Lipson said.Beijing United won the trademark infringement lawsuit against the Weining hospital in 2014. But Weining still runs an account on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter, with the He Mu Jia name.Wei Zexi, a 22-year-old university student, was lured by the promises of a Putian hospital.With a diagnosis of synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that attacks the tissue in the muscle joints, Mr. Wei had undergone three operations, four chemotherapy sessions and 25 radiation therapy sessions and had taken traditional Chinese medicines hundreds of times. With the help of donations, he bought Keytruda, an immunotherapy drug that is not available in most parts of the mainland, for $5,000 in Hong Kong.When none of it worked, Mr. Wei desperately looked online for options. A Putian center at a military hospital in Beijing, appearing at the top of his search results on Baidu, offered what seemed like a miracle: an immunotherapy program called DC-CIK.\u201cAs long as you have 1 percent of hope, it is worth using your life to take a gamble,\u201d he wrote in a May 2015 reply to a post on Zhihu, a Chinese knowledge-sharing website.A doctor, a specialist for the Putian treatment center, Shanghai Kangxin hospital management company, told him that the DC-CIK treatment had a success rate of 80 to 90 percent and could extend his life by 20 years. He touted a partnership with Stanford University.His parents borrowed money from relatives and friends for the four treatments, which cost $30,000. Within a few months, the cancer had spread to his kidneys. In April 2016, 19 months after he first sought treatment in the Putian-linked hospital, Mr. Wei was dead.The DC-CIK treatment had been phased out in the United States because it was largely ineffective. There was no partnership with Stanford.Mr. Wei, according his best friend, Wang Xi, believed the treatment was legitimate because of Baidu\u2019s search results. The influential state broadcaster China Central Television had also once interviewed the doctor who treated Mr. Wei.\u201cHe felt he was already cautious enough,\u201d his friend said.A nationwide scandal erupted after his death. The Putian network became the emblem of unfettered corruption within the private health care system. Local authorities took particular aim at one of its more egregious violations, operating clinics within other hospitals. The practice had been outlawed years earlier, but many players in the Putian network continued to develop them.In 2017, a court in Anhui Province said a hospital had violated local regulations by renting out several specialist departments in andrology and dermatology, among others, to a man from Putian, who was eventually forced to shut down. That same year, the local governments in the provinces of Liaoning and Henan announced crackdowns on the practice.\u201cChina\u2019s health care fraud is pretty rampant,\u201d said Dr. Ma Jun, director of the Harbin Institute of Hematology and Oncology, a public hospital in China\u2019s northeast. \u201cWith China\u2019s private hospitals, there are a lot of traps.\u201dIn October 2016, Chen Zhanghao paid $580 for nasal surgery in the eastern city of Ningbo at what he believed was a subsidiary of Tongren Hospital, a prestigious hospital in Beijing. He had found the Putian-affiliated hospital on Baidu.According to Mr. Chen, the hospital at the time purported on its website to be a Tier 3 institution, the government\u2019s top classification. Later, Mr. Chen learned, through a freedom of information request, that the hospital did not have the designation and was not allowed to conduct that type of surgery, according to a copy of the government\u2019s response to his request, which was viewed by The Times. (The hospital has since removed the classification.)Mr. Chen, 25, now has difficulty breathing sometimes because his nose either hurts or is congested, he said. He tried looking for the doctors who had treated him, but they have left the hospital, now known as the Ningbo Yinzhou Tongren Hospital.Mr. Chen has nightmares thinking about his surgery. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to think about it anymore,\u201d he said.In March 2017, he joined five other patients with similar problems, protesting outside the offices of Baidu for compensation. They held banners that read: \u201cWe are the living Wei Zexis.\u201dBack at his temple, Chen Deliang defended the health care empire that he founded all those decades ago.Mr. Chen said the hospital department that Mr. Wei had visited in Beijing had nothing to do with Putian but was owned by a company from Zhejiang Province. He did not elaborate, and corporate records showed otherwise.When asked about the fake ads, Mr. Chen defended them, saying all ads need to have an element of \u201cboastfulness,\u201d but added that \u201cit\u2019s impossible that they are fake.\u201dHe said many Putian hospitals had lost money, struggling to get loans and pay their workers. But when asked how many exactly, he said he could not tell for sure.\u201cWe are not selling fake drugs, nor are we deceiving people,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThe government has done nothing to us.\u201dResearch was contributed by Zhang Tiantian, Amy Cheng, Tang Yucheng, Elsie Chen and Ryan McMorrow.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Advertisement"}

Are Google and Amazon Too Big?", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFriday: Tech giants talk expansion, and two columnists sign off.Living and working in New York have ingrained in most of us a certain laissez-faire attitude to things big and grand.

{"Headline": "The Election Showed a Divided Country. Investors Can Live With That.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks jumped on Wednesday, extending a recovery from the sharp sell-off in October with broad-based gains, after midterm elections that will split control of the United States government between both major parties.The S&P 500 rose 2.1 percent, led by giant technology companies including Amazon, Apple and Google. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 2.6 percent, its strongest gain this month.Stock in consumer discretionary companies climbed 3.1 percent, in a sign of growing optimism that President Trump, stung by his party\u2019s loss of the House of Representatives, could seek a win by striking a trade bargain with China at the Group of 20 summit meeting this month. Shares of Wynn Resorts, the casino company with significant business in China, jumped 3.9 percent.After weeks of uncertainty heading into the election, investors seemed to focus again on the strong fundamentals for American businesses, helping fuel the gains on Wednesday.In the voting on Tuesday, Democrats secured control of the House in the next Congress, while the Republicans padded their majority in the Senate. A divided government is conventionally thought of as good for stock investors, because it means lawmakers are unlikely to produce sweeping policy changes.\u201cInvestors can basically refocus their mental energy away from the macro and back to the micro, where earnings are really good and valuations are really reasonable,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at the institutional brokerage BTIG.Industrial shares rose, bolstered by renewed hope for a bipartisan infrastructure-spending bill. The construction machinery maker Caterpillar, which also has large exposure to China, rose 4.5 percent.Health care shares rallied on the prospect that major health legislation is much less likely. Managed care companies that sell contract Medicaid services to state governments and insurance products on health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act rose sharply.\u201cYou worry less about large sweeping regulatory change,\u201d said Zack Sopcak, an equity analyst covering managed care companies for Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt means a repeat of \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 is off the table,\u201d he added, referring to the potential for a wholesale replacement of the law, commonly known as Obamacare.After an ugly sell-off in October, investors appear to have regained their appetite for stocks. The S&P 500 has risen in four of the first five trading days of November. The 2.1 percent gain on Wednesday for the broad index of large companies was its third-best showing this year.That turn of events reflects a dizzying swing in market sentiment. As recently as Oct. 29, the market was down more than 1 percent for the year after a rout that started in September had vaporized nearly 10 percent in gains.At that time, investors saw ubiquitous threats to the nearly decade-long rally for stocks. The potential pitfalls included rising interest rates, climbing commodity and wage costs, signs of slowing growth in China and Europe and the tariff war between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies.Most of the issues remain unresolved, but the markets have found their footing and trading seemed to suggest investors see reasons for optimism now that the elections have concluded.Equity investors are now sitting on gains of more than 5 percent for the year.Advertisement"}

The soon-to-open library branch is a modern art cube of concrete, the median income is $138,000 a year, and America\u2019s hottest online retailer is about to move in.In the eyes of the federal government, the census tract that will house Amazon\u2019s new headquarters in New York is an \u201copportunity zone,\u201d eligible for tax credits meant to spur investment in low-income communities.[Do you live or work near Amazon\u2019s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]That tax break was pitched as a benefit for distressed communities. But critics fear it could primarily help wealthy investors and speed gentrification in parts of the United States that were already likely to draw investment.Investors who pour unrealized capital gains into funds that invest in real estate or other assets that qualify for opportunity zone status can essentially avoid as much as 15 percent of the taxes they would have owed on their investment gains. If they hold an investment in an opportunity zone for more than a decade, they avoid all taxes on any gains that the investment produces.The waterfront Long Island City zone, in contrast, embodies what critics have worried might happen when place-based tax benefits extend to investment in areas that most Americans would not consider impoverished.The program\u2019s architects say that there are few tracts nationwide like the ones surrounding Amazon\u2019s new home, and that Long Island City will not divert investment from more distressed areas that lack a new high-tech tenant.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that the Long Island City tract is an outlier,\u201d said John Lettieri, president of the Economic Innovation Group, a Washington think tank that helped advocate the creation of opportunity zones. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that Amazon, and this HQ2 thing, is an outlier. I don\u2019t think those are the cases that are going to define the national experience for opportunity zones.\u201dState governors selected the zones from a list of eligible census tracts, based on a formula used to calculate eligibility for another federal effort to aid struggling areas, the longstanding New Markets Tax Credit. Governors were allowed to designate one-quarter of eligible areas as opportunity zones. Their designations were approved by the Treasury Department.But the relatively broad criteria allowed governors to choose some low-poverty, higher-income, rapidly developing areas adjacent to low-income zones. They constitute about 200 of the nearly 8,800 zones that Treasury approved, including the waterfront area that Amazon has chosen in Long Island City.Brookings estimated that 11 percent of the final opportunity zones have lower poverty rates than the national average. A third of the zones in Washington, D.C., for instance, are already gentrifying quickly, according to estimates by the Urban Institute. Among the states, New York has the highest share of gentrifying areas, with 13 percent of its zones in areas that are beginning to prosper.Areas like Long Island City \u201care already getting a lot of capital,\u201d said Brett Theodos, a principal research associate in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute. \u201cThis use case was allowed from the beginning. Whether that\u2019s a good use of public subsidies is another question.\u201dThe riverfront tract in Long Island City scored a 9 on that investment scale, and was flagged for gentrification.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carlos Ghosn Can Remain in Tokyo Jail for 10 More Days", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A Tokyo court approved a 10-day extension of jail time for Carlos Ghosn, the head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, on Friday as prosecutors assess allegations of financial misconduct. An ocean away, the corporate titan\u2019s problems were on show at the Group of 20 summit meeting: President Emmanuel Macron of France, where Renault is based, met with Japan\u2019s prime minister to discuss the alliance.Mr. Ghosn, a charismatic leader in the auto industry, is being investigated after a whistle-blower within Nissan, the Japanese automaker, alleged he vastly understated his compensation on securities filings. He has been in detention since Nov. 19, when he was arrested on his private jet soon after landing at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda Airport.Greg Kelly, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s former chief of staff and a Nissan board member, who was arrested at the same time, will also be detained for 10 more days. A former head of human resources and an American, Mr. Kelly has been described by the company as a \u201cmastermind\u201d of the alleged financial wrongdoing. Both men were in Tokyo for a board meeting.Under Japanese law, prosecutors can detain suspects for up to 22 days without filing charges, and can legally question them without a lawyer present.The extended detentions give the Japanese authorities more time to interrogate the men, search Nissan\u2019s offices for evidence and determine whether to press charges. Prosecutors have said they suspect Mr. Ghosn earned around 10 billion yen, or about $88 million, at Nissan from 2011 to 2015 but reported only half of it. The other half was to be parceled out as deferred compensation after Mr. Ghosn, 64, retired.Mr. Kelly is also alleged to have overseen the surreptitious purchase of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of housing for his boss through a Dutch company, Zi-A Capital, whose financial reports are opaque. Mr. Ghosn kept homes in Paris, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro and Beirut, Lebanon.Mr. Ghosn has denied the allegations, the Japanese public broadcaster NHK said this week. Mr. Kelly has also denied wrongdoing, according to his attorney, Yoichi Kitamura.Mr. Kitamura told The New York Times that Mr. Kelly maintained that Mr. Ghosn had the right to set his own pay, and that the executive had decided to pay himself \u00a51 billion a year as chief executive. Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly are accused of underreporting his compensation in required securities filings. Mr. Kelly said the securities report did not understate the pay, Mr. Kitamura said.Mr. Kitamura said Mr. Kelly maintained that he had consulted with an outside lawyer about a plan to defer Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation. According to Japanese media, Mr. Kelly has said he asked that lawyer to get approval from Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency to ensure the plan was correct and that it did not need to be reported as current compensation.Mr. Kitamura said Mr. Kelly believed that the plan was legal under Japanese law after consulting with an outside lawyer.Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, has stated several times that France has \u201cno evidence\u201d of wrongdoing by Mr. Ghosn, and called on Nissan to turn over its dossier. Last week, he asked his Japanese counterpart to come to Paris to make a joint public statement on the matter.At the G-20 meeting in Buenos Aires on Friday, Mr. Macron told Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan that he wanted to maintain the alliance between Renault and Nissan after Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest. Mr. Macron \u201creiterated his commitment to preserving the alliance as well as the stability of the group,\u201d the president\u2019s office said in a statement.In the talks, Mr. Abe said that a stable Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance was important but that its future should be decided by stakeholders in the private sector rather than either government, according to a Japanese official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Since Mr. Ghosn pulled Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy over a decade ago, it has become the alliance\u2019s more profitable partner. In recent years, executives inside the company had raised the issue of rebalancing the relationship.Renault holds a 43 percent stake in Nissan, and the Japanese company holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, the same share as the French government. There have been tensions within the alliance \u2014 which accounted for 10.6 million car sales last year \u2014 as Renault has been the dominant partner.On Thursday, officials from Renault and Nissan consulted in Amsterdam, where the alliance has its headquarters, and issued a statement that the board of directors of all three companies \u201cindividually and collectively emphatically reiterated their strong commitment to the alliance.\u201d The Japanese officials dialed in by teleconference.The move, which Mr. Ghosn opposed in a bitter fight with Mr. Macron, rattled Nissan. Nissan has no voting rights in Renault, despite its 15 percent stake. Nissan threatened to leave the alliance\u2019s master agreement.Some French newspapers have questioned why and how Mr. Ghosn was being held for weeks without charges. On Thursday, the deputy head of the Tokyo prosecutor\u2019s office, Shin Kukimoto, rebuffed the criticism as na\u00efve.\u201cWe do not unnecessarily keep people in custody for a long time,\u201d Mr. Kukimoto said. \u201cI do not criticize other countries\u2019 systems just because they are different.\u201dLiz Alderman reported from Paris, and Motoko Rich from Tokyo.

{"Headline": "Cost of Botched Gaza Spy Mission? Israel\u2019s Back on Brink of War", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured Israelis weary of conflict with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip that he was \u201cdoing everything I can in order to avoid an unnecessary war.\u201dA day and a half later, Israel appeared to be on the brink of just that.Israel hit scores of military posts and weapons caches across Gaza, and also leveled a Hamas television station, radio station and office building, and the group\u2019s military intelligence headquarters. Another target, in a densely populated area, housed both Hamas military and intelligence forces and a kindergarten. It was the heaviest fighting between Israel and Gaza since their war in 2014.The talks, mediated by Egypt, had already produced concrete steps to ease tensions in Gaza, including increased electrical power and the influx of millions of dollars in aid.So why, some Israelis were asking, with the Israeli government under pressure to ease tensions in Gaza and the talks showing progress, would the government risk it all for what officials described as a fairly routine surveillance mission?The answer, analysts said, may be that it was so routine. No one expected the Israeli commando squad to be exposed.\u201cThe real assumption is that the operation will not be revealed,\u201d said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former national security adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s not 100 percent, but it can be estimated that 99 percent of these operations are not revealed, and 99 percent is good enough to make a decision assuming that the force will enter, execute and go out without being detected.\u201dThe cost of that tiny risk became evident on Monday and Tuesday. More than 400 rockets and mortar shells were fired into Israel, and the Israeli military said it had struck more than 100 military targets in Gaza belonging to Hamas, which governs the territory, and to Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Israel\u2019s Iron Dome system intercepted more than 100 projectiles, it said.The authorities in Gaza said five Palestinians had been killed in the Israeli airstrikes and 15 others wounded. On the Israeli side, one man was killed in Ashkelon \u2014 a Palestinian from Hebron, in the West Bank, according to local reports \u2014 and at least 16 people were wounded.Each side repeatedly warned the other to back down, but refused to do so itself. After Israel threatened Monday night to begin leveling Gaza high-rises, and then did, Hamas warned that \u201cmillions\u201d of Israelis would soon come under its rocket fire.Israel\u2019s security cabinet was meeting on Tuesday, and officials said the government was spurning, for the moment, offers by Egypt and the United Nations to try to broker a cease-fire.\u201cFor the moment I think that we need to deal with the situation directly,\u201d said a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Emanuel Nachshon. \u201cIt\u2019s a security challenge, a security threat to the southern part of the state of Israel. And before discussing the issue with any international organizations, we need to make sure that we can protect our citizens. This is why the priority now is to military action, in order to send across a very clear and strong message.\u201dTo embrace talks prematurely would send the wrong message, Mr. Nachshon suggested. Rather, he said, militants in Gaza needed to understand that they \u201ccannot shoot whenever they feel like it and then stop shooting as if nothing happened.\u201dDespite Israel\u2019s efforts to degrade their arsenals, Hamas and Islamic Jihad appeared in no danger of running out of ammunition. The Israeli military said it believed the two groups had amassed more than 20,000 rockets and mortars.Overnight, the Israeli military ordered all residents in the south, including in the cities of Ashdod and Beersheba, to remain in bomb shelters, some of which were opened as far as 25 miles from the Gaza perimeter. Residents were allowed to leave shelters late Tuesday morning but told to stay close to them. Air-raid sirens were heard Monday as far away as Hebron.But deep into the night, both sides were still ratcheting up the conflict.In Gaza City, employees of the Hamas television station Al Aqsa were warned to evacuate its offices, and the building was soon destroyed by multiple missile blasts that were captured on video by onlookers. A Hamas spokesman, Fawzi Barhoum, called the station\u2019s destruction an act of \u201cbarbaric aggression.\u201dThe Israeli military said the station was a legitimate target. \u201cIt contributes to Hamas\u2019 military actions, including by providing operational messaging to militants, directing and explicitly calling for terror activities against Israel, and providing guidance on how to carry out such terror activities,\u201d the military said in a statement.Soon after, airstrikes demolished the Al Aqsa radio station\u2019s offices and Al Amal Hotel, a Hamas office building.The fighting began hours after Palestinians and Israelis buried combatants who were killed on Sunday night, after an Israeli intelligence mission inside the Gaza Strip went awry when a team of covert operatives was challenged by Hamas fighters. A gunfight erupted, and the team called in airstrikes to cover their escape.Six Hamas fighters, including a commander of forces in the Khan Younis area, and a member of the Popular Resistance Committees, another armed faction, were killed. An Israeli lieutenant colonel in the elite Maglan unit, a commando brigade, was also killed in the clash and was hailed as a national hero at his funeral.According to a former Israeli official with knowledge of the operation, the mission\u2019s goal was surveillance, not an assassination. Such missions, usually aimed at installing surveillance equipment, are extensively planned and are considered at a low risk of exposure and confrontation.But they are perilous enough that the prime minister has to approve them personally, Mr. Eiland said.Israeli officials have not publicly explained the mission or what went wrong with it.\u201cThe aim of the operation was not to abduct or to kill a Hamas operative,\u201d Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israel military spokesman, said Monday night. He said that once the Israeli force met trouble, it \u201cacted swiftly, professionally, was able to defend itself, exfiltrate in a very professional manner, making sure that all soldiers got back to Israel, that none were left behind.\u201dHe added that the operation on Sunday had not been a deliberate provocation but was a routine part of the Israeli military\u2019s efforts to contend with terrorist threats across its borders.\u201cJust as terrorist organizations don\u2019t stop to plan, and to harbor weapons and try to strike against Israeli civilians, neither do we in our preparations, in our collection efforts, and in our operations that we conduct in order to mitigate the capabilities of the different terror organizations around us,\u201d he said.Proponents of a cease-fire had warned for months that the military\u2019s best efforts to keep a lid on tensions with Gaza could prove for naught because of the unpredictability of cross-border clashes.The cease-fire talks had appeared to show meaningful progress in recent days before the turn of events that led to Monday\u2019s fighting.With both sides eager to address Gaza\u2019s collapsing economy, electrical shortages and a deepening humanitarian crisis, Israel had agreed to let new shipments of diesel fuel be delivered to Gaza\u2019s power plant, sharply increasing the availability of electrical power for residents of the beleaguered coastal enclave and allowing sewage treatment plants to resume operation.Then, last week, Israel allowed a donation of $15 million in cash from Qatar to be driven into Gaza, where Hamas distributed it as back pay to thousands of its civil servants who have received only a fraction of their salaries for months.On both sides of the Gaza border, civilians caught up in the fighting said they felt terrorized by it.Moatasem al-Aloul, a driver from Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip, said he was stuck in traffic when he suddenly saw people running away from the rocket launches, as explosions crackled overhead.\u201cThe bombing is everywhere,\u201d he said.By nightfall, during a lull in the fighting, the streets in parts of Gaza City were almost empty, with many residents staying indoors. Few cars were on the road, and the loudest sound was that of Israeli drones hovering overhead.In Kibbutz Alumim, less than two miles from the Gaza border, Sara Mash, 32, a secretary, said Monday night that her three children and husband had been in their safe room \u2014 their children\u2019s bedroom \u2014 since 4:30 p.m., when they first heard an explosion and then an air-raid siren.\u201cWe\u2019ve had times like this, but you could at least step out of the safe room and breathe,\u201d she said by phone. \u201cThis is a situation where we could not, because every second there was a boom, nonstop \u2014 and you have no idea what is going on outside: Is it our side or theirs?\u201dThen she suddenly shouted, \u201cRed alert, red alert \u2014 pick him up!\u201d and ended the call.Iyad Abuheweila and Ibrahim El-Mughrabi contributed reporting from Gaza City, Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv, Gabby Sobelman from Rehovot, Rina Castelnuovo from Ashkelon, and Irit Pazner from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Race for Global Power, U.S. and China Push Nations to Pick a Side", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The escalating brinkmanship between the United States and China as they race to quash each other\u2019s global influence is forcing other nations to pick sides between the two superpowers, putting at risk future cooperation on geopolitical threats and a resolution to the economic standoff.Across the globe, the United States and China are jockeying to build alliances or partnerships and shut out the other power. The hard-nosed competition surfaced over the weekend at an Asian economic forum that pitted Vice President Mike Pence against President Xi Jinping of China. The dispute threatens to disrupt the Group of 20 summit meeting that starts Nov. 30 in Argentina.Mr. Trump has repeatedly said China \u201cwants to make a deal very badly,\u201d but continues to warn that he will tax nearly all Chinese imports if Beijing does not open its markets to American companies and end its unfair practices.\u201cChina has been ripping off our country for many, many years,\u201d the president told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t rip us off with me.\u201dThe West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It\u2019s still waiting.Some countries are bristling at the economic demands that the two superpowers have made.Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi are both expected to attend the Group of 20 meeting. While they could come to some mutual understanding, \u201cit is becoming increasingly difficult for both sides to reconcile their competing perspectives,\u201d said Ryan Hass, a China analyst at the Brookings Institution.\u201cBoth countries are becoming entrenched in their narratives and having increasing difficulty finding common ground,\u201d Mr. Hass said. But virtually no country in Asia wants to be exclusively aligned with either power, he added.China, for its part, has signaled to other nations that they should push back against Mr. Trump on one of his signature foreign policy actions \u2014 withdrawing the United States from the nuclear agreement with Iran.China\u2019s moves to strengthen its global standing have received a big boost from Mr. Trump\u2019s denunciations of multilateral institutions, alliances and treaties.Some Trump administration officials are optimistic that the two leaders will emerge from the Group of 20 meeting with the framework of a trade agreement that would reduce America\u2019s bilateral trade deficit with China and protect the intellectual property of American companies who do business there. Treasury Department officials have been in frequent contact with their Chinese counterparts in hopes of building the groundwork for a deal.The dissonance has left China uncertain of the Trump administration\u2019s goals and cast a shadow of uncertainty over their negotiations.\u201cIt feels to me like the administration doesn\u2019t quite have one strategy toward China,\u201d said Jon B. Alterman, a global security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cNot only do you see administration leaders saying different things, but it feels like they\u2019re not integrated, especially in the absence of something like the TPP, which was a genuine long-term strategy to deal with China\u2019s rise.\u201dThe Trump administration has also embarked on bilateral trade deals with other countries with the intention of exerting pressure on China. Despite abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the administration is forging ahead with negotiations with Japan and the Philippines, and officials are eyeing possible talks with Vietnam and India.Criticism of China\u2019s trade practices was at the center of the blowup at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum over the weekend.In several meetings, Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, and his colleagues objected to a draft of the forum\u2019s closing statement that asserted, \u201cWe agree to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices.\u201dRaising his voice, Mr. Wang accused American officials of trying to insert a veiled reference to China, said one American official who was there. At one point, Chinese officials barged into the office of the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea to demand changes.Only China objected to the draft. The forum closed without a consensus statement from the 21 member economies for the first time since 1989.\u201cIt was truly a stupid move by the Chinese,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cI guess we should all conclude that China will do whatever it takes to continue to pursue unfair trade practices.\u201d\u201cAnd they will also continue to put their narrow self-interests first at the expense of multilateral institutions,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Claims Nafta Victory but Deal Faces Long Odds in U.S.", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn reality, it is a problem. The trade pact\u2019s political fate \u2014 already uncertain given Democrats will soon control the House \u2014 has only dimmed since General Motors said this week that it planned to idle five factories in North America and cut nearly 15,000 jobs to trim costs.Congressional Democrats remain open to supporting a revised trade deal. But they \u2014 along with business leaders and free-trade Republicans \u2014 have become increasingly pessimistic that the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement can win enough votes in the House without significant concessions from Mexico, like mandatory wage increases, to stem the loss of American automobile and other factory jobs.Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, said that without changes, Mr. Trump \u201cwill have real trouble getting Democrats to support the deal.\u201dAt least one major labor union, the 600,000-member International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, came out against the new agreement on Friday, a move that could encourage other labor leaders to ratchet up criticism of a deal most view as, at best, a modest improvement on the 25-year-old Nafta.\u201cAs currently written, and without further changes along the lines we continue to propose, Nafta 2.0 will do little if anything to stop the outsourcing from the U.S. and Canada and the related wage suppression of workers in Mexico,\u201d said Robert Martinez Jr., the union\u2019s president. \u201cUnless major changes are made, we cannot support Nafta 2.0.\u201dRepresentative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat who represents a heavily industrial swath of Ohio from Toledo to Cleveland, criticized the ceremonial signing as a \u201cstaged production\u201d and signaled that other Midwest Democrats, a key voting bloc in the House, would not support the deal without major changes.\u201cPresident Trump has claimed premature victory,\u201d she said.Mr. Trump pushed hard behind the scenes to ensure that Friday\u2019s symbolic, flag-bedecked signing ceremony with the leaders of Canada and Mexico took place. His staff spent much of the preceding 48 hours coaxing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to appear at the event so that three North American leaders, not just Mr. Trump and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, would appear onstage, according to people familiar with the planning.Technically, the deal that the three trading partners signed cannot be altered. But in reality, the administration is free to renegotiate with Canada and Mexico to make changes that could ultimately be included in final legislation. If nothing is passed, Mr. Trump could pull out of Nafta, as he has long threatened, or simply continue operating under the old rules.The Democratic takeover of the House has created anxiety among business groups and legislators, who are urging Republican leaders to push for a vote on the proposal in the lame-duck session, before Democrats assume control.\u201cManufacturers need certainty now, not later,\u201d said Jay Timmons, president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers. \u201cWith two million American jobs dependent on exports to Canada and Mexico, Congress needs to move expeditiously.\u201dMr. Timmons\u2019s group, along with other trade associations and Republican Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are pressing House and Senate leaders to quickly pass the deal.Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, has been quietly pushing a revision to the trade agreement aimed at improving wages and working conditions in Mexico. The provision would require that Mexican imports to the United States be certified as having been produced in accordance with labor standards, according to American officials.The plan, which won the support of Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, this year, would carry stiff criminal penalties for importers who violate the trade agreement and would also bolster inspection procedures.But it was rejected by Mexican officials, including the incoming president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, according to two people familiar with the talks. But Mr. Brown, who is close to Mr. Lighthizer, is renewing his push to increase the pressure on Mexico, and is likely to submit a range of proposals to the administration, a spokeswoman for Mr. Brown said.President Trump badly wants union leaders to back his signature trade deal, but they have thus far demurred.He has met with labor officials three times since February urging them to sign onto the new deal, according to administration officials, repeatedly assuring participants that he was driving the hardest possible bargain.In recent months, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides stepped up their courtship in a futile attempt to persuade union leaders, especially the United Steelworkers president, Leo W. Gerard, to publicly back the new Nafta before the midterms. But Mr. Gerard has held off, and on Friday he pressed the White House to negotiate a better agreement.\u201cOnly when all the issues have been resolved and it\u2019s clear that Mexico is fully and faithfully recognizing workers\u2019 rights, should Congress vote on the agreement and implementing legislation,\u201d Mr. Gerard said in a statement.There are also lingering concerns about the deal in Canada, where officials remain incensed that the agreement does not include a deal to lift the sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on Canada, Mexico and other allies.Until late Thursday night, it was not clear that Mr. Trudeau would attend the signing.If Mr. Trump celebrated the agreement as a fulfillment of his campaign promise to scrap Nafta, Mr. Trudeau played down the deal as a backstop that \u201cmaintains stability\u201d for his country\u2019s economy.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here today,\u201d he said alluding to his last-minute decision to appear in front of the cameras with Mr. Trump and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto.But his attendance also seemed intended to temper Mr. Trump\u2019s glee, and he lamented recent North American plant closures by General Motors as \u201ca heavy blow\u201d and sharply criticized the metal tariffs as an unnecessary drag on the economies of both countries.\u201cDonald, it\u2019s all the more reason we need to keep working to remove the tariffs on steel and aluminum between our countries,\u201d he said as Mr. Trump looked on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Blocks Disputed Keystone XL Pipeline in Setback for Trump", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Trump administration has moved aggressively to roll back environmental protections and speed up oil and coal projects, it has repeatedly been blocked by courts finding that the administration did not follow longstanding rules in making its sweeping changes.Now, a federal judge has issued a repudiation of one of President Trump\u2019s first acts as president, his decision to allow the disputed Keystone XL oil pipeline to proceed, saying that the administration failed to present a \u201creasoned explanation\u201d for the move and \u201csimply discarded\u201d the effect the project would have on climate change.The decision could thrust the White House into a contentious new legal battle over climate change.The judge\u2019s finding quickly drew fire from Mr. Trump, who has elevated the pipeline as a prominent symbol of his administration\u2019s effort to encourage fossil fuel use. \u201cIt was a political decision made by a judge,\u201d said Mr. Trump on Friday, speaking to reporters at the White House. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace.\u201dThe ruling, by Judge Brian Morris of United States District Court for Montana, blocked construction on the 1,179-mile pipeline, which would carry 800,000 barrels a day of petroleum from the Canadian oil sands to the Gulf Coast and has, over the past decade, become a lighting rod in broader political battles over energy, the environment and climate change. While experts have long said that the substantive impact of the pipeline on jobs, climate change and the nation\u2019s energy economy is small, it has nonetheless taken on an outsize prominence in the national discussion.Judge Morris, an Obama appointee, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the president\u2019s remarks.\u201cThis has been typical of the Trump administration,\u201d said Mark Squillace, an expert on environmental law at the University of Colorado Law School. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job dealing with the factual findings of the previous administration. The courts have been clear that you can change your position, even if it\u2019s for a political reason. But you have to show your work, how you got from Point A to Point B.\u201dThe decision leaves plenty of room for the Trump administration or TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, to appeal. Analysts said that if it did so armed with a deeply researched analysis arguing its position, it could well reverse the finding. \u201cIt\u2019s feasible, if they do the work, and show their work, and they explain, with serious, fact-based analysis, why they\u2019re choosing a different outcome, that the courts would uphold it,\u201d Mr. Squillace said. Construction on many portions of the pipeline has already been completed. At issue is the final phase, a leg that would run from Steele City, Neb., through Montana to Canada. Still, environmental groups hailed the move as a victory in the battle over Keystone, which has spanned more than a decade. \u201cKeystone XL would be a disaster for the climate and for the people and wildlife of this country,\u201d Jackie Prange, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement Thursday.The oil industry characterized the move as the latest turn of the screw in the long-running legal battle. \u201cPipelines like KXL are the backbone of our nation\u2019s energy infrastructure and one of the most environmentally sound ways to transport the fuel and petroleum products that power America,\u201d said Robin Rorick, vice president of midstream operations for the American Petroleum Industry, which lobbies for oil companies. \u201cThe pipeline has passed every environmental review conducted for it. In fact, a total of six assessments by both the Obama and Trump administrations concluded that KXL is safe to build,\u201d Mr. Rorick said. \u201cCalls to conduct identical environmental reviews makes no sense and are a waste of tax dollars.\u201dA federal judge in Montana blocked the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. (PDF, 54 pages, 0.21 MB)The ruling specifically takes the Trump administration to task for failing to address the Obama administration\u2019s arguments about climate change, including the need to keep rising global temperatures at safe levels as a basis for denying the pipeline permit. Rather, the government declared it was embracing a policy shift toward \u201cenergy security, economic development and infrastructure.\u201dThe judge said an administration had the right to reverse a previous policy, but still must back up its reason for doing so with facts. \u201cThe Department instead simply discarded prior factual findings related to climate change to support its course reversal,\u201d the judge wrote. He cited a United States Supreme Court ruling that noted, \u201cAn agency cannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual determinations that it made in the past, any more than it can ignore inconvenient facts when it writes on a blank slate.\u201dEnergy and policy analysts say that the pitched battle over Keystone is out of scale to the project\u2019s actual significance as an environmental threat or an engine of the economy. The pipeline will have relatively little effect, they say, on climate change, oil production in the Canadian oil sands, gasoline prices or the overall job market in the United States.\u201cKeystone is not a very large issue in the context of energy or climate change policy for the U.S.,\u201d said Robert Stavins, the head of the environmental economics department at Harvard University.He noted that, by comparison, Mr. Trump\u2019s moves to roll back Environmental Protection Agency rules on carbon dioxide pollution from tailpipes and power plants, and his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change accord, will have a profound impact on the emission of gases that warm the planet when they enter the atmosphere.This is the full list of environmental policies the Trump administration has targeted, often in an effort to ease burdens on the fossil fuel industry.Construction of the pipeline would also be insignificant in terms of advancing Mr. Trump\u2019s professed goal of achieving \u201cenergy dominance\u201d for the United States, said Mr. Stavins, saying that its purpose is to help move oil produced in Canada to Gulf Coast ports where it can be exported to the global market.An analysis published by the State Department during the Obama administration estimated that Keystone would support 42,000 temporary jobs for two years \u2014 about 3,900 of them in construction and the rest through indirect support, like food service \u2014 but only 35 permanent jobs. Similarly, the government concluded that the increase in carbon dioxide pollution associated with burning the oil transported through the pipeline would amount to less than 1 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect name for a pipeline that was approved in 2009. It is the Alberta Clipper, not the Alabama Clipper.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article, using information from Agence France-Presse, misstated the nature of a demonstration in Washington. The protest was mainly focused on the Dakota Access Pipeline, not Keystone XL. The picture has been removed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voters Widely Support Public Schools. So Why Is It So Hard to Pay for Them?", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf it were going to happen any year, it should have been this one. After a wave of teacher walkouts fired up people on both sides of the party line, the time seemed ripe for big investments in public schools.In reality, the results for school funding after the midterm elections last week were mixed, and illustrate a paradox in how Americans view education.And in some states where education funding is among the lowest nationwide, voters approved ballot measures that will make it even harder to direct money to schools in the future.\u201cTaxes are just a very difficult conversation,\u201d said Amie Baca-Oehlert, president of the Colorado Education Association, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union. Coloradans, after seeing teachers walk out in April over school funding, rejected a ballot initiative last week to pay for schools by raising corporate taxes and personal income taxes on those earning over $150,000 a year.Those voters also elected a Democratic governor, Jared Polis, who supports sending more money to schools, and flipped control of the State Senate from red to blue. But legislators\u2019 hands will be tied when it comes to raising revenue: Colorado requires all tax increases be approved directly by voters.A perennial challenge for public school advocates, Ms. Baca-Oehlert said, was getting the political messaging right.\u201cThere is complexity to it. It\u2019s hard to talk about school funding in a 30-second political ad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was about a person-to-person conversation, talking to your friends and neighbors. And we have to continue to do that.\u201dMs. Baca-Oehlert added that with the failure of the tax measure, her union would push policymakers to support educators in other ways, perhaps through affordable housing or student loan forgiveness for teachers.In Arizona, another state where teachers walked out, voters rejected the expansion of a program that would allow tax dollars to pay for private school tuition, a win for traditional public schools. But they overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative that prohibits new state or local taxes on personal services, such as real estate sales and beauty treatments.The initiative torpedoed a potential source of school funding in a state with some of the lowest corporate and income taxes in the nation. Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, and his Democratic challenger, David Garcia, both opposed the measure.Crystal Markowsky is a parent of three public school students in Chandler, Ariz., outside Phoenix. A political independent, she protested alongside her children\u2019s teachers last spring, and ended up voting largely for Democrats this year, because, she said, she was concerned about education and women\u2019s issues.Ms. Markowsky said that she had opposed the tax ban, but only reluctantly, and that she generally supported lower taxes on services.Ultimately, the approval of the tax ban, she said, as well as the re-election of Mr. Ducey, who bested a candidate running as a progressive champion of teachers, demonstrated that Arizona remains fundamentally conservative, despite talk of a diversifying, more liberal electorate there.\u201cIt\u2019s a red state where we just want low taxes at the cost of anything,\u201d Ms. Markowsky said.Even voters in swing states like North Carolina and Florida balked at the prospect of raising taxes. North Carolina, another walkout state, approved a ballot measure to lower the income tax cap allowed by the State Constitution. Voters in Florida passed a measure to require a two-thirds majority of the State Legislature to pass new taxes and fees or raise existing ones. Similar laws in other states have made it difficult to direct money to schools.The teachers\u2019 movement was not without its wins last week. Voters did open their pocketbooks for local classrooms, if not for those statewide. In Miami; Toledo, Ohio; Charleston, W.Va.; and other cities, they raised or renewed municipal taxes to finance their own districts, demonstrating that the most popular school spending, unsurprisingly, happens closest to home.Leaders of teachers\u2019 unions also pointed to the success of Democratic candidates for governor in Wisconsin, Michigan, Kansas and New Mexico, all of whom emphasized investing in schools.But they acknowledged that a message of taxing the rich to pay for education had not yet hit home in states with conservative or libertarian leanings.\u201cThere was a sense that after the teacher strikes, we would have a wave of electoral victories in every single place in the nation,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of two national unions. Those expectations, she added, were never realistic given deep and persistent national divides.Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the National Education Association, the other national union, celebrated the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike ran campaigns unreservedly in favor of public education. It wasn\u2019t long ago when members of both parties were more likely to criticize public schools and teachers as ineffective.\u201cNow what we have is a whole bunch of folks who made promises\u201d to support schools, she said. \u201cSome of them were real promises, and some were big fat liars. What we\u2019re going to do is keep score.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We don\u2019t have past surveys asking the same question to compare with these results, and support of feminist candidates is still not a majority opinion \u2014 more Republicans opposed electing them than supported it. But the overall support our polls found would have been unthinkable in even recent elections, scholars say. Some compare this moment to the feminist political movements of the 1920s and 1970s. Supporting feminist candidates is tricky, said Phillip Farmer, 38, a web developer in Perryville, Ky., because it has become \u201ca very divisive word.\u201d But he is voting for Ms. McGrath, and said her feminism was one reason. \u201cIf I hear that word, I hear equal rights, equal pay, equal opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems so basic.\u201d Beth Ann Haydon, 60, a small-business owner in Midway, Ky., said she does not support electing feminists, and is voting for Mr. Barr. \u201cFairness is all I ask for,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re strong-willed women, we\u2019re smart and savvy and entrepreneurs. I don\u2019t want to be boxed in as a feminist.\u201d Over all, 55 percent of black women, 53 percent of Hispanic women and 50 percent of white women supported electing feminists. Among Democratic women, 78 percent of white voters, 64 percent of Hispanics and 58 percent of black voters supported it. Three-quarters of women 18 to 34 supported electing more feminists, compared with 43 percent of women 65 and older. Issues like sexual harassment, she said, \u201care what weds conservatives to the word \u2018feminism.\u2019\u201d\u201cThere had been a simple equation: Feminist equals abortion equals Democratic Party,\u201d said Catherine Rymph, chairwoman of the history department at the University of Missouri, who has studied feminism and conservatism. \u201cMaybe because of the issues that are on the table this election cycle, there\u2019s space for people to see feminism as standing for different things.\u201d Politically, MeToo has helped make feminism about the right of women to participate in the economy, said Heather Boushey, executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, who was an economic adviser to Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s about the ability to just get a job and to be free of harassment,\u201d Ms. Boushey said, adding, \u201cBoth men and women have a deep, vested interest in women\u2019s economic success.\u201d The word feminist was not always affiliated with political liberals. Shortly after the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote in 1920, a split emerged among suffragists. On one side, women who called themselves feminists backed the Equal Rights Amendment, which would erase legal distinctions between the sexes. They tended to be elite, educated and professional. On the other side, a much bigger group, which included working-class women and labor unions, supported laws that limited women\u2019s work hours. This group rejected the \u201cfeminist\u201d label. The word burst into the mainstream again in the 1970s. The new movement wasn\u2019t initially partisan \u2014 feminists were anyone fighting for women\u2019s rights, whether they were reproductive rights or those related to workplaces and marriages. But as the Republican Party embraced the family values platform and rejected abortion, feminism became associated with the Democratic Party. Younger feminists, who came of age in the wake of Anita Hill\u2019s testimony against Clarence Thomas and the surge of women who ran for office in 1992, have tried to make the word less polarizing. They have said, \u201cLet\u2019s get on with it, we\u2019re feminists and also other things, anti-racist, gender-nonconforming, let\u2019s not fall into name-calling,\u201d Ms. Freedman said.

{"Headline": "In Bosnia, Entrenched Ethnic Divisions Are a Warning to the World", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2014 When a fire breaks out in the Bosnian city of Mostar, Sabit Golos, a veteran firefighter, knows that he does not have to worry unless the flames take hold on the Muslim side of what, from 1992 until 1994, was the front line in a vicious ethnic conflict.That is because Mostar, though long at peace, has two separate fire brigades, one made up mostly of Muslims like Mr. Golos, who are responsible for putting out fires on the east side of the old front line and a second one staffed by Catholic Croats who douse flames on the other side.The line vanished long ago as a boundary between warring communities and does not officially exist. But it lives on in the mind, an emblem of the ethnonationalist fissures that paralyze Mostar and the whole of Bosnia.As Europe and the United States struggle with the rise of ethnic nationalism as a divisive force, Bosnia\u2019s divisions offer a dark lesson in how, once cleaved apart by fear and fighting, communities can stay splintered long after many people have forgotten what it was that pushed them apart.The entrenched disunion here was reflected in recent national elections, marked by nationalist rhetoric and open questioning of Bosnia\u2019s continued existence as a state.\u201cEurope is worried these days about the rise of the far right, but this place was way ahead of the curve in showing how dangerous and enduring ethno-nationalism can be,\u201d said Tim Clancy, an American resident of Bosnia who worked in Mostar throughout the war helping victims of the fighting.Both of Mostar\u2019s fire brigades are part of the same municipal fire service \u2014 just as Mostar\u2019s two garbage collection companies, two hospitals, two electricity companies, two bus stations, two popular nightclubs and two soccer teams all technically serve the same city. But they are in reality barricaded behind the zigzagging line drawn in blood a quarter of a century ago, during Europe\u2019s worst conflict since World War II.\u201cEverything in this town is very clear. Everyone knows whose territory lies where,\u201d Mr. Golos said, adding that his brigade never gets asked by Mostar\u2019s fire service dispatcher to fight a blaze in an area that was controlled by Croat forces during the war, no matter which of the city\u2019s two fire stations is closer.\u201cYou are looking at your own future here,\u201d said Adnan Huskic, a scholar in politics and international relations at the School of Science and Technology in Sarajevo. \u201cWe have been dealing with the rise of nationalist populism for years.\u201dInstead of creating a unitary state, the 1995 agreement that halted the bloodletting in Bosnia \u2014 reached in Dayton, Ohio by the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia \u2014 only entrenched the nationalist elites that prosecuted the war. It divided Bosnia into two \u201centities\u201d \u2014 a Serb-run Republika Srpska and a mixed Muslim-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the summit of this ramshackle state stood the presidency, controlled by three elected presidents, one each for Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims, who are known as Bosniaks.Authority was further subdivided, largely along ethnic lines, with the establishment of 10 local units of government called cantons, each with its own president and set of ministers who duplicate many of the functions of the weak national government.Mr. Golos, the Muslim firefighter, said he has many friends across the ethnic boundary and feels no enmity toward Serbs, who started the fighting but have now mostly left the city, or Croats, who rained artillery shells and sniper fire into his neighborhood during the war.But he worries that, instead of fading, wartime divisions have only hardened. Because of largely segregated schooling, a postwar generation of young Croats and Bosniaks, Mostar\u2019s two main ethnic groups, often know only members of their own group and have little or no shared experience.\u201cWe have moved backwards, not forward,\u201d Mr. Golos said.His 20-year-old daughter, Amila, attended high school in the same building as Croat students but never mixed with them because students went to classes in shifts \u2014 Muslims from 7:30 a.m. and Croats from 2 p.m., a common arrangement in Bosnia.She said she has no Croat friends, though she does know a few Serbs. On weekends, she added, Muslim youth go to Art, a nightclub in the east of the city, while Croats prefer Pink Panther on the other side of town. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to be divided like this but have to accept that the division exists,\u201d she said.Like many young Bosnians, she is now thinking about emigrating to Western Europe, because work there is easier to find and better paid and also to escape the despair that grips many young people.The economy is growing, thanks in part to large infusions of foreign aid, but unemployment among young people is nearly 60 percent.For more than two decades of staggering from crisis to crisis, Bosnia\u2019s fragile system has defied predictions of imminent collapse. This ability to survive against the odds, however, is now seriously at risk, said Paddy Ashdown, a British politician who from 2002 to 2006 served as Bosnia\u2019s most senior foreign official, its so-called high representative.His gloomy prognosis follows national elections held in October that were dominated, particularly in the Republika Srpska, by divisive appeals for tribal loyalty.The result of the balloting, which selected a hard-line nationalist as the Serb member of Bosnia\u2019s tripartite presidency, has stirred fury among Croats, who complain that the election for their own slot on the presidency was tainted by ethnically impure voting: Many Muslims voted for the Croat winner, a moderate Croat now denounced by hard-liners because of his support across ethnic lines.\u201cDoes this lead to conflict? Probably no. But the international community is sleepwalking into an international disaster of major proportions,\u201d Mr. Ashdown said.The problem now, he said, is not just that Bosnia is still so divided but that Europe and the United States are themselves so polarized and have diminishing interest in Bosnia\u2019s troubles. The emerging vacuum is being filled by Russia and Turkey, each keen to reassert itself in the Balkans \u2014 Russia as a protector of the Serbs and Turkey on behalf of Muslims.\u201cThese times remind me of the 1930s. Everything is falling apart. The center cannot hold,\u201d Mr. Ashdown added.Rupert Smith, a British general who commanded United Nations forces in Bosnia at the time of the Dayton agreement, said the American-brokered deal was never meant to be a long-term settlement but simply \u201ca cease-fire agreement\u201d that mirrored and inadvertently reinforced the ethnic divisions on the ground at the time.But he thinks that the Clinton administration made a big mistake by pushing for early Bosnian elections that \u201conly cemented divisions,\u201d he said in a telephone interview, because they favored the nationalist groups that had created the conflict.Over two decades later, the same parties or successors rooted in the same ethnic allegiances still dominate national and local politics. In Mostar, power is divided between the Croat HDZ and Bosniak SDA, the same parties that reduced the center of the city to a wasteland.\u201cIt is often said that war is a continuation of politics by other means, but here in Bosnia politics is a continuation of war by peaceful means,\u201d said Adis Maksic, head of the department of international relations and European studies at International Burch University, a private college near Sarajevo. Bosnia, he added, is \u201cnot so much at peace as in a state of non-war.\u201dWhile friction between communities is rare in daily life, Amna Popovac, an activist in Mostar for Nasa Stranka, a multiethnic party struggling to break down barriers, said nationalist political leaders, all of them men, constantly stoke fear of conflict to rally support and avoid tackling real problems. \u201cTestosterone plays a big role in our politics,\u201d she said.In a recent report on Bosnia to the United Nations, the current high representative in Sarajevo, Valentin Inzko, gave a bleak account of Bosnia\u2019s disarray. He complained that ahead of the October election, Bosnian politicians and parties \u201cfocused primarily on criticizing each other or the international community and grandstanding on divisive nationalist issues, rather than governing effectively and adopting necessary reforms.\u201dSuch grandstanding, amplified by a paternalistic economic system in which jobs and the spoils of corruption are often divided along ethnic lines, has crippled Bosnia as a functioning state.It took years of pushing by the World Bank and others, for example, before Mostar finally agreed to establish a common garbage dump to take trash from the city\u2019s two garbage collectors, one dominated by Muslims and one largely Croat.Even now, said Nevenko Herceg, the president of the cantonal government, the common dump, run by a private company in the largely Muslim side of the city, sometimes refuses to take Croat trash.The wartime front line runs along the Neretva River, now spanned again by a rebuilt Stari Most, or Old Bridge, a 16th-century jewel of Ottoman architecture destroyed by Croat artillery fire during the war, and then cuts across the river for a few hundred yards into territory on the west bank, running along a boulevard lined with ruins and buildings still pockmarked by bullets.Even today, the street has two names: the Boulevard of the People\u2019s Revolution for residents on the Muslim side, and the Boulevard of the Croat Defenders for those on the opposite side.Differences between Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs are so small \u2014 they speak the same language, look the same and mostly eat the same food \u2014 that some scholars of the 1990s war have turned to Freud and what he called \u201cthe narcissism of minor differences\u201d to explain the fury of their rival nationalisms.The only clear marker is religion, though Catholic Croats, Muslim Bosniaks and Orthodox Serbs are still united by the fact that few worship regularly and nearly all like going to bars and cafes.Bosnia\u2019s biggest curse, said Ms. Popovac, the activist in Mostar, is not ethnic or religious enmity but its nationalist political leaders, who fan the fears of the communities they claim to represent to save themselves and a deeply corrupt system that has enriched them.\u201cJust follow the money,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of an activist in Mostar. She is Amna Popovac, not Amnia. The article also misspelled the name of a river that the Bosnian wartime front runs along. The river is the Neretva, not the Nirveta. In addition, the article misspelled the surname of the United Nations' high representative in Sarajevo. He is Valentin Inzko, not Inzeko.Advertisement"}

Facebook recently took a page from TikTok, a Chinese service that is a sensation among Western tweens, by releasing its own highly similar app for creating goofy short videos.If people in the West didn\u2019t see this coming, it was because they mistook China\u2019s authoritarianism for hostility toward technology.But in some ways Chinese tech firms are less fettered than American ones. Witness the backlash against Big Data in the United States, the calls to break up giants like Facebook and the anxiety about digital addiction. None of those are big problems for Chinese companies.In China, there is pretty much only one rule, and it is simple: Don\u2019t undermine the state.So titans like Weibo and Baidu heed censorship orders. Unwanted beliefs and ideologies are kept out.Beyond that, everything is fair game. Start-ups can achieve mammoth scale with astonishing speed; they can also crash brutally. Thanks to weak intellectual property protections, they can rip one another off with abandon \u2014 not great for rewarding innovation, but O.K. for consumers, who get lots of choices.And the money just keeps flowing in.$25 billionUnited States2015China10520102011201220132014201520162017\u201918$25 billionUnited States2015China105\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917\u201918$25 billionUnited States2015China10520102011201220132014201520162017\u201918In another advantage, old-school industries like media, finance and health care have been dominated by lumbering state-run giants. That has allowed internet champions like Alibaba and Tencent to sew themselves into these businesses with ease.With their mobile payment platforms, the two giants have built sprawling ecosystems in which vast amounts of commercial activity now take place. Little remains of daily life that has not been transformed. Shopping. Getting a loan. Renting a bike. Even going to the doctor.This level of clout hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by China\u2019s leaders. Never in the Communist era have private entities wielded such influence over people\u2019s lives.To keep tech in its place, the government is demanding stakes in companies and influence over management. Regulators have reprimanded online platforms for hosting content they deem distasteful \u2014 too raunchy, too flirty, too creepy or just too weird.That\u2019s why the best way for tech companies to thrive in China is to make themselves useful to the state. Nearly everyone in China uses WeChat, making the social network a great way for the authorities to police what people say and do. SenseTime, whose facial recognition technology powers those fun filters in video apps, also sells software to law enforcement.The risk for these companies is that the government demands more, sucking away resources that could be better spent chasing innovations or breaking into new markets.In China, says Lance Noble of the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, the government\u2019s support \u201ccan be a blessing and a curse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alan Greenspan\u2019s Ode to Creative Destruction", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.At age 92, Alan Greenspan remains a towering figure in American finance. He was the second-longest serving chairman of the Federal Reserve (after William McChesney Martin). Dubbed a \u201crock star\u201d by The Economist, Greenspan achieved an unprecedented level of celebrity for a Fed chairman as stocks soared to record levels in the 1990s, and then notoriety, as his legacy was undermined by the Great Recession that began in 2008, less than two years after he left office.Greenspan was appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1987 and reappointed by three successive presidents from both parties. That a lifelong champion of free markets and an early acolyte of the objectivist author and philosopher Ayn Rand could so successfully straddle the political spectrum for so long is a testament to the bipartisan free-market ideology that followed the end of the Cold War. At the time it all seemed like the ultimate triumph of democratic capitalism.Now, 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers provoked a global financial panic and led to what Greenspan refers to as \u201cthe great stagnation,\u201d the self-congratulation seems to have been premature. Both parties have largely repudiated Greenspan\u2019s precepts, with Republicans lurching toward protectionism and a nativist hostility for globalization and Democrats lurching toward something he would surely find equally repugnant: income redistribution, ever-expanding government entitlements and identity politics.Less a conventional history than an extended polemic, \u201cCapitalism in America: A History,\u201d by Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, a columnist and editor for The Economist, explores and ultimately celebrates the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s concept of \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d which the authors describe as a \u201cperennial gale\u201d that \u201cuproots businesses \u2014 and lives \u2014 but that, in the process, creates a more productive economy.\u201d While this approach risks oversimplifying centuries of American economic history, it provides a useful lens for analyzing America\u2019s current polarization and for understanding the centrifugal forces that have given rise to a President Trump, on the right, or a Bernie Sanders on the left.Other than a few paragraphs arguing the case that the Fed\u2019s easy money policy had little to no impact on the housing bubble that led to the Great Recession, \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d has almost nothing to say about Greenspan\u2019s own role in recent economic history, and he offers no defense of his tenure as Fed chairman.But that isn\u2019t his purpose here. \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d is Greenspan and Wooldridge\u2019s plea to re-embrace America\u2019s long-held capitalist traditions and entrepreneurial culture in order to rescue the country from its current \u201cfading dynamism.\u201dWhile \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d begins with the colonial era, when Americans were already enjoying \u201cthe world\u2019s fastest growth rate,\u201d Greenspan and Wooldridge hit their narrative stride and ideological sweet spot when they reach the late-19th-century \u201cAge of Giants,\u201d a name they prefer to the prevailing \u201cRobber Barons,\u201d who may have been rich but, as self-made men, were neither robbers nor hereditary barons.In the authors\u2019 approving view, men like the banker John Pierpont Morgan, the oil baron John D. Rockefeller and the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, all born within a few years of one another in the 1830s, were \u201cgiants of energy and ambition\u201d who \u201cexercised more power than anybody other than kings or generals had exercised before.\u201d These men (and they were all men) are \u201cheroes of creative destruction\u201d because they \u201chelped to produce a massive improvement in living standards for all.\u201dThat they also produced social and economic upheaval for many is a small price to pay, the authors contend. The rise of their great corporations, not to mention the industries they helped build and finance, from railroads to autos to retail chains like Sears, Roebuck, displaced millions of workers and small-business owners who were rendered obsolete. Cyrus McCormack\u2019s threshing machine displaced a quarter of the world\u2019s agricultural workers. \u201cPeople seldom achieve great things without being willing to ride roughshod over the opposition,\u201d the authors note.Not surprisingly, these \u201cgiants\u201d attracted popular hostility and resentment \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt called them \u201cmalefactors of great wealth.\u201d Their success and attendant wealth unleashed a populist backlash. Williams Jennings Bryan campaigned against Wall Street and its \u201ccross of gold.\u201d Congress passed the first antitrust laws. The first federal income tax paved the way to income redistribution.History\u2019s harsh judgment of the era (which culminated in the 1929 stock market crash and ensuing Great Depression) suggests why creative destruction has had trouble gaining much of a following. Like the Robber Barons, today\u2019s drivers of creative destruction, technology and internet entrepreneurs, \u201care seldom the easiest of heroes, nor the nicest,\u201d the authors note. \u201cThey will sacrifice anything, from their own peace of mind to the lives of those around them, to build a business empire and then protect that business empire from destruction.\u201d Such people are prone \u201cto what the Norwegians call Stormannsgalskap, or the \u2018madness of great men.\u2019\u201d Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, who merits several approving mentions, comes to mind. The disruptive forces they unleash generate \u201cunease: the fiercer the gale the greater the unease.\u201dAnd not all destruction, it should be said, is creative. In a nod to the exotic derivatives and mortgage-backed securities that led to the Great Recession (and went largely undetected by Greenspan\u2019s Fed), Greenspan and Wooldridge acknowledge that \u201ccreative destruction can sometimes be all destruction and no creation.\u201dThe popular reaction is typically a well-intentioned but misguided effort to preserve the status quo. \u201cPeople link arms to protect threatened jobs and save dying industries. They denounce capitalists for their ruthless greed. The result is stagnation: In trying to tame the creative destruction, for example by preserving jobs or keeping factories open, they end up killing it,\u201d the authors contend.In their view, America today is already well along that path to stagnation. \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d barely mentions Trump beyond condemning his \u201cdangerous\u201d trade policies and warning about the fiscal recklessness of his tax cuts. But the entire book is an indictment of Trump\u2019s stands on immigration and protectionism and his attempts to resurrect fading mining and industrial concerns \u2014 attempts that, as \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d shows repeatedly, are almost surely doomed.At the same time, Greenspan\u2019s admiration for the rugged individualists who populate the novels of Ayn Rand (who merits a nod in this history) and the frontier spirit that animated America\u2019s early development shows no sign of weakening as Greenspan has aged. He and Wooldridge lament that Americans are \u201closing the rugged pioneering spirit\u201d that once defined them and mock the \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d and \u201csafe spaces\u201d that now obsess academia.The authors quote Winston Churchill: \u201cWe have not journeyed across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.\u201d But now, they conclude, \u201csugar candy people are everywhere.\u201dTheir prescription for American renewal \u2014 reining in entitlements, instituting fiscal responsibility and limited government, deregulating, focusing on education and opportunity, and above all fostering a fierceness in the face of creative destruction \u2014 was Republican orthodoxy not so long ago. Before the Great Recession it was embraced by most Democrats as well, and more recently by President Bill Clinton, the recipient of glowing praise in these pages.No longer. \u201cCapitalism in America,\u201d in both its interpretation of economic history and its recipe for revival, is likely to offend the dominant Trump wing of the Republican Party and the resurgent left among Democrats. It\u2019s not clear who, if anyone, will pick up the Greenspan torch.America is now \u201ctrapped in an iron cage of its own making,\u201d the authors contend. But \u201cwe have shown that America has all the keys that it needs to open the cage. The great question is whether it has the political will to turn them.\u201dJames B.

Falling oil prices deserve some of the blame.The average yield on risky company bonds \u2014 measured by the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index \u2014 has climbed to 7.3 percent. Yields rise when bond prices fall.Notably, junk bond yields have moved higher as the rate on Treasuries has retreated.

The wider spread is an indication that investors are demanding greater compensation against the risk of default.What does the price of crude oil \u2014 which has dropped more than 30 percent in the past two months \u2014 have to do with this?American energy companies have been the biggest issuers of high-yield bonds since 2015, according to Dealogic, and their bonds account for about 15 percent of the market. As the price of crude falls, investors\u2019 concerns about the health of these companies and their ability to pay off the bonds grows.It\u2019s not for nothing. In 2014, when oil prices began to slide, hundreds of smaller drillers went bankrupt, and manufacturers and other businesses that supply the energy industry also took a hit.But energy companies or high-risk companies aren\u2019t the only reasons for the growing caution.

{"Headline": "Clean Energy Is Surging, but Not Fast Enough to Solve Global Warming", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Over the next two decades, the world\u2019s energy system will undergo a huge transformation. Wind and solar power are poised to become dominant sources of electricity. China\u2019s once-relentless appetite for coal is set to wane. The amount of oil we use to fuel our cars could peak and decline.But there\u2019s a catch: The global march toward clean energy still isn\u2019t happening fast enough to avoid dangerous global warming,\u00a0at least not unless governments put forceful new policy measures in place to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Here are some of the report\u2019s major themes:Around the world, the electricity sector \u201cis experiencing its most dramatic transformation since its creation more than a century ago,\u201d the report said. One big factor is the rapid growth of wind and solar power.Over the past five years, the average cost of solar power has declined 65 percent and the cost of onshore wind has fallen 15 percent. The energy agency predicts those prices will keep tumbling as technology improves and governments scale back subsidies. Solar plants are becoming well-placed to outcompete new coal plants almost everywhere.\u201cOur solar expectations are about 20 percent higher than they were last year, both because of new policies in China and India and because the costs are coming down so fast,\u201d said Fatih Birol, the agency\u2019s executive director.For decades, developing countries like China and India have turned to coal as the cheapest, easiest way to power their economies and lift themselves out of poverty. It\u2019s a big reason carbon dioxide emissions have skyrocketed. That\u2019s quickly changing.And, while countries in Southeast Asia and elsewhere are still drawing up plans to build new coal plants, the agency expects this frenzy of construction to slow sharply after 2020. But don\u2019t expect coal to disappear altogether. While the era of rapid coal growth is fading, the agency projects that global coal consumption could stay flat for decades. One reason for that: The average coal plant in Asia is less than 15 years old (compared to about 41 years in the United States).\u00a0Those plants will keep polluting for decades, unless countries decide to retire them early or develop technology to capture and bury their emissions. Even as the world puts hundreds of millions of new cars on the road, we\u2019re increasingly using less oil to fuel them. The report projects that global oil use for cars will peak by the mid-2020s as countries ratchet up their fuel-economy standards and deploy more electric vehicles.Those sectors haven\u2019t seen the same improvements in efficiency. As a result, the agency expects global oil demand to keep rising through 2040, led by developing countries.One reason: Carbon-free sources like wind, solar and nuclear power aren\u2019t yet growing fast enough to keep up with rising global energy demand, particularly in places like India and Southeast Asia. That means fossil fuel use keeps growing to fill the gap.Governments will play a key role: The report notes that the world invests $2 trillion annually in energy infrastructure, and 70 percent of that is directed by state-owned companies or regulators. \u201cThat tells me that our energy destiny will rely heavily on government decisions in the next two decades,\u201d Mr. Birol said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Deal in Crisis After 2 U.K. Cabinet Ministers Quit", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain faced a deep political crisis on Thursday after two cabinet ministers quit her government, including Dominic Raab, her chief negotiator on withdrawal from the European Union \u2014 decisions that threaten to wreck not only her plans for the exit but also her leadership.Mr. Raab\u2019s departure was not only unexpected but also deeply damaging to Mrs. May\u2019s authority, increasing the risk that she might face a leadership challenge from rebel lawmakers inside her own Conservative Party.Shortly after his announcement, Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, resigned, adding to the turmoil.At a news conference at the end of the day, Mrs. May, projecting her customary confidence, insisted that she was not worried about the prospects for the deal or her own political fortunes.\u201cLeadership is about taking the right decisions, not the easy ones,\u201d she said. \u201cAm I going to see this through? Yes.\u201dThe pound, an indicator of stability amid the Brexit debate, fell sharply on the news that Mr. Raab had resigned and dropped again when the pensions minister stepped down. The currency, which was worth close to $1.30 before Mr. Raab\u2019s resignation, dipped as low as $1.2753 by midmorning and continued to have an unsteady day.After sliding in the minutes before Mrs. May started her speech, the currency rose to $1.2786 as she talked.The crisis is a grave one for Mrs. May, who knew even before the resignations that she would struggle to win Parliamentary approval for her draft agreement. She addressed the House of Commons on Thursday morning to sell her deal and for nearly three hours took questions on the deal, nearly all of them ranging from skeptical to outright hostile.\u201cWhat we agreed yesterday was not the final deal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a draft treaty that means that we will leave the E.U. in a smooth and orderly way on the 29th of March, 2019, and which sets the framework for a future relationship that delivers in our national interest.\u201dShe added that the deal \u201cdelivers in ways that many said could simply not be done.\u201d It would put in place a transitional relationship with the European Union through the end of 2020, while a permanent arrangement is negotiated, but the transition period could be extended.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, called Mrs. May\u2019s agreement \u201ca leap in the dark, an ill-defined deal by a never-defined date.\u201d The continued uncertainty about Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, lasting at least another two years and possibly much longer, will accelerate the exodus of businesses and investment that is already underway, he said.\u201cParliament cannot, and I believe will not,\u201d accept the arrangement, he added.That view was echoed by Ian Blackford, a lawmaker from the Scottish National Party, who said the prime minister was \u201ctrying to sell us a deal that is already dead in the water.\u201dReflecting the cool response to Mrs. May\u2019s plan and the talk of a leadership challenge, Laura Kuenssberg, the political editor of the BBC, asked at the prime minister\u2019s news conference, \u201cIs it not the case now that you are in office, but you\u2019re not really in power?\u201d Mrs. May did not answer directly, sticking firmly to her talking points about the deal and declining to dwell on the politics around it.The lack of support for the agreement from lawmakers in both major parties had kept the pound down. \u201cWhat we need to see is ministers who have not resigned come out and back the deal,\u201d said Jordan Rochester, a foreign exchange strategist at Nomura Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s not the P.R. campaign we\u2019ve expected.\u201dStill, the lack of clarity kept the pound from collapsing, Mr. Rochester said, though calls for a vote of no confidence in Mrs. May did not help. Despite a series of negative headlines through the day, he noted, the pound did not continue to fall.\u201cThere is a buyer out there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s guys thinking, \u2018It\u2019s bad now, but it increases the chance of remain.\u2019 \u201dEuropean Union officials lay low on Thursday, declining to comment on the drama across the English Channel, or to speculate about what would happen if Mrs. May were ousted or if Parliament rejected the deal. But speaking on the condition of anonymity, they said the union had gone a long way to satisfy the prime minister\u2019s demands that there be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and that Britain continue to have frictionless trade with the bloc.Negotiators \u201cthink it is the best we can do collectively with the constraints that we have on both sides,\u201d one official said.Mrs. May made much the same point: \u201cNobody has any alternative proposal that both delivers on the referendum and ensures there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\u201dAlthough a hard-line supporter of Brexit, Mr. Raab had been a core member of the cabinet, and his presence had reassured other hard-line lawmakers. He served as Brexit secretary for barely four months, succeeding David Davis, who also resigned, because he felt that Mrs. May was not taking a hard enough line in negotiations.In his letter of resignation, Mr. Raab said that he could not \u201creconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made.\u201dMs. McVey\u2019s departure, though damaging, was less of a surprise.Another cabinet minister, Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, was also reportedly reconsidering her position after a cabinet debate on Wednesday that Mrs. May described, diplomatically, as \u201cimpassioned.\u201d As many as 10 cabinet ministers were reported to have voiced reservations.Iain Duncan Smith, a leading Conservative supporter of Brexit and former party leader, told the BBC that the effect of Mr. Raab\u2019s resignation would be \u201cdevastating,\u201d because it suggested that the Brexit secretary\u2019s concerns had been ignored, despite his pivotal position in government and in withdrawal negotiations.Such is the unhappiness from around the party at Mrs. May\u2019s draft deal that the calculation of those who want to oust her might change.It would take written requests from 48 Conservative lawmakers to secure a vote of no confidence in Mrs. May. Though the hard-line pro-Brexit faction has that number, it has held back so far because it does not believe that it has enough support to topple her.To oust her as prime minister would require a majority of Conservative lawmakers \u2014 at least 158 \u2014 voting to force her out.On the floor of Parliament on Thursday, Mrs. May faced a torrent of criticism, much of it from members of her own party. One Conservative lawmaker, Julian Lewis, described her deal with Europe as \u201ca \u2018Hotel California\u2019 Brexit deal which ensures that we can never truly leave the E.U.\u201dMr. Rees-Mogg, the Conservative Brexit hard-liner, said that the prime minister\u2019s promises and actions \u201cno longer match,\u201d and asked why he should not join those demanding a vote of no confidence. He later confirmed that he had done just that.Britons voted to quit the European Union in a 2016 referendum, but since then the Conservatives have been split between those who want to keep some close economic ties to the bloc, to protect the economy, and others who want a cleaner break.Worryingly for Mrs. May, many of her enemies, on both the right and the left, are converging around the view that the compromise she has carefully forged is the worst of both worlds, leaving Britain without a voice in the European Union but still subject to many of its trade rules. Several leading Brexit supporters have characterized the draft deal as worse than membership in the bloc they find so objectionable.The focus of the discord has been around plans to ensure that, whatever happens in future trade talks, there should be no physical checks at the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which is a member of the European Union.Under the so-called backstop plan that is part of the draft deal, the whole of the United Kingdom would remain in a customs union with the European Union until future trade plans that negate the need for border checks are worked out.But Northern Ireland would be subject to more of the European Union\u2019s regulatory processes than the rest of the country, a fact that Mr. Raab said \u201cpresents a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201dHe also objected to the fact that Britain could not unilaterally leave the backstop, a move that would clear a path to exit a customs union and pursue trade deals with other countries.One of Mr. Raab\u2019s under secretaries for Brexit, Suella Braverman, also stepped down on Thursday. Their departure had been preceded on Thursday morning by the resignation of Shailesh Vara, a junior Northern Ireland minister.Speaking at a news conference in Brussels shortly before Mr. Raab\u2019s announcement, Michel Barnier, the top European Union negotiator, and Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said they would call a summit meeting for Nov. 25, where leaders of the bloc\u2019s member states could endorse the deal.Mr. Tusk said that the accord approved by the British cabinet meets two crucial objectives: It limits the damage Brexit would cause, and it protects the vital interests of the 27 remaining members states and the European Union as a whole.\u201cWe have always said Brexit is a lose-lose situation and these negotiations were always about damage control,\u201d he said.Mr. Barnier said that the coming days, when the focus will be on finalizing a political declaration outlining the future relationship between Britain and the European Union, would be \u201cintense,\u201d adding that \u201cwe have no time to lose.\u201d Brexit is scheduled to take effect on March 29.However, European Union officials have made it clear that they were scheduling the summit meeting on the assumption that turbulence in Mrs. May\u2019s party would not paralyze or overwhelm her government.Reporting was contributed by Michael Wolgelenter, Amie Tsang and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from London, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.Advertisement"}

And generally, the president has been worse than useless. His rhetorical high point probably came when he went to the synagogue where 11 people were murdered and didn\u2019t say anything.Hours after the synagogue shooting, Trump was already back at a rally, before his howling supporters in Illinois. To be fair, he began by speaking about \u201cthe hateful poison of anti-Semitism\u201d and the need \u201cto renew the bonds of love and loyalty that hold us all together as Americans.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d cried the audience on cue.\u201cI had a feeling you might say that,\u201d the leader of the free world said happily.But seriously, we have to let this leader-in-a-crisis part go. You can be driven to distraction by only a couple of different things on any given night.The worst thing about the rallies is that Trump keeps coming back to immigration, even though recent events have made it crystal clear that this is poisoning the nation. (\u201cWe\u2019re getting prepared for the caravan folks, you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d)He\u2019s now adding a plug for his new plan to toss out the part of the Constitution that says if you\u2019re born here, you\u2019re a citizen \u2014 an idea that has even Paul Ryan reeling. (\u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to bring it up. I said we have to bring it up.\u201d)We know now that both the alleged pipe bomb-maker and the synagogue shooting suspect were obsessed with immigrants. Immigrant-bashing is what Trump thinks is the key to winning the midterms. It\u2019s also the place where Trump becomes an abettor in the right-wing, white nationalist turmoil that\u2019s torturing the country.It\u2019s insane to expect him to lift up the nation. But is it too much to ask that he just avoid the violence-inducing themes in his repertoire?For instance, he loves to remind his fans that he won the election, and that\u2019s a safe topic. Maybe he could devote half an hour of every rally to his theory that it\u2019s harder to win electoral votes than the popular vote. Plus crowd estimates \u2014 he could spend some time claiming that 47 percent of the entire population of Fort Wayne, Ind., was standing outside the door, in terrible weather, just to watch him on closed-circuit television.We\u2019re better off if he talks about the mysterious promise of a 10 percent tax cut known to no one in Washington but Donald Trump. And the Space Force! (\u201cSo important. That\u2019s where it\u2019s at.\u201d)What else could he say that isn\u2019t dangerous? Well \u2014 he could talk about the things the Republican majority did over the last two years. O.K., that definitely wouldn\u2019t fill up an hour.Then there\u2019s the Republican candidates \u2014 Trump\u2019s already spending more time actually talking about them in recent appearances. Earlier in the season they were lucky if they got to walk across the stage, but now they\u2019re getting quality time. And he\u2019s praising them off a teleprompter, which is definitely a help for the politicians in question.But you\u2019ll miss the off-the-cuff paeans like the one he gave the other night to a congressman from Illinois. (\u201cAnd frankly the Future Farmers, I could have done that one. But this is a rally for Mike Bost and frankly this one maybe I could have except I don\u2019t want to change our life for somebody that\u2019s sick and evil.\u201d)And if all else fails, instead of just announcing, as he always does, that \u201cthis is the greatest political movement in the history of our country,\u201d he could claim it\u2019s the greatest in the history of the planet. And compare himself to Thucydides or Winston Churchill or Pope John Paul II.Honestly, it\u2019d be such a relief.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slowing Global Growth May Lessen the Threat of Rising Rates", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the biggest threats to stock prices is suddenly looking less scary.Investors\u2019 concerns about rising interest rates have helped fuel the recent selling that has left the S&P 500 stock index nearly 6.6 percent off its high. But there have been signs in recent days that interest rates may not rise as quickly as investors previously expected.Officials at the Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, made remarks last week that suggested they were becoming more mindful of a slowing global economy.While that may mean stock investors will soon be able to worry less about rising rates, the slowdown in growth could still weigh on stock prices.Central bank policymakers tend to hold off on raising interest rates if they believe the economy is decelerating. Higher rates push up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. That, in turn, may prompt them to spend less, which can weaken the economy.Rising rates can hurt stock prices in another way. They make the returns from bonds more attractive compared with stocks. That may cause investors to shift some of their money to bonds from stocks.But the case for steadily higher rates may be weakening.The bond markets are signaling increasing concerns about global economic growth. After hitting 3.24 percent earlier this month \u2014 a move that underscored investors\u2019 belief that rates were on their way up \u2014 the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell last week to close at 3.07 percent on Friday.A shift is also occurring in the market that investors use to bet on the Fed\u2019s future interest rate decisions. A majority of investors no longer expect the central bank to raise rates twice between now and when policymakers meet in March. A week ago, investors were forecasting a 54 percent chance of two increases.While the tone of Fed officials may also have softened a bit, they have not said they will hold off on interest rate increases. The gentler tone is apparent in comments about growth. When asked last week what headwinds the economy faces, Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, mentioned slowing global growth, calling that \u201ca real thing.\u201d He also listed the waning effect of the United States\u2019 tax cuts and the Fed\u2019s own interest rate increases.\u201cThese are things we are well aware of, though,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cWe know that when we\u2019re making policy, and we think about those, and kind of have a sense of what they might be.\u201dOn Friday, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, Richard H. Clarida, noted that slowing abroad could affect the United States\u2019 economy. \u201cIt impacts big parts of the economy through trade and through capital markets and the like,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC.Advertisement"}

Its politics had both democratic and authoritarian elements, though on balance those were more democratic than authoritarian. Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement with the Chinese government in Beijing afforded it a high degree of autonomy. The territory was able to maintain the rule of law by constraining the local government\u2019s powers and protecting citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.Not anymore. In the aftermath of the Umbrella Movement in late 2014, a series of protests and an occupation that paralyzed major Hong Kong streets for 79 days, the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) has adjusted its approach. The Chinese government in Beijing has increasingly cracked down on Hong Kong politically, while steadily integrating the city\u2019s economy into the mainland\u2019s.The onslaught against free speech extends beyond candidates for political office \u2014 and doesn\u2019t seem to require making any offending statement at all.Beijing\u2019s political red lines here keep shifting \u2014 but always in the direction of more repression.Prosecutorial power is already being used to deter people from organizing any form of civil disobedience. Eight other leaders of the Umbrella Movement and I will be on trial starting Monday simply for organizing and leading protests that called for respecting the Hong Kong people\u2019s existing democratic rights. We are charged with vague common law offenses: conspiring to cause a public nuisance, as well as inciting others to cause a public nuisance and inciting others to incite others to cause a public nuisance. We face seven years in prison, a far more severe sentence than more modern laws provide.Not many people, inside or outside Hong Kong, seem to notice these changes or to take them seriously enough. Perhaps it\u2019s because the deterioration is incremental and individual measures of repression are disguised as legal rules or sugarcoated in economic benefits. Yet Hong Kong no longer is what it was, nor what it is supposed to be.But it isn\u2019t dead either. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King was right to say, \u201cOnly when it is dark enough can you see the stars.\u201d Many people in Hong Kong continue to strive for democracy and to nonviolently resist Beijing\u2019s creeping crackdown. We may not be able to stop the advance of authoritarianism. But we must do what we can at least to slow it down.Benny Tai Yiu-ting is an associate professor of law at the University of Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wrong Way to Punish Iran ", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy threatening to penalize Swift, the financial messaging service, the U.S. is alienating European allies and could undercut the dollar\u2019s dominance.Mr. Farrell is a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University. Mr. Newman is a professor in the School of Foreign Service and Government Department at Georgetown University.On Nov. 4, the United States is set to escalate sanctions against Iran as part of its decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. These sanctions include financial messaging, so the Trump administration could press for Swift, a private cooperative based in Brussels, to disconnect Iranian banks from its network. Swift is like a global post office for banks, providing a secure messaging system for the vast majority of international transactions, so disconnecting Iran would isolate it almost completely from the global financial system and would have drastic and immediate consequences for the Iranian economy.If the Trump administration goes ahead with this plan, it will have serious consequences for the United States as well. It will undermine America\u2019s influence over the international financial architecture and diminish its power over allies and adversaries alike. These baby steps may falter, but they provide a glimpse of what the world would look like if Europe became a competitive global financial power. One of the promises of globalization was that it would promote peace and stability by creating international economic networks that make countries more dependent on one another. Instead, America has weaponized this interdependence, twisting Swift and the dollar clearing system to strangle its adversaries. Other powers could do the same, or even undermine the United States by building alternative global networks.That is why the United States needs European cooperation with its approach to pressuring Iran. The European Union is the one power that could credibly test America\u2019s dominance. The E.U. may not have an army, but it does have economic might. And it can use that power to harm American companies and, if pushed far enough, fragment the international financial system.Sanctioning Swift would be a mistake for the United States. If the European Union can no longer rely on the United States, it will move to further develop its own payment channels. This would take years, but the end result could isolate the United States. Other countries \u2014 not just those in Europe \u2014 may prefer to be part of a European-led financial network, one that is backed by a publicly stated commitment to the rule of law, rather than a global financial system dominated by an increasingly unpredictable America. European politicians have long looked with envy at the power of the United States dollar. They now have an opening to position the euro as a viable competitor.The Trump administration hates being constrained by its allies. What it does not realize is that American economic power depends on the assent of other countries to be part of a financial system led by the United States. Push them too far, and American authority and influence could be permanently undermined.Henry J. Farrell is a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University.

{"Headline": "Why Only Some Workers Get Time Off to Vote on Election Day", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a common refrain around election time in the United States: Voter turnout here is exceptionally low, and many other developed democracies consistently manage to do better.And in some cases there is another, more practical reason: People just can\u2019t find the time to get to a polling place.Would it help if more people could get time off from work on Election Day? And if so, is this the responsibility of the federal government, state legislatures or private companies?Some people are guaranteed time off from work on Election Day because of where they live.Democrats or Republicans will piece together a House majority from across five main types of congressional districts that are most competitive this fall. Here\u2019s our field guide to those races.\u201cI think it would be great to get a little more standardization, because it\u2019s true that we are a country that has very different election laws state by state,\u201d she said.Most states posit that employees should have some time off to vote, and some specify a certain amount of time, like two or three consecutive hours while polling places are open. (But even that does not necessarily mean employees will get time off, since many workers could find that time before or after their shifts.)Some states, like California, Minnesota and Maryland, say that if employees need to take time off to vote, employers should pay them as long as they meet certain conditions; others, like Georgia, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, do not mandate such payment. Some states allow early voting more than a month in advance; others allow one or two weeks. In a few states, including Connecticut, Alabama and Kentucky, there is no early voting at all. (Absentee ballots are still an option, but states vary \u2014 again \u2014 in how strictly those are regulated.)And in some places, people don\u2019t even need to deal with voting booths. Residents can have their ballots mailed to them in states such as Oregon, Colorado and Washington. (This can work wonders for turnout; in Oregon, the number of registered voters who vote, including in midterm elections, regularly exceeds 70 percent.)With such a patchwork of policies, are there any blanket solutions that could make it easier for all Americans to get to the polls?For example: What if we simply rescheduled the vote altogether?The Upshot has partnered with Siena College to poll dozens of the most competitive House and Senate races across the country.That might be addressed with a federal holiday provision mandating that all employees have several hours of paid time off on voting day, said Adam Bonica, an elections expert and associate professor of political science at Stanford University.And given the long history of low electoral turnout in the United States, he added, any legislative change that could increase access to the polls should be considered.\u201cWe should do all of the above,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have an Election Day holiday, early voting, absentee voting and voting by mail for anyone who wants to vote that way. All of these things are completely feasible and doable. It just takes the political will.\u201d\u201cThis is a pretty simple thing for companies to do,\u201d Mr. Bonica said. \u201cAnd at a time when corporate profits are basically at a record high and companies just got a massive tax cut, the least they can do is make sure that our democracy is well served.\u201dIf people get time off according to which company they happen to work for, it might exacerbate the inconsistencies that already exist across states. And these moves do little to address the scheduling demands of multiple jobs, including informal work like taking care of family members or maintaining a household.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the easiest system,\u201d Ms. Spillane said.She added that it might help to treat Election Day as a true holiday in a cultural sense, rather than just a reason to take time off work. \u201cWe need to figure out a way to promote a culture of participation and make it fun, celebratory and appealing for people to participate civically,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Oust Walker in Wisconsin and Kobach in Kansas but Fall Short in Florida and Ohio", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats wrested control of governorships from Republicans in seven states on Tuesday including Wisconsin, where they ousted Scott Walker after eight tumultuous years as the state\u2019s chief executive, and Kansas, a surprise victory in a longtime Republican stronghold.But Republicans fended off strong Democratic challenges to hold on to the governorships of Florida, Ohio and Iowa, maintaining their control of three states likely to be crucial in the 2020 presidential elections.The victories expanded the number of states with Democratic chief executives \u2014 an important consideration as legislatures begin the process of drawing congressional district lines. In addition to Kansas and Wisconsin, Democrats also picked up governor\u2019s seats in Nevada, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico and Maine.Still, the results reflected a night of mixed tidings for the party out of power, given that Democrats were hoping to install a rising young star in Florida and sweep the midwest states where President Trump forged the core of his unexpected victory two years ago.And in Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, defeated Fred Hubbell, a Democrat and wealthy businessman, in a tossup contest that had hinged on local issues including the state\u2019s health care system and its economy.The biggest defeat for Republicans was in Wisconsin. Mr. Walker, a onetime rising party star and short-lived presidential candidate, was seeking a third term in a state that unexpectedly flipped to Mr. Trump in 2016. The showing gave hope to Democrats eager to win the state back in 2020.Mr. Walker fell to Tony Evers, a Democrat and the state schools superintendent. As in other Midwestern states, Democrats ran against Mr. Walker and the Republican establishment rather than against Mr. Trump.In Nevada Steve Silosak, a Democratic businessman, defeated Adam Laxalt, the Republican attorney general, a victory that underlined the extent to which the state has been edging into the Democratic column \u2014 Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump there in 2016, and Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, unseated an incumbent Republican senator, Dean Heller, on Tuesday night.It also reflects what analysts view as the rising power of Latino voters in the state. Mr. Trump notably did not campaign in Nevada during the final weeks leading to the vote, a time when he was stressing what he described as the threat of illegal immigrationMr. Newsom loped to an easy victory, riding the overwhelmingly Democratic edge in the state but also the strong opposition to Mr. Trump. The president endorsed Mr. Cox in the primary.The contests for governor were, to a considerable extent, overshadowed by the battle for control of Congress during this contentious election season. But along with the battle to control state legislatures, they could prove significant in setting the nation\u2019s political landscape for the next decade.This new class of governors will take office as states prepare for the highly partisan process of drawing congressional and legislative districts. Republicans seized power in states across the nation in 2010, in the first midterm election of the presidency of Barack Obama, which put them in a position to use the redistricting process to cement their majority in Congress.Mr. Trump was an early supporter of Mr. DeSantis, who defended the president on television and modeled his candidacy after the president\u2019s. And Mr. Trump returned the favor, heading to Florida to campaign on his behalf.Heading into Tuesday\u2019s election, Republicans controlled 33 governor seats, compared with 16 held by Democrats. (One is an independent). There were 26 Republican-held seats on the ballot Tuesday and nine Democratic seats.One of the most closely watched races in the nation was unresolved early in the morning. In Georgia, Brian Kemp, the Republican secretary of state, held a slight lead over Stacey Abrams, who was trying to become the first African-American woman elected governor in any state. Addressing supporters early Wednesday, she said she wanted all ballots counted and suggested the campaign may go to a runoff.In Kansas, Mr. Kobach is best known for his hard-line views on immigration and voting rights, and his candidacy was considered problematic by both national and state party leaders, who worried that he was too extreme to win a general election. Nevertheless, he was a close ally of Mr. Trump, and the president endorsed him in the days before the primary last summer.\u201cToday, Kansans voted for change,\u201d Ms. Kelly said as she declared victory in Topeka. \u201cChange not only in the direction of our state, but a change in the tone of our state.\u201dIn addition to Ms. Whitmer, another up-and-coming Democratic moderate, Gina Raimondo, held on to her governor\u2019s seat in Rhode Island, beating her Republican challenger, Allan Fung. Voters in New Mexico elected the state\u2019s first Democratic Latina governor, Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies. She defeated Representative Steve Pearce, a member of the Republican House Freedom Caucus. Democrats have not held the statehouse in New Mexico since 2010.Republicans kept seats in solidly red states including Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Arizona, Nebraska, South Carolina and Wyoming. Three moderate G.O.P. governors, Charlie Baker in Massachusetts, Larry Hogan in Maryland and Mr. Scott in Vermont, also kept their seats.Ms. Whitmer and Ms. Raimondo represent a class of younger \u2014 and energetic \u2014 Democratic leaders who, with this election, have emerged at a time when the party is debating not only what its ideology should be, but which lawmakers should lead it.Ms. Whitmer will replace Rick Snyder, a Republican who was elected governor of Michigan in 2010.A former venture-capital executive who won her first term for governor in 2014, Ms. Raimondo has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Rhode Island\u2019s lackluster economy. She has also faced lingering bitterness from some of the state\u2019s unions over her role in overhauling the pension system years ago when she was the treasurer.But on the national stage, she is well respected by high-ranking Democrats \u2014 she was among those reportedly considered as a possible running mate to Hillary Clinton \u2014 and serves as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, which focuses on electing state executives.Mr. Cordray\u2019s loss in Ohio deepened the Democratic Party\u2019s concerns that the once-purple state has become irreversibly red. The Democratic Party had bet that a focus on lunch-pail issues could appeal to liberals and minority voters, as well the white working-class voters who had overwhelmingly swung to Mr. Trump.But Mr. DeWine\u2019s victory \u2014 driven perhaps by the popularity of the departing Republican governor, John Kasich \u2014 and the appearance of Mr. Trump at a rally in Cleveland on Monday, suggests that the reddening seen in 2016 could be more a new standard than an anomaly.Mr. Cordray was gracious as he addressed subdued supporters at a hotel in downtown Columbus. He congratulated Mr. DeWine and expressed hope that the governor-elect would bring the state together after a campaign that had at times turned sour.\u201cMike has always been a dedicated public servant,\u201d Mr. Cordray said, \u201cand I hope he will be a governor who looks out for all Ohioans \u2014 as much for the Ohioans who voted for me as for the Ohioans who voted for him.\u201dIn Tennessee, where most of the political energy was focused on the state\u2019s Senate race, Bill Lee, a Republican, defeated Karl Dean, a Democratic former mayor of Nashville, in the race to succeed Gov. Bill Haslam. Mr. Haslam, a Republican who faced term limits and chose not to run for the Senate seat, was seen as a moderating force in the Tennessee capital.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the last year a Democrat was governor of New Mexico.

What Trump saidIf you know, China has come down tremendously. Tremendously. China would have superseded us in two years as an economic power; now, they\u2019re not even close.But even if China\u2019s growth rate hadn\u2019t slowed, the country was hardly about to eclipse the United States in two years. Last year, Chinese economic output totaled $12.2 trillion, according to the World Bank. The American economy\u2019s output totaled $19.4 trillion. Assuming the two economies kept growing at last year\u2019s rates, it would still take around a decade for China to surpass the United States.What Trump saidChina got rid of their \u201cChina \u201925\u201d because I found it very insulting. I said that to them. I said, \u201cChina \u201925\u201d is very insulting, because \u201cChina \u201925\u201d means, in 2025, they\u2019re going to take over, economically, the world. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not happening.\u201d\u201cChinese companies are trying to reach the technological frontier, and they\u2019re continuing to pursue these plans even if the government has stopped being vocal about Made in China 2025,\u201d said Dan Wang, a tech analyst for the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. \u201cFirms and the government have already invested billions into plants producing semiconductors, robotics, aviation equipment and other high-technology goods.\u201dAlso, even if the plan\u2019s goals are eventually met, it is debatable whether that would mean China will have taken over, economically, the world. The plan includes semiofficial targets for how much Chinese manufacturers sell by 2025 \u2026 in China.What Trump saidBut I have to say this: Billions of dollars will soon be pouring into our Treasury from taxes that China is paying for us. When the United States places tariffs on Chinese imports, China doesn\u2019t pay them. American importers do. And they might pass along the extra costs to American consumers. (Tariffs can still hurt Chinese companies, of course, if the higher cost means Americans stop buying their products.)Advertisement"}

They are French, Italian and British. They speak English, French and Italian. They drink tea, love cheese and can cook the best pasta dishes. They are Europeans \u2014 it is in their blood, it is in their genes.Personally, I expect that eventually the United Kingdom will split into England and into the countries that make up the United Kingdom\u2019s Celtic fringe: Cornwall, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

I voted remain, but like most Britons it was not out of any love for the European Union, which I see as a fundamentally flawed and undemocratic institution. Even so, I think leaving will mean a decade of tough times for my country as the European Union does its worst.I work for an airline that flies to and within Europe. I am very worried about my job: I estimate that we\u2019ll face more expensive fuel, a business downturn and possibly be prevented from flying on some of our routes within Europe. I am an American expat. For the past 30 years I\u2019ve been living in North Wales, in one of the few areas of the country that voted Remain; it is still in a state of disbelief. My husband is a hill farmer in the Snowdonia National Park: A huge part of our farming income comes from European Union environmental grants. So far, the present British government has done little to address this situation. I am definitely not looking forward to Brexit. We have been coerced into this whether we wanted it or not.

Hence the Democratic Unionist Party\u2019s ability to stalemate the government.The Brexit right blames all of this on a liberal establishment allied to Europe. It claims that European rules have held back business, weakened the pound and eroded national self-determination. By quitting the European Union, the Brexiteers hope to break that establishment and empower the Conservative Party\u2019s small-business base.The D.U.P. and the Brexit right don\u2019t have identical priorities. Brexiteers want a low-wage, low-tax economy to compete with the European Union. The D.U.P., with a more working-class base, often votes with Labour on issues like public spending. But they share the vocabulary of \u201cBritishness,\u201d and the D.U.P. would go along with \u201cfree market\u201d reforms as long as Northern Ireland received generous funding.

{"Headline": "In Connecticut, Race Between Lamont and Stefanowski Is Close as Wet Ballots Delay Count", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Democrats picked up at least six new governor seats across the country on Tuesday, Republicans remained optimistic about prevailing in a tight Connecticut race, hoping to capitalize on an unpopular incumbent governor and a sluggish economy.But, hours after polls closed, voters were left waiting for results: Wet ballots had delayed a final count.Secretary of State Denise W. Merrill said early Wednesday that voters dripped water onto their ballots after standing in the rain waiting to vote, and poll workers were unable to scan potentially thousands of soggy cards into the tally machines.Sounding as if she were only half-kidding, Ms. Merrill said she told registrars around the state to get out their hair dryers and try to rescan the ballots once they had dried a bit. But, she warned, election workers may have to count thousands of votes by hand.Gabe Rosenberg, a spokesman for Ms. Merrill, said the office was unsure when a final tally would be ready.As of early Wednesday, Bob Stefanowski, the Republican candidate and a former business executive, held a slight lead over Ned Lamont, the Democrat, with 73 percent of precincts reporting. But many of the state\u2019s urban centers, where Democrats expected a strong showing, had not fully reported, according to The Associated Press.Marc Bradley, Mr. Lamont\u2019s campaign manager, sent supporters home from the campaign\u2019s election night party, saying \u201cthings are going to have to wait a little bit longer\u201d before the race will be called. Kendall Marr, a spokesman for Mr. Stefanowski, said the campaign also sent supporters home and did not expect results for many hours.Mr. Lamont\u2019s campaign looked to portray Mr. Stefanowski as an acolyte of President Trump, who remains out of favor in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans five to three. The state voted for Democratic candidates in the last seven presidential elections, including in 2016, when Mr. Trump received 40.9 percent of the vote compared with Hillary Clinton\u2019s 54.6 percent.If Mr. Stefanowski wins, it will be particularly important for Republicans, who lost governor seats in Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico and Wisconsin. Connecticut would be the only state where Democrats lost a governor\u2019s seat.Connecticut\u2019s congressional delegation, however, will remain entirely blue.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a 45-year-old Democrat, easily won re-election to his second term by defeating Matthew Corey, a Republican Navy veteran.Mr. Murphy\u2019s decisive victory \u2014 the race was called immediately after polls closed at 8 p.m. \u2014 came after he spent much of the election cycle campaigning for other Democrats, including Mr. Lamont and Jahana Hayes, a first-time congressional candidate.In his victory speech, Mr. Murphy took direct aim at President Trump.\u201cWe are not a nation that tolerates bullies or wannabe tyrants,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cWe are a democracy, and maybe louder and clearer than anything we can say tonight, we\u2019re saying, here in Connecticut, that if you come after our democracy, then we are coming for you.\u201dIn the House, Democrats held onto all five of the state\u2019s seats, with four incumbents winning re-election.Ms. Hayes, 45, easily defeated her opponent, Manny Santos, a Republican and former mayor of Meriden. Elizabeth Esty, the incumbent Democratic representative, did not seek re-election after a sexual harassment case involving her former chief of staff.\u201cThe thing is while it may be atypical for a member of Congress, it\u2019s not really that strange for people in our communities,\u201d Ms. Hayes said in an interview after her victory. \u201cIf we are truly representing people, we have to have a true understanding of what people are experiencing and what they\u2019re going through.\u201dKevin Lembo, a Democrat, won a third term as the state comptroller, and Ms. Merrill, also a Democrat, was re-elected to a third term. Other statewide races, including for attorney general and treasurer, remained too close to call. Control of the State Legislature was also undecided.Kristin Hussey contributed reporting from Hartford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Needs Amazon as Much as Amazon Needs Us", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street has dominated New York\u2019s economy for too long. Amazon\u2019s HQ2 is a huge opportunity to diversify.Mr. Chakrabarti is an architect, author and professor at Columbia University.For decades, experts have called for the diversification of the New York City economy. In the wake of postwar deindustrialization, our reliance on Wall Street and the financial industry in general had by the 1990s left our city disproportionately vulnerable to swings in the financial markets. We have experienced significant downturns that today feel like distant memories but could certainly return. I know this from my own experience as director of planning for Manhattan after Sept. 11. In those heady dark days, few spoke about gentrification or the supposedly ominous specter of new companies entering New York City. To the contrary, many worried that no one would build so much as a Quonset hut in this city again. Darker still were the memories of my older colleagues in city government, who helped rescue us from the nose-dive of the late 1970s, when New York City lost hundreds of thousands of jobs and crime ravaged our most vulnerable neighborhoods.It is for these reasons that we should welcome Amazon, but with a few caveats: To become true New Yorkers, the people at Amazon must abide by our implicit social compact, which is that New York City strives to be a place of opportunity for all. Amazon, the city and the state must build an \u201cinfrastructure of opportunity\u201d that creates both physical and social mobility for all New Yorkers, and they must do so with fiscal responsibility. While opinions differ regarding the incentive package offered Amazon, a few things are clear: Amazon obtained incentives available to any forward-looking large company seeking to relocate here. Second, government officials involved are confident that the deal will yield between $12 billion and $27 billion of direct economic benefit, which is many multiples of the incentives offered; and third, the incentives are part of the city and state\u2019s established budget to lure companies here \u2014 not money that would otherwise go to subways and schools. Beyond these incentives, government investments should be focused on significant improvements to the physical mobility of western Queens, including a reimagined subway, streetcar, bus, bike, scooter and ferry network. The agreement does establish an Infrastructure Fund using targeted tax revenue, but the details, time frame and scope for the improvements are murky and should be clarified. Amazon must participate as well \u2014 let\u2019s press those logistics experts less about a helipad and more about how they hope to transport thousands of workers to one of the most congested parts of our city. First steps have been made, along with commitments to make Amazon\u2019s new waterfront home accessible to the public in accordance with the Long Island City waterfront design guidelines. More significant is the potential to create a new paradigm for social mobility. We lost this along with our manufacturing base and never regained it by relying on Wall Street. Unsung treasures like LaGuardia Community College, Queensbridge Houses and the public schools and cultural institutions of Queens shouldn\u2019t be thrown the crumbs of this project. Amazon is proposing to locate in the most ethnically diverse county in the United States and near the nation\u2019s largest public housing project \u2014 the company\u2019s work force and campus must reflect the diversity around them. The current agreement with Amazon, which calls for $15 million to fund work force development and three years of direct engagement with Queensbridge Houses, is a good first step. More should be done, including a longer-term goal of 50 percent of all employees drawn from the borough. This is an enormous opportunity for Amazon to differentiate itself from its competitors by proving that it can help bridge what has become a gaping American class divide. Amazon will continue to be criticized about the way it held this competition, even though New Yorkers have long advocated more business growth outside of Manhattan. (Queens has a population similar to Chicago\u2019s but nowhere near the economic output.) Amazon will be criticized for its impacts on small retailers, although it arguably hurts big-box stores far more than mom-and-pops, which sell through Amazon. It will be criticized for being one of the world\u2019s richest companies, by both the left and the right. This isn\u2019t about one company. It is about fulfilling our collective dream of New York as a city of opportunity for millions of strivers of all colors, genders and creeds. Our new socioeconomic ladder appears to be digital, and we should embrace it, if \u2014 and only if \u2014 its creators have the tenacity and temerity to embrace us.Vishaan Chakrabarti is an architect, author and professor at Columbia University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Winter-Coat Heavyweight Gives Trump\u2019s Trade War the Cold Shoulder", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "Columbia Sportswear has worked around tariffs for decades \u2014 and it says the president\u2019s new wave of levies will not bring jobs back to America.Supported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 Columbia Sportswear has spent years designing ski jackets and hiking boots to withstand the elements: wind, rain, snow and, increasingly, tariffs.Located on a sprawling campus adorned with hanging canoes, the 80-year-old retailer has long protected its outdoor gear from the whims of Washington by engaging in what the company calls \u201ctariff engineering\u201d \u2014 adjusting its products to lessen import taxes on materials from outside the United States like rubber soles, zippers and waterproof nylon.But now Columbia worries that its approach is under threat from a president whose trade strategy leaves little room for American companies that make and sell products globally.At Columbia, the response is to lean heavily on the company\u2019s long experience in navigating the thicket of trade restrictions it has faced in the United States and abroad. Every fleece vest and waterproof glove stamped with the Columbia logo is manufactured abroad, and the company has come to rely on a system of pairing its designers with its team of trade experts, who recommend work-arounds that can help an item of clothing circumvent tariffs.In a conference room filled with samples, Jeffrey W. Tooze, Columbia\u2019s vice president for global customs and trade, showed how a small change in design can mean big money for a given product.The addition of a super-thin sheath of fabric to the sole of a boot or shoe can help circumvent an existing 37.5 percent tariff on rubber soles imported into America. A fabric sole, by contrast, is taxed at 12.5 percent. (Customers find that the fabric wears off within days, revealing the rubber sole beneath.)A water-resistant jacket triggers a 7.1 percent tariff, while a jacket that has not been waterproofed gets hit with a 27.7 percent tariff. A jacket filled at least 10 percent, by weight, with down, brings about a tariff of only 4.4 percent.Those distinctions don\u2019t reflect national security or economic concerns \u2014 they are the result of long-past lobbying campaigns intended to protect or exempt certain manufacturers. Recognizing them, and designing around them, has become part of Columbia\u2019s corporate culture since Mr. Tooze joined the company in 2001. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the thought process, part of the creative thinking, part of the D.N.A.,\u201d he said.What Columbia is not doing, to any large degree, is bringing production jobs to the United States, as Mr. Trump would like.Tim Boyle, Columbia\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent interview that there was nothing the president could do to entice the company to make its products in the United States, where costs would be higher and apparel manufacturing expertise has withered through decades of outsourcing.\u201cThere is no way,\u201d Mr. Boyle said. \u201cZero. None.\u201dPeter J. Bragdon, Columbia\u2019s general counsel, agreed with that assessment. \u201cWe\u2019ve got huge tariffs on things already,\u201d he said, adding that they have yet to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States.Mr. Boyle said the firm emulated another Oregon retailer, Nike, adopting the approach that it should \u201cdesign, market merchandise from a central location \u2014 America, Portland, whatever \u2014 and make it where you should make it in the world and sell it everywhere in the world.\u201dToday, just under 40 percent of Columbia\u2019s business is outside the United States, and all of its products are made abroad. It sells heavily to Asia, Europe and Canada. It has a joint venture in China and is in the process of buying out its Chinese partner. Vietnam is its largest supplier. A quarter of its footwear comes from China.At every turn in the supply chain, it is faced with tariffs.So far, Columbia has gone mostly unscathed, in part because Mr. Trump\u2019s initial round of Chinese tariffs has largely avoided clothing. But the company has braced itself for the next wave, which would probably hit many of their imports, particularly Chinese-made footwear.Columbia is preparing itself for every contingency. Among the questions the company is contemplating: Can it move products out of its factories and into stores quickly enough to beat any new tariffs before they go into effect? Can it change how it manufactures its goods \u2014 by, say, ramping up production in Vietnam and slowing it down in China?\u201cWe\u2019ve had probably two meetings a day on that, every day, for the last two months,\u201d said Emily Vedaa, Columbia\u2019s global trade manager. \u201cHow can we soften the blow?\u201dMr. Trump has been unapologetic about his approach, arguing that any short-term economic pain will lead to long-term growth. He has also called out companies like Apple, telling them to move their production plants if they don\u2019t like his plan.But companies like Columbia say they cannot adjust the way they do business on the fly to deal with policy changes, particularly when they are not settled. For instance, Mr. Trump has dangled the threat of additional tariffs on China while also saying a compromise could be reached. He plans to meet with President Xi Jinping of China for a high-stakes meeting at the G-20 in Buenos Aires later this month. And while the new tariffs are predicated on trade law, they have come about through executive, not congressional, action and could easily be undone by an administration that looks more kindly on global trade.Thomas B. Cusick, Columbia\u2019s chief operating officer, said the company has received its entire fall shipment already, as well as the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of merchandise for the Christmas season. In addition, it has bought all its products for next spring and reserved factory capacity for its fall 2019 line. Any changes it makes in response to moves out of Washington would not go into effect until 2020 \u2014 and that would mean large investments that the company would make only if they were certain to pay off in the long run.Nearly every large American retailer is in a similar situation: 98 percent of the footwear bought by Americans is made overseas, and 97 percent of clothing sold in the United States is produced in other countries.Along with the factories, the manufacturing expertise has moved overseas.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to design a shirt like you\u2019re wearing,\u201d Mr. Boyle said. \u201cYou can sketch that out on a piece of paper. But to make it fit somebody, that\u2019s a technical expertise in tailoring that doesn\u2019t exist here anymore. You could come up with some stuff that nobody could wear.\u201dMr. Boyle conceded that if Mr. Trump does hit China with more tariffs \u2014 and Columbia is not immediately able to find a way around them \u2014 the company will have no choice but to charge more, despite its long expertise in navigating trade winds.\u201cThe prices will go up \u2014 we\u2019re going to pass those along,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no other option.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Years and Hundreds of Inflammatory Ads Later, the G.O.P. Is the Party of Trump", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe Republican Party\u2019s post-mortem after Mitt Romney lost his presidential bid to Barack Obama in 2012 was brutally straightforward: Expand the tent or risk extinction. \u201cWe need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian and gay Americans and demonstrate we care about them, too,\u201d party leaders wrote.Regardless of the results on Tuesday, that playbook is gone, burned and buried, and it is not going to be easy to retrieve it from the dump. The Republican Party is now the party of President Trump.The dark politics of anger, division and fear were on display in campaigns across the country this year, as Republican candidates for Congress and governor \u2014 and fringe groups who support them \u2014 embraced the racially inflammatory brand of politics that Mr. Trump unleashed in 2016. With the presidential campaign of 2020 effectively underway on Wednesday, there is little reason to think Mr. Trump will back away from a tactic that clearly rallies his base.And as he showed his party in the closing days of the midterms, there may be no way for Republicans to escape his shadow.\u201cHe\u2019s tapped into something really powerful and really ugly in the American electorate,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University, \u201cand it\u2019s going to be hard to put that back into the bottle.\u201dIn some respects, the strategy appeared to have worked. In Indiana, the Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun crushed the incumbent Democrat, Senator Joe Donnelly. Mr. Braun, a businessman and former state legislator, branded Mr. Donnelly \u201cMexico Joe\u201d and wrapped his arms around Mr. Trump, who rallied voters in Indiana on Monday by telling them, \u201cIf you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow.\u201dBut some Republicans apparently paid a price. In heavily Hispanic South Florida, Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Republican who distanced himself from Mr. Trump\u2019s stance on immigration, lost his House seat to the Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. And in Michigan, the Democrat Haley Stevens had a healthy lead in her House race against Lena Epstein, a Republican businesswoman and Trump ally.In Arkansas, a political action committee calling itself Black Americans for the President\u2019s Agenda released a radio ad using racist caricatures in an effort to court black voters. In Georgia, a white supremacist group paid for robocalls that described Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who was vying to become the nation\u2019s first black female governor, as a \u201cNegress\u201d and a \u201cpoor man\u2019s Aunt Jemima.\u201dRacially charged messaging is not new. Ian F. Haney L\u00f3pez, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who wrote the book \u201cDog Whistle Politics,\u201d says the 2018 campaign is the culmination of a more than \u201c50-year pattern,\u201d dating back to the presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater, a Republican. President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d courted white segregationists and effectively drove African-Americans to the Democratic Party.Other presidential candidates have since dabbled in racial politics: Ronald Reagan lauded states\u2019 rights in a 1980 speech in Neshoba County, Miss. In 1988, when George Bush was running for the White House against Michael Dukakis, Bush backers ran an ad spotlighting Willie Horton, a black convicted murderer who raped a white woman while furloughed from prison during Mr. Dukakis\u2019s time as governor.But, Mr. Zelizer noted, Mr. Reagan backed away from the speech and Mr. Bush distanced himself from the ad when each man faced criticism. By contrast, he said, \u201cwhat President Trump keeps doing is, each time there is criticism, he comes right back in more aggressive fashion.\u201dThat strategy has its limits. Last year in Virginia, Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who once urged his party to avoid the \u201csiren song\u201d of anti-immigrant rhetoric, lost his bid for governor after a campaign that adopted Mr. Trump\u2019s cultural and racially tinged messaging, including advertisements featuring tattooed Salvadoran prisoners meant to be members of the gang MS-13, a frequent target of the president.\u201cTheir current messaging does not address the aspirations of many immigrants and young voters, and that\u2019s the future,\u201d said Tom Davis, a retired congressman and former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cShould that continue, it\u2019s a demographic death wish.\u201dMr. Davis, though, argues that what is happening in 2018 is nothing more than the usual end-of-campaign-season hardball politicking. Jack Kingston, a former Republican congressman from Georgia, said Democrats engaged in their own brand of racially tinged politics. He pointed to a speech given by Oprah Winfrey at a town hall for Ms. Abrams in which Ms. Winfrey, harking back to the days when African-Americans did not have the right to vote, told a black crowd that failing to show up at the polls would be \u201cdishonoring your family.\u201d\u201cOprah had a very deliberate racial message,\u201d Mr. Kingston said.Mr. Kingston said if he had his druthers, Republicans would have centered their message on the economy, and not closed out the campaign with dire warnings about caravans of immigrants.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to use any racial language. We have the lowest unemployment rates in history for African-Americans and Hispanics,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also know that any time any of us second-guess President Trump on messaging, we lose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s America: Aggrieved and Adoring Voices From Inside the Presidential Bubble", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "At rallies, the president\u2019s most fervent supporters look past his falsehoods, racially charged statements and attacks on critics. For his party to win Tuesday, he needs them to turn out in droves.Supported byHUNTINGTON, W.Va. \u2014 In two years, President Trump has reshaped the idea of America for his supporters. They repeat his tweets. They parrot what he says in speeches. Their views on taxes, immigration and the news media are, word-for-word, his views on taxes, immigration and the news media \u2014 as endlessly repeated by Fox News.Outside the Trump bubble, the president is fact-checked, scorned, doubted or challenged. His words \u2014 and there are many of them most days \u2014 appear to have lost their ability to persuade moderates and independents. To his critics, Mr. Trump is a liar and a fraud who is cheapening the office he holds and threatening the fabric of the nation\u2019s democracy.But inside the bubble, it is different. Inside, supporters share Mr. Trump\u2019s view that men are the aggrieved gender. Inside, they vent their fury at Democrats and the news media using the president\u2019s incendiary language. Inside, they harbor Mr. Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories and echo his dark fear of immigrants.Like Mr. Trump, the president\u2019s most fervent supporters are not swayed by facts they consider inconvenient. Mr. Trump tells them the economy is the best the country has ever had, and they believe him, even if their communities are still struggling. The attacks on Mr. Trump only reinforce what they believe: He is on their side, no matter what.In dozens of interviews with Republican voters at 11 rallies across eight states, one thing is clear: The country is no longer divided into Red America and Blue America. It is cleaved cleanly between two realities \u2014 Trump\u2019s America and everyone else.At rallies in West Virginia, Florida and Montana \u2014 each far from the Mexican border \u2014 Trump\u2019s supporters almost universally cited the northward march of a Central American caravan as their top reason for voting. Like the president they came to see, most expressed anger at \u201cillegal aliens,\u201d unfounded suspicions about the Jewish billionaire they believe is funding the caravan and a fierce determination to support a military blockade to keep foreigners out of the United States. He says what we all feel, and he was able to take a stand for us, and we appreciate it. Immigration is the biggest one. Living in Florida, we\u2019re close enough to some of the borders. Off Interstate 10, it\u2019s easy for someone to make it into our area, and we just need them to not. Security absolutely is my top concern with it. I think we should close the border or make them earn their chance to come in. They need to go through the process the right way.Attended the rally in Pensacola, Fla.I don\u2019t think they ought to let them flood our country. To bring people like that in is fine if they come in legally, but when they come in illegally, holding foreign flags, waving them in the air. They don\u2019t want asylum. They are coming in, they are invading our country. Come in the right way. I don\u2019t know who was behind all this. But it\u2019s funny when you see these people in designer tennis shoes, you know, athletic shoes.Attended the rally in HuntingtonI can\u2019t really say that anything he says is true, but I trust him. And I absolutely 100 percent agree that we need stronger borders. Coming from a Mexican family myself, people can\u2019t just barge in. Even if they\u2019re seeking asylum, they need to do it the right way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe to have anyone come in that we know nothing about. It doesn\u2019t make us racist. We just want to protect our home.Attended the rally in Belgrade, Mont.I don\u2019t see it as a military threat or a physical threat to our country, but I think that it\u2019s more of a statement so that it doesn\u2019t continue. I think that he feels that if this caravan comes across, the next one will form behind it, and the next one behind it, so it\u2019s a form of saying, \u201cHey, we need to vet folks who come here.\u201d It\u2019s a deterrent \u2014 a show of force.Attended the rally in PensacolaMany of the president\u2019s recent rallies have been held in economically struggling communities, which have lagged behind the nation\u2019s recovery. But the Trump supporters see something else: a new hope that they attribute directly to the president. And they fear that Democratic victories on Tuesday would mean an end to the better life they say they are experiencing.We\u2019ve got to get rid of a lot of corruption that\u2019s within our government as it is. We cannot allow the liberal mind-set to take over. The economy, for one. It\u2019s better than it\u2019s been for years. If they come in, they want to raise the taxes and they want to increase the regulations like they had before. They want to cause our economy to hit the dumps.Attended the rally in HuntingtonAttended the rally in BelgradeI\u2019ve seen my business skyrocket over the last two years. I sell real estate to second- or third-time buyers, so it\u2019s a luxury purchase. People only purchase at the ranch if their businesses are doing well. So if we\u2019re doing well it\u2019s a good indicator.Attended the rally in BelgradeThings are changing in the construction industry. People are working. They reopened a coal mine that was shut down in the past month or so. I don\u2019t think the coal industry is ever going to be what it was. But this state thrives on coal. I just believe the president is actually not part of what went on for 75 years in the United States. I believe he has some fresh ideas and is good for America at this time.Attended the rally in HuntingtonEven before the president arrives at the rallies and points out the \u201cfake news\u201d in the back, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters are primed to erupt in angry boos. They believe that the news media is biased and unfair, and are eager to say so. And they lump the news media together with Democrats, using Mr. Trump\u2019s language to describe them: evil, socialists, dangerous.For years, Democrats were in office. How many Republican riots were done? How many Democrats were beat up? How many Democrats were run out of restaurants because they were Democrats? No. What\u2019s happening now? A Republican congressperson can\u2019t even go eat a dinner without people \u2014 I mean, if that\u2019s not just crazy. If that\u2019s not indoctrination. These people are doing it just because Nancy Pelosi or Maxine Waters said go do it. They\u2019re calling us the violent people. Their own people advocate violence and bullying. It\u2019s crazy. People can\u2019t even carry a Trump sign down the street that somebody doesn\u2019t rip it out of their hands and tear it up.Attended the rally in Columbia, Mo.I don\u2019t even look at fact checks. I think it lies, too. I mean, truthfully, the media has done nothing but lie. They are socialist and the mainstream media is out there to take him down just like the Democrats. I don\u2019t watch CNN. I don\u2019t watch any of it. I listened to him in Charleston, W.Va. He said if they do not keep control, he said \u2014 in the Senate and the House \u2014 he said we are going to be one big sanctuary city and we\u2019re going to be just like Venezuela, people eating out of garbage cans. I don\u2019t particularly want to eat out of a garbage can.Attended the rally in HuntingtonThe presidency is always something of a cult of personality. We build up our presidents (only to, sometimes, tear them down). But Mr. Trump has taken it further. To his supporters, he can do no wrong, regardless of his willingness to mangle the truth, make racially charged statements, ignore diplomatic traditions and viciously attack his adversaries.

{"Headline": "Pakistan Makes Concessions to Protesters in Blasphemy Case", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 After protesters blocked highways and forced the closing of schools and businesses, the Pakistani government and Islamist leaders enraged over the acquittal of a Christian woman accused of blasphemy reached an agreement on Friday night that allows further appeals and bars her from leaving the country.Despite her legal victory, which was hailed worldwide by rights groups, Ms. Bibi\u2019s lawyers and her family have expressed fears for her safety because hard-line Islamist parties in Pakistan have called for her execution.Under the accord, which some analysts viewed as a capitulation to extremists, the government agreed not to oppose the filing of an appeal in the Supreme Court of Ms. Bibi\u2019s acquittal. It also agreed to initiate legal proceedings to prevent her from traveling abroad.The government also said it would release all protesters who had been arrested since Wednesday. For their part, the protesting religious leaders offered an apology if their statements had offended anyone, an apparent reference to their criticism of the military leadership.The protesters, led by a firebrand cleric named Khadim Hussain Rizvi, had been demanding that Ms. Bibi be placed on the so-called exit-control list, a roster of people barred from leaving Pakistan.Ben-Her Gill, a leader of the Christian community in Islamabad, the capital, said Ms. Bibi was still in Pakistan, at a secret location under the protection of the authorities.Protesters took to the streets of several cities on Friday, demanding that the Supreme Court reverse its ruling and that the three justices on the panel that had issued it, including Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, be dismissed.Mobile networks were suspended in Islamabad and in three other major cities in Pakistan\u2019s largest province, Punjab, as the authorities tried to stop protesters from organizing and expanding the demonstrations.A highway connecting Islamabad to the city of Lahore was blocked, and rail networks across the country were severely slowed by the protests. Schools in Islamabad, Punjab and Kashmir were closed because of the demonstrations.The military said Friday that it had nothing to do with Ms. Bibi\u2019s release. \u201cThe armed forces hope that this matter is resolved without disruption of peace,\u201d Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the army\u2019s spokesman, was quoted by state-run media as saying.Ms. Bibi, a mother of five in her early 50s, has been a central figure in the debate over Pakistan\u2019s harsh blasphemy laws, which critics say are often used to persecute and intimidate members of religious minorities. Blasphemy is a highly combustible subject in Pakistan, with emotions flaring over mere rumors that Islam has been insulted. People accused of it are often killed by mobs even before the police can take action, rights groups say.Ms. Bibi was accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad after getting into an argument with Muslim farm workers in June 2009 in her native village in Punjab. She was dragged to a local police station and charged with blasphemy. In 2010 she was convicted and sentenced to death, the first woman ever sent to Pakistan\u2019s death row for blasphemy.\u201cThe stakes attached to Ms Bibi\u2019s case are extremely high,\u201d said Saroop Ijaz, a lawyer based in Lahore.\u201cThese groups have always extracted their pound of flesh,\u201d said Mr. Ijaz, who predicted that the government would be forced to give in to some of the protesters\u2019 demands. \u201cThey\u2019ve escalated to a point where it has become difficult for the government to avoid that fate. What that means for Asia Bibi, who has endured close to a decade of incarceration, remains uncertain.\u201dMeher Ahmad reported from Karachi, and Salman Masood from Islamabad, Pakistan.Advertisement"}

Of Course.", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Jack Ma, China\u2019s richest man and the guiding force behind its biggest e-commerce company, belongs to an elite club of power brokers, 89 million strong: the Chinese Communist Party.In fact, the disclosure reveals a party that is eager to prove its legitimacy by affiliating itself with capitalist success stories. Mr. Ma is a tech rock star in China, and his membership in the party could prod others to follow his lead.\u201cEven Jack Ma is a party member,\u201d said Kellee Tsai, dean of humanities and social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, referring to the party\u2019s pitch. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it make you want to join the party, too?\u201dAlibaba declined to comment on the matter. The Hurun Report, a research organization in Shanghai that tracks the wealthy in China, estimates Mr. Ma and his family\u2019s net worth at 270 billion renminbi, or $39 billion.The West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It\u2019s still waiting.Today\u2019s party isn\u2019t exactly exclusive. Its members represent nearly 7 percent of China\u2019s population. Its ranks include government officials, businesspeople and even dissidents. Being a member often suggests a desire to network and get ahead rather than express one\u2019s political views.It is unclear when Mr. Ma joined the party or how much he pays in dues. The party sets dues at 2 percent of monthly salary for higher-income members.Companies say they face much greater pressure to set up the cells than in the past. Even some of the coolest start-ups in tech-savvy Beijing have designated party-building spaces.The disclosure of Mr. Ma\u2019s membership reflects the thinking that the party controls the economy and society, said Guo Yuhua, a sociology professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing and a critic of the party.\u201cIt\u2019s going backward from the Deng Xiaoping era, when the party advocated the separation of the party and the government,\u201d she said, referring to the party leader who ultimately governed China during its early years of reform in the 1970s and \u201980s.The disclosure also drew attention because Mr. Ma had in the past tried to keep his distance from the government. When asked at public appearances how he managed government relations, he often said, \u201cFall in love with the government, but don\u2019t get married.\u201dBut as Mr. Xi tightens ideological controls and the power of the state grows, many successful entrepreneurs have made a point of showing their party loyalty.In recent weeks, amid signs of a slowing economy and an intensifying trade war with the United States, China\u2019s leaders have taken a softer tone toward private enterprise, making supportive remarks and promising tax cuts.Making it clear that Mr. Ma, the most successful businessman in China, is a member could strengthen the party\u2019s legitimacy.\u201cAbove all,\u201d said Ms. Tsai of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, \u201cthe party is quite open about the fact that it wants to survive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rocket Lab\u2019s Modest Launch Is Giant Leap for Small Rocket Business", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company\u2019s Electron rocket carried a batch of small commercial satellites from a launchpad in New Zealand, a harbinger of a major transformation to the space business.A small rocket from a little-known company lifted off Sunday from the east coast of New Zealand, carrying a clutch of tiny satellites. That modest event \u2014 the first commercial launch by a U.S.-New Zealand company known as Rocket Lab \u2014 could mark the beginning of a new era in the space business, where countless small rockets pop off from spaceports around the world. This miniaturization of rockets and spacecraft places outer space within reach of a broader swath of the economy.The rocket, called the Electron, is a mere sliver compared to the giant rockets that Elon Musk, of SpaceX, and Jeffrey P. Bezos, of Blue Origin, envisage using to send people into the solar system. It is just 56 feet tall and can carry only 500 pounds into space.But Rocket Lab is aiming for markets closer to home.\u201cWe\u2019re FedEx,\u201d said Peter Beck, the New Zealand-born founder and chief executive of Rocket Lab. \u201cWe\u2019re a little man that delivers a parcel to your door.\u201dBehind Rocket Lab, a host of start-up companies are also jockeying to provide transportation to space for a growing number of small satellites. The payloads include constellations of telecommunications satellites that would provide the world with ubiquitous internet access.The payload of this mission, which Rocket Lab whimsically named \u201cIt\u2019s Business Time,\u201d offered a glimpse of this future: two ship-tracking satellites for Spire Global; a small climate- and environment-monitoring satellite for GeoOptics; a small probe built by high school students in Irvine, Calif., and a demonstration version of a drag sail that would pull defunct satellites out of orbit.Space Angels, a space-business investment firm, is tracking 150 small launch companies. Chad Anderson, Space Angel\u2019s chief executive, said that although the vast majority of these companies will fail, a small group possess the financing and engineering wherewithal to get off the ground.Each company on Mr. Anderson\u2019s list proffers its own twist in business plan or capability: Vector Launch Inc. aims for mass production; Virgin Orbit, a piece of Richard Branson\u2019s business empire, will drop its rockets from the bottom of a 747 at 35,000 feet up; Relativity Space plans to 3-D print almost all pieces of its rockets; Firefly Aerospace will offer a slightly larger rocket in a bet that the small satellites will grow a bit in size and weight; Gilmour Space Technologies is a rare Australian aerospace company; And Astra Space Inc., which is operating in stealth mode like a Silicon Valley start-up, saying nothing about what is doing. Rockets are shrinking, because satellites are shrinking.In the past, hulking telecommunications satellites hovered 22,000 miles above the Equator in what is known as a geosynchronous orbit, where a satellite continuously remains over the same spot on Earth. Because sending a satellite, there was so expensive, it made sense to pack as much as possible into each one.Advances in technology and computer chips have enabled smaller satellites to perform the same tasks as their predecessors. And constellations of hundreds or thousands of small satellites, orbiting at lower altitudes that are easier to reach, can mimic the capabilities once possible only from a fixed geosynchronous position.\u201cIt\u2019s really a shift in the market,\u201d Mr. Beck said. \u201cWhat once took the size of a car is now the size of a microwave oven, and with exactly the same kind of capabilities.\u201dSome companies already have launched swarms of satellites to make observations of Earth. Next up are the promised space-based internet systems such as OneWeb and SpaceX\u2019s Starlink.Until now, such small spacecraft typically hitched a rocket ride alongside a larger satellite. That trip is cheaper but inconvenient, because the schedule is set by the main customer. If the big satellite is delayed, the smaller ones stay on the ground, too. \u201cYou just can\u2019t go to business like that,\u201d Mr. Beck said.A Falcon Heavy can lift a payload 300 times heavier than a Rocket Lab Electron, but it costs $90 million compared to the Electron\u2019s $5 million. Whereas SpaceX\u2019s standard Falcon 9 rocket has no shortage of customers, the Heavy has only announced a half-dozen customers for the years to come.The United States military \u2014 a primary customer for large launch vehicles \u2014 is also rethinking its spy satellites. The system would be more resilient, some analysts think, if its capabilities were spread among many, smaller satellites. Smaller satellites would be easier and quicker to replace, and an enemy would have a harder time destroying all of them.SpaceX could have cornered this market a decade ago.Jim Cantrell, one of the first employees of SpaceX, did not understand that decision and left the company. In 2015, he started Vector Launch, Inc., with headquarters in Tucson. Its goal is to make the Model T of rockets \u2014 small, cheap, mass-produced.Vector claims that it can send its rockets into orbit from almost any place it can set up its mobile launch platform, which is basically a heavily modified trailer. That trailer was inspired by Mr. Cantrell\u2019s hobby, auto racing, and many of the companies\u2019 employees come from the racing world, too.The company is still aiming to meet its goal of getting the first of its Vector-R rockets to orbit this year, but Mr. Cantrell admitted that the schedule might slip again, into early 2019. The flight termination system \u2014 the piece of hardware that disables the rocket if anything goes wrong \u2014 is late in arriving.\u201cThere are a lot of little things,\u201d Mr. Cantrell said. \u201cIt drives you crazy.\u201dA prototype was planned for suborbital launch from Mojave, Calif., in September, but it encountered a glitch and the test was called off. The crew put the rocket in a racecar trailer and drove it to Vector\u2019s testing site at Pinal Airpark, a small airport a half-hour outside of Tucson that is surrounded 350 acres of shrubby desert.Vector built test stands for firings of individual engines as well as completed rocket stages. During a recent visit to the site, engineers were troubleshooting the launch problems of both the prototype rocket and a developmental version of its upper-stage engine.Soon the team will head to the Pacific Spaceport Complex, on Alaska\u2019s Kodiak Island, for its first orbital launch. Next year, Mr. Cantrell said, the company hopes to put a dozen rockets into space.Tom Markusic, another veteran of SpaceX\u2019s early days, also sees an opportunity to help smaller satellites get to space.\u201cI didn\u2019t feel there was a properly sized launch company to address that market,\u201d he said.Mr. Markusic said that the need for stronger antennas and cameras would ultimately prompt the construction of slightly bigger small satellites, and that it would be beneficial to be able to launch several at a time.He started Firefly in 2014, aiming to build Alpha, a rocket that would lift a 900-pound payload to orbit.The company grew to 150 employees and won a NASA contract. But in the uncertainty surrounding Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, a European investor backed out. An American investor also became skittish, Mr. Markusic said, after a SpaceX rocket exploded on the launchpad in 2016. Firefly shut down, and the employees lost their jobs.At an auction, a Ukraine-born entrepreneur, Max Polyakov, one of Firefly\u2019s investors, resurrected the company. Mr. Markusic took the opportunity to rethink the Alpha rocket, which is now able to launch more than 2,000 pounds.\u201cAlpha is basically Falcon 1 with some better technology,\u201d he said.Mr. Markusic said his competition was not the smaller rockets of Rocket Lab, Vector or Virgin Orbit but foreign competitors such as a government-subsidized rocket from India and commercial endeavors in China. But he complimented Rocket Lab.\u201cThey\u2019re ahead of everyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they deserve a lot of credit.\u201dFirefly plans to launch its first Alpha rocket in December of 2019.Not everyone is convinced that the market for small satellites will be as robust as predicted.\u201cThat equation has weaknesses at every step,\u201d said Carissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm.Three-quarters of venture capital-financed companies fail, she said, and the same will likely happen to the companies aiming to put up the small satellites. She also is skeptical that space-based internet will win against ground-based alternatives.\u201cPublicly, there\u2019s no compelling business plans,\u201d she said.That means that the market for small rockets could implode for lack of business. She said a key to survival would be to tap into the needs of the United States government, especially the military. Virgin Orbit, Vector and Rocket Lab were the current front-runners, she said.The small rocket companies also have to compete with Spaceflight Industries, a Seattle company that resells empty space on larger rockets that is not taken up by the main payload. In addition, Spaceflight is looking to purchasing entire rockets launched by other companies, including Rocket Lab, and selling the payload space to a range of companies heading to a similar orbit.The first such flight, using a SpaceX Falcon 9, is to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base this month carrying 70 satellites, in what the company compares to a bus ride into orbit.Curt Blake, president of Spaceflight, said that both approaches can work. Buses are cheaper but less convenient, and sometimes the timely lift from a taxi is worth the added cost.Mr. Anderson of Space Angels was also optimistic. \u201cThe difference today is how robust the sector is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sector today can handle failures.\u201dWhile the sector is getting off the ground, Rocket Lab doesn\u2019t intend to waste any more time: it is hoping to quickly follow \u201cIt\u2019s Business Time\u201d with a second commercial launch next month, and then a third the month after that.\u201cWe\u2019re very focused on the next 100 rockets, not the next one rocket.\u201d Mr. Beck said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to go to orbit. It\u2019s a whole another thing to go to orbit on a regular basis.\u201d_____Michael Roston contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Theresa May a Secret Genius? ", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Opinion WriterHer allies maintain that while Mrs. May has made some grievous tactical errors, she has been less na\u00efve and incompetent than she appears. Rather than being the helpless victim of her party\u2019s divides, she has been engaged in a stealthy operation to avoid confrontation with her rebellious right-wing colleagues in public, while outflanking them in private. Like Muhammad Ali in a comeback fight, she has chosen to absorb punches until the very last moment she can deliver her own.Is Mrs. May really more of a Machiavellian fighter than a punching bag? Well, possibly. But even if these generous interpretations of the prime minister\u2019s actions over the past two years are accurate, her strategy will still turn out to have been a dangerous mistake once Brexit finally arrives. Only brave leadership \u2014 not back-room games \u2014 can save Britain.One senior politician described Mrs. May\u2019s embarrassing predicament: \u201cIt looks like dithering, it\u2019s not heroic, and you can\u2019t boast about it until it\u2019s done, but it\u2019s practical,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s been hellish,\u201d another said. The divisions over Brexit left her \u201cin an impossible position\u201d from the beginning, this politician said, caught between enemies in her own party and a complex exercise in international diplomacy.Mrs. May is famously uncommunicative, secretive, averse to being challenged and cool toward her colleagues. Her sense of being besieged has encouraged those tendencies. \u201cHer natural secrecy has been reinforced by political practicality,\u201d said a person who advises the prime minister. She has a core group of six to eight people acting as advisers, and even some of those are unsure of her strategy because she keeps so much to herself. \u201cLike talking to a brick wall; you get nothing back,\u201d a senior Conservative said.This degree of isolation leaves Mrs. May cut off from the insights that she needs for Britain to avoid calamity. Furious and frustrated politicians, experts, diplomats and business leaders have been blocked, sidelined or ignored when they have tried to brief the prime minister on the catastrophic complexities of Brexit. Even those she listens to rarely hear what she thinks. They often deduce it from how she acts afterward.By being so silent, Mrs. May has not made the case for the Brexit deal she wants. Even if she gets Brussels to agree to it, it will fail unless she can get the cabinet and members of Parliament to back it \u2014 not by secrecy and shrewd bluffs, but by full-throated advocacy and persuasion.And that is the fatal flaw in Mrs. May\u2019s punching-bag strategy. She needs support she has not bothered to build. Ever since taking power in 2016, she should have been telling Britain the truth: The Brexit you hoped for is undeliverable because it promised a fantasy. The Brexiteers lied to you. We cannot have all the benefits of the European Union and none of the costs. We must compromise or face disaster.Even some of Mrs. May\u2019s close supporters say privately that her deal cannot survive. If it reaches the House of Commons, which must approve any Brexit agreement, many Conservative Euroskeptics will rebel, and not enough of the opposition will step in to save her. There will be uproar, chaos, talk of a second referendum and fears of \u201cno deal.\u201dThis situation was never inevitable. It is the product of an overcautious leader\u2019s fundamental misjudgment of her party\u2019s politics. Mrs. May has always been stronger than she thought; she had defeated the Brexiteers to become prime minister, and none, despite all their sniping and plotting, has had the backing to replace her since. A more courageous leader would have argued publicly for the least disruptive Brexit from the start, persuading a divided country to follow her, avoiding the immense damage we have already inflicted on our businesses, our international reputation and our relationship with our alienated, exhausted European Union partners.Mrs. May has been inadequate, but she was the best her party could agree on. \u201cWould anyone else step up?\u201d an insider asked. \u201cEveryone wants her job after March,\u201d when Britain is set to leave the European Union. \u201cNo one else wants it now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Red-State Voters Stand by Republicans Despite Trump\u2019s Trade War Pain", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Voters in red states largely shrugged off concerns about the economic effect of President Trump\u2019s global trade war, throwing their support behind Republican candidates who embraced the administration\u2019s protectionist agenda despite attempts by Democrats to turn it into a wedge issue.In a series of high-stakes Senate races in states exposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s tit-for-tat tariffs, voters ousted three incumbent Democrats on Tuesday who tried, in varying degrees, to tie their Republican opponents to the president\u2019s tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese goods. Those tariffs have provoked retaliatory levies on agricultural and industrial products in Republican strongholds.All of them lost, and badly.Mr. Cramer, who mildly criticized the tariffs but praised Mr. Trump\u2019s overall approach, beat Ms. Heitkamp by nearly 11 points. Josh Hawley, who unseated Ms. McCaskill, and Mike Braun, who trounced Mr. Donnelly by nearly 10 points, did not back away from their support for the tariffs.\u201cSenator McCaskill thought she could drive a wedge between Josh and the ag community. It didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Kyle Plotkin, Mr. Hawley\u2019s campaign manager, referring to the agricultural community.In many ways, the races were a test of whether Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy of emphasizing short-term pain for long-term gain would resonate with parts of the country battered by, or hostile to, globalization.\u201cPeople are willing to deal with some short-term pain to serve a long-term goal,\u201d said Eric Branstad, a former administration official in the Commerce Department who ran Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in the state two years ago.\u201cThe fact that Trump concluded a deal with Canada and Mexico gave people a sense that things were moving in the right direction,\u201d Mr. Branstad said. \u201cThere\u2019s also the trust factor for him here.\u201dRepublicans lost two House seats in Iowa, which has also been hit by retaliatory tariffs on soybeans, pigs and other agricultural products. But those losses had less to do with trade than with suburban gains by Democrats in more affluent and educated areas adjacent to midsize cities like Des Moines and Davenport.Nationally, less than a third of all voters said that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies had hurt them.It is impossible to quantify the influence of the president\u2019s trade policies, especially in industrial states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, in which support for Democrats surged significantly. But Democratic consultants in those states said the tariffs contributed to a general anti-Trump sentiment, but were not a central issue in the midterm elections.An analysis by The New York Times of election results and economic data showed that Mr. Trump\u2019s party continued to perform strongly in agriculture-rich House districts \u2014 which helped create a rural firewall that largely limited the party\u2019s losses to suburban areas. Republicans held onto 17 of the 25 districts that are the most dependent on agricultural jobs. Democrats retained the four they held, with two seats held by Republicans yet to be decided.Mr. Trump\u2019s overall popularity in rural America seems to be growing \u2014 and it seems to have been stoked by the tactic, employed by China and other trading partners, of targeting retaliatory tariffs at Trump-friendly districts.\u201cI think our pain definitely has a purpose,\u201d said Doug Schroeder, a corn and soybean farmer from Mahomet, Ill., a district that voted Republican on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think the balance of trade with China has been fair for a long time. Someone needed to stand up and do something.\u201dIn Washington State\u2019s Fourth Congressional District, which includes much of the state\u2019s wine-producing region, Representative Dan Newhouse, the Republican incumbent, defeated his challenger by 28 points on Tuesday. Two years ago, in a far more Republican-friendly environment over all, Mr. Newhouse won by just 16 points.The expansion of the Republican majority in the Senate, and the failure of the tariffs to ignite a political brush fire, is likely to embolden Mr. Trump as he contemplates additional tariffs on all Chinese imports before he meets with President Xi Jinping of China this month in Buenos Aires.Mr. Trump, speaking on Wednesday at a White House news conference, signaled he would continue his pugilistic approach to trade. Mr. Trump heralded the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, which still needs to be approved by Congress and expressed hope that Democrats, who now control the House, will help shepherd it through. He boasted that tariffs on China were filling the coffers at the Treasury Department.And he reiterated his threat to impose tariffs on automobiles from countries that do not agree to trade deals that benefit the United States, suggesting that tariffs on Japanese cars could soon be in store.\u201cSay hello to Shinzo,\u201d Mr. Trump told a Japanese reporter, referring to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s happy about tariffs on his cars.\u201dStill, the trade issue, so central to Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and appeal to voters in the Midwest, was little more than background noise in states like Indiana and Missouri, overshadowed by the fierce and polarizing debates over health care, immigration and Mr. Trump himself.And even in North Dakota, where farmers are reporting a sharp decrease in Chinese demand for soybeans, the political consequence was barely detectable.Mr. Trump, who authorized a $12 billion bailout in July for farmers hit by China\u2019s tariffs, made a point of playing down his own responsibility for the pain felt by local businesses and farms, repeatedly placing the blame on Beijing.\u201cThe thought that American voters pick a candidate based on how they position themselves on the issues,\u201d he added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t realize that a person\u2019s partisan affiliation determines their positions, even when the policy directly impacts them, not vice versa.\u201dResistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies from Republican lawmakers and business leaders is unlikely to abate even if his voters are willing to weather them.Speaking at a forum on Wednesday in Singapore, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, warned about the prospects of an \u201ceconomic iron curtain\u201d and said that he feared that large parts of the global economy would be closed off to free trade and investment.\u201cNobody wins a trade war,\u201d said Mr. Paulson, who remains close with Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary.Joshua Bolten, the chief executive of the Business Roundtable, said on Wednesday that he was still hopeful that Mr. Trump would pursue a more \u201ccooperative\u201d trade agenda in the second half of his term.\u201cWhat the business community will be looking for over the next two years of the Trump Administration is a lessening of the conflict with our good friends, allies and trading partners,\u201d Mr. Bolten said.Binyamin Appelbaum and Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M., Not Trump, Is the Real Villain to Some Ohio Factory Workers", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLORDSTOWN, Ohio \u2014 After an election campaign in which he had pledged a manufacturing renaissance, President Trump came to this once-thriving industrial region of northeastern Ohio last year and all but waved a mission-accomplished flag.\u201cSome people were crying,\u201d said Joyce Olesky, a 23-year employee of the plant. \u201cI looked over and saw people who looked like they had the flu, turning white.\u201dMany Lordstown residents recalled that Mr. Trump had promoted steel tariffs and his trade savvy as a way to create jobs. But while critics faulted the president for failing to deliver what he promised, a number of workers were quick to exonerate him.Some portrayed him as well intentioned but simply outgunned by larger economic forces. Others suggested that whatever Mr. Trump\u2019s flaws, they paled in comparison to those of General Motors, which they considered the real culprit.\u201cI believe that if there\u2019s tariffs or not, G.M. will continue to take our cars out of this country because it\u2019s cheaper to do it and ship it back,\u201d said Ms. Olesky, a Trump supporter.Beyond the roughly 1,600 jobs that are likely to be lost at the plant, there are a few dozen suppliers employing thousands of workers in the region, along with businesses here in the Mahoning Valley that will be hit hard by the loss of customers.Timothy Francisco, director of the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State University, cited a colleague\u2019s estimate that three additional jobs were lost for every one cut at the plant.On Monday morning, Earl Ross, the owner of Ross\u2019 Eatery & Pub, a social hub in Lordstown, was in a tree stand poised to hunt deer when he received a text message about the news. \u201cMy reaction was a sick stomach,\u201d Mr. Ross said, \u201cand for the whole rest of the day, I just sat in the rain and thought about the future.\u201dThere is also the likely effect on the housing market, as workers try to offload mortgages amid the prospect of unemployment.Jason Sickler, who has worked at the plant since 2000, said he would prepare his house for a possible sale as he contemplated whether to request a transfer to a General Motors operation in another city.\u201cI was literally nauseous yesterday when I walked out of there,\u201d said Mr. Sickler, who enjoys his job in the trim department and is loath to relocate with a son still in high school. \u201cToday I\u2019m trying to get a better game plan, accept it a little more.\u201dIn some ways the story of Lordstown in recent decades sounds a lot like the story of industrial America writ large. The number of workers at the G.M. plant peaked around 13,000 in the mid-1980s, according to the union there. It had dropped below 5,000 by this decade, as foreign competition and automation took their toll.But in other respects G.M.\u2019s presence allowed the village of about 3,200 to defy the economic realities bearing down on the region.Factory workers have helped generate millions of dollars in village income-tax revenue over the years to pay for infrastructure and other expenses. \u201cWe\u2019ve been blessed with the ability to have money to do that,\u201d said Arno Hill, who has served as mayor in two stints totaling nearly 20 years since the early 1990s.Even during the recession and financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, which pushed G.M. into bankruptcy, the plant and the town were only briefly affected. And in 2010, when G.M. began to produce a new fuel-efficient sedan, the Chevrolet Cruze, in Lordstown, workers at the plant were overjoyed.\u201cOh, my God, we were so excited,\u201d said Marisol Gonzalez-Bowers, who has spent more than two decades at the plant. \u201cWe had three shifts, were running at full capacity. Twelve hours if you wanted it.\u201d Ms. Gonzalez-Bowers said that with overtime, she could easily take home $75,000 a year during the early half of this decade.Even with Lordstown\u2019s relative durability, Mr. Trump\u2019s vision of an industrial comeback resonated in town. Mr. Trump carried the county by about 6 percentage points, a nearly 30-point swing toward Republicans since President Barack Obama won it decisively in 2012.But the day after the election, General Motors announced that it would eliminate a third shift at the Lordstown plant. After years of strong sales, the Cruze was flagging as consumers defected to trucks and sport-utility vehicles.Then, in April of this year, as the slump continued, the company said it was eliminating a second shift. The workers\u2019 last day coincided with news reports that the company would be building a popular S.U.V. in Mexico.\u201cIt was terrible \u2014 they announced that as people were walking out to their cars,\u201d said Dave Green, the president of the United Automobile Workers local in the area. \u201cThey turn on the radio, and they hear that G.M. is going to build the Blazer in Mexico.\u201dCritics said Mr. Trump seemed oblivious to the plant\u2019s struggles despite his promise to workers there. \u201cI had a conversation with him and he did not know about the first two shift layoffs,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, who spoke with Mr. Trump by phone over the summer. \u201cIt shocked me.\u201dMr. Brown said that he had asked Mr. Trump to intervene personally with G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, and that the president had been noncommittal. \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019ll see,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brown recalled. The White House declined to comment.Tommy Wolikow was laid off from the plant last year and said he became a Trump fan after attending the president\u2019s speech hailing the return of manufacturing jobs. \u201cI felt he was speaking to me, and I believed him,\u201d said Mr. Wolikow, who didn\u2019t vote in 2016 but had planned to vote for Mr. Trump in 2020. \u201cI took the man for his word.\u201dBut in recent months, Mr. Wolikow has concluded that the president wasn\u2019t interested in following through.Mr. Wolikow, who now volunteers for the progressive group Good Jobs Nation, said that he and his fianc\u00e9e, Rochelle Carlisle, together brought home around $100,000 a year when both worked at the plant in 2016, but that they now lived on her earnings as a waitress at Cracker Barrel. It brings in about $250 to $300 a week \u2014 not enough to cover their mortgage and car payments, to say nothing of expenses for their three daughters.Other workers continue to support the president, however. \u201cWhat he had planned, it should have worked,\u201d said T.J. Lambert, a former G.M. worker in Lordstown who left the plant in late 2016. Of the corporate tax cut passed under Mr. Trump, he said: \u201cThe plan was to bring those jobs back, a one-time tax cut. He can\u2019t have control over what a corporation does 100 percent.\u201dMs. Olesky and Mr. Sickler, the current G.M. workers, have voted reliably Republican in recent years, but they are proud union members who say the labor movement is often the only protection the middle class has against corporate greed. \u201cWithout a union, people would be making $11 per hour,\u201d Ms. Olesky said. \u201cManagement gets as much as they can, and unions try to protect us.\u201dMr. Sickler noted in disbelief that the company would be laying off eight of his colleagues at the end of this week, even though it would cost little to allow them to stay on until the plant goes idle in March. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to run on a skeleton crew to save money,\u201d he said.Kimberly Carpenter, a General Motors spokeswoman, said the layoffs were \u201cjust regular people movement due to people returning from leave.\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018I heard you\u2019re closing your plant,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal, relating their conversation. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s not going to be closed for long, I hope, Mary, because if it is, you have a problem.\u2019\u201dMayor Hill, a tall, barrel-chested man who worked for decades for a local automotive supplier, said he thought the odds were fair that the president would eventually save the plant, though he conceded it could take several months.\u201cPeople say, \u2018Trump promised us,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cYes, he came here, told the people in the valley, \u2018Don\u2019t sell your house, we\u2019re going to bring your jobs back.\u2019 Well, you know, they made the announcement yesterday.

{"Headline": "How Loneliness Is Tearing America Apart", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen people have a hole in their life, they often fill it with angry politics.Mr. Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute.America is suffering an epidemic of loneliness.In the \u201csiloed,\u201d or isolated, worlds of cable television, ideological punditry, campus politics and social media, people find a sense of community in the polarized tribes forming on the left and the right in America. Essentially, people locate their sense of \u201cus\u201d through the contempt peddled about \u201cthem\u201d on the other side of the political spectrum.There is profit to be made here. The \u201coutrage industrial complex\u201d is what I call the industries that accumulate wealth and power by providing this simulacrum of community that people crave \u2014 but cannot seem to find in real life.Why are we becoming so lonely? One reason is the changing nature of work. Work is one of the key sources of friendship and community. Think of your own relationships; surely many of your closest friendships \u2014 perhaps even your relationship with your spouse \u2014 started in the workplace. Yet the reality of the workplace is rapidly attenuating, as people hop from job to job, and from city to city, as steady work becomes harder to find and the \u201cgig\u201d economy grows.Mr. Sasse worries even more, however, about a pervasive feeling of homelessness: Too many Americans don\u2019t have a place they think of as home \u2014 a \u201cthick\u201d community in which people know and look out for one another and invest in relationships that are not transient. To adopt a phrase coined in Sports Illustrated, one might say we increasingly lack that \u201chometown gym on a Friday night feeling.\u201dMr. Sasse finds this phrase irresistible and warmly relates it to his own life growing up in Fremont, Neb., a town of 26,000 residents. He describes the high school sports events on Friday nights that drew the townspeople together in a common love for their neighbors and community that made most differences \u2014 especially political differences \u2014 seem trivial. He relates with deep fondness the feelings he experienced, after moving away for a couple of decades for school and work, when he returned to Fremont\u2019s small-town life with his family, and the deep sense of belonging it created.That can be a tricky proposition for many of us. On reading the book, I asked myself where I might get that hometown-gym feeling, where I have natural roots, where I can imagine being buried. No specific place came to mind. I have no Fremont \u2014 not even Seattle, my hometown, which is a perfectly nice place, but one I unsentimentally left behind 35 years ago.All this is particularly germane to my wife and me at the moment, as we prepare to move from Maryland to Massachusetts in the coming months. We fear the loneliness we are sure to feel as we enter a completely new place where neither of us grew up or has ever lived. Is a thick community and the happiness it brings out of reach for rootless cosmopolitans like us?And there lies the challenge to each of us in a country suffering from loneliness and ripped apart by political opportunists seeking to capitalize on that isolation. Each of us can be happier, and America will start to heal, when we become the kind neighbors and generous friends we wish we had.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Nafta Plan Could Be Upended by Democrats\u2019 House Takeover", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s promise to quickly pass a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement has been upended by the midterm elections, with Democrats who will soon control the House vowing to withhold their support to extract greater protections for American workers.Administration officials remain confident they will corral the votes for the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump speedily negotiated in September to claim a big win on one of his signature issues before the November elections.While White House officials considered pushing the revised deal through the coming lame-duck session, they did not want to risk a backlash from lawmakers in both parties.\u201cTrump made it seem like this was a done deal, but there is a long, long way to go,\u201d said Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat who is likely to be named chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.The House will consider the agreement first under the Constitution\u2019s provision mandating that revenue bills originate in the lower chamber. A vote could take up to nine months or longer, according to senior administration officials.House Democrats are particularly concerned about a provision that would require at least 30 percent of the labor used to build each car in Mexico to be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour. That amount will rise to 40 percent by 2023 but the $16 wage is not indexed to inflation, meaning the increase will be diluted over time as prices rise.The text of the agreement also requires Mexico to make it easier for workers to join unions.All of these actions were intended to make it less likely that automakers and other manufacturers would shift American jobs south for cheaper labor. But Democrats and their allies in manufacturing unions \u2014 who have remained neutral on the proposed pact \u2014 maintain that the new requirements, while an improvement on the original Nafta, do not go far enough.They are demanding more specifics about how the deal will be enforced, and raising questions about whether the $16-an-hour benchmark for Mexican workers \u2014 which is about four times the typical wage for Mexican autoworkers \u2014 is high enough to stanch the flow of American jobs to Mexico.\u201cWithout enforcement you don\u2019t have anything. Without it, you are, shall we say, just rebranding Nafta,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said last week, days before voters swept her party back into power.\u201cRight now, it is a work in progress,\u201d said Mrs. Pelosi, a former speaker who is expected to reclaim that post. \u201cMexico has to pass a law about labor rights in Mexico, so that has not happened yet and that is a predicate of this agreement. Most important of all are the enforcement provisions in terms of labor and the environment. Enforcement, enforcement, enforcement.\u201dThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, have both said publicly that they will not take up the agreement this year, although several free-trade proponents in their own party, led by Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, are urging them to reconsider.Mr. Toomey has his own reservations about the deal \u2014 he believes it includes too many potential restrictions on free trade \u2014 but he warned his fellow Republicans that entering a protracted negotiation with Democrats would be a losing strategy.\u201cI would be shocked \u2014 shocked \u2014 to learn that Nancy Pelosi is going to make passing new Nafta, which would be a big win for the president, her top priority,\u201d he said.Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, has repeatedly assured Mr. Trump that he will be able to sell the deal to Democrats and the leaders of the United Steelworkers Union, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Autoworkers Union, according to current and former White House officials.\u201cWe are very confident that Congress will approve U.S.M.C.A.,\u201d said Jeff Emerson, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\u201cFrom the beginning, Ambassador Lighthizer has worked closely with Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate on the renegotiation of this agreement,\u201d he said, adding that the pact \u201cis a balanced deal with strong provisions that will benefit U.S. businesses and workers and that enjoys broad support among key stakeholders.\u201dBut there are signs that Mr. Lighthizer, who has a close working relationship with many labor leaders and pro-union Democrats like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, may have a tougher time than he anticipated.\u201cWords on a paper won\u2019t stop jobs from going to Mexico, unless there\u2019s real teeth behind them,\u201d Mr. Brown said.In the letter, Mr. Gerard took issue with the administration\u2019s decision to maintain steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and questioned the effectiveness of the agreement\u2019s proposed automotive rules of origin intended to increase the percentage of cars built by American workers.But he saved his sharpest criticism for the Mexican wage provisions, arguing that the $16 hour average wage mandated in the deal \u201cis arguably too low to make a significant difference\u201d in persuading manufacturers to keep their plants in the United States. He suggested making the wage standard a minimum, rather than an average, and suggested indexing it to inflation to ensure that the wage increases aren\u2019t \u201cmeaningless.\u201dAndr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a populist who was elected president of Mexico in July, supports wage increases but it is unclear if he can pass sweeping labor reforms through the country\u2019s legislature.During a private meeting with House members of both parties last month, Mr. Lighthizer conceded that the labor provisions needed to be strengthened, but he declined to reopen talks with Mexico, according to three people who attended the meeting.The Nafta vote will be up or down, and Congress cannot amend the text, according to the rules governing fast-track trade agreements. But negotiators from each country are free to negotiate potential changes to secure enough votes for passage in their respective chambers.Mexican officials have said the labor standards in the deal are sufficient. Mr. Emerson said Mr. Lighthizer rejected as \u201cfalse\u201d the idea that he would consider reopening the deal. The labor standards included in the deal, he added, \u201care ambitious and enforceable,\u201d he said.But Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who attended the meeting last month, called the provision \u201ca major flaw\u201d and said \u201cthere will have to be some attempt to discuss this with Mexico\u201d in order for the deal to win Democratic backing.Mr. Lighthizer remains eager to conclude a deal as quickly as possible, people close to him said, so he can focus on China, whose trade practices he sees as a far bigger threat to American workers than Nafta, which has helped stitch together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States.But there\u2019s one tactic he refuses to use to break the logjam: withdrawing from Nafta as a means of pressuring legislators to act quickly.Mr. Trump has raised the possibility repeatedly since being elected, but has been talked out of it by Mr. Lighthizer and other advisers, most recently the National Economic Council director, Larry Kudlow, according to a senior administration official with knowledge of the situation.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi and Pence Stake Out Trade Positions in Dueling Speeches at Pacific Rim Forum", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 President Xi Jinping of China and Vice President Mike Pence pushed back against criticism of each of their countries\u2019 trade practices in speeches on Saturday at an Asia-Pacific trade summit meeting in Papua New Guinea, while seeking to assure allies of their commitment to the region.Mr. Xi and Mr. Pence spoke ahead of what is likely to be a tense meeting between President Trump and the Chinese leader at the Group of 20 conference in Argentina later this month, where they will attempt to defuse a trade war.Mr. Xi may also be looking to shore up ties with an important trading partner, North Korea. He told President Moon Jae-in of South Korea on the sidelines of the trade forum that he was considering visiting the North after its leader, Kim Jong-un, extended an invitation, according to a spokesman for Mr. Moon.The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trade practices, including restricting market access, pushing American companies to hand over valuable technology and engaging in cyberespionage and intellectual property theft. It has put tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods; China has retaliated with tariffs of its own.Mr. Pence, echoing warnings from Mr. Trump, said the United States could \u201cmore than double\u201d the tariffs it had placed on $250 billion in Chinese goods.\u201cThe United States, though, will not change course until China changes its ways,\u201d Mr. Pence said.He urged Asian nations to avoid investment offers from China and to choose instead a \u201cbetter option\u201d \u2014 working with the United States \u2014 which, he said, would not saddle them with debt, a quandary some countries are facing as a result of their partnerships with Beijing.\u201cLet me say to all the nations across this wider region, and the world: Do not accept foreign debt that could compromise your sovereignty,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\u201cWe don\u2019t drown our partners in a sea of debt,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t coerce or compromise your independence. We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road. When you partner with us, we partner with you, and we all prosper.\u201dMr. Xi, perhaps anticipating the criticism, spoke before Mr. Pence and disputed the notion that accepting Chinese investment as part of the initiative called \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d would compromise a nation\u2019s sovereignty.The initiative \u201cis not for geopolitical purposes; it will exclude no one; it will not close a door and create a small circle,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cIt is not the so-called trap, as some people say. It is the sunshine avenue where China shares opportunities with the world to seek common development.\u201dMr. Xi sought to paint China as continually opening its markets to the world.\u201cChina will continue to significantly relax market access, strengthen intellectual property protection and actively expand imports,\u201d he said. Since the beginning of this year, Mr. Xi said, China has \u201csignificantly\u201d reduced import tariffs on 1,449 consumer goods, 1,585 industrial products and vehicles and components.He described the trade dispute as a choice between \u201cwin-win progress or a zero sum game.\u201d\u201cMankind has once again reached a crossroads,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cWhich direction should we choose? Cooperation or confrontation? Openness or closing doors?\u201dMr. Pence and Mr. Xi may have been sending mixed messages with their speeches, said Brendan Taylor, an associate professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University.\u201cThe extent to which Mr. Xi tried to reassure the region that he didn\u2019t have any geopolitical ambitions \u2014 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly convincing,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.He described Mr. Pence\u2019s speech as having a \u201cvery strong \u2018America First\u2019 tone,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s quite a big gap between his rhetoric and what\u2019s actually happening in the region.\u201dOther nations in the region were hedging their bets, he said. \u201cThe moves those countries are making relate to their uncertainties about the U.S. and the Trump strategy or lack thereof,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.The two leaders discussed economic cooperation and the possibility of the Japanese military participating in training exercises in Darwin, where about 2,000 American Marines rotate through each year.In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Pence lauded the economic and military cooperation between the United States and its Asia-Pacific allies, and he warned China that American ships and jets would sail and fly anywhere allowed by international law.Chinese military forces have confronted American and other foreign navies and aircraft that have entered waters in the South China Sea that China claims as its own.\u201cThe United States of America will continue to uphold the freedom of the seas and the skies, which are so essential to our prosperity,\u201d Mr. Pence said.He said the United States would support efforts \u201cto adopt a meaningful and binding code of conduct that respects the rights of all nations, including the freedom of navigation, in the South China Sea.\u201dHe also announced that the United States would participate in an Australian-Papua New Guinea initiative to develop a naval base on Manus Island in the Bismarck Sea, in northern Papua New Guinea.The spokesman for Mr. Moon, Kim Eui-kyeom, said Mr. Xi was considering making his first state visit to Pyongyang next year.China is North Korea\u2019s largest trading partner, accounting for more than 90 percent of the North\u2019s external trade. But Mr. Xi has never visited North Korea as Chinese leader, and a trip to Pyongyang would be an important nod to Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership from North Korea\u2019s most important ally.Ties between the two countries had frayed recently as North Korea pressed ahead of with its nuclear weapons and missile tests, and Beijing joined American-led efforts to impose sanctions on the North. This year, however, Mr. Kim has sought to mend the relationship, meeting with Mr. Xi three times. For each of those meetings, Mr. Kim traveled to China.Mr. Kim, the South Korean spokesman, said Mr. Xi and Mr. Moon had agreed at the APEC forum that if the North\u2019s leader and Mr. Trump held a second summit meeting, as they have agreed to, it would be a \u201cwatershed\u201d moment in international efforts to end Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula.Jamie Tarabay reported from Sydney, Australia, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

{"Headline": "A Week After the Midterms, Trump Seems to Forget the Caravan", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For weeks before the midterm elections, President Trump warned ominously about the threat from a caravan of migrants streaming from Central America toward Mexico\u2019s border with the United States. It was a fearsome mix of criminals and \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d Mr. Trump claimed darkly, one that constituted a genuine national emergency.But since the election last week, Mr. Trump has tweeted about the caravan exactly once \u2014 to issue a proclamation preventing those who cross the border illegally from applying for asylum in the United States. Fox News, which faithfully amplified Mr. Trump\u2019s warnings about the migrants, has gone similarly quiet on the subject.There was little dispute, even before Election Day, that Mr. Trump was exploiting the caravan for political purposes. But analysts, historians and veterans of previous administrations said there were few comparable instances of a commander in chief warning about what he called a looming threat, only to drop it as soon as people voted.\u201cNow that the political utility of troops on the southern border to face a fictitious caravan invasion threat is over,\u201d said Adm. James G. Stavridis, a former commander of the military\u2019s Southern Command, \u201clet\u2019s hope the president will stand down the troops so they can be with their families \u2014 especially over the holidays.\u201dBut some officials in the Defense Department worry that Mr. Trump could do the opposite \u2014 seek an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, the 1878 law that prohibits the government from using active-duty troops to enforce laws inside the country\u2019s borders.As pure political calculation, analysts from both parties said that seizing on the caravan mobilized Republican voters, dramatizing immigration in a way that resonated with Mr. Trump\u2019s political base. But it is far less clear that the dire warnings helped Republican candidates with independents or other late-deciding voters.David Axelrod, a former aide to President Barack Obama, said on Twitter, \u201cThe president\u2019s calculated histrionics about the caravan, about which we have heard very little since Election Day, may have sunk the @GOP in AZ.\u201dIn exit polls, voters who made up their minds in the last three days before the election said they voted for Democrats over Republicans 53 percent to 41 percent. That coincides with the period in which Mr. Trump redoubled his focus on the caravan, rejecting the advice of aides who wanted to air a commercial promoting the healthy economy.Exit polls did not contain a specific question about the caravan. But they did show that voters who made up their minds in the final week of the campaign, before Mr. Trump\u2019s last-minute push, chose Democrats over Republicans by a narrower tally: 49 percent to 48 percent.Privately, Republican pollsters pointed to the fact that their party had picked up just three of 10 Senate seats held by Democrats as evidence of the ambiguous effect the caravan crusade had on Republicans.At one campaign rally after another, Mr. Trump said the election came down to \u201cthe caravan, law and order, and common sense.\u201d In Mesa, Ariz., on Oct. 19, he said: \u201cYou got some bad people in those groups. You got some tough people in those groups. And I\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 this country doesn\u2019t want them. O.K.? We don\u2019t want them.\u201dA day earlier, he tweeted about the \u201cassault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in.\u201dMr. Trump posted footage of an undocumented immigrant on trial for killing a police officer, and his campaign organization produced an ad featuring migrants trying to scale a wall to dramatize the stakes of the election.\u201cI\u2019ve never before seen an American president, after going all over the country about this national crisis, then the day after an election shrug,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University.The closest parallel that Mr. Brinkley drew was to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who seized on \u2014 and mischaracterized \u2014 two murky encounters between American and North Vietnamese warships in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964 as a pretext to accelerate America\u2019s engagement in the Vietnam War. Still, he said, Mr. Trump\u2019s response was of a different order.\u201cIt was a dangerous form of xenophobia, aimed solely for electoral purposes and had nothing to do in the end with real national security,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said.For the troops, so far, it has mostly been an expensive field trip. The cost of the deployment is not known, but budget officials believe it could reach $200 million if all 15,000 troops that Mr. Trump pledged are ultimately sent.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday that the Pentagon was \u201ccapturing\u201d the expenses daily and would update the public when he knew the total cost. On Wednesday, Mr. Mattis plans to meet with soldiers at Base Camp Donna, the forward operating base built over the last month near the Rio Grande.Mr. Mattis said there had been no change to the mission; the troops were not receiving extra combat or hostile-fire pay. His visit, a defense official said, is meant to be low key and reminiscent of his days as a Marine general, when he could meet front-line troops with little fanfare.Living conditions at Base Camp Donna are spare, but since its construction this month, the Army has added showers and a larger living area aside from the initial allotment of tents.Defenders of Mr. Trump said the troops would take little notice of his sudden lack of emphasis on the caravan.\u201cKnowing the troops, knowing how busy they are, they\u2019re not focused on him,\u201d said Jack Keane, a retired four-star general who is a former vice chief of staff of the Army. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201dBut other former military officers said the soldiers were well aware of the political motivation behind their mission. Lacking much else to do, they will quickly pick up on Mr. Trump\u2019s loss of interest in the caravan, and it will add to their already depleted morale.\u201cHaving spent months in the desert with nothing to do, at least we had scorpions to have scorpion fights with,\u201d said John A. Nagl, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who served in Operation Desert Shield in 1990 and 1991.\u201cBut we had a real mission,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys don\u2019t have that.\u201dThomas Gibbons-Neff and Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington, and Mitchell Ferman from McAllen, Tex.Advertisement"}

In addition to the airstrikes, Saudi Arabia has imposed economic sanctions and blockades on Yemen, contributing to the deepening humanitarian crisis.David Beasley, the managing director of the World Food Program, visited Yemen last week and painted a dire portrait of the situation. Since the spring, the price of basic food staples has doubled, Mr. Beasley added. \u201cFor a country that\u2019s dependent on imports for the basic needs of life, this is disaster,\u201d he said.  As the death toll from the military operation worsens, rebuilding the economy has emerged as a priority to prevent widespread famine.Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen\u2019s civil war in April 2015 to fight the Shiite rebels backed by its regional rival, Iran. But instead of a quick victory, the Saudi-led campaign evolved into a bloody stalemate. The bombardment, which relies heavily on arms and equipment from the United States, has torn the country asunder.Save the Children said it had been forced to reroute supplies for the north of the country through the southern port of Aden, with deliveries taking three weeks instead of one.According to Stephen L. Anderson, country director for the World Food Program in Yemen, 8.4 million people are considered to be severely food insecure, one step from famine. \u201cNow, based on analysis and projections, that number could increase by 50 percent or so,\u201d Mr. Anderson said in a phone interview on Wednesday. \u201cEven if peace were to break out tomorrow, which is very unlikely, we\u2019ve still got a massive humanitarian crisis on our hands,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump praised the Saudis for a drop in oil prices, writing on Twitter: \u201cOil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\u2019s go lower!\u201dThis month, the United States said that it would end air refueling flights for the Saudi military campaign in Yemen and prepare sanctions against Saudis linked to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi. But those steps were seen as limited and in response to overwhelming international condemnation.Mr. Mattis did not specify a date for the peace talks for fear of coming out ahead of a United Nations announcement.\u201cIt looks like that very, very early in December, up in Sweden,\u201d he said in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019ll see both the Houthi rebel side, and the U.N.-recognized government, President Hadi\u2019s government, will be up there.\u201d Mr. Mattis added that the Saudi-led coalition had stopped its offensive around Hudaydah before the talks.Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudis Close to Crown Prince Discussed Killing Other Enemies a Year Before Khashoggi\u2019s Death", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Top Saudi intelligence officials close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked a small group of businessmen last year about using private companies to assassinate Iranian enemies of the kingdom, according to three people familiar with the discussions.Saudi officials have portrayed Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death as a rogue killing ordered by an official who has since been fired. But that official, Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, was present for a meeting in March 2017 in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, where the businessmen pitched a $2 billion plan to use private intelligence operatives to try to sabotage the Iranian economy.During the discussion, part of a series of meetings where the men tried to win Saudi funding for their plan, General Assiri\u2019s top aides inquired about killing Qassim Suleimani, the leader of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps and a man considered a determined enemy of Saudi Arabia.The interest in assassinations, covert operations and military campaigns like the war in Yemen \u2014 overseen by Prince Mohammed \u2014 is a change for the kingdom, which historically has avoided an adventurous foreign policy that could create instability and imperil Saudi Arabia\u2019s comfortable position as one of the world\u2019s largest oil suppliers.As for the businessmen, who had intelligence backgrounds, they saw their Iran plan both as a lucrative source of income and as a way to cripple a country that they and the Saudis considered a profound threat. George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman, arranged the meeting. He had met previously with Prince Mohammed, and had pitched the Iran plan to Trump White House officials. Another participant in the meetings was Joel Zamel, an Israeli with deep ties to his country\u2019s intelligence and security agencies.A spokesman for the Saudi government declined to comment, as did lawyers for both Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel.During the March 2017 meeting about the plan to sabotage Iran\u2019s economy, according to the three people familiar with the discussions, the Saudis asked the businessmen whether they also \u201cconducted kinetics\u201d \u2014 lethal operations \u2014 saying they were interested in killing senior Iranian officials. The businessmen hesitated, saying they would need to consult their lawyer.The lawyer flatly rejected the plan, and the businessmen told the Saudis they would not take part in any assassinations. Mr. Nader told the Saudis about a London-based company run by former British special operations troops that might take on the contract. It is unclear which company he suggested.Before he was ousted last month, General Assiri was considered one of Prince Mohammed\u2019s closest advisers, a man whose sharp ascent tracked the rise of the young crown prince. In 2016, he became the public face of Saudi Arabia\u2019s campaign in Yemen, giving briefings about the state of the war. He traveled frequently to Washington, where Saudi-paid lobbyists brought him to think tanks to give optimistic assessments about the campaign\u2019s progress and he extolled the Saudi concern for the welfare of civilians.By 2017, however, the Saudi campaign that General Assiri oversaw in Yemen had ground into a military stalemate and, despite his assurances, a humanitarian catastrophe. But his patron, Prince Mohammed, also consolidated his power over all of the kingdom\u2019s security apparatuses, and he promoted General Assiri to the deputy head of the kingdom\u2019s spy agency, the General Intelligence Directorate.Western analysts believe that Prince Mohammed moved General Assiri there in part to keep an eye on the spy chief, Khalid bin Ali bin Abdullah al-Humaidan, known as Abu Ali, who was close to Western intelligence agencies and suspected of harboring loyalties to one of the crown prince\u2019s royal rivals.Mr. Nader\u2019s and Mr. Zamel\u2019s plan dates to the beginning of 2016, when they started discussing an ambitious campaign of economic warfare against Iran similar to one waged by Israel and the United States during the past decade aimed at coercing Iran to end its nuclear program. They sketched out operations like revealing hidden global assets of the Quds Force; creating fake social media accounts in Farsi to foment unrest in Iran; financing Iranian opposition groups; and publicizing accusations, real or fictitious, against senior Iranian officials to turn them against one another.Mr. Nader is an adviser to the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, a country that, along with Saudi Arabia and Israel, has identified Iran as the primary threat to stability in the Middle East.Both he and Mr. Zamel believed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s anticipated victory in the 2016 election meant a continuation of the Iran nuclear deal signed by President Barack Obama \u2014 and little appetite in Washington for a concerted campaign to cripple the Iranian economy. So, they decided to pitch the plan to Saudi and Emirati officials, even submitting a proposal to General Assiri during a meeting in Belgium.The election of Donald J. Trump changed their calculus, and shortly after, Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel traveled to New York to sell both Trump transition officials and Saudi generals on their Iran plan.Mr. Nader and Mr. Zamel enlisted Erik Prince, the former head of Blackwater and an adviser to the Trump transition team. They had already discussed elements of their plan with Mr. Prince, in a meeting when they learned of his own paramilitary proposals that he planned to try to sell to the Saudis. A spokesman for Mr. Prince, Marc Cohen, declined to give specifics about the meeting but said that Mr. Prince had no discussions with Saudis about assassinations.In a suite on one of the top floors of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in New York, Mr. Zamel and Mr. Nader spoke to General Assiri and his aides about their Iran plan. The Saudis were interested in the idea but said it was so provocative and potentially destabilizing that they wanted to get the approval of the incoming Trump administration before Saudi Arabia paid for the campaign.After Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, Mr. Nader met frequently with White House officials to discuss the economic sabotage plan.General Assiri\u2019s interest in assassinations was unsurprising but unrepresentative of official policy, said one Saudi familiar with the inquiry into the Khashoggi killing. The investigation has shown the general to be a grandiose and ambitious novice to intelligence who sought to impress the crown prince with unauthorized schemes for black operations, the person said.But General Assiri\u2019s well-known closeness to the crown prince \u2014 the general often joined Prince Mohammed for meetings in Riyadh with visiting American officials \u2014 might make it difficult for the prince\u2019s supporters to distance him from the proposals, just as the same connections have helped convince Western intelligence agencies that the prince must have known about the plot against Mr. Khashoggi.\u201cHad a truly magnificent meeting with M.B.S.,\u201d Mr. Nader wrote in early 2017, discussing possible Saudi contracts. The crown prince, he said, had advised him to \u201creview it and discuss it with General Ahmed.\u201dMark Mazzetti reported from Washington, Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv and David D.

{"Headline": "Thanksgiving Turkey and Raita in Texas", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe dinners at my parents\u2019 house in Dallas told a story of the nation\u2019s contemporary history. Ms. Rao is a writer.We did all the American scenes big, but especially Thanksgiving. There can\u2019t be many families of any race or creed as invested in the holiday as mine. Our house in Dallas became the center of the world come November. Cousins, aunts, uncles without the holiday off made space in the calendar to fly in from India. A turkey joined our normally vegetarian household, with no debate about Hindu notions of cleanliness.The spread reflected aspirations. On the dining table, dishes married Hallmark and Karnataka: green bean palya, sweet potato raita. A friend of my parents dreamed up cranberry chutney, an instant hit. My mother\u2019s best friend brought a touch of cosmopolitan sophistication: yams and marshmallows without any Indian spice.The coffee table stayed frozen in time, homage to Mom\u2019s take on America, and after her death, to Mom herself. Appetizers spoke to the quick-food era: cream cheese tortilla rollups served with salsa; a loaf of King\u2019s Hawaiian carved to hold spinach dip thick in water chestnuts, recipes pulled from magazines she leafed through in her early years in the country.The parties told a story of the nation\u2019s contemporary history. As a young business school professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, my father had students from India. My parents thought to provide a home.The moods of the brown folks who walked through our doors reflected shifts in American policy and the global order. In the 1980s, a mania for finance degrees and with relative ease of entry meant a flood of Indian M.B.A. students. In the 1990s, Indian migration to Dallas soared, and friendship became less an act of desperation than of choice. In time most attendees spoke Kannada, the language of my parents. In the early 2000s, as the Indian economy grew, there were excited conversations about annual return trips, from which some families never returned.Cousins from India became part of the household, and the country: Mukund, who would get his M.B.A. at the University of Texas in Dallas; his wife, Asha, for whom the allure of America had faded after the outsourcing boom brought bars and jobs aplenty to their home city of Bangalore. Raghav locked himself upstairs on his first Thanksgiving to watch the American version of \u201cThe Office\u201d as required reading of a sort for an undergraduate with a Mumbai accent in Chicago.My mom\u2019s last year alive, 2007, we sang around the table that she and my father bought their first year in Texas. A stroke wiped her of speech except in song. She managed broken refrains to tunes she remembered from India, devotional songs and Bollywood hits. After she died the parties turned rare and sparse, in rhythm with the outside. Our local scene aged, the young scattered, recession reordered the world.I had moved to Brooklyn. Thanksgivings had become an ad hoc affair. In 2016, under a new administration, we staged a reunion tour as my father turned 70. I emailed family early and asked them to buy plane tickets to Dallas. The presidential election unsettled me.We held a roast outside the house: Uncles and aunties from Dallas sat in the audience as the family put on a show. Jokes centered on decay. Dad\u2019s house broke days before the holiday: The stove didn\u2019t work, the power went out, his car wouldn\u2019t start. We boiled water on a camping stove donated by an uncle whose wife sat at home with tumors to fight. An Iranian student of Dad\u2019s, who was supposed to join us, was already having trouble with his visa and was stuck in Canada. Dad fretted he might lose a job offer to teach in America, that he might never be let back in. A cousin roasted the audience, making fun of their belief in America. He took special aim at those who voted for a man under whom they might never have made it in, were their timing different.My cousins now have children who didn\u2019t know of a past to mourn. They turned the power failure in my father\u2019s house into a game, calling the long weekend \u201cthe Pitch-Dark Party.\u201d Hadn\u2019t my parents tried to meet a similar need of students, family, friends \u2014 to participate in an illusion? Turkey and family and football. An American scene, peopled by us, despite our differences from the stars of Norman Rockwell canvases and holiday commercials. I realized my wish for a Dallas Thanksgiving came out of a wish for illusion, too, a discomfort with reality.Mallika Rao is a writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Psychology of Anti-Semitism", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy is prejudice against Jewish people so often expressed in sudden waves of virulent, even exterminatory attacks?Dr. Cuddy is a social psychologist.After the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, in which a white supremacist shot to death 11 people while screaming, \u201cAll Jews must die,\u201d a Jewish girl in New York sent an anguished note to her mother. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t feel like I don\u2019t have an answer to this question,\u201d she wrote in a text message that was later shared on social media. \u201cBut why do people hate us?\u201dHer bafflement was understandable. Many people, of course, favor the groups they belong to and dislike groups they don\u2019t belong to; that is the regrettable foundation of prejudice. But not all groups are disliked the same way: Why are some groups (such as homeless people) dismissed or neglected in a relatively steady stream of scorn, while other groups (such as Jewish people) are subjected to sudden waves of virulent, even exterminatory attacks?For many decades psychologists conceived of prejudice as a one-dimensional antipathy: People love their \u201cin-groups\u201d and hate \u201cout-groups.\u201d But this us-versus-them approach failed to account for prejudice\u2019s real-world complexities.These stereotypes, needless to say, don\u2019t seem to result from careful observation of the groups in question. On the contrary, they appear to be inferences drawn from a group\u2019s position in society. People assume that socioeconomically successful groups must be competent and that disadvantaged groups must be incompetent. Likewise, groups that are viewed as competitors \u2014 for status, for resources \u2014 get stereotyped as cold, whereas groups that are viewed as allies get stereotyped as warm.In-groups and \u201ccultural reference\u201d groups (the middle class and Christians are common examples in the United States) are stereotyped as warm and competent \u2014 a wholly positive category. In stark contrast, groups on society\u2019s margins who are blamed for their plight and viewed as a drain on resources (common examples include homeless people and drug addicts) are stereotyped as cold and incompetent \u2014 a wholly negative category. Discrimination against groups stereotyped in this way is typically expressed through disregard, stigmatizing and ostracizing.Most groups we have studied, however, garner ambivalent stereotypes: either warm but incompetent, or competent but cold. They are not stereotyped as simply good or bad. And this leads to more subtle or complex patterns of discrimination.Consider the group often described by our research participants as \u201cthe elderly.\u201d In virtually all of our studies, older people are stereotyped as warm but incompetent. Their perceived warmth elicits affection and support, while their perceived incompetence elicits disrespect and neglect. People feel a sort of condescending compassion and pity toward them. This leads to paternalistic and patronizing treatment, such as speaking unnecessarily slowly and in an overly endearing manner. (Another group commonly stereotyped as warm but incompetent are people with disabilities.)In our research, a widespread stereotype of Jewish people, like that of other socioeconomically successful minorities such as Asian-Americans, falls in the competent-but-cold quadrant. Groups in this quadrant elicit respect but also resentment for their success. We call this \u201cenvious prejudice.\u201dHow envious prejudice operates turns out to depend on how stable the world feels. As has been demonstrated in lab experiments, field studies and historical analyses, if a society, its economy and its government are seen as secure, people will look favorably on groups that are stereotyped as competent but cold, because their perceived competence is valued. When times are good, the resentment component of \u201cenvious prejudice\u201d takes a back seat.But when times get tough, envious prejudices can ignite. Societal breakdown, harsh economies or political turmoil can activate resentment toward high-status minorities, who are seen as competitors for limited resources or even dangerous enemies. The stereotyped competence of such groups, when they are suspected or accused of \u201ccold\u201d ill will, suddenly represents a serious threat. Envy toward these groups becomes volatile, mutating into anger and spurring the most extreme forms of discrimination \u2014 intentional harm and even annihilation.In the wake of Germany\u2019s defeat in World War I and the subsequent economic crisis, Jewish people were cast as powerful, manipulative agents of disaster. In the chaos of 1970s Cambodia, professionals and intellectuals were imprisoned and murdered en masse, often by neighbors whom they had socialized with or done business with just weeks before. In Rwanda in the 1990s, the Tutsi, another high-status minority group, were blamed for the country\u2019s severe economic problems and systematically slaughtered by their compatriots in a mere three months.Under the wrong circumstances, the \u201ccompetent but cold\u201d stereotype \u2014 not despite but because of its positive component \u2014 can become a dangerous weapon of discrimination and destruction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Was Not Repudiated. He Was Rewarded.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president made the midterms a real battle instead of a running retreat. He is widely hated and feared, but he is also much loved as a champion of his voters. Mr. McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Quarterly.If Donald Trump inaugurated a new era of conflict in American politics, Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections were just another skirmish, not a turning point in the war. Republicans lost fewer seats in the House of Representatives than Democrats lost in 1994 or 2010, when Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were in their first terms as president. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama both went on to win re-election two years after those midterm routs. And while Democrats also lost Senate seats in the first midterm elections under Presidents Clinton and Obama, Mr. Trump\u2019s Republicans defied the historical trend by adding to their Senate majority.Democrats and other critics of President Trump argue that given the health of the economy, the failure of Republicans to do better than just keeping the Senate amounts to a damning verdict on this administration. Democrats and their supporters also boast about winning the \u201cpopular vote\u201d for the House by a wide margin \u2014 by more than 8 percent, according to early estimates. Taken together, these claims are meant to show that Trumpism as a program and style of politics is unpopular, a drag on the Republican brand, and puts winning future elections into great doubt.Republicans on Tuesday did lose the governorship of Michigan, and they failed to win races for governor and the United States Senate in Pennsylvania. Those states, too, were part of Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral map two years ago and are apt to be critical in 2020. Would the president be unable to win them again? Lou Barletta, the Republican nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania (who lost to the incumbent Democrat Bob Casey), was a staunch immigration restrictionist, just as the president is. But Mr. Barletta ran what was almost universally deemed a poor campaign, and he had nothing of the president\u2019s star power or talent for exploiting an opponent\u2019s weaknesses through well-chosen insults. Democrats\u2019 successes in Pennsylvania suggest little about how a Democratic nominee will perform in the state against Mr. Trump in two years\u2019 time. The same can be said, with a little less confidence, about Democrats\u2019 midterm successes in other Upper Midwest contests.In an ordinary midterm election, turnout is low and the opposition party has an advantage, as is reflected in the long chronicle of losses for whichever party holds the White House at the time. In recent decades, only the 1998 and 2002 midterm elections were exceptions in which the president\u2019s party gained seats. It\u2019s easy to see why the president\u2019s party is usually endangered: It has to defend the real record of a real leader, while the opposition party can criticize the president without having to offer an alternative. Strong criticism from one side and a necessarily weaker defense from the other is a formula for gains by the party out of power.That was still the case this year. Yet Mr. Trump did something unusual by increasing turnout among his defenders as well as his opponents. Republicans felt that Mr. Trump had an agenda still worth fighting for, and they were heartened that on several key issues \u2014 perhaps most important, judicial appointments \u2014 the president had delivered what he promised. That helped to make Tuesday a good night for political engagement overall, and it kept Republican losses below what they would have been if Mr. Trump had simply been an unpopular and polarizing figure. Mr. Trump made the election a real battle instead of a running retreat. He is indeed widely hated and feared, but he is also much loved as a champion of his voters \u2014 not only by those who are nationalists as the president is but by those, too, who are conventional Republicans who want lower taxes, fewer regulations and more conservative judges. Far from bringing about Mr. Trump\u2019s repudiation, whether by a defeated and regretful right or by the country as a whole, the midterm election has only firmed up the lines of conflict for the future. President Trump will be at the center of that conflict, not as an aberration or departure from the norms of politics but as an integral part of the Republican Party \u2014 its head as well as its right arm.

{"Headline": "Making Gains for Women in STEM Fields Will Take More Effort", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 If the world of STEM is looking for more women role models, V\u00e9na Arielle Ahouansou and Alejandra Estanislao are candidates.Both are young and have degrees in a field involving science, technology, engineering or mathematics \u2014 the disciplines where women are significantly underrepresented.Ms. Estanislao, 31, originally from Venezuela, also wanted to be a doctor but got a degree in mathematics and finance at a top French engineering school, and she is now a software engineer at Google in Paris.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad at the engineering faculty, where we were about 25 percent,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said. \u201cIt was later, at work. When you find yourself one woman in a room of 30 people, that is when you feel lonely.\u201dDr. Ahouansou, whose company employs 15 people, said men still have a blind spot \u2014 not about women in management, but about women in technology. \u201cThey need to change their mind-set that science is just for them,\u201d she said.No one disputes these days that STEM remains mostly a man\u2019s world. Much has been written about the male geek culture that dominates Silicon Valley and other technology hubs. But numerous speakers at the conference agreed that needs to change soon if women are to adjust to fast-changing job markets that increasingly require technological skills, or scientific proficiency.The study found that in the developed world, women account for just 25 percent of graduates in information and communications technology, and 24 percent in engineering \u2014 even though women outnumber men in graduate schools over all.As jobs change around the world, technology \u2014 and the flexibility it promises \u2014 could offer women a chance to choose how, when and where they work. But these opportunities are lost without the skills to access them, which is why many said at the global women\u2019s forum, in which The New York Times is a partner, that giving women the skills to master technology is a social, moral and economic necessity.\u201cFixing that is the right thing to do,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said.\u201cWhat the study found is that girls want more role models,\u201d Ms. McKinley said. \u201cWhere are the women STEM teachers? Girls are more interested in hands-on experience; they want to see the life applications of what they are learning. We need to focus on this.\u201dAngel Gurria, Secretary General of the O.E.C.D., speaking at an opening event at the organization\u2019s headquarters, said a recent effort in his native Mexico \u2014 \u201cmacho Mexico\u201d as he put it \u2014 to expose girls in high schools to celebrated women in science and technology has had a positive affect. But, he acknowledged, fighting stereotypes is an uphill battle.\u201cThey happen naturally, starting in families,\u201d he said. \u201cParents often don\u2019t have enough information. We are fighting centuries and centuries of tradition and culture.\u201d One answer, some experts say, is to encourage paternity leave after the birth of a child, which allows their wives to keep working, and the men to become more involved in family life and to offer their daughters in particular another role model at home.Paternity leave has been catching on in some countries, particularly those facing a declining birthrate and an aging population, as a way to encourage women to stay in the work force.In Iceland and elsewhere, fathers\u2019 share of paid leave dipped during the financial crisis, as men stayed at work to boost the family income.But in many countries, cultural biases can trump even the most progressive legislation. Generous paternal leave policies in Japan and Korea are rarely used for both economic and cultural reasons, Mr. Adema said.In Russia, legislation that allows fathers to take up to three years off after the birth of a child is widely shunned, according to Svetlana Lukash, a member of Russia\u2019s presidential staff. \u201cIt is still badly perceived by society,\u201d she said.According to O.E.C.D. statistics, women are still eight times more likely to care for children than men, even though 86 percent of men agree they should do more to share the burden at home. As several speakers admitted, attitudes toward shared responsibilities at home have changed, but behavior has not.\u201cWe need to make the women\u2019s agenda a family agenda,\u201d said Gabriela Ramos, chief of staff at the O.E.C.D.Attracting girls and women to STEM studies is just one issue. Another, perhaps more significant, is encouraging them to stay the course. \u201cIt is all about retention,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said. \u201cIt is useless to bring in women if you can\u2019t keep them.\u201dAccording to Ms. Nefesh-Clarke, more than 50 percent of women in information and communications technology, or ICT, leave, mainly because of a hostile environment. That helps explain why women hold only 3 percent of the top management jobs in ICT, she said.\u201cWe can\u2019t just address the external pipeline,\u201d she said later. \u201cWe have to address the internal pipeline, and why it is leaking. What is it about the culture of ICT that makes women not want to stay?\u201dA new danger is that the low level of women\u2019s participation in STEM may become self replicating. A number of speakers at the three-day forum noted that women are woefully underrepresented in the high-tech start-up world. Only 9 percent of apps are created by women; 10 percent of innovative start-ups were founded by women; and women-only teams account for just 6 percent of popular open source programming language for data analysis.In other words, all-male teams are writing algorithms that reflect their attitudes and biases, which inadvertently or not can exclude women.\u201cAlgorithms are built by humans,\u201d said Emanuela Aureli, of Spencer Stuart, a consulting firm. \u201cIf women don\u2019t participate in their creation, they won\u2019t have a voice.\u201d Pronouns flagging the sex of applicants have been found inserted in job search programs, she said.\u201cThe message is we should not reproduce the biases and stereotypes of the analog world,\u201d said Ms. Ramos, the chief of staff of the O.E.C.D.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of women in information and communications technology who leave, mainly because of a hostile environment. It is 50 percent of women, not 50 women.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carlos Ghosn Felt Stars Deserved Big Pay. His Accusers Say He Took That Too Far.", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShortly after Carlos Ghosn took over in 1999 as chief operating officer of an ailing Nissan Motor, he overhauled the way the company paid senior employees.Abandoning Japanese traditions that rewarded seniority and shunned incentive awards, Mr. Ghosn enforced a performance-based system and gave bonuses to midlevel managers.He earned a reputation as one of his generation\u2019s most successful C.E.O.s, but now the way Mr. Ghosn managed his own rewards may prove to be his downfall.On Monday, Mr. Ghosn was arrested in Tokyo after a company investigation alleged that he had deceived Japanese financial authorities about his pay package.According to Tokyo prosecutors, Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a onetime Nissan human resources manager and current board member, underreported Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation between 2011 and 2015 by more than 5 billion yen ($44.5 million). The prosecutors say they declared pay of just under \u00a55 billion ($44.3 million), which was half the nearly \u00a510 billion ($88.8 million) he actually earned.Neither man has been charged. Prosecutors have 72 hours to assess the accusations, and they can request an additional 20 days, depending on court approval, to investigate.Nissan\u2019s board will meet Thursday to consider their removal.He was named one of the most powerful people in business by Fortune magazine in 2003. He became a fixture on the conference circuit and a regular at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.By the time prosecutors boarded his corporate jet on Monday at Haneda Airport in Tokyo to take him off for questioning, Mr. Ghosn had been embroiled in several fights over executive pay, something of a recurring subplot in his career. He has made many millions of dollars serving as chief executive and chairman of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors. At times, his pay drew the ire of investors and politicians, including Emmanuel Macron, now the French president, when he was finance minister in 2016.\u201cHe was always arguing about whether he was adequately compensated,\u201d said Robin Ferracone, founder of Farient Advisors, an executive compensation advisory firm. \u201cThe question was whether he should be compared to Japanese standards, or international standards or American standards.\u201dIn Japan, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s pay far outstripped those of his counterparts. As chairman of Nissan last year, he reported income of \u00a5735 million, more than four times the pay of Toyota\u2019s chairman.\u201cThere was always a disconnect between Western management salaries and Japanese management salaries,\u201d said Christopher Richter, deputy head of Japan research at CLSA, an investment and brokerage group. Even though \u201ccompared to executives in other countries, some people would regard him as underpaid,\u201d Mr. Richter added, \u201cI guess you could say there was something of a culture clash in that.\u201dMr. Ghosn was born in Brazil to Lebanese immigrants and moved to Beirut when he was a toddler.He went on to study engineering at an elite university in Paris, then worked at Michelin, the tire maker, for 18 years.He started on the factory floor, preparing rubber for the manufacturing process. Soon he was a plant manager. Before long he was deployed to his native Brazil as chief operating officer of Michelin\u2019s local subsidiary, where he expanded the business despite soaring inflation. In 1990 he was made chief executive for Michelin\u2019s troubled North American division, and he revived it.But Michelin was a family company, and Mr. Ghosn said he knew he was unlikely to become C.E.O. When Renault, the French carmaker, recruited him in 1996, he joined as the executive vice president overseeing manufacturing, purchasing, and research and development.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s inviting gestures went only so far. Six months into his tenure, on the eve of the Tokyo Motor Show, he presented a plan for Nissan\u2019s revival. Billed the Nissan Revival Plan, it called for the elimination of some 21,000 jobs, or 14 percent of the work force, including several top managers.A series of manga comics, published in 2002, depicted the moment when Mr. Ghosn unveiled the restructuring plan to Nissan\u2019s executive team. The illustrations showed colleagues sweating about the news to close factories.\u201cRight now Nissan is just like a boat that is on fire and we need to extinguish this fire as soon as possible,\u201d the cartoon Mr. Ghosn says.In a country where layoffs are rare, Mr. Ghosn was pilloried in the press and labeled a \u201cgaijin,\u201d or foreigner. In a measure of his own confidence, Mr. Ghosn pledged to step down if his plan failed.The aggressive cost-cutting worked. Within a year, Nissan\u2019s finances had stabilized. Soon after, its debt load was slashed and its profits had improved. Mr. Ghosn was named chief executive in 2001.The recession of 2008 forced Mr. Ghosn to institute wide-ranging belt-tightening across the company, including new parts orders and factory overtime, and even the activities of the corporate-sponsored baseball team. Managers took a 5 percent pay cut.One investment that Mr. Ghosn continued to pursue was the development of battery-powered cars. Profitability might still be elusive, but the alliance saw the models \u2014 Renault, with its subcompact Zoe, and Nissan, with its compact Leaf \u2014 as necessary innovations.On Monday, Mitsubishi, like Nissan, said it would recommend that Mr. Ghosn be removed as chairman. In France, where Renault employs 47,000 workers, there was a more cautious response. The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Tuesday that Mr. Ghosn was \u201cno longer in a position capable of leading Renault\u201d because of the inquiry, but France has seen no evidence of the crimes alleged in Japan.Mr. Ghosn had planned to spend Tuesday night far differently. According to Jun Miyaji, a manager at Kushiwaka, a restaurant serving skewered chicken, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s secretary called to cancel his 7:30 reservation for dinner.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of the director of the movie \u201cMarie Antoinette.\u201d She is Sofia Coppola, not Sophia.Jack Ewing, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Typically Rises After Midterm Elections. This Year Is Anything but Typical.", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThere has been a deficit of cheerful news lately about American politics. And with the midterm elections looming, it may be difficult to think clearly about anything else.So here\u2019s a tidbit that may be diverting and even mildly comforting: The midterms have consistently been good for the stock market.Remarkably, this has been true for every midterm election since World War II.The data shows that it hasn\u2019t mattered who won or lost or which party controlled the White House or Congress, either before the voting or as a result of it. Whatever the political configuration or the election results, the midterm election season has been an excellent one for stocks.The pattern \u201cgives a very positive message for the market,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States Strategist for Ned Davis Research. \u201cIt\u2019s only part of the picture, but it\u2019s a positive part.\u201dThe numbers tell the story. Since 1946, in years with midterm elections, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has gained a median of 18.4 percent in the nine-month period from Sept. 30, just ahead of voting, through June 30 of the following year, according to data compiled by Ned Davis Research. In that same period in nonvoting years, the index gained 4.9 percent.Diving a little deeper into the Ned Davis data, the pattern is evident when presidential terms are broken down into three-month quarters. Each four-year presidential term has 16 quarters, and the best one has typically been the quarter we are in now, the fourth quarter of a midterm year.In this midterm quarter, the stock index since 1946 has gained 7.5 percent on average. The next best two quarters in performance have been the next two quarters chronologically \u2014 the first and second quarters in the year after the midterm election \u2014 with average gains of 7.5 percent and 6.6 percent.There have been declines within these periods \u2014 including one, in 1946, as large as a 15.4 percent loss \u2014 but in every case, the net result for the nine-month midterm season was a market gain.The main working hypothesis is a cynical one: Presidents are politicians who care overwhelmingly about their own re-election. (And to a much lesser extent, two-term presidents look to ensure the election of their successors.) They stimulate the economy \u2014 and, indirectly, the stock market \u2014 for maximum effect as their own elections grow closer, or so the theory goes.That implies that their first year in office is the best time to make politically painful moves, which won\u2019t hurt them in the polls later. And it follows that it\u2019s better to gin up the economy in the second half of their tenure, starting around the midterms. If the good times are going to roll, let them roll closer to a presidential election.Cause and effect have been difficult to prove. The one case with a smoking gun occurred, naturally enough, in the Nixon administration.Mr. Nixon took other actions, including the imposition of wage and price controls to curb inflation, all aimed at improving his standing in the polls. And he crushed Senator George McGovern in the presidential election of 1972.Still, the patterns in the stock market over a very long period appear to be persuasive. (Even for Mr. Carter, the stock market eked out a small gain, 0.4 percent, in the midterm election quarter.)But even if the overall pattern is more than an elaborate series of coincidences, and even if presidential self-interest causes it, it\u2019s possible that President Trump may be so singular that little of this applies.Will the midterm pattern be sustained once more? Its overwhelming consistency is formidable. But so is Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to shatter convention.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the chief United States Strategist for Ned Davis Research.

{"Headline": "A Cryptocurrency Millionaire Wants to Build a Utopia in Nevada", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "A man spent millions on an enormous plot of land near Reno. Now he wants to build a community based on the blockchain technology introduced by Bitcoin.Supported bySTOREY COUNTY, Nev. \u2014 An enormous plot of land in the Nevada desert \u2014 bigger than nearby Reno \u2014 has been the subject of local intrigue since a company with no history, Blockchains L.L.C., bought it for $170 million in cash this year.The man who owns the company, a lawyer and cryptocurrency millionaire named Jeffrey Berns, put on a helmet and climbed into a Polaris off-road vehicle last week to give a tour of the sprawling property and dispel a bit of the mystery.He imagines a sort of experimental community spread over about a hundred square miles, where houses, schools, commercial districts and production studios will be built. The centerpiece of this giant project will be the blockchain, a new kind of database that was introduced by Bitcoin.After his driver stopped the Polaris on a high desert plateau, surrounded by blooming rabbit brush and a grazing herd of wild horses, Mr. Berns, who is 56, pointed to the highlights of his dream community.\u201cYou see that first range of mountains,\u201d he said, pointing south. \u201cThose mountains are the border of our South Valley. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going to build the high-tech park,\u201d a research campus that would cover hundreds of acres. There are also plans for a college and an e-gaming arena.As strange \u2014 even fantastical \u2014 as all this might sound, Mr. Berns\u2019s ambitions fit right into the idiosyncratic world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains.The blockchain began as a digital ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Some aficionados have grander plans. They think it could be a new way of taking power back from the institutions they believe are calling all the shots.Just as Bitcoin made it possible to transfer money without using a bank, blockchain believers like Mr. Berns think the technology will make it possible for ordinary people to control their own data \u2014 the lifeblood of the digital economy \u2014 without relying on big companies or governments.Mr. Berns was drawn to Nevada by its tax benefits, including the lack of income taxes. And the breadth of his ambitions certainly raises the risk of a boondoggle.But he is different from his crypto-brethren in one big way: He is spending his own money. So far, he said, he has spent $300 million on the land, offices, planning and a staff of 70 people. And buying 67,000 largely undeveloped acres is a bit of old-fashioned, real estate risk-taking.Still, Mr. Berns said his ambition was not to be a real estate magnate or even to get rich \u2014 or richer. He is promising to give away all decision-making power for the project and 90 percent of any dividends it generates to a corporate structure that will be held by residents, employees and future investors. That structure, which he calls a \u201cdistributed collaborative entity,\u201d is supposed to operate on a blockchain where everyone\u2019s ownership rights and voting powers will be recorded in a digital wallet.Mr. Berns acknowledged that all this is way beyond what blockchains have actually accomplished. But that hasn\u2019t discouraged him.\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d he said over the roar of the Polaris engine. \u201cI just \u2014 something inside me tells me this is the answer, that if we can get enough people to trust the blockchain, we can begin to change all the systems we operate by.\u201dMr. Berns has managed to win over local officials who are eager for economic development. Nevada\u2019s governor, Brian Sandoval, read a proclamation that named the Blockchains property \u201cInnovation Park\u201d at an event last month where Mr. Berns sat on a panel with the governor and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla.Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory in Nevada, which has been described as the largest building in the world, is surrounded by Blockchains\u2019 land. Companies like Google, Apple and Switch also have properties in the industrial park that is surrounded by Mr. Berns\u2019s holdings.The Nevada county where this is all located, Storey County, has only about 4,000 residents and was best known, until recently, for its history of silver mining and its modern brothels, including one owned by a county commissioner.That same county commissioner, Lance Gilman, bought the land surrounding the brothel and turned it into the industrial park where Tesla and Google are now located.Blockchains has already received preliminary county support for a new town along the Truckee River, with thousands of homes, a school and a drone delivery system, and is working closely with the county on a broader master plan.But for now, Blockchains is empty land and a repurposed office building. Mr. Berns said the company won\u2019t begin construction on the broader property until late 2019, at the earliest, after putting together the master plan and getting it approved by the county.The office manager from Mr. Berns\u2019s old law office in Los Angeles, Joanna Rodriguez, moved with her four children and husband to Nevada.\u201cHe has these crazy ideas \u2014 but I know that every time he sets his mind to something he will get there,\u201d said Ms. Rodriguez, 29, who has worked with Mr. Berns for eight years and is now the manager of the Blockchains office in Nevada. \u201cThat\u2019s why I decided to move.\u201dMr. Berns spent most of his professional life on class-action lawsuits, many of them against financial companies. He learned about Bitcoin in 2012 but was won over by another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, which makes it possible to store more than just transaction data on a blockchain.Mr. Berns bought Ether, the digital token associated with Ethereum, in a big sale in 2015. Thanks to an astronomical increase in the price of Ether and some well-timed selling last year before it crashed, he became wealthy enough to fund his dream project.Ethereum is what he believes makes his community more than just a giant real estate project. To understand why requires more than a bit of imagination. And faith. Every resident and employee will have what amounts to an Ethereum address, which they will use to vote on local measures and store their personal data.Mr. Berns believes Ethereum will give people a way to control their identity and online data without any governments or companies involved.That is a widely shared view in the blockchain community, but there are significant questions about whether any of it can work in the real world. Most blockchain companies have failed to gain any traction, and Ethereum and Bitcoin networks have struggled to handle even moderate amounts of traffic.Mr. Berns believes that one of the big problems has been security. People have been terrible at holding the private keys that are necessary to get access to a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet.He wants to address that with a custom-built system where people\u2019s private keys are stored on multiple digital devices, kept in vaults, so that no one device can gain access to the keys. He has already purchased vaults that are burrowed into mountains in Sweden and Switzerland, and he plans to build additional vaults in the mountains in Nevada.The other thing holding back Ethereum, Mr. Berns believes, has been a lack of real-world laboratories. His Nevada land, he hopes, will change that.\u201cThis will either be the biggest thing ever, or the most spectacular crash and burn in the history of mankind,\u201d Mr. Berns said. \u201cI don\u2019t know which one. I believe it\u2019s the former, but either way it\u2019s going to be one hell of a ride.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Texas Art Mecca, Humble Adobe Now Carries a High Cost", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARFA, Tex. \u2014 Adobe is one of the oldest building materials known to humanity, especially in arid regions like the southwestern United States. The material \u2014 earth, straw and water, pressed and sun-dried, was always plentiful and above all, dirt cheap.OKLA.N.M.TEXASDallasMarfaHoustonSan AntonioMEXICOGulf ofMexico200 milesBy The New York TimesBut for many of Marfa\u2019s longtime residents, the gentrification of the adobe home has made living in one rather expensive.Required by Texas law to find more revenue, the Presidio county tax assessors realized that adobe homes in Marfa were selling at a premium, and so they raised their appraisal values in 2017, just three years after a townwide revaluation. That has meant two big tax increases, not only for owners of the high-end and expansive adobe homes with backyard pools, xeriscaped gardens and adobe walls to surround them, but also for hundreds of more modest, weather-beaten residences clustered around the south side of Marfa, where historically most of the town\u2019s Hispanic population has lived.\u201cWhy are you going to tax them for using the cheapest building material they could get?\u201d said Sam Martinez, 58, whose family owns an adobe home built in the 1800s, and whose ties to Marfa are just as longstanding.All over town, the tax authorities sank their hooks into adobe.A century-old two-bedroom partial adobe house with a metal roof and laminate floors, wedged between two much bigger homes on West Dallas Street, saw its annual property taxes rise from $905 five years ago to $3,003 today. In that same time, a renovated three-bedroom with a partially exposed adobe wall in its living room saw its taxes go up from $1,365 to $4,988.Taxes on a wind-battered one-bedroom on the southeast edge of town, with a rusting corrugated metal shed in its yard, rose from $319 to $1,953. For a tidy three-bedroom with a wood-burning fireplace, a detached garage and a large yard, located north of the Marfa courthouse, the bill went from $1,848 to $4,469.Last year owners of 448 of the 530 adobe homes in Marfa \u2014 85 percent \u2014 protested the increased appraisals. Some of them received adjustments, but not Maria Flores, a 57-year-old house cleaner. She saw her taxes rise to $1,050 this year, compared with $752 five years ago. The appraisal board told her that because of improvements she\u2019d made \u2014 a fresh coat of paint and a new fence \u2014 her tax would not be lowered.Originally a water stop along the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway, Marfa began as a sleepy ranching town that was de facto segregated well into the 1960s. Most of the existing adobe homes were located on the south side of the railroad tracks, without plumbing and electricity.\u201cThe Hispanics, in my time, all lived in little adobe houses,\u201d said Rito Rivera, 78, who still lives in one of those houses. \u201cThe Anglos were ranchers \u2014 cowboys and landowners \u2014 and they could afford better material.\u201dThe appraisal on his adobe house increased from $39,770 five years ago to $104,660 this year. Mr. Rivera recently learned that he had prostate cancer, unlucky news that came with one upside: Under state law, it helped him qualify for a veteran\u2019s disability exemption from his rising tax bill. But an adobe home his wife inherited from family in town saw its bill spike to $1,925 from $1,170 five years earlier.Fortunes changed for Marfa, and adobe, when the sculptor Donald Judd arrived in the 1970s and turned its empty expanses into something of a vast outdoor studio. Marfa came to signify something within the art world, people from far reaches traveled to the desert to see it, and the prices of things began to reflect the cities they came from.The classic Marfa adobe home was once a two-room structure made of dirt dug from a pit in the backyard. No longer. Adobe became popular for three- or four-bedroom homes with observatories for stargazing and custom-tiled kitchens. And it wasn\u2019t just dirt anymore. Construction companies in the area like Rainbow Adobe specialize in homes made out of cement-stabilized adobe to prevent erosion.Susan Kirr, a filmmaker, and her artist husband, Rusty Martin, who bought an adobe home in 2005 while they were still living in Austin, admired the soft rounded shape the material made, its insulating properties and its relative affordability. Since they bought the house, their taxes have nearly quadrupled from $639 to $2,463.But until recently, even as Marfa\u2019s housing prices rose dramatically, its appraisals for tax purposes did not. And since public schools rely on property tax revenue, Marfa\u2019s school district faced major penalties once the state comptroller got wind of the disparity between the appraised value of the houses and their market prices.After the county\u2019s 2014 action, property appraisals were still not close enough to market value to comply with Texas law, which requires them to fall between 95 and 105 percent of market value. To fix the problem, and increase tax revenues, the town created a separate, higher appraisal classification for adobe houses, an unusual move. The jump in value \u2014 and taxes \u2014 incited lower-income homeowners, who saw it as an unfair blunt-force tool.But Richard Petree, a consultant hired to help Marfa comply with the state law, said the new classifications were merely a reflection of what\u2019s been going on for years with adobe. \u201cIt\u2019s a very unique market,\u201d he said.While the adobe homes in Marfa are now yielding more tax dollars for Presidio County, the local schools can\u2019t expect any windfall. Despite the living conditions of many of its 350 schoolchildren, the Marfa district is now considered \u201crich\u201d by Texas standards because of the new tax revenue, and thus must refund more than $400,000 to the state for use in districts with less money.In many respects, even the hardest-hit homeowners recognize that Marfa\u2019s transformation has paid dividends. Thanks to all those visitors and retirees, it has a thriving economy for a small town. According to Census Bureau figures, its median household income, $44,107, exceeds that of the nearest major city, El Paso, about 200 miles away, and is nearly double that of Presidio, a town 60 miles to the south, on the Mexican border.\u201cThere\u2019s always something to do in Marfa,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for that. Donald Judd brought money to Marfa.\u201dMr. Martinez once made adobe bricks while working on a construction project at the Capri, a bar and restaurant that serves craft cocktails and small plates.\u201cPeople used to joke, \u2018Sam is from Marfa but now he can\u2019t even afford to live in it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Martinez said.But now, he said, it\u2019s true: His taxes have gone up from $678 in 2016 to $967 this year, and with $4,000 in back taxes due, he has put his family\u2019s three-bedroom home on the market for $150,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York and Washington are leaving the rest of the country behind. Companies like Amazon explain why.In the end, even Amazon has behaved according to this rule: In the modern tech economy, cities that already have wealth, opportunity, highly educated workers and high salaries will just keep attracting more of them.\u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely hard-wired into technology economies,\u201d said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a sort of interesting thing that happens \u2014 it\u2019s inherent to the technology.\u201d \u201cThis is a very rational decision for Amazon to make in the micro; in the macro, it reinforces a really challenging trend for the U.S. economy,\u201d said John Lettieri, the president of E.I.G. \u201cThe divide between prosperous and distressed regions is growing wider. And it\u2019s because of things like this.\u201dIn previous economic expansions, E.I.G. has found, the benefits were more broadly felt, and growth was driven by more places, including rural communities. Today, data points about the national economy no longer describe well what\u2019s happening on the ground in many places. Part of what has changed is that the American economy has become dominated more by companies like Amazon, which produce services instead of manufactured products, and thus employ software engineers instead of assembly line workers. \u201cIf you are in the business of making new things \u2014 whether it\u2019s a new product, or a new way of delivering things, or a new service \u2014 and it\u2019s something that is unique, and it keeps changing and it needs updating, the most important factor of all is human capital,\u201d said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s not like making soap, or like making textiles.\u201dIn its request for proposals, Amazon asked for good airport connections, public transit and strong universities. But it\u2019s not quite right to say that New York and Washington will probably win because they have these things. Rather, the presence of these amenities makes possible what Amazon was really looking for: that intangible thing that happens when certain kinds of workers are clustered in the same place.\u201cThis is too profound a structural shift to reverse,\u201d Mr. Lettieri said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to reverse. That\u2019s just the nature of the economy today.\u201d But maybe we can slow down this shift, he said, or find better ways to ensure that more people get to benefit from what\u2019s happening in superstar cities, and that more places get to join in this process. Mr. Lettieri argues that what\u2019s good for New York doesn\u2019t have to be bad for other parts of the country.It plainly looks that way in Amazon\u2019s case, however, because of the public sweepstakes the company invited. These 50,000 jobs that look likely to go to New York and Washington are 50,000 jobs that won\u2019t go to smaller finalists like Columbus or Nashville. Or to even smaller places, like Tucson or Fresno, that dropped out of the running months ago.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Trade Adviser Warns That There Will Be No Quick Deal With China", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, lashed out at Beijing just ahead of a meeting between President Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, predicting that Mr. Trump would have the \u201ccourage\u201d to reject a bad trade deal with China.Mr. Navarro, a blunt populist who has long held unsparing views about China\u2019s rise, suggested that reaching a trade deal would be more difficult than Mr. Trump\u2019s recent comments would indicate, despite the intervention of Wall Street executives who have urged the president to repair relations quickly.Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump are scheduled to meet in Buenos Aires this month during the Group of 20 conference, and the trade dispute is expected to be a central topic. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that China wants to make a deal, and on Wednesday he said he was also hoping to reach an agreement with Beijing.\u201cWe\u2019re going to try and make a deal with China because I want to have great relationships with President Xi, as I do, and also with China,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference.Inside the White House, Mr. Navarro\u2019s broadside was seen as an effort to fend off more moderate trade advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who are trying to soften the president\u2019s stance toward China during the G-20. Mr. Navarro\u2019s remarks contrasted sharply with Mr. Trump\u2019s more upbeat assessment last week, when he told reporters at the White House that he was \u201cgetting much closer to doing something\u201d with China.\u201cThey want to get us to the bargaining table, sound reasonable, talk their way and have their way with us,\u201d Mr. Navarro said of China\u2019s trade negotiators, speaking without notes before an audience at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.\u201cThe biggest problem,\u201d he added, \u201cis the trust issues.\u201dMr. Navarro has privately expressed exasperation at the access to Mr. Trump enjoyed by Wall Street executives \u2014 whom he terms \u201cglobalists\u201d \u2014 like Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group, one of the world\u2019s biggest private equity investment firms. Mr. Schwarzman, who speaks with the president frequently on economic matters, has advised Mr. Trump to show restraint with China.\u201cIf there is a deal \u2014 if and when there is a deal \u2014 it will be on President Donald J. Trump\u2019s terms. Not Wall Street terms,\u201d Mr. Navarro said in his speech on Friday. \u201cIf Wall Street is involved and continues to insinuate itself into these negotiations, there will be a stench around any deal that\u2019s consummated because it will have the imprimatur of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street.\u201dTwo White House advisers said that Mr. Navarro was not expressing the president\u2019s views but his own. He did not inform Mr. Mnuchin or Larry Kudlow, who succeeded Mr. Cohn as director of the economic council, that he planned to speak, they said.Mr. Navarro said during the speech that negotiating the trade deal with China was \u201cnot my lane\u201d and that the responsibility would fall to Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative.But the two are largely in lock step when it comes to China, and Mr. Lighthizer is pessimistic about the prospects of reaching a significant new deal with Chinese negotiators in Argentina, according to officials with direct knowledge of his views.At a summit meeting in Washington on Friday, Yang Jiechi, a top Chinese foreign policy official, said the United States and China needed to resolve the trade conflict soon rather than escalate it.\u201cA trade war, instead of leading to any solution, will only end up hurting both sides and a global economy,\u201d Mr. Yang said at a news conference.Mr. Yang and the Chinese defense minister, Wei Fenghe, were in town to meet with Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, as part of a regular dialogue that had been established by the presidents of the two nations.American business leaders, who have been watching the China talks nervously from the sidelines, have urged the White House to approach the Buenos Aires meeting with an open mind.\u201cIt\u2019s constructive to have both sides talking,\u201d said Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents 200 American companies that do business with China.\u201cIf Beijing has something substantive to offer, we should be willing to negotiate.

{"Headline": "The Democrats\u2019 Next Job: Bury Supply-Side Economics", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVoters don\u2019t like Republican policies, but conservatives win by spinning a good story about economics. Liberals need to do the same.Contributing Opinion WriterWin, lose or draw on Tuesday, the Democratic Party will almost immediately turn its focus to the next presidential election and the fight between the establishment center and the left wing. But while the Democrats have that argument, they must also undertake the far more important task of thinking about what they agree on, and how they can construct a story about how the economy works and grows and spreads prosperity, a story that competes with \u2014 and defeats \u2014 the Republicans\u2019 own narrative.For 40 years, with a few exceptions, Democrats have utterly failed to do so. Until they fix this, they will lose economic arguments to the Republicans \u2014 even though majorities disagree with the Republicans on many questions \u2014 because every economic debate will proceed from Republican assumptions that make it all but impossible for Democrats to argue their case forcefully.Republicans have a theory and a story about how the economy grows. You know it as supply-side economics: Cutting taxes, especially on the rich, and decreasing regulation will unleash so much innovation and economic activity that tax revenues will actually increase and the entire economy will benefit.This has been the conservative story, which the right has elevated to veritable religion, for 30 or 40 years now. And the Democrats\u2019 alternative story is \u2026 what? If you\u2019re not recalling it, that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t one.The Democrats have impulses, they have beliefs, they even have principles. But they don\u2019t have a story to challenge the supply-side story and tell people about how the economy grows and helps everyone.They used to, once upon a time. It was called Keynesianism, or sometimes demand-side economics (which is why conservatives named their theory supply-side). Keynesianism \u2014 in a nutshell, government investment in public goods increase demand and prosperity \u2014 held sway from the 1940s through the 1970s, the greatest period of economic growth in history.Then came stagflation, which opened the door for the supply-siders. Democrats, by and large, stopped talking about theories. Their story was discredited, so the supply-siders said. Democrats stopped defending public investment, and they stopped defending government.They still defend particular investments that poll well, like infrastructure spending. And they defend specific programs when they know they\u2019re on safe ground, like Social Security and Medicare. And now that Obamacare, or at least the part about making insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions, is registering positive numbers, they\u2019re happy to defend it, as they should.But none of this amounts to an answer to supply-side economics. None of it creates an alternative story about how prosperity is spread.It seems to me that the Democrats\u2019 story has to be built around the simple idea of investing in middle- and working-class people. Not \u201cspending,\u201d but \u201cinvesting.\u201d Spending sounds profligate; investing sounds prudent.This is not to be done for reasons of \u201cfairness.\u201d That\u2019s an absolutely vital point. Liberals reflexively want to make economic arguments about fairness. But this persuades only liberals. People who aren\u2019t liberals \u2014 three-quarters of the country \u2014 don\u2019t especially care about fairness. They do, however, care about growth. So Democrats need to argue that these investments, not tax cuts for the rich, are the way to spur growth.Such an argument stands in direct contrast to the right\u2019s story. Republicans say the rich, with millions returned to them in the form of tax cuts, know best what to do with their money and the market can make the best decisions about investments and society\u2019s needs.It should be fairly easy for Democrats to say to Americans: Look around you. How has that worked out for you?So that\u2019s the easy half of the story \u2014 criticizing supply-side\u2019s failures. The harder half is making the affirmative case for the Democratic theory of growth.That\u2019s an argument that might appeal broadly, but it\u2019s backed up by a theory that in our time is practically seditious: that the public sector can make better decisions about where money should go than the private sector. That is a principle Democrats have been skittish about supporting. But it is one they must start defending without apology.They should defend it because it\u2019s what more and more economists argue and because it\u2019s what Democrats believe. There\u2019s a lot of ideological space between Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, who is among the most left-leaning members of the House. But they\u2019re both Democrats for a reason, and presumably that reason is they think government can be a force for good in people\u2019s lives. So, if Democrats think it, they should say it.And now we have arrived at an alternate theory, a story: Giving more money to working people and investing in their needs is how an economy grows. That\u2019s a direct counterargument to supply-side economics. If enough Democrats say it and say it and say it, they can drive a stake through supply-side\u2019s heart. Once Democrats can make that case, they\u2019ll be able to turn the tables on the supply-siders. Republicans will argue that government investments and wage increases are \u201cjob killers.\u201d But Democrats, rather than merely appealing to people\u2019s consciences, will be able to respond that government investments and wage increases are growth producers that will spread benefits well beyond the top 5 percent or 10 percent.The important thing is the idea. Democrats must persuade America that there\u2019s a better way to expand the economy than the way Republicans have been advocating for decades. Just as inflation and other ills opened the door for critiques of Keynesianism in the 1970s, so have inequality and disinvestment done the same for critiques of supply-side today. Someone just has to make them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Starving Babies, Molotov Cocktails and Death Threats: One Photojournalist\u2019s Venezuelan Reality", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderMeridith Kohut, an American photographer who frequently freelances for The Times, feels \u201ca moral obligation to stay\u201d and bear witness to the horrors of Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse.If you know anything about the crisis in Venezuela, you\u2019ve most likely seen the work of Meridith Kohut, an independent photojournalist based in Caracas.This month Meridith, 35, was one of four female journalists around the world to be honored by the International Women\u2019s Media Foundation with a Courage in Journalism Award. In a recent interview, she spoke about the challenges of reporting in Venezuela, the global resonance of her work and what she wishes readers knew.What drew you to photojournalism?Ever since I was really young, I was fascinated by photography and social justice. I was constantly the kid who was questioning authority and challenging rules. In high school I started shooting for our local paper, and then at university I studied photojournalism. How did you become interested in Latin America?I\u2019m from Texas, and Latin American culture is a part of life there. Growing up, I had friends who were immigrants. I also studied Spanish in high school and university. When I was a broke student in college, I began taking buses to Mexico and Central America and built my portfolio with stories about Latin America. Why did you go to Venezuela?I moved to Venezuela a few months after graduating from college. I was fascinated by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and went to cover the socialist revolution. My plan was to go for a few months. Then a year turned into a few years, and now I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m still here.Is there one photo essay you\u2019ve done that stands out in your memory?I had been in Venezuela for 10 years, so I had witnessed the rise and fall of the revolution. I\u2019d seen the entire crisis unfold. For years people covered it as bread lines and protests, but no one had reported that people were dying from it. I spent five months going around the country to report the story with Isayen Herrera, a Venezuelan journalist. It was incredibly hard. We had to work with doctors to give us information and put us in contact with families whose babies were dying. We went to babies\u2019 funerals. We photographed young boys who had left home and joined street gangs because they didn\u2019t have food. Our story comprehensively documented the malnutrition and how difficult it was for Venezuelans to access food. It was on the front page and went completely viral, changing how the world viewed the severity of the crisis.Have you faced repercussions in Venezuela for your work?State television has called me a C.I.A. operative who is trying to destabilize the revolution. Intelligence services have even falsely accused me of stealing babies and harvesting their organs to sell on the black market; they threatened to put me in prison for life for it.What keeps you in the country after everything you\u2019ve experienced?The good thing about being in Venezuela for so long is that I have residency. The government has cracked down on the press since the crisis began, so I\u2019m one of the few foreign journalists left in the country. I feel a moral obligation to stay because I have the perfect trifecta: the legal ability to work here, the resources of The Times to do in-depth stories and a large platform for people to see our reporting. How do you maintain enough emotional distance from your subjects to do your work effectively?A lot of journalists talk about needing to withdraw emotionally to get the job done, but I feel the opposite. I don\u2019t try to limit my emotions when I\u2019m in the field. I do the reverse and try to put myself in the people\u2019s shoes and feel everything they\u2019re feeling. Do you ever get desensitized to the horrors you witness?If you can see what we\u2019ve witnessed in Venezuela and not be affected emotionally, I think you\u2019re in the wrong profession. You have to be able to sympathize with the people you\u2019re documenting. You have to be sensitive to their feelings and to the extraordinary circumstances they\u2019re living under. For certain stories, especially when I saw babies die and watched how their parents struggled, this was overwhelming. Sometimes my face was soaked because I was crying so much. But I can still take pictures; I can still do my job. If anything, when the families knew that I cared enough to be upset about their child, we became closer. I think if I were there as a numb, cold observer, it would have been less natural. I don\u2019t suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or struggle with the emotional weight. I think a big reason I\u2019m able to handle everything is because I process it in the moment. I\u2019m channeling the emotions into the work.How do you weigh the danger of your job?We\u2019re constantly at risk, but it\u2019s all calculated. We spend a lot of time with The Times\u2019s security team and with editors planning logistics down to the most minute detail so that we\u2019re taking the most reduced risk possible.Is there anything you wish readers knew about what goes into your work?The biggest thing that I would love for readers to know is how much the people in our stories are sacrificing by putting their security, jobs and families at risk. Yes, it takes courage to report something that the government wants hidden. But it takes much more courage to be the person quoted or the person who lets you document intimate, painful moments of suffering. It\u2019s incredibly selfless and brave for people to say, \u201cYes, I will be the face, the family who represents the struggle of so many other Venezuelans.\u201dHave you ever felt disadvantaged for being a woman in your profession?Absolutely. I\u2019m constantly underestimated in the field. That used to frustrate me, but I use it to my advantage now. Soldiers see me as nonthreatening because I\u2019m a woman, so I can sneak past them with more ease than my male colleagues. How is the #MeToo movement reshaping photojournalism?I\u2019ve dealt with being discriminated against for being a woman throughout my career. Every single one of my friends who are women photojournalists has also dealt with discrimination, and it\u2019s past due that we\u2019re having these conversations. There\u2019s still a lot of work to do because the number of women in photojournalism is dismal \u2014 the glass ceiling is still firmly intact.What issues do you want to tackle next?Things are getting worse in Venezuela, and people have lost hope. Thousands flee to neighboring countries every day, so I\u2019m focused on documenting the growing migration crisis.What is the biggest personal takeaway from your work?Documenting the crisis has renewed my faith in the power of journalism, especially right now as journalists are attacked, doubted and questioned for the role they play in society. We uncovered truths that the Venezuelan government wanted hidden and told them to the world. International organizations and diplomats got involved in Venezuela, and the donations sent to help Venezuelans were overwhelming. People know what\u2019s going on with the crisis because of journalists. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Hiatus, China Accelerates Cyberspying Efforts to Obtain U.S. Technology", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Three years ago, President Barack Obama struck a deal with China that few thought was possible: President Xi Jinping agreed to end his nation\u2019s yearslong practice of breaking into the computer systems of American companies, military contractors and government agencies to obtain designs, technology and corporate secrets, usually on behalf of China\u2019s state-owned firms.The pact was celebrated by the Obama administration as one of the first arms-control agreements for cyberspace \u2014 and for 18 months or so, the number of Chinese attacks plummeted. But the victory was fleeting.Soon after President Trump took office, China\u2019s cyberespionage picked up again and, according to intelligence officials and analysts, accelerated in the last year as trade conflicts and other tensions began to poison relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies.The new operatives have intensified their focus on America\u2019s commercial and industrial prowess, and on technologies that the Chinese believe can give them a military advantage.\u201cWe have certainly seen the behavior change over the past year,\u201d said Rob Joyce, Mr. Trump\u2019s former White House cybercoordinator, speaking at the Aspen Cyber Summit in San Francisco this month.Mr. Trump and administration officials often suggest that all technology-acquisition efforts by China amount to theft. In doing so, they are blurring the line between stealing technology and negotiated deals in which corporations agree to transfer technology to Chinese manufacturing or marketing partners in return for access to China\u2019s market \u2014 a practice American companies often view as a form of corporate blackmail but one distinct from outright theft.The stealing of industrial designs and intellectual property \u2014 from blueprints for power plants or high-efficiency solar panels, or the F-35 fighter jet \u2014 is a long-running problem. The United States trade representative published a report this month detailing old and new examples. But the administration has never said whether cracking down on theft and cyberattacks is part of the negotiations or simply a demand that China cease activity that Beijing has already acknowledged, in the Obama years, was illegitimate.Whatever the reason for the renewed hacking, it is a cautionary tale as Mr. Trump tries to use tariffs and threats of more restrictions to strike a new trade deal with Mr. Xi, one that presumably would address, once again, the Chinese practices that Mr. Obama thought he had halted.American trade and intelligence officials, as well as experts from private cybersecurity firms, all acknowledged that the previous agreement had completely fallen apart.And that, they agreed, has made it still more difficult to imagine how any new agreement struck between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would become a permanent solution to a problem that reaches back years, and seems rooted in completely different views of what constitutes reasonable competition.\u201cOur two systems are so dissimilar that I think there was never real hope that crafting an agreement like this would last that long anyway,\u201d said Matthew Brazil, a former government official who now runs Madeira Security Consulting, a firm in San Jose, Calif.Why the espionage has spiked again is a matter of debate. Some officials and analysts call it a cause of the worsening trade relationships, others a symptom. Still others argued that the tightening of American export controls in critical industries like aerospace and rules on Chinese investment in Silicon Valley \u2014 which China sees as part of a \u201ccontainment\u201d strategy to blunt its industrial and geopolitical rise \u2014 has led the Chinese once again to try to steal what they cannot buy.The impetus for the 2015 accord was one of the most blatant espionage operations ever conducted by the Chinese government: the removal, over a period of more than a year, of 22 million security-clearance files on American officials, military personnel, contractors and American intelligence officers.The Obama administration, partly out of embarrassment, said little about the breach, never naming the Chinese publicly \u2014 except by mistake when the director of national intelligence blurted out the truth.Privately, American intelligence officials concluded that the Chinese were assembling a giant database of who worked with whom, and on what, in the American national security sphere, and were applying \u201cbig data\u201d techniques to analyze the information. The C.I.A. could not move some officers to China, for fear their cover had been blown. Publicly, Obama administration officials offered millions of Americans credit protection for a few years in the wake of the data breach \u2014 as if Mr. Xi\u2019s agents were looking for credit card numbers.All that was forgotten after Mr. Obama left office. Mr. Trump has never referred publicly to the 2015 agreement.Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who is now a China analyst for the International Crisis Group, said that China had a fundamentally different understanding of what was acceptable in espionage. While the Central Intelligence Agency, say, would not act to help a private company gain a competitive advantage over a foreign competitor, he said, China\u2019s Communist Party, which has control over practically all aspects of policy there, would make no such distinction.\u201cIf you view economic growth as an existential pillar of your party\u2019s political legitimacy and in fact your national security, it follows that you would do anything possible to maintain that competitive edge,\u201d he said.Indeed, the latest spike in corporate espionage cases \u2014 including some not yet made public \u2014 has focused on industries critical to Mr. Xi\u2019s Made in China 2025 program.That is a plan to jump ahead of the United States and others in cutting-edge industries like aerospace, automation, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.\u201cWe are seeing it in high tech, in law firms, in insurance companies,\u201d said Dmitri Alperovitch, one of the founders of CrowdStrike, who early in his career was one of the first to identify the teams of state-run Chinese hackers aiming at the United States, and who tracked their retreat after the 2015 pledge.With the arrest of the intelligence officer in Belgium in October, the Trump administration claimed it had exposed what the assistant F.B.I. director, Bill Priestap, called \u201cthe Chinese government\u2019s direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States.\u201dThat case involves Xu Yanjun, a deputy division director in the Jiangsu branch of the Ministry of State Security, China\u2019s main intelligence agency.According to a secret criminal complaint filed in Ohio in March but not unsealed until October, Mr. Xu tried to recruit an employee of General Electric Aviation and entice him to provide proprietary information about jet fan blade designs.Instead the employee alerted the company, which went to the F.B.I. and organized a sting. Mr. Xu flew from China to Belgium in April on the hope he would be able to copy the employee\u2019s computer hard drive. He was arrested on April 1 when he arrived in Brussels and was extradited to the United States on Oct. 9, the day before the Justice Department made the case public.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the criminal case as \u201cpure fabrication,\u201d but it has neither confirmed nor denied that Mr. Xu was an intelligence officer. China\u2019s relatively muted reaction could be an effort to minimize attention on an embarrassing intelligence failure and leave room for quiet negotiations for an exchange.Mr. Xu\u2019s was the most high profile of several recent cases, including two others that had links to the Ministry of State Security\u2019s branch in Jiangsu Province, which extends north from Shanghai.The F.B.I. affidavit in the case said that Mr. Ji\u2019s handler \u2014 presumably Mr. Xu \u2014 had been arrested, allowing the bureau to send an undercover officer to meet the student in April. Mr. Ji, the affidavit said, had been recruited to gather background information about eight potential recruits for the Jiangsu branch.Mr. Xu, who went by at least two aliases, often claimed to represent the Jiangsu Association for International Science and Technology Cooperation and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, both based in the provincial capital, Nanjing.The reasons Jiangsu has become a hotbed of China\u2019s cyberespionage are not entirely clear, though it is an important manufacturing center, with many foreign investments, and is thus one of China\u2019s richest provinces.Another American criminal case of espionage in the same region of China was announced Oct. 30. The Justice Department accused two other intelligence officers from that branch, as well as five hackers and two employees of a French aerospace company in Suzhou. The target was Safran, which operates a joint venture, CFM International, that builds jet engines with General Electric.The hackers were accused of using a variety of sophisticated techniques and tools against the Suzhou plant, and against other companies. But as in the cases the Obama administration brought, the suspects are believed to still be in China and thus beyond the reach of American law enforcement.David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Steven Lee Myers from Beijing.Advertisement"}

We\u2019re constantly examining and re-examining our assistance programs.\u201dMr. Green pointed to a separate refugee movement, in Venezuela, as a crisis of historic proportions that his agency was trying to help address.As the economy in Venezuela has collapsed and inflation has risen sharply under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, two million to three million people have fled the country in recent years.\u201cThe consequences of this mass movement I think are serious,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cI think they\u2019ll have consequences for economies.

Mr. Mahairas is the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s New York Special Operations and Cyber Division, and Mr. Beshar is the general counsel of Marsh & McLennan.Fortunately, there are many steps that both the private and public sectors can take to reduce their dependence on sheer luck.Many water utilities still need to adopt \u201cdefense in depth\u201d\u00a0approaches that create multiple layers of security, instead of relying on passive defenses like antivirus software, email filters and firewalls. The post-air-gap environment requires constant scanning for anomalous network activity as well as rigorous patch management and security upgrades. Utilities need to segregate their consumer and industrial control networks as much as possible and develop contingency plans for operating water systems without computers.Device manufacturers also have a critical role to play by producing more secure hardware for monitoring and managing things like water pressure, leakage and chemical levels.\u00a0Many industrial internet-connected devices are built much like their consumer counterparts, like web-connected toasters and wearable health monitors. As a result, they have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a wide range of hackers, from hostile governments to sophisticated criminals. Devices often are too small to include the necessary security hardware, lack the computing power to host security software or can\u2019t be updated when flaws are discovered.Utilities also need more practical cybersecurity guidance from federal agencies, warnings that go beyond the typical bulletin identifying the kind of attack and its source. Depending on the threat, that guidance might be hardware instructions \u2014 like closing unused ports or using single-direction gateways that don\u2019t allow information to flow inward. Or it might point to organized phishing attacks and recommend specific filters for emails and attachments. The more utilities know about threats, the better their chances of defending themselves.Finally, utilities also need to trust the government channels available to them to report attacks. Robust cybersecurity depends on real-time updates about threats and tactics. So if one utility reports an attempted hack of a particular part of its system, utilities everywhere would know to how to fortify that portion of their network. In 2015, Congress gave companies legal protection to share sensitive customer data with the government when it relates to cyberthreats; only six companies have done so. But there is reason for optimism that this number will grow.

{"Headline": "Shetland Islands: Scenery, Sheep and Knitters Galore on Britain\u2019s Northern Tip", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "PursuitsShetland Wool Week is hailed as the worldwide mecca of knitting festivals. But the islands have a rich, complex history beyond that of the textiles industry.Supported byLast fall, just a few days into my trip to the Shetland Islands, the Scottish subarctic archipelago across the sea from Norway, I found myself on the top of a cliff face, peering through the fog at a huge rock in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The rock was topped with a spike of white: the Muckle Flugga lighthouse, built in 1854, a mind-boggling feat as the rock\u2019s cliff face juts straight up out of the roiling sea. In the early days of the lighthouse, our tour guide told us, men had to be hoisted by ropes around their arms to safely cross the gap between their boat and the landing area on the rock. At this most northerly point in the U.K, I felt a profound sense that I was very far from home.Before I left New York, the only thing I really knew about Shetland was that it is the birthplace of Fair Isle knitting (Fair Isle being the most remote of the islands), a technique of colorwork recognizable in traditional sweaters. What I found was a place with a complex history beyond that of the knitting industry, difficult to get to but well worth the journey.In Shetland, knitting is a tradition that goes back centuries and is embedded in the place\u2019s rich history. Sheep here outnumber people by 20 to 1, and inclement weather on the islands has encouraged the local sheep to grow a softer and lighter weight fiber that makes Shetland wool unique.For much of the 20th century the textile industry was an important element of Shetland\u2019s local economy; women farmers, before production was moved to factories, knitted the yokes of sweaters to be sent abroad while they walked to and from the fields.Today, knitters in Shetland are unambiguously celebrated for their vision and skill; frequent signs on the road advertise local designers whose homes double as shops.There are about 100 islands in Shetland, though only 16 are inhabited. To get to mainland Shetland, one either takes an overnight ferry or a small plane from Aberdeen, on the coast of Scotland (I took the ferry, a very memorable roller-coaster experience on the heaving sea that I\u2019m nonetheless not sure I want to experience again). Some of the smaller islands\u2019 municipal needs are taken care of from Lerwick on mainland Shetland, the islands\u2019s central port and biggest city (with a population of about 7,500), which is also where the hub of the festival is.Often when you curve around a bend in the road the view before you is breathtaking, and if you are driving a car you have to be careful not to drive right off the road. Cliffs drop precipitously just feet from the pavement; inlets have choppy waves (and, in summer, killer whales who pick off sleepy seals), enormous rocks jut up from the ocean just off the coast, and everywhere, roofs and boats and houses are painted cheerful colors that burst against the overcast sky.In the winter, there is a month of near-perpetual darkness, and in the summer, a month of continuous sunlight; the wind, I was told, is constant no matter the time of year, though at certain times it is known to gust harder, stronger, or more or less predictably (in September, the month I was there, the winds are known as \u201cthe Equinox gales\u201d).Considering the size of Shetland, Wool Week is incredibly vast and diverse. The program is eight full days, and each day features myriad classes and exhibitions, tours, gatherings, teas and lectures on nearly all of the islands; on a random day, I counted 54 different offerings.For such a small place, Shetland offers an incredible amount to attract visitors. In addition to the textile industry, visitors are drawn by archaeology \u2014 (there are ancient sites scattered all over the islands), by geology (the islands sit atop a network of tectonic plates and boast an array of ancient and volcanic rocks), by caving and kayaking, and by an enormous diversity of nesting seabirds (puffins, who nest there in the 100s of thousands in the summer, are a popular draw).Two of the nights we were there, there were sightings of the northern lights, ethereal streaks of color across the night sky. The main industry on Shetland is still fishing \u2014 primarily mackerel, herring and salmon farming \u2014 and more than 75 percent of Scotland\u2019s mussels are produced there.Getting there was a bit of a challenge \u2014 as with most everywhere on the islands, there are no street addresses, so one has to know the landmarks one is looking for, or pray that Google recognizes what you are searching for and can lead you to the correct dropped pin.Jamieson and Smith Shetland Wool BrokersLerwickmainlandJamieson\u2019s ofShetlandA970ScallowayCastleB9073Virdafjell Bedand BreakfastUradale FarmGulberwickNorth SeaDetail, below1 mileNorwayMuckle FluggaLighthousescotlandAberdeenbritainunstHermanessNationalNatureReserveireland250 milesyellOllaberry HallEshaness Lighthousemainlandshetland islandsDetail, topAtlantic OceanNorth Sea20 milesBy The New York TimesUradale Farm is actively trying to bring more of the native Shetland sheep back to Shetland \u2014 currently, of about 150,000 sheep on Shetland (compared to 25,000 people), less than 30,000 are native, though the native sheep are the ones most well-adapted to thrive on the islands.Ronnie decried the phasing out of native sheep \u2014 for many years, only white wool has been worth any money (white wool can be more easily dyed, and is considered more \u201cpure\u201d for no clear reason), though native sheep are traditionally black or brown (or \u201cmoorit\u201d). Asked whether he saw any change, he spoke about Wool Week and the bigger crowds it brings to the islands every year, all with interest in and passion for the native wool. \u201cYou\u2019re standing here, that\u2019s the change,\u201d he said. Before Wool Week started nine years ago, he said, the situation seemed quite desperate.After he talked, he brought us into his colorful home (a rainbow is painted on the ceiling) for tea and more homebakes, and spoke a bit more generally about the increased interest that Wool Week has brought to Shetland (he and his wife also then let us shop for wool in their living room). One of the organizers I spoke to said that Wool Week in 2017 brought in more than 700,000 pounds (or about $900,000) to the local economy, and that doesn\u2019t include all that was spent at local shops, restaurants, or B & Bs by the 600 attendees. In 2018, nearly 700 people made the trip, primarily from Europe, the United States and Canada, but also from many farther-flung places such as Australia, Japan, Egypt, Lebanon, Indonesia and Israel.Where is all of this attention coming from? The BBC series has helped, as has perhaps a general back-to-basics interest in those of us who feel increasingly distanced from a natural form of community in our modern world.One doesn\u2019t want to get too positive \u2014 nearly every person who shared with us the good news about a resurgence of interest in the knitting industry was also quick to share the difficulties their line of work still faces (the general demand is still for inexpensive, mass-produced white wool, and the market for handmade goods is still small and imperiled) \u2014 but standing on the shores of Shetland during Wool Week, a knitter can\u2019t help but feel optimistic, and a person can\u2019t help but feel swept away.Nellie Hermann is the author most recently of the novel \u201cThe Season of Migration,\u201d and is a fellow at The Institute for Ideas and Imagination in Paris.An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of the mystery writer who set a series of murder mysteries on the Shetland Islands.

{"Headline": "Acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker Once Criticized Supreme Court\u2019s Power", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, once espoused the view that the courts \u201care supposed to be the inferior branch\u201d and criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s power to review legislative and executive acts and declare them unconstitutional, the lifeblood of its existence as a coequal branch of government.\u201cThere are so many\u201d bad rulings, Mr. Whitaker said. \u201cI would start with the idea of Marbury v. Madison. That\u2019s probably a good place to start and the way it\u2019s looked at the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of constitutional issues.\u201dThough Democrats called on Mr. Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates conspired, the Justice Department has said he will supervise Mr. Mueller. Past statements suggest that Mr. Whitaker has already made up his mind that the investigation will fail to show that Mr. Trump or his advisers aided Russia\u2019s disruption.\u201cThere was interference by the Russians into the election, but that is not collusion with the campaign,\u201d he added, views that dovetailed with Mr. Trump\u2019s longstanding complaints about the investigation. \u201cThat\u2019s where the left seems to be just combining those two issues.\u201dWhile the Justice Department was treating Mr. Whitaker\u2019s installation as acting attorney general as a done deal, prominent legal experts insisted that it was unconstitutional. Justice Department officials have pointed to the Vacancies Reform Act, a law that Congress passed in 1998, which set out the procedures that Mr. Trump used to name Mr. Whitaker as acting attorney general without Senate confirmation.\u201cWe cannot tolerate such an evasion of the Constitution\u2019s very explicit, textually precise design,\u201d they wrote, adding, \u201cFor the president to install Mr. Whitaker as our chief law enforcement officer is to betray the entire structure of our charter document.\u201dOther aspects of Mr. Whitaker\u2019s record also came under sharper scrutiny on Thursday as Mr. Whitaker huddled with Justice Department officials in a lengthy briefing about its major cases and other activities.Mr. Hall said he interviewed Mr. Whitaker over the phone, writing down his answers. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment.Mr. Whitaker\u2019s criticism of Marbury aligned with the view of some conservatives that the 1803 case \u2014 or at least how it came to be interpreted \u2014 gave the courts too much power to strike down laws. But Mr. Whitaker also criticized famous decisions in which the Supreme Court declined to strike down laws that conservatives do not like, including 1930s cases involving President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal programs and the 2012 case in which the court declined to strike down President Barack Obama\u2019s health insurance law.He also criticized the Supreme Court for \u201call New Deal cases that were expansive of the federal government. Those would be bad. Then all the way up to the Affordable Care Act and the individual mandate.\u201dLaurence H. Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, said that Mr. Whitaker\u2019s expressed views of the Constitution and the role of the courts \u201care extreme and the overall picture he presents would have virtually no scholarly support\u201d and would be \u201cdestabilizing\u201d to society if he used the power of the attorney general to advance them.Simultaneously criticizing the Supreme Court\u2019s power of judicial review while criticizing cases where it declined to strike down laws regulating economic and health insurance matters was a sign of an \u201cinternally contradictory\u201d and \u201cignorant\u201d philosophy, Mr. Tribe said. Because the attorney general oversees decisions about which laws the Justice Department will defend and can decide which ones not to enforce, he said, Mr. Whitaker\u2019s views were likely to have faced sharp scrutiny even from Republicans in a confirmation hearing.\u201cHe seems to think much of the fabric of federal law that is part of our ordinary lives violates the Constitution of the United States to which he is evidently going to take an oath,\u201d Mr. Tribe said.\u201cWe need to do everything we can to repeal it, defund it, delay it \u2014 we need to do whatever it takes,\u201d Mr. Whitaker said of the Affordable Care Act in 2014.He also signaled opposition to abortion rights, saying that he believed \u201clife begins at conception,\u201d and to same-sex marriage rights, saying that \u201cit\u2019s traditionally been up to the churches and to God to define that.\u201d He expressed frustration that the Iowa Legislature had not pushed back against a State Supreme Court ruling in 2009 that permitted same-sex couples in Iowa to marry.Mr. Whitaker voiced a hard line on immigration, saying he did not believe in \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented immigrants who are already inside the country \u2014 he did not address the so-called Dreamers, or people brought to the United States as children \u2014 and talked about visiting the southwestern border while he was the United States attorney for the Southern District of Iowa during the second term of President George W. Bush.\u201cI was able to see what our border looks like and the fact it is under assault on a daily basis from people trying to bring illegal people and illegal drugs into our country,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do I think the solution is? We need to secure the border first and then look at ways to reform the system, whether that\u2019s getting rid of chain immigration,\u201d in which migrants trace the paths of relatives or others they know to come to the United States, \u201cor increasing the number of skilled-worker visas.\u201dHe indicated that he did not believe mass shootings justified more restrictive gun control laws, and said he believed the federal government should play no role in public education.\u201cThe Department of Education should be disbanded and the resources either returned to the taxpayers or put into the schools,\u201d he said. \u201cBureaucrats in Washington, D.C., shouldn\u2019t know how to better educate my kids than I do.\u201dOn the issue of climate change, Mr. Whitaker said he was \u201cnot a climate denier,\u201d but also said that while the globe may be warming and human activities may contribute, \u201cthe evidence is inconclusive\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s very small and it may be part of the natural warming or cooling of the planet.\u201d As a result, he said, he did not believe in regulations aimed at curbing carbon emissions that could \u201chamstring\u201d the American economy.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in big-government solutions to a problem that doesn\u2019t appear to be that significant or quite possibly isn\u2019t man-made,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of the special counsel.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market\u2019s Dangers Are Easier to See Now", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesProject ahead a year or two: It is much easier to make a case for a troubled stock market than for a booming one.Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, regularly tallies what he calls \u201cthe pros and cons\u201d of the stock market. I asked him for an informal update: He came up with 14 pros versus 22 cons.That abundance of negativity isn\u2019t intended as a quantitative assessment of the market\u2019s prospects, but it does give a rough sense of his view and, I think, of the perspective of many skittish investors.\u201cWe were bullish for a long time, but right now I\u2019d say I\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a time to be cautious.\u201dI also asked James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in Minneapolis, for his sense of the market. An economist, Mr. Paulsen is worried about stocks because he is worried about the economy, he said. While the United States is not in a recession now, he said, \u201cwe have moved into the ballpark of a recession.\u201d\u201cIt gets somewhat easy, with a little experience, to recognize when you\u2019re in the ballpark of a recession,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThat is where we are now, and that alone is quite a bit of information.\u201dGiven his current outlook, which is that the probability of a recession within two years is reasonably high though not certain, \u201cthis is a good moment to take a little risk out of your portfolio, just in case things turn down,\u201d he said.The stock market, Mr. Paulsen said, often moves in advance of a recession \u2014 and a declining market can help cause a recession \u2014 making investment timing extremely difficult now. In this dangerous environment, he said, \u201cright now, I\u2019d be a little careful.\u201dMr. Hickey, too, advises caution, because when he enumerates the pros and cons for the market, the positive side is scanty. It includes factors like these:\u25a0 The yield curve \u2014 the difference between long- and short-term interest rates \u2014 remains in a bullish zone, although that positive margin has been narrowing and bears close watching.\u25a0 Finally, there is already so much bad news about the stock market that it amounts to good news. According to contrarian logic, Mr. Hickey said, the negatives are baked into stock prices, so the market has room to rise.That last item may be a stretch. It is an indication, he said, that he is having difficulty being upbeat.The stock market negatives on Mr. Hickey\u2019s list, by contrast, are straightforward. A sampling includes these items:\u25a0 The trend of stock prices has been quite negative. While a string of strong days could turn that around, momentum is bearish.\u25a0 Despite Mr. Powell\u2019s latest comments, the Fed is still tightening monetary policy, which could easily derail the stock market and the economy.\u25a0 The fiscal stimulus provided by the tax cut is, increasingly, behind us. Combined with tighter monetary policy, the loss of fiscal stimulus could hurt the American economy.\u25a0 Tariffs have been rising, and business sentiment has been depressed by the prospect of widening trade wars.\u25a0 Global economic growth has been slowing, and many stock markets around the world are already in bear market territory.\u25a0 The domestic housing market has weakened, homebuilder stocks have plunged, commodity prices have fallen, and auto sales are relatively weak.\u25a0 The tech sector, which propelled the market higher earlier in the year, has now lost hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Because of the importance of stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Apple, the psychological \u201cimpact of their weakness can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d Mr. Hickey said.\u25a0 Corporate debt levels are high, creating new vulnerabilities.\u25a0 The rate of earnings growth is likely to decline. That could disappoint Wall Street analysts and shake up the market.And that\u2019s just a start. The negatives go on and on.Yet even despite these portents, a gloomy financial outlook may not be entirely appropriate. For example, neither Mr. Hickey nor Mr. Paulsen is confident that the bull market is over or that a recession is likely to arrive soon.\u201cThere could be another strong bull run,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a good sense of that until at least the end of the year.\u201dI asked Mr. Paulsen to make the strongest case he reasonably could for upbeat economic and market outcomes for the next two years. In response, he said it was possible that the Fed would soften its monetary policy enough to extend the economic recovery and bolster the stock market. If the economy keeps growing and corporate earnings keep rising, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks will rise, too.The odd conditions of 2018 have already made stock valuations more attractive. Because prices have been flat while earnings have risen, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has declined to about 18, from about 23.5 in January, he pointed out.If that trend continues, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks might become rather enticing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go into a recession and if interest rates don\u2019t rise too much, at some point stocks could look good enough to set off another bull run,\u201d he said.But he added that he wouldn\u2019t bet on it with money needed to pay the bills in the next couple of years.After a nearly 10-year bull run, the downside of the market is becoming increasingly obvious.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Backlash From 2008 Is on the Ballot in 2018 ", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Obama\u2019s era, democracy done in good faith struggled. For his demagoguing opponents, that remains the whole point. Mr. Suskind is a journalist and author.Ten years ago yesterday, 240,000 spectators nestled in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park and millions tuning in worldwide huddled together and watched a lithe, elegant African-American man stroll victoriously across a shimmering stage with his beautiful young family to accept the challenge of leading the free world. He opened his speech wryly asking, \u201cIf there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.\u201dPeople wept. Some of them against their will, watching their television screens in Red America. His opponent John McCain made a gracious concession. Celebrations broke out in cities and on college campuses. They danced in the streets of foreign capitals. There was talk in prestigious editorial pages of a post-racial America. I wrote a gushy piece about the start of the \u201cObama Era\u201d for The New York Times Magazine. People of all political persuasions cheered his historic, confetti-strewn election.We were still a nation that could keep its promises \u2014 its biggest ones. Before us stood the indisputable evidence. In the midst of two wars and a crashing economy, America sure felt great, again.Few then were thinking of the word \u201cbacklash.\u201dA decade later, there\u2019s consensus that the seeds of one were planted that night and watered into bitter harvest as the first black president was in power. There is now also indisputable proof, a historical reminder, that any forceful action carries with it an equal and opposite reaction, especially in public life.Now, as a former president and star guest on the midterm campaign trail, Mr. Obama himself makes this rationalization. \u201cFor every two steps of progressive change, we often take one step back in conservative retrenchment,\u201d he told the crowd at a Democratic rally in Florida on Friday.The blows came \u2014 his very presence drew virulent attack \u2014 but not his counterpunches, even when fighting more fiercely and wielding power with impunity might have been in order. The economy, for instance, was structurally in shambles and he relied on men who\u2019d faultily built it to put it back together again.Wall Street\u2019s elite, clearly guilty of systemic self-dealing that amplified the disaster, was on its knees, but instead of \u201cOld Testament justice,\u201d Mr. Obama slyly offered to stand between Wall Street and \u201cthe pitchforks,\u201d a perilous stance of enormous political cost from which he extracted no concessions. He assessed policy by what he called \u201cHippocratic risk\u201d \u2014 a \u201cfirst, do no harm\u201d tact that was civilized, conflict-light and let the banks \u201cearn their way back to health.\u201d And they sure did, with billions of zero-interest funds from the Fed, while homeowners suffered. The economy began to recover. Business as usual resumed. But a Rooseveltian moment to create fundamental change had passed.While he left office accomplished and popular, he failed to fulfill the core dictum of reversing the Reagan drumbeat of government as problem not solution. Now, rather than a careful professor, a reckless bully owns Washington \u2014 a lover of backlash, the embodiment of it. Courting it with every tweet and maneuver, like a matador waving his red cape before the crowd. And civility is at a nadir, buried. Mr. Obama was a believer in our constitutional construct of balance, \u201cthat ambition must be made to counteract ambition,\u201d as Madison wrote. But there needs to be enough ambition connected to compromise in order for it to be productive.Across decades, that\u2019s what allowed old bulls like Utah\u2019s conservative Republican Senator Orrin Hatch to fight fiercely with liberal icons like Ted Kennedy \u2014 often in the process of creating strong legislation, for which both received credit \u2014 and then grab dinner to rehash. They both talked endlessly of those post-vote fetes, as though they were a couple making up. When partisans won\u2019t allow their elected agents to do that anymore, the system collapses, grievance doesn\u2019t get redressed and people start calling for power to be exercised on their behalf by any means necessary.Both lovers and haters of President Trump share his belief that the process of self-governance \u2014 which Mr. Obama haltingly attempted to restore \u2014 is busted, and maybe irreparably. At the rally in Florida on Friday, Mr. Obama cried out, \"When words don\u2019t mean anything, when truth doesn\u2019t matter, when people can just lie with abandon, democracy can\u2019t work!\"President Trump, if he ever decided to give the audience a truthful aside, would most likely agree with his predecessor \u2014 except, for him, the dysfunction is the point, fertile ground for personality-based, one-man rule.\u201cYou know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so that when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you,\u201d he told the veteran TV journalist Lesley Stahl when privately asked about his attacks on the press.His very wager is that believers in liberal democracy \u2014 in an informed electorate, in representative democracy and in the rule of law \u2014 aren\u2019t as strong as they think. You can hear the dare at his rallies: Go ahead, here\u2019s my chin. Hit me with your best shot. That\u2019s all you got?But all backlashes face their own referendums. Mr. Obama, for his part, has told voters, \u201cThe character of the country is on the ballot.\u201d But these midterms are also a gauge of the Obama legacy, a test of whether the capital of fear currently driving change is stronger than the audacity of hope, of whether that night a decade ago in Grant Park was a glimpse of bold possibility, yet unfulfilled, or the predicate to a coming darkness that could envelop the nation\u2019s very foundations.By nightfall Tuesday, we\u2019ll all know.Ron Suskind is the author of six books, including \u201cConfidence Men, Wall Street, Washington and the Education of a President.\u201d He won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for feature writing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dangerous Na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Trump and Xi ", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States and China may be on a collision course yet their presidents each underestimate the pain the other could inflict. Opinion ColumnistPresidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are a bit alike, and that presents a danger to the global order.The American and Chinese leaders are both impetuous, authoritarian and overconfident nationalists, and each appears to underestimate the other side\u2019s capacity to inflict pain. This dangerous symmetry leaves the two sides hurtling toward each other.The 10 percent tariffs already imposed in the trade war are scheduled to rise to 25 percent in January, but there\u2019s also a broader confrontation emerging.Trump and Xi may well be able to reach a cease-fire in their trade war when they meet for the Group of 20 in two weeks. Even if a deal is reached, though, it may be only a temporary respite that doesn\u2019t alter the dynamic of two great nations increasingly on a collision course.Each side miscalculates by seeing the other as likely to give in. China perceives a wild man in the White House who talks big but who ultimately climbed down off his high horse on trade with Europe. Beijing doesn\u2019t seem to realize that Trump\u2019s challenge to China arises from core beliefs and reflects a broad disillusionment with China in the United States.I\u2019m an example of that. I studied Chinese and lived for five years in China; my wife and I wrote a largely upbeat book about the country\u2019s prospects called \u201cChina Wakes.\u201d But Xi has damaged China\u2019s brand just as Trump has damaged America\u2019s, and today it\u2019s hard to find either Democrats or Republicans eager to speak up for China.Chinese tourism to the U.S. can slow, students can be directed to Australian universities over American ones and rare earth minerals needed by American companies may develop shortages. China can further ease sanctions on North Korea, buy more oil from Iran or become more aggressive in the South China Sea. It can cancel Chinese trademarks owned by Ivanka Trump \u2014 that might get the president\u2019s attention \u2014 and it can dump U.S. Treasury bonds.Trump is right (I can\u2019t believe I just wrote those three words!) that China has not played fair. The best response would have been to work with allies to pressure China simultaneously from all sides; instead, Trump antagonized allies so that we are fighting this battle alone.Why have I and so many others soured on China?This is larger than Trump and Xi. China\u2019s admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 was meant to integrate the country into the global trading system as an increasingly responsible world power. But after moving mostly in the right direction under Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, China stalled under Hu Jintao and has moved backward under Xi.China has stolen technology and intellectual property even as it has become more aggressive militarily in the South China Sea and curbed freedom at home. Xi offends global values by detaining more than one million Muslims in the Xinjiang region, arresting lawyers and Christians, and steadily squeezing out space for free thought. I used to report from China each year but now find the limits on a journalist visa so onerous that it\u2019s not worthwhile. And I\u2019m supposed to be the lao pengyou, or old friend, of China.There are other grounds for American concern about China\u2019s irresponsibility that haven\u2019t received much attention: I estimate that around 20,000 Americans die each year from overdoses of drugs originating from traffickers in China. In particular, two-thirds or more of America's fentanyl, a synthetic opioid far more lethal than heroin, appears to come from China.In fairness, China has made some efforts to crack down on the drug trade, but this hasn\u2019t been a priority so long as the traffickers mostly export their fentanyl rather than sell it at home. If the Chinese government pursued drug smugglers the way it crushes dissident Christians, labor activists, lawyers or feminists, those drug exports would end.America\u2019s business executives used to be strong supporters of a pro-China policy, but they, too, have cooled. Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, has long been a vigorous advocate of close ties with China, so I was struck by a sober warning he gave to the Asia Society in New York the other day.\u201cEconomic tensions are reaching a breaking point,\u201d Paulson cautioned in his speech. He concluded, and I think he\u2019s right, that if the U.S. and China don\u2019t resolve their problems, the world will face \u201ca systemic risk of monumental proportions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reimposing Iran Sanctions, Trump Places 3 Bets (One a Long Shot)", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 As the United States reimposes severe economic sanctions on Iran early Monday, President Trump is placing a series of bets that he can not only change Iran\u2019s behavior, but also use American economic power to bludgeon reluctant allies into joining him.And finally, he is wagering that the Iranian government will crack in some way \u2014 that it will renegotiate the nuclear deal more along Mr. Trump\u2019s terms, or that it will collapse under economic pressures that have sent the country\u2019s exports and currency into a tailspin.\u201cWe want to restore democracy there,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week, walking just to the edge of declaring that regime change is the goal. \u201cWe think the Iranian people want that same thing.\u201dMany outside experts who have dealt with Iran over the decades say they believe that Mr. Trump may succeed at his first two bets, but fail on cracking the government of President Hassan Rouhani.\u201cIran\u2019s oil production is down, its revenues are down, and the country is more isolated than it was\u201d before Mr. Trump withdrew from the deal, said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former State Department and National Security Council official under several Republican presidents.\u201cBut there is nothing about the history of sanctions that suggests they can coerce any country into doing something big and dramatic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is a government that is unlikely to want to be seen as being coerced. That goes against the DNA of the Iranian revolution.\u201dCoercion, of course, is the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to allies and adversaries alike. In this case, the sanctions are the culmination of a vow Mr. Trump made during the 2016 campaign, when he repeatedly declared that he would scrap a \u201chorrible\u201d agreement with Iran, a line that always drew cheers. Today, Mr. Trump lists the declaration as one of his \u201cpromises kept.\u201dThe Europeans, Chinese and Russians \u2014 the other signatories to the deal \u2014 have vowed not to follow the United States in renouncing it, and the Europeans say they are moving toward a barter system that would enable them to buy Iranian oil without doing business in dollars and defying the sanctions.As the Europeans maneuver, Mr. Trump is clearly enjoying causing them pain. He announced in May that he was leaving the accord over the protest of European leaders, including Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. The Europeans thought until hours before the announcement that they were moving toward a new approach to keep the accord in place and negotiate additional agreements with Tehran to limit missile tests and support for terrorist groups.While Mr. Trump is expected to issue exemptions to China, India, Japan, South Korea and Iraq, among others, allowing them to continue buying Iranian oil for a limited time, the closest European allies will be given no such leeway.On Friday, Mr. Trump tweeted out a takeoff on a poster for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d picturing him in the lead role and superimposing the words \u201cSanctions Are Coming\u201d across his chest. It was a play on the \u201cWinter Is Coming\u201d teaser by the popular HBO series. (\u201cWe were not aware of this messaging,\u201d HBO said in a statement, \u201cand would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes.)It is unclear whether Mr. Trump will completely succeed at bringing winter to the Iranian economy, but he is off to a strong start. An economy that was expanding early in the year is now expected to slip into recession.But Iranian officials have insisted that they plan to stick to the deal that they negotiated with former Secretary of State John Kerry in Vienna in the summer of 2015, agreeing to a 15-year hiatus in their ability to produce significant amounts of nuclear fuel.In a meeting with reporters in September in New York, Mr. Rouhani declared that \u201cthe United States is not capable of bringing our oil exports to zero,\u201d and suggested that he would brush off the sanctions. Whether that restraint continues, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in New York last month, is \u201cdependent on a series of future judgments.\u201dAnother one of Mr. Trump\u2019s bets is also paying off: While governments are declaring that they will stick with Iran while it sticks with the deal, companies are fleeing. Boeing has canceled a $20 billion deal struck after the 2015 nuclear agreement to deliver aircraft to Iran\u2019s decrepit fleet; the French oil giant Total S.A. has said it will not go through with a lucrative contract to develop oil fields; and Maersk, the shipping giant, is stopping its movement of Iranian goods.The contrast with three years ago is stark: Mr. Kerry traveled to Europe after the deal was reached to urge European companies to engage with Iran so that the nation would feel the benefits of giving up 97 percent of its uranium stockpile and dismantling uranium and plutonium production facilities.But even with the sanctions fully in place on Monday, it is far from clear that Iran will move to renegotiate the deal with the United States. Mr. Rouhani insisted during his visit to New York that the United States would first have to come back into compliance with the nuclear deal.For his part, Mr. Trump will have to navigate two other major hurdles. The first is justifying the growing pressure on Iran when the major ally it is depending on to contain that country, Saudi Arabia, is admitting that a 15-member hit squad killed the dissident Jamal Khashoggi and so far refusing to stop its bombing in Yemen.Mr. Pompeo has vowed to follow the Khashoggi investigation wherever it goes, but American diplomats note that he has refused to call the killing an act of terrorism. Iran gets different treatment: On Sunday, Mr. Pompeo accused Iran of plotting assassinations in Europe as part of his claim that the country is the largest exporter of terrorism.Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest long-term challenge may be explaining how he can invoke new sanctions on Iran \u2014 which the International Atomic Energy Agency has declared is abiding by its commitments to halt nuclear production \u2014 while declaring that North Korea is \u201cno longer a nuclear threat.\u201dUnlike Iran, the North already has nuclear weapons, and by the account of American intelligence agencies is continuing to produce them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Housing Market Is Slumping Despite a Booming Economy", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHome prices are out of reach relative to incomes and mortgage rates. The big question for the economy is how the imbalance adjusts. These should be happy times for the housing sector. The economy is booming, with more people working at higher pay, and with the sizable millennial generation reaching prime home buying age.Given how central housing is to the broader economy \u2014 it is the biggest driver of both wealth and indebtedness for most families, and its fluctuations have frequently been major factors in past booms and busts \u2014 this slump isn\u2019t something to be taken lightly for anyone hoping the good times will last.So what\u2019s going on?When you look closely at the data, it appears this paradox of a strong economy and a weak housing market is, at its core, an illustration of a fundamental rule in economics: If something can\u2019t go on forever, it won\u2019t.Home prices in a given location are ultimately tethered to the incomes of the people who either live there or want to. But for much of the last six years, that relationship has come undone.The gap is even larger in the big coastal cities with high wages and booming job markets, but where legal and other barriers make it hard for builders to add to the supply of homes. In the San Francisco metro area, per capita personal income rose 40 percent from 2011 to 2017, while home prices rose 96 percent. Similar patterns are evident in Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, New York and Washington.In less high-flying markets, there was still a disconnect. In the Minneapolis area, for example, incomes rose 22 percent while home prices rose 46 percent.Those rising home prices got help from years of very low mortgage rates, which put more expensive homes within reach for people at a given income level. Activity was also probably boosted by some bounce-back effect after the housing market crash of 2007-09, a result of pent-up demand for homes that were not bought while the market was collapsing.Rates bottomed out in late 2012 at 3.31 percent for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. They have been moving upward in fits and starts since, including a full percentage point in the last year alone to nearly 5 percent \u2014 still low by historical standards, but high compared with the ultralow levels that had enabled these huge price gains.But that doesn\u2019t matter if prices are out of reach relative to incomes. Moreover, lending standards have remained more rigorous than they were during the last housing boom, so it has been harder for people to stretch to buy a home. The inability of people to buy homes they can\u2019t really afford is great news in terms of avoiding another crisis, but not so great for the near-term outlook for housing.\u201cBuyers can only stomach so many price increases until it gets unsustainable,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at the online brokerage Redfin. \u201cPrices reached a breaking point where buyers were fed up and started to consider other options,\u201d she said, including renting and moving away from the expensive coastal markets where prices are most out of whack with incomes.As Economics 101 teaches, price movements are the way that supply and demand match up with each other. But in the housing sector especially, that adjustment can take a while.In contrast with the stock market, where relatively unemotional traders are buying and selling shares every day and the market stays liquid, home purchase and sales decisions can take months and are deeply emotional for the participants.What seems to be happening is that sellers are trying to cling to the spring 2018 prices that their neighbors received, while there aren\u2019t enough buyers in late 2018 willing or able to pay those prices.You would expect, in a zero-sum transaction like a home sale, for those numbers to move in opposite directions. Instead, it seems that sellers are unhappily realizing that they aren\u2019t going to get what they thought their house was worth six months ago, and buyers still think homes are too expensive.That helps explain why transaction volume, especially for new houses, has fallen substantially while prices haven\u2019t (at least yet). It\u2019s a standoff. And the outcome of the standoff will, in the aggregate, play a role in shaping the future of the economy.There is precedent for this, and it isn\u2019t a happy one. In the last housing boom, new home sales peaked in July 2005, and home prices didn\u2019t start declining until May 2006. It didn\u2019t start to hurt the overall economy until December 2007, when the damage had spread through an overleveraged global financial system.But that doesn\u2019t mean this episode has to end in tears. Home prices are not nearly as out of line with incomes as they were then; speculative activity hasn\u2019t been nearly as frothy; and consumer debt levels are considerably more measured.\u201cI think income growth will help us get out of this period,\u201d said Robert Dietz, the chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. \u201cWe\u2019re probably looking at a period where existing home sales volume is flat to declining, and it now looks like 2017 was the peak year for transaction volume.\u201dA strong (nonhousing) economy makes it more likely that this housing slump will end without a steep 2008-style downturn. So does the basic reality that young adults are forming families and need a place to house them.But in the meantime, it could be a soft few months or even years of standoffs between buyers and sellers, with the big question of which comes first: sellers who settle for less after recognizing that the price they thought they would get is beyond the reach of buyers, or incomes that catch up with a housing market that got a little ahead of itself.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Productive\u2019 Talk, but No Deal Between Trump and Cuomo on Hudson Tunnel", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe made a video to show President Trump how a critical tunnel under the Hudson River is falling apart. He flew down to Washington to make his case in person \u2014 again.But Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York left Wednesday\u2019s lunch meeting at the White House empty-handed, without a promise of funding from Mr. Trump for what is arguably the most important infrastructure project in the Northeast.Still, Mr. Cuomo said he was optimistic, and that the president understood the urgency of building a new train tunnel and wanted to find a solution.The leaders had a \u201cproductive\u201d lunch \u2014 the menu included shrimp and beef dishes and, for dessert, chocolate cake \u2014 and Mr. Cuomo said both agreed they wanted to avoid having the tunnel project turn into \u201canother government boondoggle.\u201dThe tunnel, which is known as the Gateway project, could cost more than $13 billion.\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the president was receptive to what we were talking about,\u201d Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters after the lunch. \u201cThe president said he wanted to take the next steps to find a way forward.\u201dThe tunnel project involves building two single-track tunnels under the Hudson River between Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan and New Jersey. Those tunnels would supplement the two 108-year-old tubes that constitute the only rail links between New York City and points beyond Newark, N.J.The White House said in a statement that the leaders discussed \u201ca number of important topics, focusing on infrastructure.\u201d\u201cThe president cares deeply for his home state of New York and always appreciates the opportunity to engage with the governor on issues important to the state and region,\u201d the White House statement said.As a first step, Mr. Cuomo said he and Mr. Trump wanted a precise estimate for the project\u2019s costs, instead of relying on figures from Amtrak, which owns the existing tunnel. State and federal officials planned to discuss how to begin soliciting bids from private companies to examine the costs, Mr. Cuomo said.Mr. Cuomo had an answer for those critics disappointed that he did not leave the White House with a concrete promise of federal dollars: \u201cIf the president wasn\u2019t interested and wasn\u2019t moved by the video, why have the meeting?\u201dThe meeting was attended by Elaine Chao, the federal transportation secretary; Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; John F. Kelly, the president\u2019s chief of staff; and Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.Before President Barack Obama left office, his administration had reached a funding agreement with Mr. Cuomo and Chris Christie, who was then the Republican governor of New Jersey. The two states agreed to cover half of the cost with the federal government providing the other half.A spokesman for Mr. Schumer said the senator believes Mr. Trump \u201cwants to use Gateway as leverage to trade for the wall.\u201d Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to build a wall along the souther border of the United States to deter illegal migration.\u201cSenator Schumer has told the president repeatedly that he is not going to make such a trade,\u201d said Angelo Roefaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer.Mr. Trump has said he wants to work with Democrats on infrastructure after Republicans lost control of the House in the midterm elections.Amtrak has said the existing tunnels are deteriorating rapidly after having been flooded with salty water in 2012 during Hurricane Sandy. About $2 billion of the estimated cost would go toward rehabilitating the old tunnels after the new ones are built.The Port Authority is a sponsor of the Gateway project. Mr. Cotton has essentially been Mr. Cuomo\u2019s infrastructure czar, overseeing the construction of a replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge, and now at the Port Authority, the rebuilding of La Guardia Airport.Mr. Cuomo, who has a been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, said the leaders found common ground over the hazards of building projects.\u201cThe president is skeptical of government construction contracts,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cI am skeptical of government construction contracts.\u201dMr. Cuomo said he and Mr. Trump were both dubious about the estimated costs of Gateway, which Mr. Cuomo dismissively said were \u201cprovided by Amtrak.\u201d If the project costs $13 billion, New York\u2019s share would be $3.25 billion \u2014 all the state could afford, the governor said. \u201cI\u2019m at my maximum budget,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.Katie Rogers contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s part of a broader push by the government to take control of its global narrative and present a friendlier, less menacing image of China to the world.China\u2019s booming box office and seemingly inexhaustible cash reserves have provided a much-needed boost to Hollywood as it faces slowing ticket sales in the United States and challenges from Amazon and Netflix.But Hollywood\u2019s embrace of China has not come without strings attached.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see something that\u2019s like \u2018Seven Years in Tibet\u2019 anymore,\u201d said Larry Shinagawa, a professor at Hawaii Tokai International College who specializes in Asian and Asian-American studies. Studios that make films critical of China, he said, risk being banned from releasing movies in the country.At stake for China is more than just the validation of Hollywood\u2019s powerbrokers and celebrities. In speeches and at forums, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well\u201d \u2014 to make sure a coherent, compelling and, most important, Communist Party-sanctioned narrative of China\u2019s rise to power reaches global audiences.\u201cThere is a notion that its propaganda has not worked well enough,\u201d said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cSo this is where the film industry comes in. There\u2019s a real sensitivity to the blockbuster power of Hollywood.\u201dChina has raised its influence in Hollywood by bankrolling a growing number of top-tier films.Of the top 100 highest-grossing films worldwide each year from 1997 to 2013, China helped finance only 12 Hollywood movies:199719992000200520062007200820102012201319971999200020052006200720082010201220131997199920002005200620072008201020122013But in the five years that followed, China co-financed 41 top-grossing Hollywood films:201520162014201720182014201520162017201820142015201620172018Hollywood studios are also eager to grab a slice of China\u2019s fast-growing box office market, which surpassed the United States\u2019 in total revenue for the first time ever in the first quarter of 2018.Success in China can make up for a disappointing box office performance at home or even transform a hit into a global blockbuster. By the same token, getting shut out of the Chinese market can be devastating for a movie.That\u2019s a powerful incentive to avoid causing any offense to China.One of China\u2019s top movie regulators spelled it out in a speech at the U.S.-China Film Summit in Los Angeles in 2013.\u201cWe have a huge market, and we want to share it with you,\u201d said Zhang Xun, then the president of the state-owned China Film Co-Production Corporation, speaking to a room full of Hollywood executives.Then came the condition. \u201cWe want films that are heavily invested in Chinese culture, not one or two shots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see positive Chinese images.\u201dChina\u2019s campaign to push a positive image abroad has extended beyond Hollywood.Since then, China has stepped away from the big-budget co-production model, focusing instead on making features that cater to its large and still-expanding domestic market. To do that, it has enlisted Hollywood talent \u2014  producers, technical experts and even top celebrities.But they have had to walk a fine line.A number of actors, musicians and other celebrities have been barred from entering the country over behavior deemed inappropriate or critical of the Chinese Communist Party.Here\u2019s why some of them were barred from China:The difference in the \u201cChinese perspective\u201d was most evident in CGTN\u2019s coverage this year of an unexpected proposal to abolish presidential term limits in China\u2019s Constitution. While Western news media outlets raced to explain why the amendment, which would open the door to President Xi\u2019s indefinite rule, was unprecedented, CGTN\u2019s anchors were calm \u2014 and eerily synchronized \u2014 in their message praising the change.It is difficult to tell whether China\u2019s push to soften its image through movies, media and cultural projects has been successful.\u201cChinese soft power has not been that successful outside of the developing world,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies Chinese society and cinema. \u201cIf China does have any soft power, it\u2019s probably because of the success of their economy and the Chinese model that they\u2019re pushing very hard now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Chairman Seeks to Reassure Those Left Behind by Roaring Economy", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell walked the streets of a struggling neighborhood in this otherwise prospering city on Thursday before meeting with community leaders in a visit intended to demonstrate the Fed\u2019s concern about those who have been left behind by a decade of economic growth.As is often the case, minority communities have seen the smallest gains.And the Fed is slowly raising its benchmark interest rate, prompting concerns that higher rates will abbreviate the economic expansion. The rate, currently 2 percent to 2.25 percent, is approaching the level that the Fed regards as neutral, meaning that it would neither stimulate nor impede economic activity.The central bank is widely expected to raise the rate by another quarter point at its next policymaking meeting, in mid-December.Mr. Powell did not address the Fed\u2019s specific plans for monetary policy, but he said the central bank wanted to extend the current economic expansion for as long as possible.The Fed mostly focuses on communicating its plans to sophisticated investors, but its policies ripple throughout the economy, affecting millions of people who have only the vaguest understanding of its role and its responsibilities.Mr. Powell has sought to put a friendly face on those decisions by engaging with the public in a wide range of venues.Sherman Lewis III, the chairman of Houston Habitat for Humanity, owns 48 Shell stations and Jack in the Box restaurants around the Houston area. He said 13 were damaged by flooding, along with the homes of many of his employees. All of those stores have reopened, but sales remain lower than before the storm.Anna M. Babin, the chief executive of the United Way of Greater Houston, told Mr. Powell that mortgage and rent assistance calls are up 27 percent year over year.\u201cWe had so many people living in the edge, very vulnerable,\u201d she said. \u201cThis storm pushed them down further.\u201d She noted much of the aid promised by the federal government has yet to arrive, including $5 billion for housing redevelopment.Kathy Flanagan Payton, the president of the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation, said she thought it was important for Mr. Powell to see the challenges facing her neighborhood. She drew a contrast between the Fifth Ward\u2019s recovery from the storm, and the recovery in the affluent River Oaks neighborhood.\u201cPeople in River Oaks set mattresses out in the trash to be picked up,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople in Fifth Ward set their mattresses out in the sun to dry them.\u201dThe Fed, she said, could help by making sure banks are serving the community.\u201cI think it\u2019s an underutilized resource in terms of making sure that we\u2019ve got our banking partners at the table and we\u2019re getting enough from that community,\u201d she said.Federal regulators are considering changes to the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to make loans throughout the regions where they collect deposits. Mr. Powell said on Thursday that the goal was improvement. \u201cWe\u2019re deeply committed to the mission of the C.R.A.,\u201d he said of the act. \u201cWe\u2019re only looking to make it more effective.\u201dIn one respect, however, the Fed is poised to make life here more difficult.Houston Habitat for Humanity makes mortgage loans to its home buyers, and it has continued to charge 3 percent interest even as the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate and as the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan has climbed to 4.94 percent.But Allison Hay, the executive director of Houston Habitat for Humanity, said she did not expect to be able to keep the rate at 3 percent for much longer. If the Fed, as expected, continues to raise rates, she said she will need to do so, too.Habitat already is struggling to keep the price of its homes at an affordable level. Land prices in the Fifth Ward are rising as the city continues to grow.A higher interest rate means applicants will need more income to become homeowners.Mr. Powell\u2019s visit continues the practice of his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, who made a public trip to a struggling community in each year of her tenure as Fed chairwoman. Ms. Yellen\u2019s trips tended to focus on education and job-training programs.Robert S. Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, arranged the tour and accompanied Mr. Powell on Thursday. Mr. Kaplan said that while it was right to celebrate economic growth in Texas, the struggling parts of the state deserved more attention. He said he had considered taking Mr. Powell to other struggling areas of the state, including parts of Dallas and communities along the southern border.Elizabeth Powell, 63, lives one block from the house that Mr. Powell visited. Her home flooded during Harvey; the high-water mark is clearly visible on the walls. The storm also took her 2006 Cadillac, which was completely paid off.She bought a new car, but now she has a monthly payment.And Ms. Powell said she has not received any aid from the federal government.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen anybody from the federal government,\u201d she said.She said she had not heard of Mr. Powell, but she did know a little about the Fed.\u201cThat\u2019s where they keep the money,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to invest more of that in the inner city.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Falling Oil Prices May Make Trump Happy but They Pose Risks for U.S.", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOil, which is trading at around $50 a barrel, is close to an economic sweet spot. Prices are not so high that they are a burdensome tax on consumers and businesses, and not so low as to bankrupt energy companies and strain the finances of major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia.\u201cTrump tweets as if he has a joystick and he has everything under his command like he is playing one of these video games,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.Mr. Trump is expected to discuss oil prices with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia at the Group of 20 summit meeting at the end of the week. That conversation will come days before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to set production targets.If he persuades major oil-producing nations to maintain their current output, \u201coil prices could go down to the low 40s,\u201d Mr. Kloza said.That kind of drop would have been an unalloyed economic boon for the United States just a dozen years ago, when domestic oil production was declining and the country was becoming increasingly dependent on unstable or unfriendly countries like Venezuela and Nigeria.But lower prices will have a more ambiguous impact now. After the boom in drilling in shale fields, oil production in the United States has more than doubled since 2008, to upward of 11 million barrels a day now, and the country has become a major exporter. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other oil companies have made huge investments and employ tens of thousands of workers across the country.At the time, OPEC decided not to cut production in order to retain market share and undercut American shale producers. That decision set off a three-year slump in prices.\u201cOf course I\u2019m concerned because the price of oil is dropping like crazy right now,\u201d said Darlene S. Wallace, president of Columbus Oil, a small Oklahoma producer. \u201cI was making a profit this year for the first time in four years, and now it doesn\u2019t look like it will end up that way toward the end of the year.\u201dBut the drop in prices has clearly been a boon to people and businesses that use oil.Americans consume roughly 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so every time prices fall by a penny they save about $4 million. The average retail price for regular gasoline is about $2.50 a gallon, according to AAA, about the same as a year ago. But that is $1.60 a gallon less than it was a decade earlier, when the shale-oil boom was just starting.In addition to the benefits of lower prices for consumers, Mr. Trump appears to want a well-supplied oil market so he can press countries to cut their imports from Iran without worrying about running out of fuel. Lower energy costs should also tamp down inflation, which in turn would help keep interest rates low at a time when some analysts fear an economic slowdown.The president might have some success in getting Saudi Arabia not to cut oil production because of how he has handled the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Thankful for Mr. Trump\u2019s public support, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, might be more willing to tolerate low oil prices than he would have been otherwise.Russia also appears to be in no hurry to cut production, which is at the record level of roughly 11 million barrels a day. Igor Sechin, chief executive of the Russian oil company Rosneft and an influential ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, has aggressively promoted drilling at home and abroad. Mr. Putin recently said he was satisfied with the current price of oil.Given all those political calculations, Mr. Kloza and other energy analysts say that Saudi Arabia is likely to cut production modestly, and lobby other producers to do the same. At current prices, Saudi Arabia, which is heavily dependent on petroleum exports, can pay its bills and most oil companies can make a profit. (The global price of oil is about $60 a barrel.)\u201cI think everybody is keen on stability,\u201d said Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco. He expects OPEC will cut production by at least a million barrels a day, roughly 1 percent of global supply.The energy minister of Ecuador, Carlos P\u00e9rez, said in a recent interview that he thought prices would end up in a Goldilocks range.\u201cSome talk of $60 oil. Other crazy people talk of $100 oil,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez, who will represent his country at the OPEC meeting next week. \u201cBut I personally think we are going to a range of between $65 and $75.\u201dBut oil prices rarely settle at such temperate levels for long.Any OPEC cut that raises prices would encourage more drilling in the United States and other non-OPEC countries like Brazil, potentially forcing prices back down again. And if trade tensions between the United States and China depress global growth, oil prices could slide anew.Bernard L. Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said it was virtually impossible to predict oil prices more than a month in advance. That is even more the case when the president is trying to jawbone energy markets and intervene in the global economy.\u201cWe do know that after some of Trump\u2019s tweets we have seen big drops,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said. \u201cTrump is the unpredictable factor, not just in terms of his tweets but what he is going to do in terms of his steel and aluminum tariffs, his hiking of tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.

In the dish\u2019s name lies some of the tangled history of East and West: lamprais \u2014 whose pronunciation is close to \u201clump rise,\u201d although some leave the P and S silent \u2014 comes from the Dutch portmanteau lomprijst, itself derived from lemper, sticky rice cakes with shredded meat inside, which the Dutch first encountered in Malaysia and Indonesia.Here, what arrives is a grand parcel folded in banana leaves, with a little paper umbrella staked at one end, as if to say, \u201cLet the party begin.\u201d Inside is abundance: rice plumped on coconut milk and ghee and scented with rampe (pandan) and sera (lemongrass); more cashews, riled up by green chiles and given a menthol hit of fennel; ash plantains, deep-fried and evoking potatoes; eggplant gone dark and caramelly; and onions broken down with practically every spice in the larder, until they are half solid, half syrup.Also tucked in is the curry of your choice, crowded with chicken heady from cardamom and cloves or nubs of goat plush with fat. (The best part is the runoff, to be drunk by the spoonful.) And on top: a golden orb of a fish cutlet, and a wrinkled, paunchy oval that proves to be a deep-fried hard-boiled egg, crunchy coat giving way to creamy yolk.Elsewhere on the table might be hoppers, crepes of fermented rice flour curved like bowls, thick and spongy at the bottom with sides that get thinner and lacier as they reach up. And kurakkan pittu, small pillars of grated coconut and ragi (finger millet), to be knocked over and mixed with coconut milk and lunu miris, raw onion and chile smashed in a mortar until the heat blooms, sweet and rank at once, brightened with the faintest trace of lime.Here too is kottu, tangled scraps of roti tossed in a wok with vegetables and curry, calling to mind fried rice. One version gets a trickledown of melted mozzarella, Cheddar and blue cheese for a happy hint of funk.Staten Island is home to more Sri Lankan immigrants than any other borough, with a population estimated at 5,000, more than five times what it was two decades ago when Mr. Hewabajgamage first came to New York. In his early years he took many jobs, driving a taxi and commuting as far as Philadelphia for work.In 2007, he and his wife opened a restaurant called Vidutara, half a mile from where Sagara now stands, with Ms. Hewabajgamage running the kitchen. Then their third child was born and the economy went south, and they had to shutter within the year. Now they\u2019re trying again, this time with the help of a veteran chef, Lalith Gunasekera.But the spirit is kind. On a recent evening, with the next ferry departure looming and Uber far in the distance, my group of offshore diners inquired hesitantly as to a local car service. Mr. Hewabajgamage sprang into action, ushering us into his S.U.V. and cheerfully reminiscing about his years as a taxi driver (\u201cI was mugged!\u201d).There was no charge. We made it to the ferry with minutes to spare.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steve King, for a Change, Faces a Battle for House Seat in Iowa", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut suddenly, the overlap of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting by a virulent anti-Semite and Mr. King\u2019s latest inflammatory remarks, to a publication associated with neo-Nazis, have converged to add some drama to a re-election bid that once looked assured.\u201cWe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms, and I strongly condemn this behavior,\u201d Mr. Stivers wrote.In Des Moines on Thursday, Mr. King responded angrily when accused of sharing the same ideology as the Pittsburgh shooter, and he demanded that the man who made the suggestion be ejected from a candidate forum.In an acknowledgment of the heat Mr. King is feeling, his campaign released its first TV advertisement Friday. (It turned out to be an expression of heartland pride and optimism recycled from his 2014 campaign.)A public poll on Monday showed Mr. King leading his opponent, J.D. Scholten, by a single point. After news of the survey popped up on social media, money poured in to Mr. Scholten from around the country: $641,000 in 48 hours, his campaign said, enough to launch a 90-second TV ad of his own, featuring farmers, mothers and others who the campaign says are former King supporters.Three large agriculture businesses \u2014 Land O\u2019Lakes, Purina and Smithfield \u2014 announced they would no longer support Mr. King because his conduct did not represent their values. AT&T announced Friday that the employees who manage disbursements from its political action committee have determined that it will not make future contributions to him.Douglas Burns, an owner of The Carroll Daily Times Herald and other newspapers in Mr. King\u2019s deeply conservative district, which President Trump won by 27 points, said the Republican base was still with Mr. King, who remains the favorite to win. But Mr. Scholten was his first Democratic challenger not easily caricatured as a carpetbagger or a liberal. Mr. Scholten, 38, is a fifth-generation Iowan and former professional baseball player who is running largely on his biography, not ideology.\u201cI think Scholten\u2019s strength is that he is an acceptable place for potentially a lot of Republicans or Republican-leaning independents to park a discontented vote,\u201d Mr. Burns said.He added that Mr. King has been running \u201cthe laziest campaign\u201d he has seen. \u201cKing is a natural political animal. He\u2019d maul Scholten in a debate, but he is just ignoring him. I don\u2019t understand why.\u201dIn contrast to the often elusive Mr. King, Mr. Scholten has crisscrossed the 39-county district in an RV named the Sioux City Sue, for the Gene Autry song, sleeping overnight in Walmart parking lots, while accusing the incumbent of ignoring constituents to pick fights on behalf of white nationalists.\u201cPeople have been frustrated with King for years but they haven\u2019t had somebody else they could trust,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Scholten, calling from his RV on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we made such an effort of getting out there to the people.\u201d He is stopping in downtowns to encounter voters of both parties rather than just holding town halls that attract supporters.The issues he talks about are mainly the high cost of health care and making a farm economy work for young people who keep moving away.\u201cEvery time I fill up this RV with gas there\u2019s usually a donation box for someone who just got sick or in an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in the wealthiest country in the world and people have to beg to pay for their medical expenses.\u2019\u2019In the past, Iowans in the Fourth District rolled their eyes, or simply ignored Mr. King\u2019s controversial statements about undocumented immigrants or Muslims that attract national outrage. He was a Republican whose views on abortion, taxes and gun rights were in step with the voters in northwest Iowa, the state\u2019s most conservative region. Two years ago, he was re-elected to an eighth term by 22 percentage points.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Iowa\u2019s senior Republican, declined to discuss Mr. King on Friday at a campaign stop for a different House Republican, Representative David Young. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give you any words that would detract from the importance of re-electing Young,\u201d he said.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Nancy Trapolino, a 34-year-old mother of two from Arcadia, Iowa, who works in a family business that manufactures farm machinery, said she was likely to vote for Mr. King to keep the House in Republican hands. She approves of the tax cut passed last year and other Republican priorities.\u201cI haven\u2019t found anybody running against Steve King that\u2019s given me much hope,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think having a Republican Congress is going to be important for achieving some of the goals that they have.\u201dAsked about his remarks supporting white nationalists, she said: \u201cI can\u2019t support the racist remarks Steve King makes. It makes me upset.\u201dMr. King\u2019s most fervent supporters have in the past accepted his denials that he is a racist and agreed with him that news media distorts his remarks.But his latest comments and actions come at a time when the country\u2019s nerves are newly sensitive to hate speech, after the Pittsburgh massacre and Mr. Trump\u2019s escalation of heated rhetoric about the caravan of Central Americans headed toward the United States, and his misleading online ad about an undocumented immigrant bragging about killing police officers.He also argued that diversity does not strengthen American society. \u201cWhat does this diversity bring that we don\u2019t already have?\u201d he said. \u201cMexican food, Chinese food, those things, well, that\u2019s fine, but what does it bring that we don\u2019t have that is worth the price?\u201dThe remarks came after a five-day visit he made to Holocaust sites funded by a nonprofit group that educates lawmakers about Nazi genocide.In his Des Moines appearance on Thursday, Mr. King vehemently rejected a connection between his words and actions and the anti-Semitic ideology of the Pittsburgh gunman.Saying he has \u201cstood with Israel all along,\u201d he asked organizers to remove the man who suggested a connection to the gunman, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not listening to another word from you.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cYou\u2019re done; we don\u2019t play these games here in Iowa,\u201d he said.On Friday, Mr. Scholten said his internal polls showed him further behind Mr. King than the survey showing a one-point race, but he is happy the attention will drive up his name recognition, which has been a challenge of his campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re just saying there is a need in the Fourth District for a new moral leadership, one that rejects white supremacy and racism,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stimulus Plan or Populist Giveaway? Italy\u2019s Budget Sets Up Clash With E.U.", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAPLES, Italy \u2014 Italy\u2019s desperate need for a financial shot in the arm is palpable at all levels of the economy, from the entrepreneurs in the industrial north who are hungry for tax breaks and a streamlined bureaucracy to the welfare seekers in the poverty-stricken south, with its dizzying levels of youth unemployment.The question is whether the budget is a serious stimulus plan or a bank-breaking populist giveaway larded with tax cuts, pension benefits and welfare programs that neither Italy nor the European Union can afford. A crash of the Italian economy, one of the largest in the bloc, could sink everyone. Doubts among investors have already caused an increase in the yields of 10-year government bonds \u2014 an indication that markets view Italy as a riskier country to lend to.But Italy\u2019s populists, who are holding more meetings today, appear unwilling to budge. The anti-immigrant League, led by Matteo Salvini, has sought tax cuts to please its business-friendly northern base. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, is looking to rally support in the relatively poor south with a welfare program estimated to cost around $9 billion. Both parties are looking to consolidate before European Parliament elections in May, which are seen as a test of their power at home.The government\u2019s argument in favor of spending might be more persuasive if Italy\u2019s public debt were not already 131 percent of G.D.P. But it is precisely the combination of high debt and low growth \u2014 now about zero percent \u2014 that has left Italy struggling to find a way out of its economic dead end.Yet even some supporters of the expansive Italian spending are worried that the country\u2019s leaders are playing politics with the economy.\u201cIt\u2019s schizophrenic,\u201d Gennaro Ferrillo, the director of a job center in Naples, said of the opposing policies in the budget. \u201cTo put the two together is in complete contradiction. On the one hand, you have a tax break that reduces revenues, and on the other, you have increased spending to address the needs of the poor and those harmed by the crisis and austerity.\u201dMr. Ferrillo was speaking after the lone hour that the job center he runs on a dusty street on the outskirts of Naples opens in the afternoon. The Five Star Movement has envisioned registration at these centers \u2014 some of which lack internet connections \u2014 as a prerequisite for receiving its proposed \u201ccitizens\u2019 income,\u201d essentially an unemployment benefit that would be worth about $875 a month for about six million struggling Italians.\u201cThe help is necessary,\u201d Mr. Ferrillo said of the aid, \u201cto help people work, to keep them from being forced into the black market where they are exploited and completely lose their dignity.\u201dBut he said that he had seen no details of the plan and that a proposed, billion-dollar overhaul of the job centers would have to be carefully thought out if it was to be effective.\u201cEveryone is asking how will the government and Di Maio do this revolutionary measure for Italy,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cit\u2019s practically impossible unless there is also a revolution in the centers.\u201dMr. Salvini has opted for what he calls a flat tax, a proposed cut of 15 percent for small businesses and individuals making up to $73,000 a year, that is designed to please his base in the north, the country\u2019s industrial and economic heart.Along orderly streets lined with canals and handsome shops in the wealthy northern town of Treviso, a stronghold of the League, residents welcomed the proposed tax break. National, regional, provincial and city taxes, as well as those on utilities, can add up to about 65 percent in Italy, suffocating businesses.Even so, officials at the headquarters of Confartigianato, an association of Italian small businesses that have an average of about four employees, in the northeastern region of Veneto, expressed doubts about the seriousness of the government\u2019s proposals.In fact, they say, it is the combination of uncertainty, a lack of clarity in what the government is offering and a looming conflict with the European Union that is paralyzing small businesses.\u201cDay after day, the government changes its information,\u201d said Vendemiano Sartor, the president of the group\u2019s Treviso chapter.The group\u2019s policy shop has not started calculating the real impact of the tax proposal because there has not yet been a concrete proposal to study.This government, according to Agostino Bonomo, the association\u2019s president in Veneto, \u201cmakes only electoral slogans and gives no clarity and has no vision for business.\u201dThe businesses \u201care waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t moving.\u201dEntrepreneurs, he added, feared a devaluation of Italy on the international markets that would hurt its reputation and lead to a drop in work orders from abroad.Increasingly, people in Veneto are moving their bank accounts to Austria, said the officials, who also expressed concern that the standoff with Brussels was more about stimulating frustrated voters than about improving the economy.Just as the north of Europe tends to resist paying for what it sees as fiscally undisciplined southern countries, the pro-business north of Italy, where joblessness is not an issue, does not want to pay for a huge expansion of welfare in the south, where youth unemployment can reach as high as 50 percent.\u201cWhat we\u2019re protesting is that we are spending money in this country to create a dependency culture,\u201d Mr. Sartor said. \u201cIf the south drains resources, it\u2019s not that we can just say, \u2018Oh well.\u2019 It\u2019s 100 years like this!\u201dKilling time with other unemployed women perched on parked scooters, Filomena Palumbo lamented the lack of job prospects in the city for herself and for her adult children and their spouses, with whom she shared a small apartment in a crowded street up the hill. Her sons-in-law managed to \u201cget by,\u201d she said.\u201cThey steal!\u201d her friend Giuseppina Iaccarino, 35, said with a laugh.Ms. Palumbo, a 38-year-old grandmother, shushed her friend but then conceded with a shrug: \u201cThey can\u2019t even get by doing that anymore. There\u2019s not enough money going around. It\u2019s not worth going to jail for nothing,\u201d she said.She said she had voted for the Five Star Movement because she hoped that its promised relief program \u2014 which the party\u2019s leaders have sought to equate with the 1930s-era New Deal in the United States \u2014 would provide an alternative. \u201cThe government has to get the money flowing,\u201d she said.Since taking office though, Five Star\u2019s popularity has shrunk while the League\u2019s has expanded. The League is applying pressure on Five Star to support a high-speed rail project through the Italian Alps to France. Mr. Di Maio, who has a record of flip-flopping, keeps getting outplayed by Mr. Salvini and is clearly desperate to deliver. But it is his welfare proposal that is driving deficit spending through the roof and attracting the censure from the European Union.In recent days, Mr. Di Maio has begun exploring the possibility of saving face by scaling back the welfare program, which critics say is merely an expanded version of the system put in place by the previous government that he excoriated.Some of the hundreds of people who turn up daily at the Naples job center have already started asking for the citizens\u2019 income even though it does not yet exist. On a recent afternoon, Daniele Peluso, 17, showed up looking for a job. Instead, he found a guard explaining to frustrated job seekers through a locked fence that the region had failed to update its website for its new operating hours. They were now 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., not 2:45 to 3:45.Crestfallen, Mr. Peluso turned away. His father, Luigi, 55, who had accompanied him, said he hoped the citizens\u2019 income would eventually help unemployed young southerners like his son. Daniele agreed, but added that he had some reservations if the job centers were to be involved in distributing the funds.He gestured to the guard and the locked gate. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad start,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Tell Us What You\u2019d Like to See.", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBULLETIN BOARDOur new Travel editor, Amy Virshup, says she will be rebooting our travel journalism for the digital age. Send her your suggestions or ask a question here. [[Leave your feedback and questions for Amy on her plans for our travel coverage in the comments.]]One is how we tell stories. The classic storytelling mode in travel writing (not just at The Times, but pretty much everywhere) is the first-person travelogue, in which someone parachutes into a location and brings back the tale of the journey. That has resulted in some wonderful writing and terrific insights into far-flung places. But it made more sense when travel was harder, when most people were never going to take that trip to Patagonia or the Australian outback, so the writer really was the reader\u2019s window into a different world. Now, people can much more easily visit places themselves, and they don\u2019t necessarily want our take on a place; they want the tools to discover it for themselves and find their own take on it. Those places, unlike hotels, give you the opportunity to really live in a neighborhood and partake of its charms \u2014 shopping at the grocery store, finding \u201cyour\u201d bakery where you can pick up croissants each morning, or going for a run in the local park. To tap into that hunger, I am looking at using more writers who actually live in the places readers want to visit.Years ago, if we wrote about Los Angeles, for instance, few people there would read it. Even if they did, if they found what we wrote lacking, the only way we would know is if they wrote a letter to the editor. These days, they take to Twitter and we hear them loud and clear. As Travel editor, I want to harness that energy to amplify our coverage. One writer and one story can\u2019t tell everything about a place, but if we can add readers\u2019 voices and knowledge to what we do, we can get a fuller picture. And that\u2019s what we all want.Let\u2019s get started. What suggestions do you have for our Travel desk? What kinds of travel tips would be useful to you? What do you think we\u2019ve been missing?

Now they are honing what they hope is a winning economic message focused on workers.Supported byAKRON, Ohio \u2014 Richard Cordray never seems quite sure how to stand.He tilts to the left like a Leaning Tower of Bureaucrat, arms sagging, as he waits for his turn at the microphone. When it comes, he speaks as if his internal keyboard lacks an exclamation point.\u201cI can feel \u2014 I can feel the blue wave coming,\u201d Mr. Cordray, Ohio\u2019s Democratic nominee for governor, said flatly here recently, greeting supporters inside a plumbers and pipe fitters union hall. He allowed that many had probably come to see someone else: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, whose charisma had been imported for the morning rally.\u201cWe\u2019ve been telling the campaign, \u2018Take the gloves off with this guy,\u2019\u201d said Jack Hefner, a local steelworkers union leader standing in the back, who has feared that Mr. Cordray would be a difficult sell with some members, many of whom unexpectedly supported President Trump in 2016. \u201cBut Ohio\u2019s a funny state. Right when you think you\u2019ve got it figured out, it flips.\u201dThey are betting that a renewed focus on lunch-pail issues can reassemble their fractured coalition of city-dwelling liberals and minority voters, left-leaning suburbanites and especially white working-class voters hungering for an economic pitch aimed at their interests.If only those blue-collar defectors of 2016 can be persuaded to listen.\u201cEvery Democrat I know supported Trump,\u201d David Vlosich, 50, a former local auto union official, said recently from his seat at a labor banquet in Girard, outside Youngstown. \u201cIncluding half the people in this room.\u201dPerhaps the highest hurdle for Democrats here has been decades of near-domination by Ohio Republicans in nonpresidential cycles, with large conservative majorities in the legislature and control of the governorship for all but four of the last 28 years.\u201cOur electorate in midterm elections is more aligned with Republicans,\u201d said Michael Hartley, a longtime adviser to Republican campaigns in Ohio, observing that Democrats appeared much better positioned this year in other Midwestern states that also voted for Mr. Trump, like Michigan and Wisconsin. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of holding the line a little bit.\u201dThe president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d bravado on trade resonated deeply, aligning him more with some Democrats, including Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, than fellow Republicans. But Mr. Trump is not on the ballot this year, and neither is Hillary Clinton. (A few Democrats in the state acknowledged that having two men in the marquee midterm races, Mr. Cordray and Mr. Brown, might help.)\u201cI think we talk more about workers, we talk more about labor, as a party,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been a better party on trade enforcement than we were.\u201dTraditionally, Democratic victory here has involved running up the score around Cleveland and other major population centers, particularly with nonwhite voters, while holding onto white working-class households in old-guard union towns with deep Democratic ties. The formula has become significantly trickier without Mr. Obama, who proved uniquely effective at turning out younger voters and African-Americans.Despite Mr. Obama\u2019s two wins in Ohio, it remains in many respects a culturally conservative state, where canvassers know not to door-knock on Sunday mornings during church \u2014 or to expect much success on Saturday afternoons during Buckeyes football games, either.\u201cPray to end abortion,\u201d read a sign displayed recently on a church yard in Akron \u2014 among the more liberal enclaves in the state \u2014 beside a cluster of white crosses pounded into the grass. The Supreme Court\u2019s legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015 stemmed in part from an Ohio plaintiff\u2019s challenge to a state constitutional amendment to ban such unions. Mr. DeWine\u2019s office argued for the ban to be upheld.David Betras, the chairman of the Mahoning County Democratic Party, said liberal social causes \u201ccan\u2019t be a centerplate issue\u2019\u2019 for Ohio Democrats, and preached a focus on pocketbook fare instead. \u201cMost voters,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t give a whit one way or the other\u201d about the former. (He did not say \u201cwhit.\u201d)And it is in Mr. Betras\u2019 region, along Ohio\u2019s oxidized eastern edge, where Democrats were particularly disappointed in 2016.In an interview, Mr. Cordray said the economic recovery had been uneven, elevating the importance of issues like jobs and health care. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody owns Ohio voters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey swing back and forth based on who they think is going to address problems and improve their lives, particularly on the economic anxieties that many of them feel.\u201dMr. DeWine has presented Mr. Cordray as a do-nothing Democrat out of step with the state, lashing him for supporting a constitutional amendment that would reduce penalties for some drug users.\u201cYou\u2019re all talk,\u201d Mr. DeWine said at a debate in Dayton. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a failure at every job you have ever had.\u201dBut generally, the race has been relatively tame, with two stylistically equivalent candidates who can benefit at times from the well-founded impression that they are boring. Mr. DeWine\u2019s pre-Trump establishment background as a well-known state official could mollify suburban voters uncomfortable with the president\u2019s more unruly instincts. And Mr. Cordray\u2019s meek manner can imply a centrism that belies much of his policy platform.At Mr. Cordray\u2019s rally with Mr. Booker, Jenna Gravalis, 23, stood watch in a \u201cNerds for Cordray\u201d T-shirt. \u201cUs nerds are very excited,\u201d she said.But some veteran labor organizers are wary, acutely aware that their members have little visceral connection to the man they are being asked to support.\u201cHe\u2019s not Sherrod Brown,\u201d Mr. Hefner, from the steelworkers union, said of Mr. Cordray, in an office that includes two pictures of himself with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. It was no coincidence that Mr. Cordray\u2019s team called upon Mr. Biden for a joint appearance this week in Youngstown.The district includes Mansfield, a once-humming manufacturing hub, now replete with pawn shops and faded storefront signs.\u201cThis is the wealthiest district in the state of Ohio; this district also has industrial towns like Mansfield, Ohio, that our country has forgotten,\u2019\u2019 Mr. O\u2019Connor said. \u201cThis district is this country.\u201dAnd so is this state, at present: anxious, complicated and controlled by Republicans.On a recent canvassing swing around Akron, Russ Brode, the president of the Tri County Regional Labor Council, encountered the full range, hoping to educate residents about Mr. Cordray.He came upon David Lashchuk, 48, and his son Hunter, 12, tossing a Frisbee. \u201cDo you have any Girl Scout cookies?\u201d Hunter asked, requesting sugar-free. \u201cIf not, we\u2019re not interested.\u201dBut Mr. Lashchuk, a tarp manufacturer, lingered to listen. \u201cI think Corduroy\u2019s got a real vision,\u201d he said, inventing a more memorable pronunciation while praising the candidate\u2019s emphasis on infrastructure, a potential boost to business. \u201cIf they\u2019re not fixing bridges, I\u2019m not putting tarps on them.\u201dA short walk away, Mr. Brode approached Michael Birch, 39, perched on a roof grinding sandstone for a chimney repair. Was he interested in hearing about some fine folks running for office?\u201cAre they Republicans?\u201d asked Mr. Birch, a union bricklayer. No? Then he was not interested.Mr. Brode turned to leave, brushing past a truck with a sticker on the back window: \u201cMaking America great again,\u201d it read, \u201cone brick at a time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Supported byChina, the biggest buyer of American soybeans, all but stopped purchases after the White House imposed tariffs this summer and set a retaliatory spiral in motion. The pronouncements and maneuvers in world capitals have reverberated through the kitchens and living rooms of farmers, who were targets in part because they are big exporters and core supporters of Mr. Trump.\u201cSome say enough already \u2014 it\u2019s a big gamble and the timing is horrible for us to be messing with trade,\u201d Mr. Knopf said. \u201cOther farmers are incredibly excited about what the administration is doing on trade and truly believe they\u2019ll come up with a better deal for us long term. I\u2019m probably somewhere in the middle. I\u2019m cautiously hopeful.\u201dFALL 2017Trade frictions with China mounted through most of last year, but when Mr. Trump traveled to Beijing in November, the tone changed. The president piled praise on Mr. Xi, and blamed the United States for inequitable trade deals. It looked as if relations were warming, and the price of soybeans was floating around $9.90 a bushel.On the farm, Mr. Knopf was deciding how many acres of soybeans, sorghum and corn to plant in the spring to take advantage of an early-order discount for seed. As a no-till farmer, he diversifies and rotates crops to create healthier soil, instead of plowing and relying heavily on pesticides. WINTER 2018Mr. Knopf said China\u2019s announcement was \u201cwhen the reality really sank in that this trade war was going to have a significant impact on my farm here in the middle of central Kansas.\u201d\u201cOur local price that day dropped by \u2014 I believe it was 80 cents,\u201d he said. \u201cJust that one announcement from China decreased my potential revenue by 20 percent in one day.\u201d Soon, though, the sorghum and soybean prices rebounded.SPRING 2018 Mr. Knopf had decided to reduce his corn and sorghum acreage because soybean prices looked favorable. He had finished planting corn and was halfway through his soybean fields when prices started sinking. \u201cAll of a sudden, things have changed pretty quickly,\u201d he said.He could have sold part or all of his spring crops in advance, but rain had been sparse. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a good mood to sell before I had a better picture of what we had planted and if the crop was off to a good start,\u201d he said.By waiting, Mr. Knopf was betting that the price of soybeans would not drop too much. But from late May to mid-June, it went from $10.41 a bushel to $8.95. Now, he had a different reason to hold off.\u201cI will tell you from an emotional standpoint, it\u2019s hard to sell or write a contract when something has just taken a big plunge,\u201d Mr. Knopf said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sell just after the price falls, so I was getting paralyzed.\u201d SUMMER 2018 Washington and Beijing seesawed through a set of punishing threats and tariffs. The first China-specific tariffs went into effect on July 6. Beijing responded by imposing tariffs on American products, including soybeans. By mid-July the price sank to $8.18 a bushel, the lowest in nearly a decade. At the same time, Midwestern farmers were contending with a drought.\u201cThe president keeps calling us farmers great patriots and keeps asking us to trust him and says that we\u2019re going to end up with a better deal,\u201d Mr. Knopf said. \u201cThat is in the back of farmers\u2019 minds. But at the same time, we can only do this for so long.\u201dMr. Trump sent out an early-morning Twitter post on July 24 that \u201cTariffs are the greatest!\u201dLater that day, the administration announced $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers.On Aug. 1, Mr. Knopf sold 2,000 bushels of soybeans at the local cash price of $8.25 a bushel. \u201cI remember thinking \u2018O.K., prices have come back some, at least we\u2019re off the lows, although they\u2019re not what they were,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI would have liked to have done much more, but I wasn\u2019t sure how many bushels we were going to raise. We were on the verge of almost having areas in the field begin to die because of the drought.\u201d The next day, tensions between China and the United States rose again, with virtually no break through most of September. On Sept. 18, after a list of Chinese goods was drawn up for a new tariff, soybeans fell to $8.14 a bushel.FALL 2018 At a United Nations Security Council session on Sept. 24, Mr. Trump accused the Chinese of trying to interfere in the midterm elections. By the time this cycle of threats, counterthreats and complaints to the World Trade Organization concluded, the United States had applied tariffs to $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China had imposed tariffs on $110 billion worth of American goods, including soybeans. A couple of weeks later, with the midterm elections a few days away, Mr. Trump offered some hope about an agreement at a meeting with Mr. Xi at the end of November. He knows there\u2019s a risk: \u201cIf nothing comes out of the G-20 summit and prices fall, I will be penalized for waiting.\u201d In any case, he hopes to have an acceptable price by the end of the year, so as to avoid further storage costs. That is also when the United States plans a further increase in tariffs on Chinese goods. There is no formula for managing the uncertainty. Farmers\u2019 responses vary widely. \u201cEveryone will have a different take,\u201d Mr. Knopf explained. \u201cSome will use market advisory services. Some depend on political persuasion, how much he trusts or doesn\u2019t trust what this administration is promising to deliver. There\u2019s also the business reality of cash flow.\u201dLOOKING AHEADOver the last six months, he has become more skeptical of the president\u2019s policies. In early June, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. It\u2019s a different approach \u2014 he\u2019s changing things up. Let\u2019s give it a try.\u201dThis week, Mr. Knopf sounded a darker tone: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of progress.\u201d Chinese tariffs on soybeans have reduced farmers\u2019 incomes, but American tariffs on foreign steel have significantly raised the costs of their machinery and equipment. \u201cWe\u2019re on the wrong end of it on both sides,\u201d he said.The growing cycle has started again, and Mr. Knopf is planning next year\u2019s crop. The meeting this week between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, he said, is \u201creally important to farmers who are already beginning to think about and make plans for spring.\u201d Without an accord by planting season, \u201cI think the mood is going to sour pretty quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cPatience will run out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before a Deal, Amazon Had to Know: Could Cuomo and De Blasio Get Along?", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a late October day, Amazon executives flew to New York to answer a final question before they committed to opening a massive technology center in Queens: Could Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio stop bickering long enough to see the project through?\u201cThey wanted to just trust-but-verify that everybody was on the same page,\u201d said Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor who was at the meeting with Mr. de Blasio.After meeting with both men separately that day, the Amazon officials decided the two Democrats could put aside their longstanding differences. Soon after, documents were exchanged, and re-exchanged, ironing out details of a package worth more than a billion dollars in tax incentives and state grants. The politicians even agreed to a plan to circumvent the City Council to prevent future roadblocks.The deal for the Queens development, in Long Island City, was announced on Tuesday, after Amazon concluded a 14-month, countrywide search for a location for a second headquarters for some 50,000 well-paid tech workers. The company, which ended up picking two sites and dividing the new workers between them, is also opening a huge corporate site in Arlington, Va., in an area across the Potomac River from Washington. Amazon said the new developments, both to be called headquarters, would require $5 billion in construction and other investments.The company also said it would develop a much smaller operations and logistics facility in Nashville, creating 5,000 jobs.The announcement capped a frenzied competition among nearly 240 communities across the country. Many politicians saw it as an opportunity to remake their city or a neighborhood for the tech era. Some economists and policymakers warned against using public money to help one of the most valuable companies in the world, and of the potential for escalating housing costs and traffic.Amazon said that the size and quality of the winners\u2019 labor pools decided the competition. Amazon was also offered more than $2 billion in tax incentives from New York and Virginia. Up to $1.2 billion of that will come from New York state\u2019s Excelsior program, a discretionary tax credit. In Virginia, the company could receive up to $550 million in cash incentives from the state by 2030, and $200 million more after that if it continues to hire. Both state programs are tied to the number of jobs the company creates \u2014 if Amazon\u2019s hiring falls short of projections, the incentive payments will be smaller.Both states have pledged to help Amazon with infrastructure upgrades, job-training programs and, in the case of New York, assistance \u201csecuring access to a helipad\u201d \u2014 some of which did not come with a price tag.Still, in New York and Virginia, most top politicians hailed the Amazon news as a major victory, and the culmination of an aggressive sales job.\u201cWe had an unprecedented opportunity to add to the number of jobs,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday.The project is a \u201ctransformational opportunity to diversify the economy\u201d of Northern Virginia, which is heavily dependent on government contracting, said Stephen Moret, president and chief executive of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.New York\u2019s sales pitch began in September 2017, immediately after Amazon began its search for a second headquarters that Mr. Bezos promised would be a \u201cfull equal to our Seattle headquarters.\u201dAmazon executives had realized that if its projections were right, the company needed a plan for its fast growth, said Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon. It made the search public because \u201cyou can\u2019t quietly talk to cities about investing $5 billion and creating 50,000 jobs,\u201d he said.Shortly after the announcement, a group of Long Island City leaders, including Elizabeth Lusskin, the president of the Long Island City Partnership, a business group, and Alan Suna, the chief executive of Silvercup Studios, a film and television studio there, were meeting to discuss their plans to bring biotech and life science companies to the neighborhood. But they quickly began talking about Amazon, according to Mr. Suna.Within a month, about 16 sites in the neighborhood had been identified, including the parcels along the waterfront eventually chosen by Amazon. The area is now a combination of public and private land that includes a distribution center for city school lunches, warehouses, studios and an outdoor bar and grill.When New York City submitted its bid to the company, just a few weeks later, Long Island City was one of four spots proposed, along with Lower Manhattan, Midtown Manhattan\u2019s West Side and an area in central Brooklyn.By January, Amazon narrowed the list to 20 locations, including New York. Amazon visited in April, July and September, said a person familiar with the meetings. The executives narrowed their search to sites on the West Side of Manhattan and in Long Island City before finally settling on the Queens neighborhood.Mr. Carney said Mr. Bezos did not tour any of the sites. The process was run by Holly Sullivan, who leads the company\u2019s worldwide economic development. John Schoettler, the executive who oversees Amazon\u2019s real estate, negotiated with the private developers.During one visit, the Amazon executives visited the Cornell Tech campus, a new high-tech school on Roosevelt Island, and took the ferry from there to Long Island City. They rode Citi Bikes as city officials and local Queens representatives showed off the area. On another occasion, they took the ferry at sunset.It wasn\u2019t until the past few weeks that things really took off.Gov. Cuomo met Amazon executives, including Jeff Wilke, who runs the company\u2019s retail business, in his offices on Third Avenue. From the window, he said, they could see the site along the waterfront Amazon would eventually select.\u201cI showed them the pictures of the progress of LaGuardia, of J.F.K., Penn Station, Kosciuszko Bridge \u2014 I explained what doubling the span means,\u201d he said, referring to building projects. He said Amazon executives were interested in having a pipeline of educated employees, not just from the top universities, but from other places such as Queens College and the nearby LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City.Amazon expressed concern about the city\u2019s planning process, which is slow and allows for local officials and the City Council to veto projects. The company\u2019s lawyers appeared to know about those pitfalls and wanted to avoid them. So Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo agreed to let the state control the approval, meaning there could be local input but no local veto. Mr. Cuomo said it was a \u201cfriendly condemnation\u201d of the city-controlled land by the state, not a source of tension.Though the mayor and governor met separately with Amazon, they were in close contact, comparing notes and strategizing over the phone, according to a person briefed on the talks.\u201cI know him so well, it\u2019s just more open and verbal,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. \u201cWhether it\u2019s good or bad.\u201dMr. de Blasio said, \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable that we made the right move.\u201dIn Virginia, the initial HQ2 announcement came as the state was wrapping up a planning process to focus its economic development on tech, as well as diversifying away from government work. The request for proposal from the company \u201chit right in the bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d said Mr. Moret of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.The proposal for Northern Virginia, one of three regions presented by Virginia, stressed regional cooperation. The Arlington neighborhoods of Crystal City and Pentagon City, as well as the adjacent Potomac Yards neighborhood in Alexandria, were rebranded into a new area, National Landing, as part of the proposal. That is the name Amazon used in its announcement on Tuesday.Then after Virginia officials submitted the proposals in October 2017, things went quiet.A few months later, Victor Hoskins, the director of Arlington Economic Development, was walking up to the stage at a conference with other development officials when their phones started buzzing with news reports that Virginia, Washington and Maryland were among Amazon\u2019s 20 finalists.\u201cIt quickly became, \u2018Hey, we got three locations in that list of 20, we\u2019ve got a good chance here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hoskins said.Amazon visited several times, at one point going up to the top of a tower, near Reagan National Airport, for a bird\u2019s-eye view of Crystal City. But it was more down to business than New York. Catering was ordered in.\u201cTalent was at the core of a tremendous amount of our conversations,\u201d Mr. Hoskins said. He said Amazon never discussed the incentives or proposals other locales offered.Mr. Carney said inside Amazon, the team running the search decided at a meeting in August that it would be easier to hire the number of workers they wanted if they split the headquarters into two. (An Amazon spokesman later said the meeting happened the first week of September.) \u201cWe also think that 25,000 as a floor is easier for the communities to absorb,\u201d Mr. Carney said.The company did not tell the cities about the split immediately. When Mr. Hoskins first heard about it, he was conflicted. \u201cYou want the 50,000, but you know what, hey, 25,000 is a huge number,\u201d he said.By early November, local officials were feeling good. A small stage went up on an empty lot in Crystal City for the announcement, only to take be taken down quickly. It was premature.After a final round to address the last details, on Monday, Mr. Moret was driving through rural Virginia when he signed the final state agreements digitally, his cell reception cutting in and out along the road.\u201cWe had a call from them just an hour after we executed it saying we won,\u201d he said.The company said it would start hiring in New York, Virginia and Tennessee next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chronicle of Life and Pain in Upstate New York", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn PhotographyBrenda Ann Kenneally\u2019s masterful new photo book, \u201cUpstate Girls: Unraveling Collar City,\u201d is a deep study of a group of girls from two or three extended families in Troy, N.Y. Most of them live in the same neighborhood, even on the same block. \u201cUpstate Girls\u201d begins in 2004, when Kenneally is drawn to the story of 14-year-old Kayla, who is pregnant. Kayla\u2019s partner is Sabrina, also 14. The baby daddy is Sabrina\u2019s cousin Joshua, and the pregnancy is a result of a casual encounter between Kayla and Joshua while Kayla and Sabrina were on the outs. But with the baby almost due and Joshua in prison, Kayla and Sabrina are back together, determined to be co-parents.Kenneally obtains permission to begin documenting their lives, and does so over the course of nine years, from 2004 to 2013. In the book, we meet parents, siblings, children, lovers, friends who move in because they have nowhere else to go. We meet Deb, Kayla\u2019s mother, and Wilhelmina, Deb\u2019s mother. We meet Big Jessie and Dana, sisters who live next door (Big Jessie is so called because Kayla has a younger brother called Little Jesse). The cast of characters sprawls out to more than two dozen, the connections ramifying, with deaths and births and marriages and breakups. Year follows year in these difficult lives. It is an immersive project, and the book, at more than 400 pages, can barely contain the material.There are boys in \u201cUpstate Girls,\u201d in addition to the girls. Infant boys who turn out to have serious social and developmental problems and are institutionalized well before puberty. Growing boys who come in and out of juvenile detention, whose hours are consumed with snacking and video games and listlessness. And there are men who never stopped being boys, who are peripheral to their families for reasons of drink or drugs, temperament or incarceration. The boys misbehave at all ages, but there\u2019s no suggestion by Kenneally that there is some straightforward explanation for their misbehavior. Like the girls, they seem more helpless than malicious, largely unable to fight back against their overwhelming circumstances.\u201cUpstate Girls\u201d is in the tradition of socially concerned photography, and it evokes ground-level studies of American poverty like \u201cLet Us Now Praise Famous Men,\u201d James Agee and Walker Evans\u2019s project on three sharecropping families in 1930s Alabama, or Dorothea Lange\u2019s photographs of the Great Depression in the American West. The vertiginous odds that control these lives, in Kenneally\u2019s telling, have everything to do with the specific history of place. In this sense, \u201cUpstate Girls\u201d might be compared to LaToya Ruby Frazier\u2019s \u201cThe Notion of Family\u201d (2014), which is about the effect of industrial pollution on her family in their hometown, Braddock, Pa.Kenneally\u2019s own biography primed her to identify with her subjects. \u201cI had become a fixture among the girls on Sixth Avenue,\u201d she writes. \u201cI was there on the afternoons when one by one they walked into Kayla\u2019s room and flung their bodies in a pile across her bed like rag dolls putting themselves away.\u201d Born in Albany, she spent much of her childhood in nearby Troy. Her family had many of the same complications that assail the families in \u201cUpstate Girls,\u201d including mental illness and alcoholism. Kenneally was pregnant at 14 and got an abortion at her mother\u2019s bidding. Now approaching 60, she is a successful artist, a winner of two World Press Photo awards and a Guggenheim fellowship. But Kenneally still sees herself in these girls. \u201cMy love for the girls was deepened by the gratitude I felt to them for returning the bad-girl part of me I\u2019d had to abandon,\u201d she writes. Jettisoning all professional detachment, she joins them on joy rides and shoplifting sprees, losing herself in \u201cthe whirlwind of activity that didn\u2019t seem attached to a bit of progress.\u201dKenneally\u2019s photographs are scrupulously unbeautiful. But the innate tenderness of young people is everywhere in the book, visible because she chooses to see it. Kenneally adopts an aesthetic reminiscent of a do-it-yourself family album. Images are laid out across the book\u2019s binding, and there are captions both handwritten and typed. Kenneally\u2019s own photographs are supplemented both by childhood snapshots of the girls and boys and by archival photos and ephemera from the local historical society. \u201cUpstate Girls\u201d contains a handful of strikingly composed photographs, but for the most part, Kenneally seems uninterested in \u201cgood\u201d photography. The images convey the sprawl and messiness of overpopulated interiors or gritty streetscapes. There\u2019s stuff everywhere, page after page, in the paradoxical plenitude of poverty: cheap clothing, packaged food, soda bottles, bedding, posters, wires, balloons, bits of trash on the ground, gaudily painted walls, lots of pink here and there, human limbs and faces and bellies (I can\u2019t recall ever seeing a book with this many pregnant bellies). There are babies and parents and lovers and dogs, and stuffed toys that remind us that these young women are still girls. Often shooting with a wide lens, neither prettying things up nor making them intentionally gross, Kenneally respects her material. It\u2019s squalid, but it\u2019s also how life sometimes is.Ingenuity and patriotism are not what come to mind in any consideration of the appalling income inequality, poor social services, deadly drug epidemics and overincarceration that make up the contemporary reality of many places like Troy. These are pictures of enmity. How can a society as wealthy as the United States so despise and so thoroughly batter its own? This darker historical story is skillfully woven into \u201cUpstate Girls.\u201d When Kenneally tells us about Kayla\u2019s brother Robert\u2019s first placement in a juvenile facility, at Vanderheyden Hall, she folds it into an account of how Vanderheyden Hall evolved out of the Troy Orphan Asylum, and how such institutions came into being. The decline of the textile industry is vividly illustrated by the fact that Kayla\u2019s mother, Deb; her grandmother Wilhelmina; and her great-grandmother all worked as sewing-machine operators at Standard Manufacturing Co. Inc. in North Troy, until Deb finally moved on to insecure jobs in retail and housekeeping.The sociological dimension of the project is impressively detailed, but I do wish Kenneally would have considered questions of race and sexuality more directly. Several of the girls are lesbian or bisexual, but this is barely addressed, except in relation to one father\u2019s intolerant Christianity. And though many of the girls (most of them white) are involved with mixed-race or black men, that also isn\u2019t discussed at all. The much higher rate of black childhood poverty in Troy, compared with the already high rate for white children, ought to have merited a mention. These omissions feel artificially apolitical.In the second half of the book, the focus turns to Tony, the boy born to Kayla at the beginning of the project. Tony\u2019s behavioral problems are severe. He has terrifying tantrums, several of which Kenneally photographs. Before the age of 7, he is found to have A.D.H.D., insomnia, bipolar disorder, separation anxiety and PTSD. Several members of the family had been given similar diagnoses when they were children, including his mother. Many of Kenneally\u2019s subjects find the world hostile and threatening. They rarely like being away from home or their loved ones. The diagnosis \u201csocial phobic\u201d recurs. Home is not easy, but there is something truly frightening about strangers: This is just one of the many ways, as Kenneally shows, that extreme poverty can limit human potential.Is there any hope? Kenneally ends the book, against all odds, on an upbeat note. She cannot console us about what we have seen, and she can\u2019t even persuade us that change is coming. But she subtly sides with hope. One girl returns to an early love and marries him. Another, in a family with no college graduates, writes an impressively self-possessed college-application essay. The final photo in \u201cUpstate Girls\u201d is of Tony at 13, almost the age Kayla was when she had him. He lies on his back on a blue background, a few yellow leaves around him, a beautiful boy. His tumultuous life, for a moment, is stilled. His face looks peaceful. And in the acknowledgments of the book, without supplying an explanation, Kenneally thanks him as her son.Teju Cole is a novelist, a photographer and the magazine\u2019s photography critic.

Faced with strong Democratic enthusiasm and fund-raising, and hindered by an unpopular president, Republicans were counting on that economic strength to lift them at the polls, or at least limit the damage.It didn\u2019t. Republicans lost in House districts with low unemployment rates. They lost in districts that have gained manufacturing jobs. They lost in districts that got big tax cuts. And they lost overwhelmingly in the kind of affluent, educated suburbs that have experienced the strongest overall recovery \u2014 and that were once among the most reliable Republican districts.Republicans had lost 30 net seats in the House as of Friday afternoon, and will probably lose a few more once all the votes are counted. It is possible, of course, that Republican losses might have been even larger were it not for the strong economy. But there was little sign of that in district-level results: Many of the Democrats\u2019 pickups came in places where the economy, at least by standard measures, is strong. All told, there was no apparent relationship between Republican candidates\u2019 performance in Tuesday\u2019s House races and the strength of the economy in those districts, an analysis of economic and electoral data shows.Analyzing the role of the economy in elections is particularly difficult in the Senate because there are fewer races and senators represent entire states, in which economic conditions can vary by area. But Tuesday\u2019s results do not appear to align with measures of state economic health.If the economy was going to save Republicans anywhere, it should have been in Minnesota\u2019s Second Congressional District, where the unemployment rate was 2.5 percent in the third quarter of the year \u2014 down a percentage point in the past two years \u2014 and where the typical household earned more than $80,000 in 2017.Ms. Craig wasn\u2019t the only Democrat who found success in a part of the country where the economy is exceptionally strong. Republican incumbents were defending eight seats that are among the 25 districts where unemployment is lowest. They lost five, including two districts each in Minnesota and Iowa, where the local unemployment rate is below 3 percent.In fact, Republican incumbents fared better on average in districts with higher unemployment rates. And while that partly reflects baked-in partisan dynamics \u2014 Republicans tend to do well in rural areas, where unemployment tends to be higher \u2014 the party\u2019s candidates also did better relative to past elections in districts where the jobless rate was higher than the national average.Democrats dominated prosperous districts, winning at least 57 of 87, by an average of nearly 25 points.When Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut late last year, they envisioned it as a centerpiece of their sales pitch for the midterms. But they may have miscalculated how potent an electoral weapon the tax law would become \u2014 against them.More broadly, Republican incumbents fared modestly worse than expected, relative to past elections, in districts where a large share of residents take that deduction.Republican incumbents lost ground to Democrats in districtswhere more people take the SALT deduction+15 pct. point swing toward DemocratsDemocrats did betterthan in past electionsDemocraticpickups+10\u00a0VA-10+50-5Democrats did worsethan in past elections-1020% taking deduction4050Republican incumbents lost ground to Democrats in districts where more people take the SALT deductionDemocrats did betterthan in past elections+10\u00a0VA-10+50-5Democrats did worsethan in past elections-1020% taking deduction40Notes: Chart shows only districts with Republican incumbents running for re-election.

Days before the vote, Representative John Culberson of Texas said the strength of the economy in his district was \u201cabsolutely\u201d resonating with voters. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re very proud of in West Houston,\u201d he said.History suggested that Republicans were being overly optimistic about the effect of the economy. In past midterm elections, economic conditions have mattered far less than presidential approval. The president\u2019s party has lost large numbers of House seats even with low unemployment several times, including in 1966 and 2006 during the administrations of Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush. Of course, things could have been worse for Republicans on election night if the economy was weak. That would have been particularly likely if, say, a recession had depressed Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Jersey Sues Pharmaceutical Company Amid Spiraling Opioid Crisis", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew Jersey officials, taking on one of the state\u2019s core industries, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson that manufactures opioids, accusing the pharmaceutical company of misleading patients about the addictive dangers posed by its drugs.It was the first time that New Jersey has brought legal action against a company based in the state as it struggles to contain a spiraling opioid addiction crisis. And it comes at a time when state attorneys general across the country have intensified their efforts to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for the epidemics of abuse.Gurbir Grewal, the New Jersey attorney general, said the subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, minimized the risks of opioid addiction in its marketing messages, targeted older people and other patients with little knowledge of opioids and mounted a campaign to \u201cembed its deceptions about the viability of long-term opioid use in the minds of doctors and patients.\u201d\u201cIt is especially troubling that so much of the alleged misconduct took place right here in our own backyard,\u201d Mr. Grewal said at a news conference announcing the legal action. \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s pharmaceutical industry is the envy of the world, with a long history of developing vital, lifesaving drugs. But we cannot turn a blind eye when a New Jersey company like Janssen violates our laws and threatens the lives of our residents.\u201dA representative for Janssen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u201cIt became a state issue because there wasn\u2019t a lot of movement on the federal level,\u201d said Lewis S. Nelson, the chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Rutgers University. \u201cTo this date, the federal government hasn\u2019t been very effective at regulating the practices of these pharmaceutical companies.\u201dIn addition to the human toll, the opioid crisis has also imposed a significant financial burden that has been largely shouldered by states, Dr. Nelson said, including paying for hospital bills, drug courts and emergency response.In New Jersey, the state also pays for opioids through public employee health plans, according to the lawsuit. New Jersey spent $178 million between 2010 and 2017 for opioid prescriptions submitted to employee health plans, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.But the lawsuit announced by Mr. Grewal represents a new front in New Jersey\u2019s battle against the scourge of opioids, targeting a company that plays a key role in the state\u2019s economy.Mr. Grewal told reporters that his office was not investigating Janssen\u2019s parent company, Johnson & Johnson, but said that additional charges could be filed. Though Janssen is one of the state\u2019s largest employers, Mr. Grewal said that did not factor into his office\u2019s decision making.\u201cWe\u2019re not shying away from holding folks accountable,\u201d Mr. Grewal said. \u201cIf they\u2019re culpable, we\u2019ll hold them accountable.\u201dThe lawsuit is similar to other lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, tracing the evolution of opioids from short-dosage painkillers in the early 1990s to drugs whose effects are more long term.\u201cJanssen joined the wave of opioid manufacturers working to persuade health care providers and patients \u2014 including the elderly and opioid-na\u00efve \u2014 that pain had been widely and improperly under-treated, and that opioid pain medications were the answer,\u201d the lawsuit says.Mr. Grewal stood beside placards displaying what his office said were examples of Janssen\u2019s fraudulent marketing campaigns for their opioid products. While Janssen sold the rights to the two drugs in 2015 for over $1 billion, Mr. Grewal said his office was focusing on the eight-year period that the company marketed the drugs.\u201cThey funded bogus research,\u201d he said. \u201cThey pushed bogus theories like pseudoaddiction, things that have been debunked. They positioned Nucynta and Nucynta ER as the safer alternative to other more powerful opioid drugs and, as the director mentioned, in fact, they were the same types of opioid drugs.\u201dThe lawsuit also pointed to disturbing trends in the prescription. Over the course of a year, one patient on a state health care plan received 125 prescriptions for two opioids, Nucynta and Nucynta ER \u2014 more than a 2,700-day supply. The prescriptions were written by a health care provider \u201cwho had received hundreds of visits from Janssen sales representatives.\u201dThe mounting legal campaigns against pharmaceutical companies, Dr. Nelson said, highlights how complicit many believe they are for the crisis.\u201cEverybody on opioids for more than a couple of weeks is dependent, only about five to 10 percent of people develop addiction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut remember, five to 10 percent of millions and millions of people is a lot of people. So, that\u2019s what the state attorneys general are really fighting against. They\u2019re fighting against the fact that all of these companies put out marketing and misinformation that these drugs don\u2019t cause addiction, don\u2019t cause dependence, don\u2019t lead to abuse.\u201d\u201cIn reality,\u201d Dr. Nelson added. \u201cLots and lots of people died using the drugs as directed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rapid Rise and Sudden Fall of Tekashi 6ix9ine", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the last two years, the Brooklyn rapper 6ix9ine has used social media to build a larger-than-life reputation as a proud public menace, a self-described \u201csuper villain\u201d whose mere presence seemed to attract drama and gun violence.That persona was an act, he said, but it put him on a path to hip-hop stardom. To gain even more credibility with his online audience, he partnered a year ago with Brooklyn men the police say are affiliated with the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods street gang.The arrest also may have saved his life: Days before the men were indicted together, Mr. Hernandez, who had recently tried to split from the gang, was warned by the F.B.I. that his one-time associates may try to kill him, his lawyer said.It was a fittingly dramatic twist for a young artist who at times seemed determined to sabotage his own rise. How Mr. Hernandez went from a lost Brooklyn teen, to a viral social media star, to an accused violent member of the Nine Trey Bloods is a cautionary tale for hip-hop, particularly as the genre scouts its next stars from the internet.Mr. Hernandez\u2019s rapid ascent \u2014 cataloged daily online \u2014 was tailor made for a new generation of web-savvy fans hooked on nonmusical content. The rowdy, scream-along tracks that 6ix9ine (pronounced six-nine) did make were more a symptom of his online success than the impetus for his fame: Mr. Hernandez only began rapping after he had achieved a taste of internet notoriety, and he appeared to pursue gang life to bolster his musical endeavors.It was an inflammatory approach in a rap business stuck between an old school of hip-hop in which street cred still matters and a new wave of artists for whom clout on internet platforms has become a pathway to success. For some rap stars, gang life was an unavoidable means of survival, and music offered a way out. For Mr. Hernandez, who also goes by the name Tekashi69, it was reversed: Gang affiliations lent authenticity to a rap career rooted more in sensationalism than in biography or in raw talent.For his critics, 6ix9ine represented the worst-case scenario of millennial hip-hop: a digital brand built around bravado and violence, with little notion that the act could have real-life repercussions.He added: \u201cAll of these things that you all are glorifying, they\u2019ve been killing our community for years. Now it just looks different on social media.\u201dIn the courtroom, where Mr. Hernandez has repeatedly appeared since 2015, he has argued that the gangland character of 6ix9ine was just that \u2014 an exaggerated artistic act. In reality, Mr. Hernandez said, he was \u201cDanny,\u201d a nice kid from Brooklyn, who had struck gold by stoking beef and acting tough.\u201cThe scumbag persona is just for shock value,\u201d he said.His lawyer, Lance Lazzaro, has contended that the associates who once lent 6ix9ine muscle and credibility were the real criminals in the picture. On Monday, Mr. Hernandez pleaded not guilty.\u201cAn entertainer who portrays a \u2018gangster image\u2019 to promote his music does not make him a member of an enterprise,\u201d Mr. Lazzaro said in a statement. \u201cMr. Hernandez became a victim of this enterprise and later took steps by firing employees.\u201dIt may have been too late.Danny Hernandez was a first-generation New Yorker, born in 1996 to a Mexican immigrant mother and a Puerto Rican father. A difficult childhood was upended at 13, when his father was murdered a block from the family\u2019s home.\u201cMy pops died in eighth grade, and I just started bugging in school,\u201d he told the No Jumper podcast, a popular hip-hop show, last year. \u201cI was 13. I was waiting for my pops to come back home, and he never came.\u201d Mr. Hernandez soon dropped out of school.He and his brother worked odd jobs to support their mother and eventually turned to selling drugs on the street, he said. Across his teenage years, as he fell in and out of trouble with the law, Mr. Hernandez began inventing an alter ego inspired by Japanese anime: Tekashi69.With brash stunts and offensive overtures, Mr. Hernandez amassed a curious legion of followers. His first viral \u201cmoment,\u201d he recalled, was an Instagram photo of himself on a city street, wearing a robelike sweatshirt emblazoned with racial and sexual slurs. He eventually had the number 69, with its sexual connotation, tattooed on his body more than 200 times.Though long a fan of hip-hop and heavy metal, which he would later combine in a compelling package, it was only after 6ix9ine achieved a fan base on Instagram, where he eventually collected more than 15 million followers, that he pivoted to music.\u201cI didn\u2019t really want to be a rapper or whatever,\u201d he told the No Jumper podcast. \u201cI just thought of making music because everybody was like: \u2018You look mad cool.\u2019\u201dBut his relentless search for shocking material soon landed him in trouble.Just before his 19th birthday, Mr. Hernandez was arrested on charges of using a child in a sexual performance. He eventually pleaded guilty. According to a statement he made to the police in March 2015, Mr. Hernandez met a man at a recording studio who seemed to have \u201ca lot of money\u201d and followed him to a gathering in Harlem.There, the group filmed a video with a 13-year-old girl that was posted to Mr. Hernandez\u2019s Instagram, in which other men had sex with her while Mr. Hernandez touched her and mugged for the camera. He later told the police he believed the girl was 19.\u201cI was doing it for my image,\u201d he said.As part of his plea deal, Mr. Hernandez agreed to stay out of trouble for two years, get his high school equivalency diploma, attend therapy, and avoid posting any sexual or violent images to social media.It was after this brush with the law that Mr. Hernandez turned increasingly to rap.Had Mr. Hernandez stayed on that track, he may have avoided the precipice on which his career \u2014 and life \u2014 now balances. Instead, Mr. Hernandez returned to Brooklyn after his tour with a pile of cash and struck up a partnership with a local member of the Bloods.Asked how he met Mr. Hernandez and became his unofficial manager, Kifano Jordan, better known as Shotti (or Shottie), could only chuckle.For whatever genuine camaraderie existed between the two, the arrangement was a mutually beneficial business venture at heart. 6ix9ine needed the street cred and security that Mr. Jordan and his friends could offer; for Mr. Jordan, 6ix9ine represented a rainbow-headed cash cow. In less than a year, they began charging $100,000 per show, up from $1,000.The partnership marked a new artistic and personal chapter for 6ix9ine. Once lauded for his edgy, almost gothic videos and musicality, he inched toward more traditional street rap and frequently insulted rival rappers online. The video for 6ix9ine\u2019s single \u201cGummo,\u201d which would go on to be viewed more than 300 million times on YouTube, was a visual testament to Mr. Jordan\u2019s influence \u2014 the entire cast sports red bandannas, a homage to the Bloods.The pair became almost inseparable. In shrieking vocals, Mr. Hernandez developed a new calling card, wailing Mr. Jordan\u2019s \u201cTreyway!\u201d catchphrase as a battle cry in songs and live-streamed videos.At the same time, 6ix9ine was becoming the most controversial \u2014 and in-demand \u2014 character in rap, with blogs breathlessly following his every move and more established artists jumping on board. Fans debated the legitimacy of his gang affiliations, the morality of supporting a sex offender, and 6ix9ine\u2019s penchant for baiting other artists, like Chief Keef and YG, through social media.But in a streaming-based music economy, controversies meant listeners. 6ix9ine never hired a publicist, yet he landed 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100.Mr. Hernandez\u2019s accelerated route to fame was anything but smooth. As his earning potential grew, tension simmered between Mr. Jordan\u2019s street crew, which wanted to guide 6ix9ine\u2019s career, and his legitimate industry team, which imagined him as a mainstream star.The problem for Mr. Hernandez was that his Brooklyn associates were not simply business partners to be placated. Mr. Jordan and his clique, according to prosecutors, had long rap sheets and were prone to violence.On the night in July that 6ix9ine released his most successful song to date \u2014 the three-times-platinum \u201cFefe,\u201d with Nicki Minaj \u2014 he was kidnapped on his way home from a video shoot and robbed of his jewelry. He later referred to his escape as divine intervention. This month, a former Treyway associate who was believed to be disgruntled was charged with the crime.Still, 6ix9ine had flaunted his street bona fides and Teflon nature in public, often daring rivals to \u201ctest my gangster,\u201d and continued the tough talk that was part of his brand. \u201cI\u2019m ready to die and I\u2019m ready to kill,\u201d he told Charlamagne early this year.Prosecutors say those words were not an act. In April, they alleged, Mr. Hernandez was with Mr. Jordan when the crew committed an armed robbery near Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. Prosecutors also said Mr. Hernandez was involved in two shootings in Brooklyn later in the summer.The tension reached a crescendo this fall, after Mr. Hernandez\u2019s much-delayed sentencing hearing in the sex crimes case. While ruling that Mr. Hernandez\u2019s multiple small-time arrests and various antics over the last year did not violate his plea agreement, the judge instructed the rapper to stay away from known gang members \u2014 or risk prison.He planned to meet Mr. Grainge, the head of his label, for lunch at Philippe in Manhattan to celebrate.When Shotti and others arrived at the restaurant, too, they were rebuffed by Mr. Grainge\u2019s security \u2014 the judge, after all, had just told Mr. Hernandez to keep his distance. But a scuffle ensued, ending with a security guard shooting one of Shotti\u2019s associates, who was wounded but survived (and was indicted with the group). Shotti later turned himself in to the police and was charged with assault in the incident.After that, the relationship between 6ix9ine and his street mentor deteriorated quickly. In an interview with \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d days before his arrest, 6ix9ine said he had fired everyone except Mr. Grainge and attributed the split mostly to money: He had booked a national tour, but did not feel he was getting his rightful share. He also invoked the July robbery.\u201cI knew how strong my team was \u2014 nobody could touch me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way you could touch me is if you were already next to me.\u201dThe next day, 6ix9ine appeared via live video on Instagram and declared, \u201c[Expletive] Treyway.\u201d Later that afternoon, Shotti posted a video to his own account, smirking in two Treyway chains and listening to 6ix9ine\u2019s music. He mouthed along as the rapper shouted out the crew he had just disowned: \u201cTreyway!\u201dOffline, 6ix9ine was meeting with F.B.I. agents, who had picked up on wiretaps that his former crew wanted to \u201csuper violate\u201d him for his disrespect, an expression authorities took as a threat to the rapper\u2019s life, his lawyer said. They offered him round-the-clock protection against Shotti and his associates, but 6ix9ine declined.By Monday, they were all in federal custody. This week, prosecutors said they had obtained a warrant for the same Instagram account that brought Mr. Hernandez to prominence, calling it \u201cquite voluminous.\u201dFor now, his future remains uncertain. Even if Mr. Hernandez finds leniency in the racketeering case, a conviction would likely be a violation of his probationary terms, which could lead to jail time. His supporters worry about his safety behind bars.\u201cYou can\u2019t come into the rap game and then turn around and decide you want to be a gangster,\u201d said Charlamagne, one of the many fans, potential mentors, media personalities and industry hands who tried to guide 6ix9ine toward safer ground. \u201cYou get to a certain point, and you\u2019ve either got to evolve or die.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Land That Failed to Fail", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "They didn\u2019t like the West\u2019s playbook. So they wrote their own.The West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It\u2019s still waiting.In the uncertain years after Mao\u2019s death, long before China became an industrial juggernaut, before the Communist Party went on a winning streak that would reshape the world, a group of economics students gathered at a mountain retreat outside Shanghai. There, in the bamboo forests of Moganshan, the young scholars grappled with a pressing question: How could China catch up with the West?The students and researchers attending the Academic Symposium of Middle-Aged and Young Economists wanted to unleash market forces but worried about crashing the economy \u2014 and alarming the party bureaucrats and ideologues who controlled it.Late one night, they reached a consensus: Factories should meet state quotas but sell anything extra they made at any price they chose. It was a clever, quietly radical proposal to undercut the planned economy \u2014 and it intrigued a young party official in the room who had no background in economics. \u201cAs they were discussing the problem, I didn\u2019t say anything at all,\u201d recalled Xu Jing\u2019an, now 76 and retired. \u201cI was thinking, how do we make this work?\u201dHow China became a superpowerThe Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation. The proposal that Mr. Xu took from the mountain retreat, soon adopted as government policy, was a pivotal early step in this astounding transformation.China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.An epochal contest is underway. With President Xi Jinping pushing a more assertive agenda overseas and tightening controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war and is gearing up for what could be a new Cold War. Meanwhile, in Beijing the question these days is less how to catch up with the West than how to pull ahead \u2014 and how to do so in a new era of American hostility.The pattern is familiar to historians, a rising power challenging an established one, with a familiar complication: For decades, the United States encouraged and aided China\u2019s rise, working with its leaders and its people to build the most important economic partnership in the world, one that has lifted both nations.During this time, eight American presidents assumed, or hoped, that China would eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization: Prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring China into the fold of democratic nations. Or the Chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot.But neither happened. Instead, China\u2019s Communist leaders have defied expectations again and again. They embraced capitalism even as they continued to call themselves Marxists. They used repression to maintain power but without stifling entrepreneurship or innovation. Surrounded by foes and rivals, they avoided war, with one brief exception, even as they fanned nationalist sentiment at home. And they presided over 40 years of uninterrupted growth, often with unorthodox policies the textbooks said would fail.In late September, the People\u2019s Republic of China marked a milestone, surpassing the Soviet Union in longevity. Days later, it celebrated a record 69 years of Communist rule. And China may be just hitting its stride \u2014 a new superpower with an economy on track to become not just the world\u2019s largest but, quite soon, the largest by a wide margin.The world thought it could change China, and in many ways it has. But China\u2019s success has been so spectacular that it has just as often changed the world \u2014 and the American understanding of how the world works.There is no simple explanation for how China\u2019s leaders pulled this off. There was foresight and luck, skill and violent resolve, but perhaps most important was the fear \u2014 a sense of crisis among Mao\u2019s successors that they never shook, and that intensified after the Tiananmen Square massacre and the collapse of the Soviet Union.Even as they put the disasters of Mao\u2019s rule behind them, China\u2019s Communists studied and obsessed over the fate of their old ideological allies in Moscow, determined to learn from their mistakes. They drew two lessons: The party needed to embrace \u201creform\u201d to survive \u2014 but \u201creform\u201d must never include democratization.China has veered between these competing impulses ever since, between opening up and clamping down, between experimenting with change and resisting it, always pulling back before going too far in either direction for fear of running aground.Many people said that the party would fail, that this tension between openness and repression would be too much for a nation as big as China to sustain. But it may be precisely why China soared.Whether it can continue to do so with the United States trying to stop it is another question entirely.None of the participants at the Moganshan conference could have predicted how China would take off, much less the roles they would play in the boom ahead. They had come of age in an era of tumult, almost entirely isolated from the rest of the world, with little to prepare them for the challenge they faced. To succeed, the party had to both reinvent its ideology and reprogram its best and brightest to carry it out.Mr. Xu, for example, had graduated with a degree in journalism on the eve of Mao\u2019s violent Cultural Revolution, during which millions of people were purged, persecuted and killed. He spent those years at a \u201ccadre school\u201d doing manual labor and teaching Marxism in an army unit. After Mao\u2019s death, he was assigned to a state research institute tasked with fixing the economy. His first job was figuring out how to give factories more power to make decisions, a subject he knew almost nothing about. Yet he went on to a distinguished career as an economic policymaker, helping launch China\u2019s first stock market in Shenzhen.Among the other young participants in Moganshan were Zhou Xiaochuan, who would later lead China\u2019s central bank for 15 years; Lou Jiwei, who ran China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and recently stepped down as finance minister; and an agricultural policy specialist named Wang Qishan, who rose higher than any of them.Mr. Wang headed China\u2019s first investment bank and helped steer the nation through the Asian financial crisis. As Beijing\u2019s mayor, he hosted the 2008 Olympics. Then he oversaw the party\u2019s recent high-stakes crackdown on corruption. Now he is China\u2019s vice president, second in authority only to Xi Jinping, the party\u2019s leader.The careers of these men from Moganshan highlight an important aspect of China\u2019s success: It turned its apparatchiks into capitalists.Bureaucrats who were once obstacles to growth became engines of growth. Officials devoted to class warfare and price controls began chasing investment and promoting private enterprise. Every day now, the leader of a Chinese district, city or province makes a pitch like the one Yan Chaojun made at a business forum in September.It was a remarkable act of reinvention, one that eluded the Soviets. In both China and the Soviet Union, vast Stalinist bureaucracies had smothered economic growth, with officials who wielded unchecked power resisting change that threatened their privileges.Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, tried to break the hold of these bureaucrats on the economy by opening up the political system. Decades later, Chinese officials still take classes on why that was a mistake. The party even produced a documentary series on the subject in 2006, distributing it on classified DVDs for officials at all levels to watch.Afraid to open up politically but unwilling to stand still, the party found another way. It moved gradually and followed the pattern of the compromise at Moganshan, which left the planned economy intact while allowing a market economy to flourish and outgrow it.Party leaders called this go-slow, experimental approach \u201ccrossing the river by feeling the stones\u201d \u2014 allowing farmers to grow and sell their own crops, for example, while retaining state ownership of the land; lifting investment restrictions in \u201cspecial economic zones,\u201d while leaving them in place in the rest of the country; or introducing privatization by selling only minority stakes in state firms at first.\u201cThere was resistance,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cSatisfying the reformers and the opposition was an art.\u201dAmerican economists were skeptical. Market forces needed to be introduced quickly, they argued; otherwise, the bureaucracy would mobilize to block necessary changes. After a visit to China in 1988, the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman called the party\u2019s strategy \u201can open invitation to corruption and inefficiency.\u201dBut China had a strange advantage in battling bureaucratic resistance. The nation\u2019s long economic boom followed one of the darkest chapters of its history, the Cultural Revolution, which decimated the party apparatus and left it in shambles. In effect, autocratic excess set the stage for Mao\u2019s eventual successor, Deng Xiaoping, to lead the party in a radically more open direction.That included sending generations of young party officials to the United States and elsewhere to study how modern economies worked. Sometimes they enrolled in universities, sometimes they found jobs, and sometimes they went on brief \u201cstudy tours.\u201d When they returned, the party promoted their careers and arranged for others to learn from them.At the same time, the party invested in education, expanding access to schools and universities, and all but eliminating illiteracy. Many critics focus on the weaknesses of the Chinese system \u2014 the emphasis on tests and memorization, the political constraints, the discrimination against rural students. But mainland China now produces more graduates in science and engineering every year than the United States, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan combined.Another explanation for the party\u2019s transformation lies in bureaucratic mechanics. Analysts sometimes say that China embraced economic reform while resisting political reform. But in reality, the party made changes after Mao\u2019s death that fell short of free elections or independent courts yet were nevertheless significant.The party introduced term limits and mandatory retirement ages, for example, making it easier to flush out incompetent officials. And it revamped the internal report cards it used to evaluate local leaders for promotions and bonuses, focusing them almost exclusively on concrete economic targets.As the economy flourished, officials with a single-minded focus on growth often ignored widespread pollution, violations of labor standards, and tainted food and medical supplies. They were rewarded with soaring tax revenues and opportunities to enrich their friends, their relatives and themselves. A wave of officials abandoned the state and went into business. Over time, the party elite amassed great wealth, which cemented its support for the privatization of much of the economy it once controlled.\u201cI basically don\u2019t see them even once a year,\u201d said James Ni, chairman and founder of Mlily, a mattress manufacturer in eastern China. \u201cI\u2019m creating jobs, generating tax revenue. Why should they bother me?\u201dIn recent years, President Xi has sought to assert the party\u2019s authority inside private firms. He has also bolstered state-owned enterprises with subsidies while preserving barriers to foreign competition. And he has endorsed demands that American companies surrender technology in exchange for market access.In doing so, he is betting that the Chinese state has changed so much that it should play a leading role in the economy \u2014 that it can build and run \u201cnational champions\u201d capable of outcompeting the United States for control of the high-tech industries of the future. But he has also provoked a backlash in Washington.He is the party\u2019s most powerful leader since Deng and the son of a senior official who served Deng, but even as he wraps himself in Deng\u2019s legacy, Mr. Xi has set himself apart in an important way: Deng encouraged the party to seek help and expertise overseas, but Mr. Xi preaches self-reliance and warns of the threats posed by \u201chostile foreign forces.\u201dIn other words, he appears to have less use for the \u201copening up\u201d part of Deng\u2019s slogan.Of the many risks that the party took in its pursuit of growth, perhaps the biggest was letting in foreign investment, trade and ideas. It was an exceptional gamble by a country once as isolated as North Korea is today, and it paid off in an exceptional way: China tapped into a wave of globalization sweeping the world and emerged as the world\u2019s factory. China\u2019s embrace of the internet, within limits, helped make it a leader in technology. And foreign advice helped China reshape its banks, build a legal system and create modern corporations.The party prefers a different narrative these days, presenting the economic boom as \u201cgrown out of the soil of China\u201d and primarily the result of its leadership. But this obscures one of the great ironies of China\u2019s rise \u2014 that Beijing\u2019s former enemies helped make it possible.The United States and Japan, both routinely vilified by party propagandists, became major trading partners and were important sources of aid, investment and expertise. The real game changers, though, were people like Tony Lin, a factory manager who made his first trip to the mainland in 1988.Mr. Lin was born and raised in Taiwan, the self-governing island where those who lost the Chinese civil war fled after the Communist Revolution. As a schoolboy, he was taught that mainland China was the enemy.But in the late 1980s, the sneaker factory he managed in central Taiwan was having trouble finding workers, and its biggest customer, Nike, suggested moving some production to China. Mr. Lin set aside his fears and made the trip. What he found surprised him: a large and willing work force, and officials so eager for capital and know-how that they offered the use of a state factory free and a five-year break on taxes.Mr. Lin spent the next decade shuttling to and from southern China, spending months at a time there and returning home only for short breaks to see his wife and children. He built and ran five sneaker factories, including Nike\u2019s largest Chinese supplier.\u201cChina\u2019s policies were tremendous,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey were like a sponge absorbing water, money, technology, everything.\u201dMr. Lin was part of a torrent of investment from ethnic Chinese enclaves in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and beyond that washed over China \u2014 and gave it a leg up on other developing countries. Without this diaspora, some economists argue, the mainland\u2019s transformation might have stalled at the level of a country like Indonesia or Mexico.The timing worked out for China, which opened up just as Taiwan was outgrowing its place in the global manufacturing chain. China benefited from Taiwan\u2019s money, but also its managerial experience, technology and relationships with customers around the world. In effect, Taiwan jump-started capitalism in China and plugged it into the global economy.Before long, the government in Taiwan began to worry about relying so much on its onetime enemy and tried to shift investment elsewhere. But the mainland was too cheap, too close and, with a common language and heritage, too familiar. Mr. Lin tried opening factories in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia but always came back to China.Now Taiwan finds itself increasingly dependent on a much more powerful China, which is pushing ever harder for unification, and the island\u2019s future is uncertain.There are echoes of Taiwan\u2019s predicament around the world, where many are having second thoughts about how they rushed to embrace Beijing with trade and investment.Over lunch at a luxurious private club on the 50th floor of an apartment tower in central Beijing, one of China\u2019s most successful real estate tycoons explained why he had left his job at a government research center after the crackdown on the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square.\u201cIt was very easy,\u201d said Feng Lun, the chairman of Vantone Holdings, which manages a multibillion-dollar portfolio of properties around the world. \u201cOne day, I woke up and everyone had run away. So I ran, too.\u201dUntil the soldiers opened fire, he said, he had planned to spend his entire career in the civil service. Instead, as the party was pushing out those who had sympathized with the students, he joined the exodus of officials who started over as entrepreneurs in the 1990s.\u201cAt the time, if you held a meeting and told us to go into business, we wouldn\u2019t have gone,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo this incident, it unintentionally planted seeds in the market economy.\u201dSuch has been the seesaw pattern of the party\u2019s success.The pro-democracy movement in 1989 was the closest the party ever came to political liberalization after Mao\u2019s death, and the crackdown that followed was the furthest it went in the other direction, toward repression and control. After the massacre, the economy stalled and retrenchment seemed certain. Yet three years later, Deng used a tour of southern China to wrestle the party back to \u201creform and opening up\u201d once more.Many who had left the government, like Mr. Feng, suddenly found themselves leading the nation\u2019s transformation from the outside, as its first generation of private entrepreneurs.Now Mr. Xi is steering the party toward repression again, tightening its grip on society, concentrating power in his own hands and setting himself up to rule for life by abolishing the presidential term limit. Will the party loosen up again, as it did a few years after Tiananmen, or is this a more permanent shift? If it is, what will it mean for the Chinese economic miracle?The fear is that Mr. Xi is attempting to rewrite the recipe behind China\u2019s rise, replacing selective repression with something more severe.The internet is an example of how it has benefited by striking a balance. The party let the nation go online with barely an inkling of what that might mean, then reaped the economic benefits while controlling the spread of information that could hurt it.Panicked officials considered shutting down the most popular service, Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, but the authorities were afraid of how the public would respond. In the end, they let Weibo stay open but invested much more in tightening controls and ordered companies to do the same.The compromise worked. Now, many companies assign hundreds of employees to censorship duties \u2014 and China has become a giant on the global internet landscape.\u201cThe cost of censorship is quite limited compared to the great value created by the internet,\u201d said Chen Tong, an industry pioneer. \u201cWe still get the information we need for economic progress.\u201dChina is not the only country that has squared the demands of authoritarian rule with the needs of free markets. But it has done so for longer, at greater scale and with more convincing results than any other.The question now is whether it can sustain this model with the United States as an adversary rather than a partner.The trade war has only just begun. And it is not just a trade war. American warships and planes are challenging Chinese claims to disputed waters with increasing frequency even as China keeps ratcheting up military spending. And Washington is maneuvering to counter Beijing\u2019s growing influence around the world, warning that a Chinese spending spree on global infrastructure comes with strings attached.The two nations may yet reach some accommodation. But both left and right in America have portrayed China as the champion of an alternative global order, one that embraces autocratic values and undermines fair competition. It is a rare consensus for the United States, which is deeply divided about so much else, including how it has wielded power abroad in recent decades \u2014 and how it should do so now.Mr. Xi, on the other hand, has shown no sign of abandoning what he calls \u201cthe great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d Some in his corner have been itching to take on the United States since the 2008 financial crisis and see the Trump administration\u2019s policies as proof of what they have always suspected \u2014 that America is determined to keep China down.At the same time, there is also widespread anxiety over the new acrimony, because the United States has long inspired admiration and envy in China, and because of a gnawing sense that the party\u2019s formula for success may be faltering.Prosperity has brought rising expectations in China; the public wants more than just economic growth. It wants cleaner air, safer food and medicine, better health care and schools, less corruption and greater equality. The party is struggling to deliver, and tweaks to the report cards it uses to measure the performance of officials hardly seem enough.\u201cThe basic problem is, who is growth for?\u201d said Mr. Xu, the retired official who wrote the Moganshan report. \u201cWe haven\u2019t solved this problem.\u201dGrowth has begun to slow, which may be better for the economy in the long term but could shake public confidence. The party is investing ever more in censorship to control discussion of the challenges the nation faces: widening inequality, dangerous debt levels, an aging population.In effect, Mr. Xi seems to believe that China has been so successful that the party can return to a more conventional authoritarian posture \u2014 and that to survive and surpass the United States it must.Certainly, the momentum is still with the party. Over the past four decades, economic growth in China has been 10 times faster than in the United States, and it is still more than twice as fast. The party appears to enjoy broad public support, and many around the world are convinced that Mr. Trump\u2019s America is in retreat while China\u2019s moment is just beginning.Then again, China has a way of defying expectations.Philip P.

But I was surprised how massive the Republican turnout was in response.The Republicans who flooded to the polls weren\u2019t college-educated suburbanites. Those people voted for Democrats this year.They weren\u2019t tax-cut fanatics. Half of the Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee either left Congress, ran for other offices or were defeated.They weren\u2019t even small-government Republicans. The same red states that elected conservatives to office also \u2014 in Nebraska, Idaho and Utah \u2014 approved ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid. The same red states that elected conservatives also approved initiatives \u2014 in Arkansas and Missouri \u2014 to raise the minimum wage.These were high-school-educated, working-class Republicans.A lot of us pundits said Donald Trump should run a positive campaign bragging about all the economic growth. But Trump ran another American carnage campaign. That\u2019s because American life still feels like carnage to many.This is still a country in which nearly 20 percent of prime-age American men are not working full time. This is still a country in which only 37 percent of adults expect children to be better off financially than they are. This is still a country in which millions of new jobs are through \u201calternative work arrangements\u201d like contracting or consulting \u2014 meaning no steady salary, no predictable hours and no security.Part of the problem is misplaced priorities. For the last several decades, American economic policy has been pinioned on one goal: expanding G.D.P. We measure G.D.P. We talk incessantly about economic growth. Between 1975 and 2015, American G.D.P. increased threefold. But what good is that growth if it means that a thick slice of America is discarded for efficiency reasons?Similarly, for the last several decades American, welfare policy has focused on consumption \u2014 giving money to the poor so they can consume more. Yet we have not successfully helped poor people produce more so that they can take control of their own lives. We now spend more than $20,000 a year in means-tested government spending per person in poverty. And yet the average poverty rate for 2000 to 2015 was higher than it was for 1970 to 1985.\u201cWhat if people\u2019s ability to produce matters more than how much they can consume?\u201d Cass asks.The bulk of his book is a series of ideas for how we can reform labor markets.For example, Cass supports academic tracking. Right now, we have a one-size-fits-all education system. Everybody should go to college. The problem is that roughly one-fifth of our students fail to graduate high school in four years; roughly one-fifth take no further schooling after high school; roughly one-fifth drop out of college; roughly one-fifth get a job that doesn\u2019t require the degree they just earned; and roughly one-fifth actually navigate the path the system is built around \u2014 from school to career.We build a broken system and then ask people to try to fit into the system instead of tailoring a system around people\u2019s actual needs.Cass suggests that we instead do what nearly every other affluent nation does: Let students, starting in high school, decide whether they want to be on an apprenticeship track or an academic track. Vocational and technical schools are ubiquitous across the developed world, and yet that model is mostly rejected here.Cass also supports worker co-ops. Today, we have an old, adversarial labor union model that is inappropriate for the gig economy and uninteresting to most private-sector workers. But co-ops, drawing on more successful models used in several European nations, could represent workers in negotiations, train and retrain workers as they moved from firm to firm and build a safety net for periods of unemployment. Shopping for a worker co-op would be more like buying a gym membership. Each co-op would be a community and service provider to address a range of each worker\u2019s needs.Cass has many other proposals \u2014 wage subsidies, immigration reforms. But he\u2019s really trying to put work, and the dignity of work, at the center of our culture and concern. In the 1970s and 1980s, he points out, the Emmy Award-winning TV shows were about blue-collar families: \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d \u201cTaxi,\u201d \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cThe Wonder Years.\u201d Now the Emmy-winning shows are mostly about white-collar adults working in Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, New York and Washington.We in the college-educated sliver have built a culture, an economy and a political system that are all about ourselves. It\u2019s time to pass labor market reforms that will make life decent for everybody.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justice Department Charges Chinese Company With Espionage", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Justice charged a Chinese state-owned company, its Taiwanese partner and three individuals on Thursday with stealing trade secrets from an American technology company, the latest move by the Trump administration to crack down on China\u2019s \u201ceconomic espionage.\u201dThe Justice Department unveiled charges against Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, United Microelectronics Corporation, a Taiwanese semiconductor company, and three Taiwanese nationals. They are accused of conspiring to steal technology from Micron Technology, an Idaho-based chip maker that does extensive business in Asia.\u201cAs this and other recent cases have shown, Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing \u2014 and it has been increasing rapidly,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. \u201cI am here to say that enough is enough.\u201dAccording to the Justice Department, a former executive of a Micron subsidiary left the company in 2015 and went to work for United Microelectronics Corporation in Taiwan. When he made the switch, the government alleges, he recruited two former colleagues to steal up to $8.75 billion in trade secrets from Micron. United Microeletronics then partnered with Jinhua, transferring the information to the Chinese market.Jinhua is opening a $5.7 billion factory in China\u2019s Fujian Province and has become increasingly ambitious in its desire to become a global player in the memory chip business.The Justice Department said the companies could face fines of more than $20 billion and the people accused could face 15 years in prison and $5 million fines.The Micron case and the other recent indictments show the Chinese government that \u201cwe notice what they\u2019re doing,\u201d John C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, said during a news conference on Thursday. The ultimate goal, he said, is \u201cnot to have a fight with China,\u201d but to get Beijing to use legal methods to improve its economy.The charges come just weeks before President Trump is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina. The White House has been pressing China to lower its trade barriers and stop the theft of intellectual property from American businesses, and has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese imports as part of a campaign to get China to change its ways.On Tuesday, Justice Department officials unsealed an indictment that accused two Chinese intelligence officers and five hackers of repeatedly penetrating corporate computer systems to steal intellectual property and other information about the aerospace industry.\u201cNo country presents a broader, more severe threat to our ideas, our innovation and our economic security than China,\u201d Christopher A.

{"Headline": "Their Soybeans Piling Up, Farmers Hope Trade War Ends Before Beans Rot", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "North Dakota\u2019s soybean crops are flourishing. But China has stopped buying. Supported byARTHUR, N.D. \u2014 This is harvest season in the rich farmlands of the eastern Dakotas, the time of year Kevin Karel checks his computer first thing in the morning to see how many of his soybeans Chinese companies have purchased while he was sleeping.Farmers here in Cass County have prospered over the last two decades by growing more soybeans than any other county in the United States, and by shipping most of those beans across the Pacific Ocean to feed Chinese pigs and chickens.But this year, the Chinese have all but stopped buying. The largest market for one of America\u2019s largest exports has shut its doors. The Chinese government imposed a tariff on American soybeans in response to the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods. The latest federal data, through mid-October, shows American soybean sales to China have declined by 94 percent from last year\u2019s harvest.Mr. Karel, the general manager of the Arthur Companies, which operates six grain elevators in eastern North Dakota, has started to pile one million bushels of soybeans on a clear patch of ground behind some of his grain silos. The big mound of yellowish-white beans, already one of the taller hills in this flat part of the world, will then be covered with tarps.The hope is that prices will rise before the beans rot.\u201cWe\u2019re sitting on the edge of our seat,\u201d Mr. Karel said.China and other trading partners hit with the tariffs, including the European Union, have sought to maximize the political impact of their reprisals. The European Union imposed tariffs on bourbon, produced in Kentucky, the home state of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, from Wisconsin, the home state of House Speaker Paul Ryan. China's decision to impose tariffs on soybeans squeezes some of Mr. Trump's staunchest supporters across the Midwestern farm belt.Both Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China have declared their desire to reduce trade barriers. Like most successful American exports, soybeans are produced at high efficiency by a small number of workers using cutting-edge technologies, like tractors connected to satellites so the optimal mix of fertilizers can be spread on each square foot of farmland. The United States exported $26 billion in soybeans last year, and more than half went to China. Some farmers in North Dakota say they trust Mr. Trump to negotiate in the nation\u2019s interest. Mr. Karel said many of his customers wear red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps and insist that the pain of lost business and lower profits is worthwhile. They say they\u2019ll suffer now so their children benefit later \u2014 echoing the argument Mr. Trump has made.Others are less enthused. Greg Gebeke, who farms 5,000 acres outside Arthur with two of his brothers, said he struggled to understand the administration\u2019s goals.\u201cI\u2019m trying to follow and figure out who the winners are in this tariff war,\u201d Mr. Gebeke said. \u201cI know who one of the losers are and that\u2019s us. And that\u2019s painful.\u201dNorth Dakota\u2019s soybean industry was created by Chinese demand for the beans, which are crushed to make feed for animals and oil for human consumption.In the mid-1990s, there were 450,000 acres of soybeans in the state. Last year, there were 6.4 million. As the state\u2019s production of soybeans increased, companies spent millions of dollars on larger grain elevators, on the 110-car trains that carry the soybeans west to the Pacific Coast, on bigger terminals at the ports. A few years ago, Mr. Gebeke traded his grain drill, used to plant wheat, for a second machine to plant soybeans.The Arthur Companies in 2016 opened a shiny drying, storage and loading facility that can hold 2.7 million bushels of beans waiting for the next train.The soybean industry\u2019s sales pitch emphasized the reliability of American infrastructure and the political stability of the United States. The message was that the Chinese could be confident that American farmers would deliver high quality soybeans.\u201cI\u2019ve been to China 25 times in the last decade talking about the dependability of U.S. soybeans,\u201d said Kirk Leeds, the chief executive of the Iowa Soybean Association. By undermining that reputation, he said, \u201cwe have done long-term damage to the industry.\u201dThe last two decades were a fat season in the soybean belt. The grain silos and pickup trucks in Cass County are shiny and new. Mr. Karel said a significant number of the farmers who sell crops to his company had done so well they purchased winter homes around Phoenix.As China swallows the world\u2019s supply of non-American soybeans, other countries are buying more beans from the United States, especially European nations that usually import beans from Brazil.Some nations that grow soybeans, like Canada, are shipping their own beans to China at high prices and then buying American beans at lower prices to meet domestic demand. Taiwan, seeking to curry favor, signed a deal to buy more American soybeans over the next two years.Some analysts predict China will be forced to buy more American beans after it exhausts other sources. Others are hopeful that China and the United States will reach a deal to remove the tariffs.But waiting carries risks. Soybeans can spoil, and Brazil harvests its crop in the spring, creating fresh competition for American beans. \u201cHope is unfortunately a terrible marketing plan,\u201d said Nancy Johnson, executive director of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association.The Trump administration said in August that it would distribute $3.6 billion to soybean farmers to offset the decline in market prices. The subsidy rate of 82.5 cents per bushel, however, covers less than half of the losses facing North Dakota farmers at current market prices.Brandon Hokana, whose family farms 3,500 acres near Ellendale, N.D., estimates that they need a price of $8.75 per bushel of soybeans to break even. Last year at this time, soybeans could be sold for almost $10 per bushel. Now, local elevators are offering prices below $7.Farmers typically begin to purchase seeds and fertilizer before the end of the year, so the low prices are shaping next year\u2019s crop. The Hokanas divided their land evenly between soybeans and corn this year; next, they plan to plant half as many acres of soybeans. Instead they will devote more land to corn, and also to some wheat for the first time in two decades, and perhaps specialty crops like peas and black beans.Mr. Hokana knows that other farmers are likely to make similar decisions, and that the corn market next fall may be glutted. Specialty crops like peas and edible beans command higher prices, but also require more work and specialized equipment. Also, unlike the big cash crops, specialty crops can\u2019t be hedged. That means the farmer carries all the risk of a bad year.\u201cThe goal for next year,\u201d Mr. Hokana said, \u201cis just to break even.\u201dEarlier versions of this article misidentified the family name of one group of farmers. They are named Hokana, not Hokama.Advertisement"}

After President Trump took office, they looked to his administration for a more sympathetic ear \u2014 and got one.Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission have yet to charge Walmart, and the Justice Department reached a much lower settlement agreement with Barclays in March, for $2 billion. R.B.S. paid a civil penalty, but escaped criminal charges altogether.Across the corporate landscape, the Trump administration has presided over a sharp decline in financial penalties against banks and big companies accused of malfeasance, according to analyses of government data and interviews with more than 60 former and current federal officials. The approach mirrors the administration\u2019s aggressive deregulatory agenda throughout the federal government.The New York Times and outside experts tallied enforcement activity at the S.E.C. and the Justice Department, the two most powerful agencies policing the corporate and financial sectors. Comparing cases filed during the first 20 months of the Trump presidency with the final 20 months of the Obama administration, the review found:\u2022 A 62 percent drop in penalties imposed and illicit profits ordered returned by the S.E.C., to $1.9 billion under the Trump administration from $5 billion under the Obama administration;\u2022 A 72 percent decline in corporate penalties from the Justice Department\u2019s criminal prosecutions, to $3.93 billion from $14.15 billion, and a similar percent drop in civil penalties against financial institutions, to $7.4 billion;\u2022 A lighter touch toward the banking industry, with the S.E.C. ordering banks to pay $1.7 billion during the Obama period, nearly four times as much as in the Trump era, and Mr. Trump\u2019s Justice Department bringing 17 such cases, compared with 71.While career officials in the federal government have continued to investigate wrongdoing at companies large and small, some of the top political appointees under Mr. Trump have led a philosophical shift in governing that favors big business and prioritizes the interests of individual investors.Many Republicans in regulatory and law enforcement roles have resisted corporate penalties, suggesting that they unfairly punish a company\u2019s shareholders for the misconduct of employees. Democratic appointees have more often maintained that shareholders wrongly benefit from ill-gotten gains, no matter who was responsible for them, and that tough penalties could deter future lawbreaking.If the balance tilted toward a heavier hand in corporate penalties under former President Barack Obama \u2014 even as critics argued that his administration did not do enough to punish top bankers after the crisis \u2014 it began to swing in the opposite direction under Mr. Trump, the data show.With the exception of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a small agency where a new enforcement director has presided over an uptick in penalties and a Trump-appointed chairman vowed \u201cno pause\u201d in enforcement, the new approach extends across the federal financial enforcement regime.The S.E.C., an independent agency composed of a bipartisan group of presidentially appointed commissioners, is less subject to political considerations. The leaders of the agency\u2019s enforcement division act in a nonpartisan capacity.Still, Robert J. Jackson Jr., a Democratic commissioner at the S.E.C. who is a former law professor and corporate lawyer, said the philosophy of Republican commissioners sent the wrong message. \u201cWe should be trying to deter management from committing fraud, not rewarding corporations when their lawyers cleverly mask bad deeds,\u201d he said, while declining to discuss specific cases.\u201cThe goal is really to instill in those who are regulated the illusion that the government is everywhere and looking over your shoulder,\u201d said Harvey L. Pitt, a Republican who was chairman of the S.E.C. under President George W. Bush. \u201cIf you take away that threat, that could embolden some to keep breaking the law.\u201dIn a statement, the S.E.C. disputed The Times\u2019s approach to assessing the agency\u2019s record.\u201cThe article\u2019s conclusion that enforcement of the federal securities laws has flagged rests on deeply flawed methodology,\u201d said Stephanie Avakian and Steven Peikin, the heads of enforcement. \u201cAs the thorough analysis in our annual report makes clear, the division of enforcement\u2019s performance, effectiveness and activity level during our tenure compares favorably with any period in the commission\u2019s history.\u201dMs. Avakian and Mr. Peikin also highlighted their efforts to root out wrongdoing in virtual currencies, saying the agency had \u201cemerged as a global leader in addressing misconduct relating to digital assets.\u201dThe S.E.C. has chalked up some of the decline in settlement sizes to recent Supreme Court rulings that effectively handcuffed the agency. The agency has also noted that it filed a flurry of cases toward the end of the government\u2019s fiscal year on Sept. 30 even while losing 10 percent of its workers over the past two years.Legal experts who track the S.E.C. and Justice Department attributed some of the decline in penalties to factors beyond the federal government\u2019s control, noting that a soaring stock market had left the agencies with a smaller pipeline of cases because evidence of malfeasance is often easier to identify in tougher economic times. The Obama administration owed its surge in penalties partly to the fallout of the financial crisis, the experts said, whereas Wall Street has since bolstered some compliance procedures.The decline in corporate penalties from the Justice Department may partly reflect the Trump administration\u2019s heavier emphasis on immigration, violent crime and drugs. For two years in a row, the department has announced record-breaking prosecutions of health care fraud, much of which is related to the opioid crisis.\u201cAttorney General Sessions has set clear goals for this department: reducing violent crime, homicides, opioid prescriptions and drug overdose deaths,\u201d said Steven Stafford, a department spokesman. \u201cUnder his leadership, we have begun to achieve all four of these goals by increasing violent crime and firearm prosecutions to all-time highs.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere can be no doubt that this is a pro-law enforcement administration and Department of Justice.\u201dWhen Jay Clayton, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for chairman of the S.E.C., took the oath of office in May last year, he was surrounded by his family, his staff and the Supreme Court justice he had selected to swear him in: Anthony M. Kennedy.The presence of Justice Kennedy, a moderate conservative, indicated that Mr. Clayton, a political independent, was not plotting a radical partisan revamping of the agency.But Mr. Clayton\u2019s remarks that day about job creation \u2014 something not directly under the purview of the commission \u2014 signaled a new emphasis on bolstering the economy rather than policing Wall Street.\u201cThe work of the S.E.C. is fundamental to growing the economy, creating jobs and providing investors and entrepreneurs with a share of the American dream,\u201d he said in a statement that referred to keeping markets safe but made no mention of the agency\u2019s enforcement role.\u201cI think Clayton has a different focus,\u201d said J. Bradley Bennett, a partner at Baker Botts who is a Republican and a former head of enforcement at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a nongovernmental brokerage regulator. \u201cHis success metric is not enforcement fines or cases; it\u2019s the number of I.P.O.s.\u201dAs part of the analysis of S.E.C. enforcement, The Times, in consultation with legal experts, identified every case the S.E.C. filed between mid-May 2015 and September this year, reflecting back-to-back 20 month periods in the Obama and Trump presidencies. The analysis spanned 2,158 cases and was intended to measure the real-time impact of the change in administrations in January 2017.In addition to charting a sharp drop in financial penalties of $3.1 billion across all cases, the analysis shows that the S.E.C. charged far fewer high-profile defendants under Mr. Trump, including less than half as many banks and 40 percent fewer public companies. (Many of the bank cases under Mr. Obama stemmed from a voluntary self-reporting program aimed at penalizing misconduct in municipal bond offerings.)In May, the Securities Enforcement Empirical Database at New York University and Cornerstone Research, which helped The Times identify public companies among the defendants, reported a lag in cases against public companies. The data showed an uptick as the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement unit shifted into higher gear over the summer, and the S.E.C. during the Trump era has penalized such prominent companies as Citigroup and Walgreens.But even with that surge, many of the S.E.C.\u2019s cases underscored its focus on smaller defendants who defraud individual investors, according to experts who track the agency\u2019s doings.For example, actions soared in the 2018 fiscal year against fraudulent stock offerings and investment advisers accused of lying and stealing, said Gerald Hodgkins, a former senior S.E.C. enforcement official who left the agency last December and is now a partner at Covington & Burling. One recent case targeted a Florida man who was purporting to sell snake oil \u2014 pain relief drugs using cobra venom, to be precise \u2014 but whose company, it turned out, had no snakes.\u201cWe are definitely seeing a shift from the more complex cases to those that are less time-intensive and affect a narrower segment of the investing public,\u201d Mr. Hodgkins said, adding that he thought the agency overall had a productive year.When the S.E.C. publicizes enforcement figures, it includes penalties that other government agencies have collected in related actions, and calculates them based on when the cases were resolved, not when they were filed. This method, which predates Mr. Trump, credits the S.E.C. under his administration with bringing in $1.7 billion that Petrobras, a Brazilian company, was ordered to pay to other government agencies and plaintiffs in a private lawsuit.Tabulating penalties this way still leads to a $938 million gap between the two administrations, according to Urska Velikonja, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who studies the S.E.C. (The Times analysis, which found a $3.1 billion gap, excluded payments to outside agencies and attributed penalties to each administration based on when a case was initiated, not settled.)The S.E.C. disagreed with The Times\u2019s analysis, saying that it failed to account for the natural ebb in enforcement activity at the start of an administration, and that the early months of the Trump era saw more cases filed than the beginning of the Obama era. The agency also took issue with The Times\u2019s decision to focus on penalties, a spokeswoman said, because \u201cthe dollar amount of the penalties on their own don\u2019t say anything about whether we\u2019re protecting investors or enhancing market integrity.\u201dSome of the decline in penalties may reflect the growing skepticism over corporate penalties, particularly among the agency\u2019s Republican commissioners. Mr. Clayton, who during his confirmation hearing said he was \u201c100 percent committed to rooting out any fraud,\u201d is often caught in the middle between the agency\u2019s Republican and Democratic commissioners.The Times also found some investigations begun under Andrew J. Ceresney, the enforcement director in the final years of Mr. Obama\u2018s presidency, that hit a brick wall under Mr. Trump.In an investigation involving Morgan Stanley and Barclays, the banks had helped assemble the prospectus for a 2014 Puerto Rican bond deal. Although Puerto Rico\u2019s dire financial health was well known to investors, the S.E.C. under Mr. Obama investigated whether the document accurately warned that the territory was on the brink of bankruptcy.The investigation continued into the early months of the Trump presidency, when S.E.C. investigators told the bank they planned to bring charges. After higher-ranking S.E.C. enforcement officials reviewed the evidence, the agency dropped the investigation, people briefed on the matter said.Morgan Stanley and Barclays declined to comment. Legal experts said that the agency had occasionally reversed itself and ended investigations during the Obama era as well.Separately, an investigation into whether Carlyle, the private equity firm, misled investors about certain fees sputtered. The S.E.C. filed and settled similar cases against Carlyle\u2019s main competitors during both administrations, but the Trump administration did not do the same against Carlyle, people briefed on the matter said. Carlyle declined to comment.A Supreme Court ruling last year, Kokesh v. S.E.C., may have influenced the agency\u2019s approach to the investigation. The ruling held that the S.E.C. has only five years to collect ill-gotten profits; private equity firms like Carlyle typically have investment funds with a life span of 10 years or more.The S.E.C. has also said that a separate legal challenge to the constitutionality of its administrative court, where it typically filed many of its cases, reduced enforcement. A Supreme Court ruling this year forced the agency to reboot its administrative court process.As the presidential campaign was drawing to a close in late 2016, lawyers for Walmart met with senior Justice Department officials in Washington to discuss a possible settlement.Walmart bristled, and as the election came and went, the two sides continued to negotiate, leading Walmart to receive more favorable terms from the Justice Department. But at the tail end of the Obama administration, it became increasingly difficult to get Walmart\u2019s lawyers to schedule meetings, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke about the private discussions on the condition of anonymity.A person briefed on the matter said that negotiations gained steam in the early months of the Trump administration. Although Walmart was negotiating with the same career officials as it had during the Obama administration, the company closed in on a more favorable deal. Negotiations stalled again, and to date, the case against Walmart has not been resolved, though an announcement could come soon, the person briefed said. The company has said publicly that it set aside $283 million to cover potential settlements.A Walmart spokesman said the company was \u201ccontinuing discussions with the government agencies as we work to reach a solution.\u201d Mr. Stafford, the Justice Department spokesman, objected to The Times\u2019s account of the negotiations, without specifying what the department disputed.Brandon L. Garrett, the Duke law professor who examined the data, identified a drop in the number of penalties under Mr. Trump when compared with the final 20 months of the Obama administration (a 72 percent decline), and when compared with the first 20 months of the Obama presidency in 2009-10 (a 23 percent decline).Mr. Garrett said he routinely spoke to corporate compliance officers who lamented how the drop had undercut efforts inside companies to allocate more resources to preventing misconduct.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to fear prosecution for committing serious corporate crimes,\u201d he said.In March, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein declared that the Justice Department wanted to \u201cavoid imposing penalties that disproportionately punish innocent employees, shareholders, customers and other stakeholders.\u201d He has also promised that the department would try to prevent multiple law enforcement agencies from \u201cpiling on\u201d corporate fines. That approach was reflected in a number of recent cases against prominent defendants, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, in which the Justice Department gave the companies credit for penalties paid to other authorities.Some current and former employees attributed the deceleration in corporate cases, at least in part, to a leadership vacuum in the department\u2019s criminal division. Until July, the division had no Senate-confirmed leader.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have stability and organization at the Department of Justice, you may not have the bandwidth to handle major corporate prosecutions,\u201d Mr. Garrett said.The decline in criminal penalties has unfolded against a backdrop of broader regulatory rollbacks in the civil arena.Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division poured resources into lending-discrimination cases, some involving the nation\u2019s biggest banks. In the last full year of the Obama administration, the department filed seven lawsuits alleging lending violations. The next year, the Trump administration filed one such lawsuit.And like Walmart on the criminal side, some targets of civil prosecutions welcomed the more business-friendly approach of the Trump administration.Barclays, under investigation by the Obama administration for selling the soured mortgage investments, had rejected the Justice Department\u2019s demands to pay almost $7 billion, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. The Obama administration had, in turn, filed a lawsuit against the company using the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, a law that Republicans in Congress had tried to curtail.In March, Barclays settled for a much reduced penalty of $2 billion, which the bank argued was in line with what other financial institutions had paid for similar conduct.R.B.S., similarly suspected of defrauding investors in mortgage-backed securities, was facing a criminal investigation from federal prosecutors in Boston, who had obtained records of bank employees discussing \u201cgarbage\u201d loans and \u201crampant\u201d fraud.Toward the end of the Obama administration, Boston prosecutors declined to take a potential criminal prosecution off the table, according to people familiar with the matter. But under the Trump administration, Mr. Rosenstein decided that the case should not involve criminal charges in part because it was unfair to single out one of the many banks caught up in the mortgage investigations, two of the people said. Ultimately, R.B.S. reached a $4.9 billion civil settlement. The bank declined to comment.The Barclays and R.B.S. outcomes reflected the broader trend in cases brought against financial firms under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement law and the False Claims Act, which targets fraud of government programs.Andrew Schilling, a partner with Buckley Sandler who previously led the civil division at the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, said there had also been a marked decline in new financial fraud investigations being opened.\u201cCertainly, 10 years out of the financial crisis you\u2019re not going see quite the same activity,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I never thought I would see financial fraud enforcement fall off as sharply as it has.\u201dReporting was contributed by Sylvia Varnham O\u2019Regan, Gilda Di Carli, Grace Ashford, Daniela Porat and David Barstow.

{"Headline": "More Small Companies Avoid I.P.O.s, Sapping U.S. Economy\u2019s Vitality", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Smith spent years planning to sell shares of his software company, Qualtrics, on the stock market, meeting with bankers, carefully auditing financials and shaping a Wall Street-friendly narrative about the company\u2019s prospects. Two weeks ago, the finish line was close, with a listing on the Nasdaq just a few days away.But shortly before a staff meeting to update Qualtrics\u2019 employees about the public listing, Mr. Smith received a phone call from Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d Mr. McDermott told Mr. Smith.Mr. Smith then stunned Qualtrics\u2019 workers with a totally different message: SAP had agreed to buy the company for $8 billion in cash, nearly double the valuation bankers had set for the company\u2019s public listing. It was a decision, Mr. Smith said in an interview, that he did not second-guess one bit.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more peace in my life,\u201d he said.That kind of last-minute deal, an increasingly common occurrence in the tech industry, is contributing to a major reshaping of the American financial landscape that has been underway for years.Small and midsize companies are fading from stock markets, leaving far fewer publicly traded companies. Many of the smaller companies are bought by larger organizations or are enticed to stay private by the sharp rise in venture capital money, both of which allow them to avoid the volatility and scrutiny that come with going public. The number of listed companies peaked in the late 1990s, before the dot-com bust, plummeting 52 percent by 2016.Some economists say the buyouts of early-stage companies by large dominant players help explain why, by many measures, the American economy has been less dynamic in recent years. Less competition can contribute to sluggish rates of entrepreneurship, business creation, wage growth and productivity, they say.Even some companies that do go public can find that their time there is short-lived. In March, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, a software integration company, just a year after its public offering.\u201cCompanies like Qualtrics are saying, \u2018Huh, why bother the fighting in the public markets if I can do just as well by presenting myself for acquisition in sort of a premarket sale?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a Cornell University finance professor who has studied the decline of publicly traded companies.The traditionally vibrant American small business sector was long viewed as a strength for the economy. Small businesses are more likely to develop innovative new technologies, forcing large companies to reinvest significant amounts of profits to keep pace. The economy benefits from that competition, improving productivity and generating new and higher-quality products and services for consumers.The ability of large, cash-rich companies to buy smaller businesses before they have the chance to emerge as formidable competitors has altered the corporate landscape, said Thomas Philippon, a professor of economics at New York University, who has studied the increased dominance of large companies in many American industries.From 2001 to 2017, the median age of a venture-backed start-up going public was 11 years, according to a study by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. That\u2019s three years older than in the 1980s and 1990s, excluding the dot-com boom.Big tech companies like SAP and Cisco are attracted to the reliable revenue streams of the new class of cloud-based software providers, which charge monthly subscription fees for their offerings.\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for some of these big companies that need to adapt to a new way of doing business,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of I.P.O.-related research and services.\u201cThe public markets would not have awarded these companies those kinds of multiples,\u201d Ms. Smith said.While Qualtrics is growing quickly, its $290 million in annual revenue will not make an immediate difference in the earnings of SAP, which brought in more than $20 billion in 2017. But Mr. Smith of Qualtrics said that joining with SAP would help him accomplish in two years what would have taken five.\u201cOur only reason to go public was not for the financial side. It was to go take this to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got that in one swoop.\u201dTraditional investors in early-stage companies that used to go public have had to adjust to the new reality. For instance, the asset manager and mutual fund company T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, has increased its investing activity in pre-I.P.O. companies, including Airbnb and Uber, as well as Snap, the social media company, before it went public in 2017.\u201cWe are seeing opportunities to invest in companies with very similar characteristics to what would have been early-stage public market companies decades ago \u2014 only these companies are oftentimes raising money through private markets instead,\u201d Corey Shull, an analyst who leads early-stage internet investments at T. Rowe Price, wrote in an email.Investing in hot private start-ups is not generally available to the public. Retail investors seeking to ride the wave of hot cloud companies, for example, have had numerous opportunities to jump on an enterprise tech public offering this year. But some of the most notable ones, including Qualtrics, Adaptive Insights and Mulesoft, are now under the umbrella of much larger conglomerates.\u201cIf they don\u2019t have to tap the public markets to raise money, then why would you?\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who focuses on I.P.O. advisory work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netanyahu, Citing Israel\u2019s Security, Tries to Avoid New Election", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel made an impassioned attempt on Sunday to salvage his crumbling government, warning his teetering coalition partners that toppling the government at such a complex time for national security would be \u201cirresponsible.\u201dIn a live 10-minute address timed for the main evening television news broadcasts, Mr. Netanyahu drew on his military record and political clout to try to prevent early elections, listing his accomplishments in what commentators described as a pre-emptive campaign pitch.\u201cWe are in the midst of a battle, and in the middle of a battle we don\u2019t abandon our posts,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cIn the middle of a battle, we do not play politics. The security of the nation is beyond politics, and the security of the nation is also beyond personal considerations.\u201dEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, who leads another party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition \u2014 the hawkish Jewish Home party \u2014 then demanded to be named defense minister; he was rebuffed by the prime minister.Mr. Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, also of Jewish Home, are scheduled to make statements on Monday morning, when they are expected to issue an ultimatum or even quit the government.An exit by Jewish Home would bring down the government, forcing elections as early as March, since Mr. Lieberman\u2019s withdrawal of his party from the coalition last week left it with a precarious majority of one seat in Parliament.Elections were originally scheduled to take place a year from now.Mr. Netanyahu \u2014 who also serves as foreign minister and, nominally, as health minister \u2014 said that he was for now taking on the role of defense minister. In addition to the volatile situation along the southern border with Gaza, Israel has been grappling with what it views as the graver threat of Iranian entrenchment across its northern border, in Syria.Mr. Lieberman quit his post as defense minister after the government accepted what he and many other Israelis viewed as a premature and humiliating cease-fire with Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, to end a fierce 48-hour bout of cross-border fighting.Mr. Netanyahu said that he understood the criticism, but that the public could not be privy to all of the details for security reasons. He also hinted at plans for further military action.\u201cI will not say this evening when we will act and how we will act,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cI have a clear plan. I know what to do and when to do it. And we will do it.\u201d\u201cWe will overcome our enemies,\u201d he added gravely. \u201cAnd I tell you in advance, it will require sacrifice.\u201dRecalling his service to the country, and how he had lost friends, his older brother and almost his own life in battle, he said, \u201cI dedicate my whole life for the security of Israel.\u201dHe recounted his efforts as a former finance minister to strengthen the country\u2019s economy, and said that Israel\u2019s international relations were now \u201cat an all-time peak, without a drop of exaggeration.\u201dPressing his point that early elections would be an unnecessary distraction from the urgent affairs of state, he hurried off with the parting words \u201cI\u2019m going to work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Austerity Is \u2018Inflicting Unnecessary Misery,\u2019 U.N. Poverty Expert Says", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince 2010, the Conservative government has announced more than 30 billion pounds, or nearly $40 billion, in cuts to welfare payments, housing subsidies and social services, and the British leadership is in \u201ca state of denial\u201d about the devastation its policies have wrought, Mr. Alston said.The British government strongly criticized Mr. Alston\u2019s report, citing a measure \u2014 contested by some poverty researchers \u2014 that suggests poverty has in fact fallen during its tenure.\u201cWe completely disagree with this analysis,\u201d the Department for Work and Pensions, which has overseen the welfare changes, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWith this government\u2019s changes, household incomes have never been higher, income inequality has fallen, the number of children living in workless households is at a record low and there are now one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with 2010.\u201dThe release of the report coincided with a crucial stage in negotiations for a British withdrawal from the European Union, scheduled for the end of March, and Mr. Alston warned that Brexit, as it is commonly known, \u201cposes particular risks for people in poverty, but the government appears to be treating this as an afterthought.\u201dThe rapporteur was particularly scathing about bungled efforts to streamline the way welfare payments are made to individual recipients after delays in a shift to a new system, known as Universal Credit, led thousands of people to fall into poverty.\u201cThe introduction of Universal Credit and significant reductions in the amount of and eligibility for important forms of support have undermined the capacity of benefits to loosen the grip of poverty,\u201d Mr. Alston\u2019s statement said.His remarks came at the end of a tour of nine towns and cities in Britain, where the rapporteur\u2019s team met with hundreds of welfare recipients, anti-poverty campaigners, officials and politicians. His findings were also based on analysis of nearly 300 written submissions from academics and members of the public.Although poverty rapporteurs typically spend most of their time in the developing world, Mr. Alston said it was important to visit Britain, the world\u2019s fifth-richest country, because its policies were a litmus test for the politics of austerity.\u201cThe U.K. was a world leader in social security after World War II, it was a world leader on privatization on a large scale, and it is a world leader right now in self-imposed austerity,\u201d he said in an interview earlier in his visit. \u201cAnd so it is an important case study to better understand the implications of an austerity approach.\u201dKoldo Casla, a poverty researcher who submitted evidence to Mr. Alston during his visit, welcomed his conclusions, in particular the way he drew a direct line between government policy and British poverty.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mystery Font That Took Over New York", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "How did Choc, a quirky calligraphic typeface drawn by a French graphic designer in the 1950s, end up on storefronts everywhere?Steven Heller, a co-chairman at the School of Visual Arts\u2019 M.F.A. program, sees it somewhat differently. \u201cYou say \u2018cacophony,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI call it chaos.\u201dBut amid all of this chaos there is the occasional beacon. Choc, for instance.It\u2019s a typeface that draws the eye with its inherent contradictions. It seems to have been drawn improvisationally with a brush, and yet it\u2019s so hefty it looks like it could slip off a wall. It\u2019s both delicate and emphatic, a casual paradox, like a Nerf weapon.Choc is far from the most popular typeface on the storefronts of New York, but it can still be found everywhere and in every borough. It\u2019s strewn on fabric awnings and etched in frosted glass. It gleams in bright magenta or platinum lighting. It\u2019s used for beauty salons, Mexican restaurants, laundromats, bagel shops, numerous sushi bars. It may be distorted, stacked vertically, or shoehorned into a cluster of other typefaces. But even here Choc remains clear and articulate, its voice deep and friendly, its accent foreign, perhaps, yet endearing.You\u2019ve already seen it, probably repeatedly, like a stranger you recognize from your morning commute.Like so many New Yorkers, Choc is an immigrant.It was designed by Roger Excoffon, a French typographer and graphic designer whose work departed from the Modernist trends that characterized midcentury type design. Based in Marseilles, Excoffon created a diverse array of typefaces during the 1940s and \u201950s, but his script typefaces have become his most enduring work.Excoffon\u2019s most popular typeface is probably Mistral, which was modeled after his own handwriting. (Mistral has been widely used for years, from the title credits in \u201cNight Court\u201d to Connecticut Muffin or N.W.A.\u2019s logos, not to mention many storefronts in New York and elsewhere.) There\u2019s also Banco, which can justly be described as \u201cshouty,\u201d composed entirely of letters that resemble exclamation marks; Calypso, with halftone-patterned letterforms that look like miniature optical illusions; Diane, an ornate script that\u2019s just about impossible to use outside of wedding invitations; and there is Choc, something of a synthesis of all of these.Typefaces are characterized by redundancies. Notice how often the \u201cd\u201d and \u201cb\u201d can be rotated to make a \u201cp\u201d or a \u201cq,\u201d or how a capital \u201cZ\u201d is so plainly a grown-up version of its lowercase counterpart. But Choc is full of irregularity. Its lowercase \u201cr\u201d resembles a \u201cz.\u201d Its \u201cg\u201d looks like a capital \u201cS.\u201d And its \u201ch\u201d crouches forward as though in starting position for a race, whereas its more heavyset uppercase incarnation is on the verge of rolling backward.Choc remains distinctive for these reasons, and it lacks datedness, as evidenced in its continued use throughout the world, most visibly on storefronts.Choc wouldn\u2019t appear on storefronts until well after its 1955 conception, however.As an industry, type design was at this time slow-going, and its applications more limited than it is now. It wasn\u2019t until the spread of phototypesetting in the 1960s that Choc could be used efficiently for large-scale applications. Before then, the most practical way to get your name on your business was to have it painted by hand.\u201cNew York was just a sign painter\u2019s heaven until designers started getting involved,\u201d Mr. Heller said. \u201cThere were one or two or three sign producers that did all the signs, and they worked from a fairly consistent stylebook, like going into a stationery store and looking for a wedding sample.\u201d\u201cI learned how to hand letter signs and trucks,\u201d Mr. Boegemann said. \u201cWe started with a simple pencil and paper. We designed what we wanted and used the styles we wanted and knew how to apply.\u201dRight around the time Mr. Boegemann got into the business, the first computerized vinyl printing machines became efficient alternatives to hand-lettered signage. One was the Gerber IVB, also known as the Signmaker.\u201cI bought the second Signmaker in N.Y.C. back in 1984, $10,000 with three fonts and 10 colors of vinyl,\u201d Mr. Boegeman said. \u201cThe computer makes everything faster and cheaper.\u201cOver the years, more computer-generated advances made more fonts and designs and sizes,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone got into the sign and printing industry. You did not have to have any talent or skills.\u201dAsked if he\u2019s ever made a sign in Choc, Mr. Boegemann said: \u201cThis style is a \u2018Bastard\u2019 letter style.\u201d\u201cI hate these styles and do not consider them as sign advertising. It is all graffiti.\u201dAnd yet, Choc is everywhere. But the reasons for its prevalence are something of a mystery.There\u2019s an abundance of Arial (Spin City Cleaners in the East Village), as well as more kitschy options like Brush Script (Economy Candy in the Lower East Side) or Impact (5th Ave. Gourmet Delight, on a corner in Park Slope). These typefaces have long been available in computer operating systems, which would account in part for their proliferation.This wasn\u2019t precisely the case with Choc. In the early 1990s it was packaged with CorelDraw, a vector graphics editor, but under a different name: Staccato 555. CorelDraw, according to Mr. Frere-Jones, \u201cwould have been more common at a sign-making shop, being cheaper and Windows-based.\u201dAt any rate, Choc is more common than its limited availability may indicate. It\u2019s used consistently as well, and with evident purpose.This could have to do with what Choc evokes. For some it bears a resemblance to the calligraphic forms of Asian writing systems.However, it\u2019s disputed as to whether Choc was a direct homage to these styles. According to Ms. Chamaret, Jos\u00e9 Mendoza, Excoffon\u2019s assistant at the time of Choc\u2019s production, said that the letterforms were drawn in outlines. \u201cNever with a brush!\u201d she said.Even so, and just as pizzerias favor color schemes that recall the Italian flag, or how the names of Irish pubs rely on Gaelic-looking letters, Choc has come to signify Asia.John Chen, a New York-based restaurateur, claims to be among the first to have used Choc on signs in New York. (The front of Mr. Chen\u2019s 25-year-old J.J. Garden, a Chinese restaurant in Jackson Heights, is emblazoned in Choc.) \u201cWhen I wanted to use these letters, everyone thought I was crazy,\u201d he said, speaking in Mandarin.\u201cIt\u2019s abstract. It\u2019s modern. It\u2019s artistic,\u201d Mr. Chen continued. \u201cIt just gives you that certain feeling.\u201dThere\u2019s no denying that Choc has become a typographical shorthand for Asian-themed restaurants. Imagine a sushi bar adorned in Helvetica, and it may not seem as authentic, or as appetizing.\u201cHaving been used for a particular purpose,\u201d said Mr. Frere-Jones, referring to the contemporary applications of Excoffon\u2019s typefaces, \u201cit starts to take on a bit of that association, which encourages that association to be repeated, which just makes it stronger.\u201dIt\u2019s true. Excoffon\u2019s expressive, 60-year-old heavyweight script endures throughout all five boroughs: Ginger Root, on the Upper East Side; Sushi Q, in the Bronx; Sakura 6, in Greenpoint (and Natural Cleaners right across the street); Amy\u2019s Restaurant, in Inwood; Sumo Teriyaki & Sushi, in Williamsburg (which is set in an excess of Choc); A Sushi in Forest Hills; Genki Sushi in Staten Island; and, in the heart of Chinatown, Deluxe Food Market.Here and in countless other instances Choc can be a welcome familiarity. Consider Kami Asian, on Flatbush Avenue near Grand Army Plaza. It\u2019s nestled between a laundromat and a Mexican restaurant, and it\u2019s the more striking of the three storefronts: on one side is the Mexican restaurant\u2019s folksy aesthetic (its name is ornamented with a sombrero), and on the other the laundromat\u2019s staid sans-serif. In between is \u201cKami,\u201d set in gracefully spaced Choc capitals, which at night cast an ethereal glow.Jeffrey E.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War Prompts Fight Among Top Economic Advisers", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s trade war has provoked an internal fight among his top economic advisers, with officials sparring both publicly and behind the scenes over the best approach to dealing with China, the European Union and other trading partners.The disagreements spilled into view on Tuesday as Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, accused Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser, of doing the president \u201ca great disservice\u201d by making hawkish comments about trade talks with China.\u201cI think Peter very badly misspoke,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC. \u201cHe was freelancing, and he\u2019s not representing the president or the administration.\u201dHe added, \u201cI actually think he did the president a great disservice.\u201dThe internal feuding comes at a pivotal moment, as Mr. Trump prepares to meet with President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina this month and as the White House economic team considers whether to impose tariffs on cars from Europe, Japan and other nations.Mr. Trump\u2019s trade advisers are so far split over the president\u2019s desire to impose tariffs on foreign cars and car parts. Mr. Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have privately cautioned against such a move and Mr. Navarro has pushed for tariffs as a way to gain greater concessions from Europe and Japan, according to people familiar with the discussions.Mr. Kudlow, Mr. Mnuchin and others in the administration have also been encouraging Mr. Trump to make a trade deal with China and to forgo the additional tariffs he has threatened to impose on all Chinese imports. Mr. Navarro said in his speech last week that China was not playing fair and was simply trying to get the United States to the table to improve its global image.\u201cThey want to get us to the bargaining table, sound reasonable, talk their way and have their way with us,\u201d Mr. Navarro said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington.Mr. Navarro also lashed out at Wall Street executives with links to the administration who have been encouraging Mr. Trump to strike a quick deal.\u201cIf there is a deal \u2014 if and when there is a deal \u2014 it will be on President Donald J. Trump\u2019s terms. Not Wall Street terms,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cIf Wall Street is involved and continues to insinuate itself into these negotiations, there will be a stench around any deal that\u2019s consummated because it will have the imprimatur of Goldman Sachs and Wall Street.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Kudlow, an avid free trade proponent who generally opposes tariffs, said that Mr. Navarro was \u201cway off base.\u201dMore recently, Mr. Navarro has increasingly been at odds with Clete Willems, a deputy director of the economic council who has been pushing back against auto tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Navarro, who continues to have Mr. Trump\u2019s ear, declined to comment.The president\u2019s economic team was scheduled to meet at the White House on Tuesday to discuss a Commerce Department investigation into whether auto imports pose a threat to national security. Such a determination could lay the foundation for the White House to impose tariffs on imported cars and car parts under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.The report, which must undergo an interagency review process, is expected to outline a range of actions that Mr. Trump could take if he wants to limit imports \u2014 whether that is doing nothing or placing tariffs or imposing quotas.Mr. Trump could hold off on announcing the tariffs as talks proceed with Europe. However, he has been increasingly frustrated by the lack of progress in negotiations.\u201cIf they don\u2019t do the right thing, I\u2019ll put tariffs on the cars,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd if they do, there won\u2019t be any tariffs.\u201dSpeaking at the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Washington on Tuesday, Ms. Malmstrom noted that Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed last summer that there would be no additional tariffs imposed as they embarked on trade talks.\u201cI am here to continue to develop the talks,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said when asked about the prospect of auto tariffs. \u201cWe assume that if that were to happen, that that will not be for the European Union.\u201dBut there is no indication that any such carve out exists for Europe. While Mexico and Canada managed to eke out a tacit agreement during the newly renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement that they would not be subject to car tariffs, the European Union has won no such assurances from the United States.Instead, Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited his threat of auto tariffs as the main factor driving Europe to the negotiating table.However, Ms. Malmstrom said European countries were not interested in making agriculture concessions as part of a trade deal with the United States.Industry lobbyists and analysts have warned that imposing tariffs on cars would be tantamount to a disaster, with large parts of the Midwest auto industry hurt by such a move.\u201cWe\u2019ve made clear we think the imposition of tariffs under Section 232 for autos or parts would be harmful to the auto industry and harmful to the economy,\u201d said Matt Blunt, the president of the American Automotive Policy Council. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly hopeful that the report won\u2019t recommend the imposition of new tariffs or quotas.\u201dEarlier this year, the United Automobile Workers union urged the Commerce Department to take a targeted approach to any protectionist measures.\u201cThe automotive industry is a global industry with long, complicated supply chains,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe caution that any rash actions could have unforeseen consequences, including mass layoffs for American workers.\u201dMr. Kudlow did not comment on the prospect of auto tariffs but suggested that despite Mr. Navarro\u2019s recent remarks, talks with China were moving on a constructive path. He said that Mr. Mnuchin was having discussions with his Chinese counterpart and that there were communications happening at all levels of both governments.\u201cI think it\u2019s better to talk than not talk, so that\u2019s a plus,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said.Advertisement"}

The effects on health are bad enough on their own, and are well understood.The children were all in families with one child born before and one after a nearby Superfund site cleanup. That meant one child was exposed, in utero, to a higher level of environmental toxicity than the other. The study found that children conceived within two miles of a Superfund site before it was cleaned up had lower elementary school standardized test scores than the siblings born later.

{"Headline": "Russia-Ukraine Fight Over Narrow Sea Passage Risks Wider War", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s president put his nation on a war footing with Russia on Monday, as tensions over a shared waterway escalated into a crisis that dragged in NATO and the United Nations.Russia\u2019s seizure a day earlier of three small Ukrainian naval vessels and 23 sailors \u2014 including at least three wounded in a shooting by the Russian side \u2014 was the first overt armed conflict between the two sides since the beginning days of the conflict in 2014, when Russian special forces occupied Crimea.The opening of an additional front at sea, even if Ukraine lacks a real navy, introduced an unstable element into what had been a shadowy war. The conflict pitting Ukrainian soldiers against Russian-backed separatists in the breakaway Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, has sputtered along for almost five years with more than 10,000 people killed.The Kremlin, along with some Ukrainian opposition figures, called the martial drumbeats echoing from Kiev a domestic political ploy by its embattled president, Petro O. Poroshenko. They accused him of fearmongering in order to delay or at least reconfigure the March 31 election that he had seemed certain to lose.Mr. Poroshenko delivered a speech to Ukraine\u2019s Parliament asking it to approve the declaration of martial law starting on Wednesday, with the military already on full alert. The attack on the naval vessels near the shared waterway, the Kerch Strait, represented a new stage of aggression in what he called Russia\u2019s \u201chybrid war\u201d against Ukraine.\u201cThis is a bold and frank participation of the regular units of the Russian Federation, their demonstrative attack on the detachment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said. \u201cThis is a qualitatively different situation, a qualitatively different threat.\u201dMembers of 450-member Verkhovna Rada, the Parliament, who were present voted overwhelmingly to support the measure \u2014 276 to 30 \u2014 after the president agreed to dilute its scope.Ukraine also received a boost from the international reaction, underscoring both the isolation of Russia from the West over the Ukraine conflict, and the desire to protect the international maritime convention that allows for unimpeded shipping through any strait.\u201cWhat you saw yesterday was very serious, because you saw actually that Russia used military force in an open way,\u201d said NATO\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, during a news conference in Brussels following a meeting requested by Ukraine. \u201cThis is escalating the situation in the region and confirms a pattern of behavior which we have seen over several years.\u201dNATO was increasing its military presence in the area, he said, calling on Russia to allow freedom of navigation for Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait.At the United Nations, Russia called a session of the Security Council in an attempt to force a discussion about what it called Ukrainian violations of Russian territorial waters. But Western nations quickly turned the session into a long criticism of Russia for its actions against Ukraine since 2014.\u201cImpeding Ukraine\u2019s lawful transit through the Kerch Strait is a violation under international law. It is an arrogant act that the international community must condemn and will never accept,\u201d Ambassador Nikki R. Haley of the United States told the council.\u201cAs President Trump said many times, the United States would welcome a normal relationship with Russia, but outlaw actions like this one continue to make that impossible,\u201d she said.Various European capitals also criticized Russia, calling for it to release the seized vessels and their crews. There were scattered calls for new sanctions against Russia.The Russians seemed to try to tamp down the confrontation, moving an old cargo vessel anchored to block passage through the Kerch Strait, and allowing commercial traffic to resume.Russian political analysts suggested that the Kremlin had no need to ratchet up its confrontation with Ukraine \u2014 it had already achieved what it wanted by destabilizing the country through support for the separatists.While President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s flagging domestic support may benefit from a fight with Ukraine, that would be outweighed by the risk of greater Western sanctions. \u201cI do not see any benefits for the Kremlin from this confrontation,\u201d said Nikolai Petrov, an analyst and professor of political science.Asked about events during his daily briefing, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, framed the Russian actions against the Ukrainian boats as an interception, not an attack.\u201cThe question here is of incursion into the territorial waters of the Russian Federation by foreign military vessels,\u201d Mr. Peskov said. \u201cThey entered the territorial waters of Russia without responding to any queries from our border guards, in no way responded to offers to make use of pilotage service, and so on and so forth.\u201dBut Ukraine wants to assert its continued sovereignty in areas which Russia considers its own, analysts said. Controlling passage from the Black Sea through the Kerch Strait into the Sea of Azov is a key element in asserting Russia\u2019s broader claim to Crimea.The two sides signed an agreement in 2003 to guarantee free passage through the strait, but in recent months have been harassing each other\u2019s ships. The port of Mariupol and a couple of others are important for the Ukrainian economy for exports of steel and grain, as well as for imports.Steven Pifer, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said that the Kremlin might be testing the level of support for Ukraine using the waterway. \u201cThey can very easily back off,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they sense the reaction is weak, I think that they will continue the blockade.\u201dOne strategic aspect of the design shown by events on Sunday is that Russia could block the strait merely by anchoring a cargo ship in the one opening under the bridge \u2014 185 meters wide and 35 meters high \u2014 large enough to allow the passage of ships.President Poroshenko sought to portray events as part of a larger assault by Russia. During his speech to Parliament, he waved a sheaf of papers that he said detailed Ukraine\u2019s intelligence about Russian preparations for a ground offensive. That seemed unlikely, given the lack of any clear military objective, analysts said.There was, however, a widespread sense among opposition figures and analysts that Mr. Poroshenko aimed to put off the March election, noting that he had not called for martial law during previous points in the conflict when the fighting was far worse.Mr. Poroshenko tried to assuage that criticism by cutting the period of martial law from two months to one, so it would not interfere with the official start of the campaign season on Dec. 31.Other compromises mean that the martial law declaration will only affect the 10 provinces bordering Russia or Transnistria, a breakaway province of neighboring Moldova, also controlled by Russian-backed forces.The president also promised that martial law would not be used to curb civil liberties or to announce a general military mobilization, and that it would only be enforced in the case of new attacks. Still, the very prospect of martial law could help boost support for him as a wartime leader.Oleg Kashin, a Russian columnist and political analyst, wrote in the online publication Republic that the expansion of the shooting into the Sea of Azov seemed more like an extension of the endless skirmishing in eastern Ukraine than the start of any full-fledged war.\u201cThe Sea of Azov is the most convenient space for the most spectacular political wrestling,\u201d he wrote, calling it a \u201ctiny reservoir\u201d that nobody had ever considered a real sea.He wrote that the sea belongs \u201conly to Russia and Ukraine, and no third-party interests will be affected, even if tomorrow the entire surface of the Sea of Azov goes up in flames.\u201dReporting was contributed by Andrew Kramer and Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow, Iulia Mendel from Kiev, Ukraine, Milan Schreuer from Brussels and Michael Schwirtz and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Brexit Deal Has Arrived. Now the Chaos Begins.", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe next few weeks will be an exercise in brinkmanship.Ms. Lewis is a British political journalist.LONDON \u2014\u00a0The selection of a new pope is traditionally announced by white smoke drifting from the Vatican chimney. The news of a draft agreement for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union trickled out in a more modern manner: a volley of tweets.The last year and a half has seen British politicians trying to figure out what, exactly, Brexit means. Finally, after months of negotiation, a draft deal has arrived. And now the real chaos can begin.It is, to be fair to her, perhaps the best deal that could have been achieved under the circumstances:\u00a0There will be no border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (achieved by keeping all of the United Kingdom in a customs arrangement with the European Union for the moment). European citizens living in Britain can continue to do so. Both sides agree in principle that the free movement of people from Europe will end. The most contentious part of the agreement is the mechanism for ending it: A collapse in talks on the future relationship would trigger a \u201cbackstop\u201d where Britain might have to accept European rules and regulations indefinitely. The mere thought of this is giving hard-line Brexiteers palpitations.The Conservative Party is split over the wisdom of Brexit as a project, but it is united in disappointment over the form it has taken. In Parliament on Wednesday, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, got his best jabs by quoting Mrs. May\u2019s own colleagues: Jo Johnson, the anti-Brexit Conservative who quit as transport minister this week, described it as a choice between \u201cvassalage or chaos.\u201d Liam Fox, the former trade secretary, once said there would be 40 trade deals lined up \u201cseconds after\u201d Britain left the European Union. So, Mr. Corbyn asked, how many will be ready? (The answer, which the prime minister dodged, is none.) Peter Bone, an arch-Brexiteer, accused Mrs. May of \u201cnot delivering the Brexit people voted for.\u201d The party\u2019s whips have a hell of a job ahead of them. To further complicate matters, everyone believes that a defeat for Mrs. May would lead to her downfall as prime minister. So members of her cabinet will be considering not just the country\u2019s future but also how their choices will look in a future leadership election.The Labour Party, for its part, was already set to vote against the deal that Mrs. May is presenting. \u201cThere is no majority for anything but chaos,\u201d a member of Parliament told me last week.The other options, if Mrs. May\u2019s deal fails to get through Parliament, could include a general election\u00a0\u2014\u00a0unlikely, as the Conservative Party would have to call one, immediately after humiliating itself \u2014\u00a0or another referendum. But there is little time for these before March 2019.Mrs. May used to argue that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal.\u201d Having returned with a bad deal, she now seems to be arguing that no deal is worse. If the country\u2019s agreements with the European Union expire without being replaced, Britain would face grounded planes, trucks backed up on highways, and food and medicine shortages.Would members of Parliament really let a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit go ahead? The terrifying possibility is that they might not be able to stop it, simply because it is the only option left.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Missionary\u2019s Killing Reignites Debate About Isolated Tribes: Contact, Support or Stay Away?", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe recent killing of an American missionary by members of an isolated tribe on a small island in the Indian Ocean has reignited questions about the fate of the last few groups of people living off the grid.In an era when people across the globe are hyper-connected by technology and increasingly interlocked economies, the survival of a few dozen groups of hunter-gatherers living in complete isolation may seem extraordinary. But experts say they may not survive undisturbed for much longer.Because most of these groups are small and highly vulnerable, anthropologists and indigenous activists have been debating whether it makes more sense to leave them alone \u2014 or try to establish contact with them to offer basic medical care, such as vaccines. Here are some basic facts about the world\u2019s remaining isolated tribes.Anthropologists and activists who study the issue say it\u2019s hard to know for certain. But based on satellite images and field research, experts believe there are more than 100 communities living in isolation.The vast majority of groups live in the Amazon basin in areas that straddle Brazil and Peru. The only relatively large community outside of South America belongs to the Sentinelese, who live on North Sentinel Island. It is nominally part of India, but technically a sovereign territory.Based on accounts from people who have ceased living in isolation, and those who have had fleeting contact with these societies, experts say members of these communities are fearful that contact with outsiders would bring disease and mistreatment. Native communities in the Amazon were ravaged when European settlers began colonizing the Americas in the 1500s and later in the 1800s when rubber tappers flooded the region.\u201cThe historical memory of this era is likely to have been passed down to the current generation,\u201d he said.Loggers, miners, cattle ranchers and drug traffickers have encroached on the territories of these groups, exposing them to violence and disease.Anthropologists and activists for isolated tribes have long wrestled with that question.Survival disagrees, and instead calls on governments to redouble efforts to keep outsiders from the territories where these communities live.\u201cThese uncontacted peoples make a judgment that they are better off remaining uncontacted and independent, fending for themselves,\u201d Mr. Mazower said. \u201cWhere their lands are protected and their right to remain uncontacted is upheld, they live healthy lives and are totally self-sufficient.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At least part of the problem (e.g., people receiving more from Medicare and Social Security than they give) is ingrained in our tax code and retirement benefits.Changes there will require that young people learn the nuts and bolts of these systems, so they can intelligently argue about reasonable options.

We have been assured that relatively modest adjustments would cure these shortfalls. I have a right to believe what I am told, and to expect that appropriate adjustments will be made.

If Mr. Kramon wants to go on a guilt trip, he can do so, but he is dead wrong that our generation shirked its responsibilities, and, frankly, I am getting tired of listening to this nonsense.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-C.I.A. Officer\u2019s Brief Detention Deepens Mystery in Montenegro", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When a former C.I.A. officer was detained overseas recently, Montenegrin officials thought the answer to a question that their country has been obsessed with for two years might be within reach: How did Russia try to topple Montenegro\u2019s government?On the eve of a parliamentary vote in 2016 viewed as a referendum on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Montenegrin police broke up what they claimed was a Russian-backed coup. The investigation and court proceedings over the ensuing two years have riveted the country, including the sensational, and head-scratching, allegation that the coup backers recruited a former C.I.A. officer to help ferry its plotters out of Montenegro.The former officer, Joseph Assad, insisted it was all a huge mistake. He denied knowing of any Russian involvement in Montenegro and said he was only advising a friend hired as the opposition\u2019s campaign adviser.The Montenegrin controversy is a prime example of the sort of mistrust, suspicion and, sometimes, paranoia, that has arisen in the wake of Russia\u2019s campaigns to meddle in European and American elections. Current and former Montenegrin opposition officials argued that government officials\u2019 paranoia has them seeing Russians hiding behind every tree \u2014 and prompted them to wrongly tie Mr. Assad to the alleged plot.American and Montenegrin intelligence agencies believe that the 2016 coup plot was real, and that Russia supported the Serbian nationalists who were arrested and accused of preparing the operation. Polish and British officials have helped identify two members of Russia\u2019s military intelligence branch, formerly called the G.R.U., who they say were in Serbia to organize the coup.Officials acknowledge that many questions remain unanswered about the Kremlin\u2019s control over the operation and who directed Russian intelligence officers to try to topple a pro-NATO government. Montenegrin officials believe Mr. Assad can shed light on Russian funding for the opposition campaign and have sought to have him answer prosecutors\u2019 questions.Prosecutors believe Mr. Assad\u2019s real job in Montenegro was to help coup plotters flee the country after assassinating the country\u2019s prime minister, according to senior Montenegrin officials. He was supposed to use surveillance equipment smuggled into Montenegro from neighboring Bosnia and from Albania to help the plotters avoid the police as they escaped across the border to Serbia.But the problem with that allegation, according to Mr. Assad and his allies, is its basic premise. Why, they ask, would a former C.I.A. officer help Russia and its partners?The 2016 election in Montenegro was a closely fought battle. Led by Milo Djukanovic, the prime minister at the time, the ruling party promised it would deliver membership in NATO. Along with it, the party vowed, would come foreign investment to aid the economy of the former Yugoslav republic, which has been highly dependent on Russian tourism.Opposition parties, unified as the Democratic Front, campaigned on an anti-corruption platform. Some pro-Russian, anti-NATO leaders also promised a vote on alliance membership if they were elected.The campaign was unlike any Montenegro had seen since it gained independence from Serbia in 2006, in part because the opposition hired Aron Shaviv, a British-Israeli campaign adviser who crafted slick, and amusing, advertisements that poked fun of Mr. Djukanovic\u2019s ruling party.Mr. Shaviv has said his work drew the attention of security services, who delayed him at the airport, followed him to shoots and harassed him and his team. Montenegrin officials deny his accusations.Nonetheless, the unwanted attention prompted Mr. Shaviv to bring in Mr. Assad as a consultant.An Egyptian Christian raised in Egypt and Lebanon, Mr. Assad moved to the United States in 1990 and became an American citizen. He, along with his wife, joined the C.I.A. in 1999.Before taking the Montenegro job, Mr. Assad discussed the work with another former C.I.A. officer, Brian Scott, who helps lead several Florida-based security firms.A contact in Malta warned Mr. Scott that the opposition coalition was connected to Russia. Mr. Scott passed that warning on to Mr. Assad, he testified during the Montenegrin judicial investigation.Mr. Assad disputed Mr. Scott\u2019s account and said he was never warned about possible Russian involvement. \u201cIn fact, if I had known that there were even credible allegations that the Russians were involved with the opposition, I would have never agreed to provide this personal security advice to Aron Shaviv,\u201d the opposition adviser, Mr. Assad said.American intelligence services were active in Montenegro two decades ago when it was united with Serbia, and the C.I.A. supported a State Department push in 2000 to help opposition leaders defeat President Slobodan Milosevic at the ballot box. But since then, the Balkans have not been a priority for American intelligence services.Mr. Assad said he went to Montenegro once, to develop a contingency plan for Mr. Shaviv and one other colleague in case of Election Day violence. He denied that he used any surveillance equipment during his short stay.On the morning of the parliamentary vote \u2014 Oct. 16, 2016 \u2014 Montenegrin security officials announced they had foiled a coup and arrested some 20 people, including Serbian nationalists, who planned to overthrow Mr. Djukanovic\u2019s government.Suspicion immediately turned to Russia. Britain, Poland and other allies began providing information about Russian intelligence operatives in Belgrade, Serbia, who may have been involved in orchestrating the coup.Prosecutors eventually charged 14 people in connection with the coup, including two Russians, nine Serbs and three Montenegrins.In June 2017, Montenegro joined NATO, becoming its 29th member. Since then, Moscow\u2019s anti-Montenegro talk has cooled, and economic ties between the countries remain strong, with a steady flow of Russian tourists coming to the country\u2019s Adriatic coast, said Srdan Darmanovic, the Montenegrin foreign minister.But Russian meddling continues, including with intrusions in government computer systems and continued espionage in the country, officials said.One Montenegrin official said investigators did not believe Mr. Assad was involved in plotting the coup, and they did not know how much detailed knowledge he had of the plan. But Mr. Assad\u2019s alleged use of surveillance equipment to monitor the security services and work to develop an extraction plan could be prosecuted, Montenegrin officials said.Mr. Assad denies he had anything to do with the alleged coup attempt or its planning. He said he was not aware of the coup when he left the country right before the election.Prosecutors\u2019 evidence of a coup is thin, others accused of involvement said. Milan Knezevic, head of the Democratic People\u2019s Party, one of the three parties in the Democratic Front, has been indicted in connection with the alleged coup and faces up to 15 years in prison.The indictment and story laid out by the prosecution amounts to a fairy tale, he said. \u201cIf Russia wanted to organize a coup here, they could do it in 20 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody believes in this coup besides the special prosecutor.\u201dMr. Assad faces up to 10 years in prison, but a senior Montenegrin official said the government did not want to detain a former C.I.A. officer. Instead, it just wants Mr. Assad to cooperate, hoping he can help clearly define Russia\u2019s role in the alleged coup.Mr. Assad was briefly detained in the United Arab Emirates in September at the request of Montenegro, according to his spokesman. But the U.A.E. counterterrorism judge who reviewed Mr. Assad\u2019s detention ruled the allegations spurious, the spokesman said.Mr. Assad will not go to Montenegro to answer questions. But his allies said he was willing to give a statement and submit to an interview with Montenegrin officials in the United States to answer questions.Mr. Assad said he had done nothing wrong.\u201cI would not do anything against the interests of the United States,\u201d Mr. Assad said. \u201cI would certainly not work in the interests of Russia.\u201dAndrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Podgorica, Montenegro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bare Knuckle Bouts in Madagascar? \u2018It Is About More Than the Fighting\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "Madagascar DispatchThe sport of moraingy, a brutal mixed martial arts tradition in Madagascar, has become commercialized over the years, but at heart, it remains a reflection of local culture.Supported bySAMBAVA, Madagascar \u2014 The devoted fans make their way to dusty outdoor rings surrounded by grass huts and palm trees. They take their seats on makeshift wooden benches and through song and lots of cheering, glorify the gladiators of moraingy, Madagascar\u2019s brutal bare-knuckle fighting tradition.Bouts are a blur of fists, elbows, knees and feet punctuated by the thud of vicious slugs and the smack of bodies hitting the ground. Whirling blows are exchanged for longer than seems possible to withstand.Haymakers, kicks and punches are landed, absorbed and countered with equal ferocity. The fighters, known as fagnorolahy, perform a violent dance until someone gives up or is knocked down, or the referee identifies a winner.\u201cI don\u2019t feel fear before a fight,\u201d said Rocky Ambanza, a local star of the game. \u201cIf you feel fear, you have already lost. But you must not underestimate your adversary.\u201dFew opponents would underestimate Mr. Ambanza, 28, whose compact body is marked by scars and scratches. His power, speed and technique, combined with his confident swagger and aggression, made him a crowd favorite during a recent moraingy (pronounced more-AIN-gee) match in Sambava.Winners of moraingy bouts earn cash as well as prizes that can include stereos, televisions, bikes and even cars.The traditional sport has changed in another way, too. Typically it was pursued by unmarried men between the ages of 10 to 35. Now, women are increasingly taking part, both as combatants and managers.\u201cMy husband loves moraingy, so with the money we\u2019re making from the vanilla trade, we put fighters on a monthly contract and host the events,\u201d said Maria Hadjee, whose family business sponsors a moraingy team in Sambava with a half a dozen male fighters and a coach.The team travels the region by minivan, drumming up attendance by driving around the dirt roads of the towns they visit and announcing over loud speakers the next day\u2019s combat against rival clubs. The fighters sometimes set up the smaller venues themselves.The combat that follows becomes a marker not only of strength and courage, but also of character, especially in the face of a loss.Rules vary from region to region, but victory is not possible without maintaining certain critical social attitudes and principles, according to Ernest Ratsimbazafy, the author of \u201cMartial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation.\u201d\u201cPremier among these is self-control,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFear of punches must be overcome, calm must be maintained, and revengeful feelings must be avoided.\u201dIn Madagascar, people often prefer indirect forms of confrontation \u2014 through proverbs or through spreading rumors of witchcraft, for example, said Sarah Osterhoudt, a professor of anthropology at Indiana University.\u201cHarmony is very important, and there\u2019s this idea of collective action over individual action, so anything that allows people to confront things in a ritualized way softens that confrontation,\u201d Professor Osterhoudt said. \u201cFighting could be a way of doing that within a predictable format.\u201dAt a recent match in Sambava, ropes were suspended on posts over a patch of dirt in an empty lot, flanked by towering speakers thumping out Malagasy pop tunes, replacing the drums that provided the soundtrack to moraingy fights in former times. Female cheerleaders in short shorts and crop tops gyrated to the beat.Some 2,000 spectators, who paid about a dollar each, filtered through a narrow gate and filled seats or climbed walls, trees and nearby buildings to get a clear view. The crowd was well supplied with alcohol, and young men\u2019s cheeks bulged with khat, a leafy plant chewed for the mild high it provides.Once the arena was packed, the fagnorolahy entered and strutted around the ring, taunting their opponents with glares, clenched fists and menacing gestures. Despite this theatrical provocation and showboating, the atmosphere among fighters is one of camaraderie, reflecting moraingy\u2019s role as a male bonding tradition.Soon, Mr. Ambanza entered the ring. A teammate tied a red rope amulet around his bulging right biceps, and his coach smeared Vaseline on his bruised cheekbones before he slipped under the ropes to face his adversary.On the referee\u2019s signal, the two fighters circled one another, feinting and jabbing. Mr. Ambanza ducked under a sweeping right hook and unleashed a devastating uppercut that lifted his opponent off his feet and dropped the dazed fighter to the ground. The crowd roared. Mr. Ambanza raised his fists to the sky, eyes closed.Despite the drubbing the bouts can deliver, moraingy fighters often take on three or four different opponents in an afternoon. Each contest consists of one to three rounds lasting less than a minute.Mr. Ambanza\u2019s knockdown was one of the day\u2019s highlights. On his victory lap, he bumped fists with his coach and ventured into the crowd, where fans dropped bank notes into a plastic shopping bag he held out.Spectators snapped photos and recorded video clips on mobile phones to share on social media.Such modern trappings aside, moraingy remains rooted in its past as a corporeal expression of Malagasy society.\u201cIt is about more than the fighting,\u201d said Aboudou Matchimoudini, the coach of Bo\u00eete Noir de Diego, one of Madagascar\u2019s more competitive clubs. \u201cIt\u2019s our culture and our tradition, our history.\u201dThat history dates back as far as the 15th century. The fighting tradition spread across the country and to other islands off the southeast coast of Africa, including the Comoro Islands, La Reunion, the Seychelles and Mauritius.While the fights are ferocious, the rituals around the sport encourage mutual respect. The winner bear hugs his opponent, briefly lifting him off the ground before the gesture is reciprocated. The victor is cheered, but so is the vanquished.As Mrs. Hadjee\u2019s fighters gathered for an afternoon workout at a local soccer stadium, three goats nibbled on a lone patch of dry grass near midfield. After the workout, the players stopped for rice and soup at a roadside restaurant.The fighters may earn a few hundred dollars a month, which is enough for Mr. Ambanza, who first saw a moraingy match at age 15, and immediately began training.\u201cI\u2019ve been fighting for 10 years and I\u2019m earning enough to live on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only problem right now is that I have a broken rib.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Jay Powell, the Fed\u2019s chairman, has said a decision doesn\u2019t need to be made until next year.The lawsuit comes after negotiations between the Justice Department and UBS sputtered when the two parties failed to reach an agreement on a settlement. UBS plans to fight back: In a statement issued ahead of the complaint being filed, the bank said that \u201cthe D.O.J.\u2019s claims are not supported by the facts or the law.\u201dThe industry is having other troubles, too:The iPhone maker\u2019s annual report, published earlier this week, revealed that Apple owns 7,376 acres of land, up from 4,928 last year and 2,583 in 2016. In 2011 it owned just 584 acres, older filings show.The land \u2014 which is equivalent to more than 11.5 square miles, an area greater than Apple\u2019s hometown, Cupertino \u2014 is listed as being in addition to the 40.8 million square feet of building space that Apple owns or leases for its offices and retail stores.What\u2019s it for? Some analysts think Apple\u2019s property could one day be used for manufacturing sites or autonomous car testing facilities. But much of it is also being given over to data centers and solar farms.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading! We\u2019ll see you next week.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Big Ways the United States Will Need to Adapt to Climate Change", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven if the nations of the world get their act together and slash fossil-fuel emissions rapidly, the United States will need to spend many billions of dollars to harden coastlines, rebuild sewer systems and overhaul farming practices to protect against floods, wildfires and heat waves that are already causing havoc nationwide. And the more that emissions rise, the more difficult and costly that task gets.The nation\u2019s food supply could be in jeopardy as global warming intensifies, the report warns. Crop yields for corn, wheat and soy tend to decline as the number of extremely hot days increases. More frequent droughts could reduce supplies of irrigation water. Dairy cows produce less milk in the sweltering heat.In areas at risk of drought, they could use more precise irrigation techniques to conserve water. Agricultural regions could build new weather networks that provide more detailed climate forecasts, to help farmers make better decisions about which crops to plant, and when. In places like the Great Plains, dairy farmers and ranchers may need to relocate production or invest in climate-controlled buildings to protect their cattle from heat stress.But the report emphasizes, \u201cthese approaches have limits under severe climate change impacts.\u201dOne hope is that seed companies might develop new crop varieties that are better able to tolerate drought, heat waves and pests. However, the report cautions that \u201cprogress in this area has been modest\u201d and calls for much greater public investment. Much of the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including things like roads and sewers, was built with historical weather conditions in mind. But as extreme weather becomes more frequent, the report says, the past is no longer a good guide to the future.In Hampton Roads, Va., nearly half of residents reported being unable to drive out of their neighborhoods at some point last year because of flooding at high tide as sea levels have risen. In the Northeast, sewer systems built for the storms of the past are expected to overflow more frequently as climate change brings heavier rainfall.\u201cIt\u2019s still not standard practice for engineers to think about future climate,\u201d said Costa Samaras, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. While a few cities, like New York and Baltimore, have begun using climate forecasts in their infrastructure planning, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not as widespread as it needs to be.\u201dKatherine Greig, a senior fellow at the Wharton Risk Center and co-author of the report\u2019s chapter on adaptation, said that \u201cWe\u2019re still a long ways\u201d from having \u201ca serious conversation about retreat.\u201dClimate adaptation isn\u2019t just a matter of redesigning roads or power plants to be more resilient to extreme weather. The report also details ways that our natural environment, if managed properly, can be a cost-effective defense against climate change.Planting more trees in cities can help reduce urban temperatures and protect people from deadly heat waves. Restoring degraded wetlands and marshes can protect cities and coasts from flooding and improve water quality. Healthy forests that are allowed to burn at a low level periodically, as they did in the distant past, are less prone to extreme wildfires. Protecting pollinators could help make our agricultural system more resilient.One example from the report: Several Midwestern cities, including Milwaukee, have begun a large-scale effort to restore streams to their natural state, removing concrete linings, so that they can safely carry away more water during heavy storms.As detailed as the new 1,656-page climate assessment is, the authors still warn that global warming is likely to bring unpredictable dangers, particularly as complex systems like energy, water, transportation and public health all come under severe stress at once.As an example, Hurricane Harvey in Texas last year ended up shutting down gasoline refineries, straining hospitals, clogging roadways and spreading toxins and pathogens as floodwaters swamped the city. These sorts of \u201ccascading failures\u201d are difficult to study and predict in advance.At a broad level, the report warns that officials at every level of government and in every corner of the economy will have to weave climate change into their decisions, to plan for a wide range of possible futures, and to continually re-evaluate those plans. \u201cAdaptation entails a continuing risk management process,\u201d the report notes. \u201cIt does not have an end point.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raising Pressure on Nicaragua, U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Vice President", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The Trump administration imposed financial sanctions on Nicaragua\u2019s vice president, Rosario Murillo, and a top aide on Tuesday, ratcheting up pressure on the Sandinista government to end its brutal crackdown on a popular uprising.Nicaragua has been convulsed since April, when peaceful student protests developed into a broad-based movement demanding the resignation of President Daniel Ortega and Ms. Murillo, who is his wife.Washington has called on the Nicaraguan government to move up elections as a way out of the crisis, but Mr. Ortega has said that he will serve out his term, which ends in 2021. Early attempts at talks between the government and a coalition of opposition leaders foundered.Over the summer, masked paramilitaries, often accompanied by the police, attacked protesters at barricades and regained control of the streets. Since then the government has rounded up and jailed opponents, charging many of them with terrorism. The Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights says that more than 320 people have been killed and more than 600 imprisoned since the unrest began.The Trump administration had already imposed sanctions on four high-ranking Nicaraguan officials when National Security Adviser John Bolton announced on Nov. 1 that Washington would harden its policy toward Nicaragua, which he described as part of Latin America\u2019s \u201ctroika of tyranny\u201d along with Cuba and Venezuela.Until \u201cfree, fair, and early elections\u201d are held in Nicaragua, he said, the government \u201cwill feel the full weight of America\u2019s robust sanctions regime.\u201dThe sanctions, which are imposed by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, block access to any property that Ms. Murillo and the aide, N\u00e9stor Moncada Lau, might hold in the United States and prevent American financial institutions from doing any business with the two.The Treasury\u2019s announcement was backed by an executive order signed by President Trump, who declared that the Ortega government\u2019s actions constituted \u201can unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\u201dThe political unrest has stalled the country\u2019s economy, which depends on tourism, agriculture and export-assembly plants. Fitch Ratings said Tuesday that it expected the economy to contract by 4 percent this year.Ms. Murillo, 67, has exerted outsize influence on the country since 2007, when Mr. Ortega, the 1980s revolutionary leader, won the presidential election and returned to power. Mr. Ortega established an increasingly autocratic rule, taking control over all branches of government. By naming Ms. Murillo as his vice president in the 2016 election, Mr. Ortega indicated that she would be his heir.Mr. Moncada Lau, 64, has long been part of the Ortegas\u2019 inner circle and acts as their national security adviser, the Treasury Department said.\u201cNobody debates his rise to power as the guardian of the private affairs of the presidential family,\u201d the Nicaraguan newspaper Confidencial wrote of Mr. Moncada Lau on Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Saudi Murder Becomes a Gift to Iran", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe assassination of a journalist has further hurt the Trump administration\u2019s frail strategy of buddying with Saudi Arabia to restrain Iran\u2019s expanding influence.Professor Nasr, a scholar of Middle East politics and diplomacy, is the author of \u201cThe Shia Revival: How Conflicts Within Islam Will Shape the Future.\u201dThe Trump administration is not ready to admit it, but its Middle East strategy is in deep trouble, now compounded by the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey last month. The administration\u2019s recent pressure on the Saudis to seek a truce in their war in Yemen is a clear signal of just how much the credibility of Saudi Arabia, which is at the heart of that strategy, has shrunk, perhaps even in President Trump\u2019s eyes.The strategy\u2019s goal was to work with the Saudis to contain Iran\u2019s influence in the Middle East. Instead, we can now expect a growing sense of ease in Tehran about exerting its influence, even as it adjusts to the tough economic sanctions that were reimposed last week. That freedom is more likely to be used through maneuvering and deal-making, rather than through aggressions.It\u2019s not as if Iran expects a change in American policy toward it in the aftermath of the Khashoggi affair. Instead, the weakening of confidence in Saudi Arabia throughout the region is more likely to confirm to Iran\u2019s leaders the wisdom of their own current strategy \u2014 manage pressure from America by mobilizing domestic resources; rely on Europe, China and Russia to keep economic channels with Iran open; and consolidate Iran\u2019s alliances and positions of influence politically.Over the past year, Iran has been able to avoid escalating tensions with the United States, in part because it has confidence in Russia\u2019s commitment to stay its course in Syria. Iran shows no sign of ever abandoning Syria, even as it stays surprisingly quiet in the face of repeated Israeli strikes on Iranian bases there. Similarly, expectations of a confrontation in Iraq after the Iranian consulate in Basra was torched in September proved unwarranted. Instead, Iran quietly helped Iraqis forge a political alliance that formed a government reliant on Iranian-backed militias that the United States wants disbanded.Now, the leaders in Tehran may well expect that a weakened Saudi Arabia could be compelled to end both its military campaign in Yemen and its blockade of Qatar. All along, the Iranians have sought talks with the Saudis, who may be ready to talk to them \u2014 especially if the Saudis take American advice and decide to end the Yemen war. The government in Riyadh may also find it necessary to mend relations with Iran to rebalance its relations with Turkey, which has been aligned with a buoyant Qatar and was further angered by the Saudi assassination on Turkish soil. Remaining calm, in turn, might give Iran\u2019s leaders greater confidence in their own bargaining power, perhaps to the point of talking to the United States about its nuclear and missile programs. The ruling circles in Tehran already seem confident that the economy has absorbed much of the shock of American sanctions and that Iran can sell enough oil and have enough trade with Europe, China, Russia and India to keep its economy afloat. Conservatives and moderates have formed a united front to rally the population to the flag and to fend off any popular discontent that the United States might hope economic hardship would bring.The Trump administration has derided the nuclear deal, asserting that it was failing to curb Iran\u2019s regional influence and claiming to want a new deal strong enough to do just that. But Mr. Trump will now find it even more difficult to deliver on his promise of forcing Iran to come to the table on his terms. If Iran comes at all, it will not be in a position of abject weakness. All it needs to do is remain committed to the deal it signed with Barack Obama and let Mr. Trump recognize that his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy falls short. Then Tehran might be ready to talk.From the start, the Trump administration thought it could rein in Iran\u2019s regional influence by forging a close partnership with Saudi Arabia\u2019s young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. But a series of heavy-handed Saudi missteps, culminating in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, have backfired, leaving Iran with much more room for strategic initiatives.Relying on Saudi Arabia to contain Iran was always questionable. Saudi Arabia has never been truly successful at rolling back Iran\u2019s regional presence, and in recent years Iran\u2019s influence in the region has only grown. For example, Saudi Arabia has for all practical purposes washed its hands of Syria, leaving it to the United States to deal with Iran and the endgame of that conflict. The greatest missteps started in 2015 with the ill-conceived war in Yemen, followed last year by a blockade that failed to ostracize Qatar and then a weekslong detention of the prime minister of Lebanon that failed to lessen his reliance on Hezbollah. All were clumsy attempts to make other Arabs afraid to deal with Iran and its allies. All had the opposite effect, with the region\u2019s principal players \u2014 America\u2019s friends among them \u2014 seeing Saudi Arabia as a greater menace than Iran.The Khashoggi affair has been a watershed event. It brought into sharp relief the weakness at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy, even as it weakened the crown prince himself, along with support for his partnership with America. The ability of Saudi Arabia to help Israel contain Iran and provide political cover for a final deal with the Palestinians now looks far-fetched. Israel\u2019s hand has been weakened, while Turkey \u2014 which also wants greater regional influence and has shared Iran\u2019s concerns about the budding alliance between Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 has gained stature.It is now clear that Saudi Arabia will not be able to lead a regional coalition to force Iran out of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and then Yemen. Unless Mr. Trump plans to send large numbers of troops to do that, and then have them stay on to make sure Iranian influence does not return, he can hope for regional stability only by focusing on first bringing the Middle East\u2019s wars to an end. Then he would have to set aside his high hopes that \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d can successfully deal with Iran on regional issues. Accepting those truths would not eliminate Iran\u2019s influence, but it could set limits on it and provide time for the Arab world to recover and rebuild \u2014 which ultimately is the best way to check Iranian power.As for Iran, it doesn\u2019t need to flex its muscles. It just needs to wait for the Trump administration to fully appreciate the balance of power in the Middle East. As Mr. Trump\u2019s mirage of an Arab order evaporates, a stark reality emerges: There is no credible Arab challenge to Iran\u2019s regional influence, nor is there any prospect of reducing it with American threats and bluster.Vali R.

{"Headline": "How to Survive the Next Era of Tech (Slow Down and Be Mindful)", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIn his final State of the Art column, Farhad Manjoo reflects on the industry\u2019s changes and presents a new guide for navigating the future of technology.At the time, technology felt thrilling and world-changing. You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d \u2014 and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder. But tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things \u2014 every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps \u2014 that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.So to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.Now the time has come to amend and update that advice \u2014 which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I\u2019m not going far: I\u2019ll be writing for The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section starting next year.)How should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.Not long ago \u2014 in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn\u2019t work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?Something strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.But ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?But you don\u2019t have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too \u2014 and for a better, healthier tech industry, it\u2019s best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.Best of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry. There are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices \u2014 so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple\u2019s service but not from Spotify. But it\u2019s precisely this sort of mischief that I\u2019m hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.One reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.The lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.That\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.Are these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful. Go slow.Advertisement"}

He has yet to be charged with a crime.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s detention could last several more weeks. Under Japanese law, prosecutors can hold suspects for up to 23 days without filing charges. While he is held, Mr. Ghosn is likely to live in spare conditions. Even a request for extra blankets would have to go through lawyers.\u201cThere will be no special treatment\u201d for Mr. Ghosn, said Tsutomu Nakamura, a former prosecutor in Japan who is now a private defense lawyer with no role in the case. \u201cHe will be treated in the same way as a burglar.\u201dThe extended inquiry adds to the drama surrounding Mr. Ghosn\u2019s sudden arrest, which shocked an industry facing challenges amid a global trade war, slowing economies and rapid changes in automotive technology.The case has riveted Japan, home to Nissan and Mitsubishi and a country where Mr. Ghosn has long been admired. In France, where Renault employs 47,000 workers, the case against Mr. Ghosn, the carmaker\u2019s chairman and chief executive, has unleashed similar intrigue.At a news briefing on Wednesday, Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance and economy minister, said that his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshige Seko, would fly to Paris for a meeting on Thursday to discuss the alliance between Renault and Nissan. The two men spoke by phone on Tuesday.A spokeswoman for Mr. Le Maire said he was likely to seek information about Nissan\u2019s allegations against Mr. Ghosn. Mr. Le Maire had previously said there was no evidence that Mr. Ghosn engaged in wrongdoing in France, but that under the circumstances he had to step down temporarily from his role at Renault.The arrest on Monday came after an internal Nissan inquiry that found Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a onetime Nissan human resources manager and current member of the company\u2019s board, had underreported Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation to the Japanese government for several years.The Nissan board is to meet Thursday in Japan. Hiroto Saikawa, the carmaker\u2019s chief executive, has said the company is recommending that the board remove Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly from their posts. Mitsubishi said it would also seek to remove Mr. Ghosn as its chairman at a board meeting set for next week.NHK, Japan\u2019s public broadcaster, showed footage of Toshiyuki Shiga, Nissan\u2019s former chief operating officer and a current member of the board, entering the Tokyo prosecutors\u2019 office as part of the inquiry. He told reporters that he was submitting to questioning voluntarily.According to the Tokyo prosecutors\u2019 office, Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly underreported Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation from 2011 to 2015 by more than 5 billion yen ($44.5 million) \u2014 understating his true earnings by half \u2014 in reports to a bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance.The prosecutors\u2019 office declined to answer questions about where Mr. Ghosn or Mr. Kelly were being held. Mr. Nakamura, the former prosecutor, said they were probably at a detention center in eastern Tokyo.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty common in Japan to detain suspects for a long time,\u201d Mr. Nakamura said. \u201cThis is very different from the Western criminal justice system.\u201d Even after 23 days, Japanese law permits prosecutors to rearrest suspects on suspicion of other crimes and detain them for extended periods.Suspects are usually held in 50-square-foot rooms where they sleep on futons on the floor. They are allowed a limited set of clothes, Mr. Nakamura said. Long socks, which can be used to attempt suicide, are not allowed.While being held, he is not even allowed visits with family members. Criminal suspects not from Japan like Mr. Ghosn, a citizen of France and Lebanon, can see their lawyers and representatives from embassies.Laurent Pic, France\u2019s ambassador to Japan, visited Mr. Ghosn in detention on Tuesday. Landry Pierrefitte, deputy press counselor for the French Embassy in Tokyo, declined to comment on Mr. Ghosn\u2019s health or mental state.In a statement, the United States Embassy in Tokyo said that \u201cdue to privacy concerns,\u201d it could not comment on whether members of its diplomatic staff had visited Mr. Kelly.Under a change to Japanese criminal law that took effect in June, prosecutors can offer immunity to suspects in certain cases involving financial, drug or firearm crimes in exchange for information about criminal activity committed by third parties.Nissan said it was cooperating with the inquiry.\u201cNissan has been providing information to the Japanese public prosecutors office and has been fully cooperating with its investigation,\u201d Nicholas Maxfield, a Nissan spokesman, said. \u201cWe will continue to do so.\u201dAnalysts criticized Mr. Saikawa and the Nissan board for failing to detect the false reporting earlier.\u201cIt seems like there were complaints against Ghosn within the company,\u201d said Takashi Inoue, chief executive of Inoue Public Relations. Mr. Saikawa, he added, \u201cis responsible for missing the false reporting.\u201dMr. Inoue said other Nissan executives may have been jealous of Mr. Ghosn, who was paid was much more than anyone else at the company. As Nissan\u2019s chairman last year, Mr. Ghosn reported income of \u00a5735 million ($6.5 million) while Mr. Saikawa was paid \u00a5499 million ($4.4 million) as chief executive.Some analysts said that Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation may have prompted an outsize response to the alleged financial misconduct.\u201cJapanese media seems to be playing the ire of the public against large compensation of C.E.O.s to support the charge, but the inequality in compensation between ordinary workers and C-class managers are moral issues, not criminal issues,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors in Tokyo, referring to positions like chief executive and chief financial officer.\u201cThis dramatic arrest does seem excessive for what he has been alleged to have done,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf he evaded a huge amount of tax to the authorities, the arrest would be justified.\u201d But, Mr. Okubo said, given that the allegations involve not declaring income to corporate regulators, \u201cI think this seems excessive.\u201dThere is no current allegation that Mr. Ghosn did not pay appropriate taxes on his income.Renault, which owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, appointed a temporary leadership team on Tuesday to fill the gap created by Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest, but has said that he remains chairman and chief executive.Motoko Rich reported from Toyko, and Liz Alderman from Paris.

{"Headline": "Stocks Fall, Wiping Out Gains for 2018", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market\u2019s gains for 2018 were erased on Tuesday, as a sell-off led by giant technology stocks continued. The renewed declines in the United States came after drops in Asia and Europe.The pain persisted for such companies on Tuesday with Apple and Amazon falling by more than 4 percent in early trading. But a new area of concern also flared after the retailer Target reported third-quarter sales and profit that missed Wall Street expectations.The softness in retail shares reflects growing investor concern that the strong American economy \u2014 which has so far shrugged off Federal Reserve interest rate increases and signs of weakness in China and Europe \u2014 is likely to face increasing challenges in 2019, as the impact of federal tax cuts and spending increases diminishes.Also weighing on stocks was a slump in crude oil prices, which hit their lowest point this year after dropping as much as 7 percent on Tuesday.Monday\u2019s slide in the United States had already spilled over into Europe and Asia before trading on Wall Street opened on Tuesday. By the end of the trading day, the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of eurozone blue-chips, had dropped more than 1.4 percent.Concerns about privacy lapses and mismanagement at technology companies weighed on stocks on Monday, adding to broader concerns about the impact of a trade war between the United States and China as well as signs of slowing growth around the globe.The pessimism continued in the Chinese markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen as the worries that hurt technology stocks in the United States hit stocks in other parts of the world.In Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, trade concerns helped to push the stocks of Chinese semiconductor makers and other big technology companies into the red. A drop in the stock price of the chip maker Nvidia several days ago after disappointing earnings may also have rattled investors in chip makers across China. The Chinese stock market is down by more than 20 percent so far this year.Shares of Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate, fell 3.3 percent in Hong Kong trading. A broader index of large Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong dropped by 1.6 percent, while the Hong Kong market closed the day down 2 percent.\u201cStocks look weak,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for Asia Pacific at the Dutch bank ING, wrote in a note to investors. \u201cOversupply in the semiconductor industry is an issue for Asia, and made worse by an apparent lack of demand for some well-known producers of high-tech products,\u201d he added.In Seoul, South Korea, and Taipei, Taiwan, the markets finished the day down nearly 1 percent.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong, Amie Tsang from London and Matt Phillips from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Only One Democrat Deserves to Be Speaker", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNancy Pelosi\u2019s skills are a perfect match for the job, and there is no better choice in the Democratic caucus \u2014 it\u2019s not even close.Ms. Kamarck is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of a book about presidential primaries.The final vote will not come until Jan. 3, when 218 members of Congress will have to vote for the new speaker. Representative Pelosi will need 218 Democratic votes. Yesterday, 32 Democrats voted no on her nomination. So between now and 2019, Ms. Pelosi has some work to do. But the simple fact is, at the moment, there is no one in the Democratic caucus better for the job. And it\u2019s not even close. The primary role of a legislative leader has rarely been to serve as the \u201cface\u201d of the party. She is not running for president. It is instead the unglamorous and complex job of making some subset of 435 individual political entrepreneurs come together in the name of a political party. Even her detractors say that she\u2019s best at one of the most critical, if not most critical, roles of speaker, which is to court votes and count votes. Counting is a lot more complicated than conducting a survey. It involves understanding the political challenges of each and every member of Congress and then devising a legislative package that can pass. Sometimes this entails compromise; sometimes this entails structuring the vote so that a member can cast a vote against an amendment and sometimes this entails allowing a member to vote against their party \u2014 if it already has the votes to prevail.Ms. Pelosi has shown her toughness over and over. For instance, in 2005, she played a central role in the battle against privatizing Social Security. For the Affordable Care Act, she united both the left and right wings of her caucus. Later, as minority leader, she managed to keep the caucus together enough to prevent the Republican Congress from chipping away at Obamacare. Like Lyndon Johnson, a Senate majority leader who eventually rose to the presidency, Ms. Pelosi is a machine politician with a progressive bent. To court votes, an effective legislative leader cannot stick to an overtly ideological line. If she were rigid, she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold together a caucus that consists of conservative \u201cblue dogs\u201d and \u201cdemocratic socialists.\u201d Finally, a speaker has to be able to win majorities. In the midterms, Ms. Pelosi and her leadership partner Steny Hoyer of Maryland were a very big part of the reason that the party gained at least 39 seats. Mr. Hoyer recruited and campaigned with candidates from the purple or red districts where Ms. Pelosi was viewed as too liberal. She helped raise the millions to make it all happen. They both imposed a stern message of discipline on their candidates, downplaying talk of impeachment and focusing Democrats on pocketbook issues like health care. Ms. Pelosi will need to convince about 17 Democrats to vote with her. In tough districts in the midterms, some Democrats promised to vote against Ms. Pelosi if elected. Having won, they now find themselves between a rock and a hard place; voting against the overwhelming favorite in the caucus (who also happens to be a woman in a year where women gave Democrats the majority) is a surefire way to make yourself unpopular and ineffective internally. But reversing a promise to your voters in your first act in office is a surefire way to make you look like a shady politician if ever there was one.The irony here is that while Democratic candidates were being pressured into the anti-Pelosi faction, Republicans were bemoaning the fact that all the time and money spent on demonizing Ms. Pelosi was a waste that could have been better spent talking about the good economy.Holdouts will be confronted with a lot of pressure to show unity in the opening of the new Democratic Congress. If I had to bet, we\u2019ll be saying \u201cMadam Speaker\u201d for the second time in American history.Elaine C.

{"Headline": "Iran Sanctions Explained: U.S. Goals, and the View From Tehran", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe package of severe economic penalties imposed against Iran on Monday by the United States is the most significant part of President Trump\u2019s decision last May to abandon the Iranian nuclear agreement of 2015, which he has described as a disaster.The penalties include some gaping exceptions that could undermine their impact, among them: Iran\u2019s biggest petroleum customers, like China and India, will not be penalized, at least for six months.Nonetheless, Iran\u2019s oil, shipping and banking industries could take a significant hit and its weakened currency could plunge further under the sanctions, which Mr. Trump has said are intended to stop what he considers Iran\u2019s unacceptable actions in the Middle East.President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, emboldened by widespread criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s sanctions policy, including from America\u2019s closest allies, responded defiantly on Monday. He said his country would not bend to \u201cthe language of force, pressure and threats,\u201d and vowed to break the sanctions.\u201cThis will make everything substantially more difficult if not impossible in some areas for Iran,\u201d said Farhad R. Alavi, managing partner of the Akrivis Law Group, a Washington firm that specializes in sanctions and export law. \u201cRevenues are coming down and costs are going up.\u201dHere are the basics of the administration\u2019s latest Iran sanctions, Iran\u2019s response, and what could happen next:The administration threatened to penalize buyers of Iranian oil as part of its stated goal to reduce Iran\u2019s petroleum exports to zero. It blacklisted 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 people and ships, Iran\u2019s national airline and more than 65 Iranian aircraft.Under such sanctions, the United States can seize assets under its jurisdiction that are owned by blacklisted people and entities. The sanctions also forbid commercial relations with those people or entities.The Iranians have accused the United States of duplicity and of violating international law for reneging on an agreement it reached not just with Iran but five other major powers: Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany. All of them still support the accord, and its validity was reaffirmed by a United Nations Security Council resolution.President Rouhani said that his country would \u201cproudly break\u201d the reimposed sanctions and that Iran was engaged in \u201can economic war\u201d with the United States.The Trump administration says it wants to deny Iran the revenue it gets from oil, the country\u2019s most important export, but to do so in a way that will not destabilize the world market. A total ban on Iranian oil exports could constrict the supply and spike prices \u2014 an outcome Mr. Trump regards as politically dangerous.More than 20 countries already have cut their imports of Iranian oil, shrinking Iran\u2019s exports by about one million barrels a day, Mr. Pompeo said.American officials would need great leverage to induce China and India, Iran\u2019s biggest customers, to cut off all their imports; the two nations have enormous energy needs. Chinese leaders are incensed over the intensifying trade war begun by Mr. Trump, and they are wary about the diplomacy Mr. Trump is conducting with North Korea over that country\u2019s nuclear program.Given all that, experts say, it is unlikely that China and India will end all imports of Iranian oil \u2014 even after the 180-day waivers expire.\u201cI think the U.S. made the calculation that market stability and geopolitical relationships superseded interests in trying to bring down Iranian exports,\u201d said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk consultancy.The global petroleum market, having anticipated that the Trump administration would grant some exceptions, had no significant reaction to the announcement. Prices of Brent crude, an international benchmark, were little changed Monday, and in the range of $73 to $74 a barrel.Ellen R. Wald, a senior fellow at the Global Energy Center of the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based research group, said in a telephone news briefing about the sanctions that any price increases could be further blunted by the additional supplies anticipated next year from other exporters, including the United States.If that happens, she said, the administration \u201ccan push countries to cut Iranian imports even more and not see much effect on American consumers.\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints about the nuclear agreement, Britain, France and Germany regard it as a success. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the proliferation monitor of the United Nations, has repeatedly said Iran is in compliance with the deal\u2019s terms.So the Europeans are angry the United States is using its enormous economic leverage to threaten European companies that wish to do business with Iran. Many of them have abandoned the country.More broadly, the Europeans fear instability in Iran, which could bring security problems and migrants, and they worry the United States is taking steps that could destabilize the country.Some speeches from Iranian officials have reflected concern. Farhad Dajpesand, Iran\u2019s minister of economy, said this was probably the most \u201csensitive\u201d period for the country since the government\u2019s founding after the Islamic revolution in 1979.The minister of interior, Abdul Raza Rahmani Fazli, suggested that the recent wave of economic protests in Iran was a serious challenge. The protests were driven in part by the failure of the nuclear agreement to bring the economic benefits Mr. Rouhani had promised, although corruption and mismanagement also were regarded as underlying causes.Iran\u2019s biggest critics may say it is, pointing to a severe drop in the value of Iran\u2019s currency since Mr. Trump first took office. But many Iran analysts say the impact of the reimposed sanctions is far from clear.\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between crisis and collapse,\u201d Mr. Rome said. \u201cI think they\u2019re on the verge of a crisis. They will have a very difficult time ensuring sufficient food supplies and medicine. But Iran has been through severe challenges in the past. There\u2019s nothing we\u2019ve seen that they\u2019re somehow on the verge of just giving up.\u201dEdward Wong and Mujib Mashal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBased on a simplified extrapolation, it works out to about $122 gained a month for a typical family \u2014 which for some would be wiped out by higher mortgage rates.It helps to look beyond the overall economic data to understand this disconnect. After all, you can\u2019t eat G.D.P., and good jobs numbers aren\u2019t the same as a place to live.If you look instead at the actual financial lives of average middle-income families from 2016 \u2014 their incomes, spending, assets and debt \u2014 and how shifts since Election Day in 2016 would have been likely to affect them, you get a more mixed picture.Wages haven\u2019t risen much. Inflation has been low, helping keep the price of most staple goods down, though with gasoline prices a costly exception. The tax cut has left more money in most middle-class families\u2019 pockets, but only a bit. In terms of assets, the typical middle-income family has either zero or minimal holdings in the stock market, meaning the surge since November 2016 hasn\u2019t paid direct benefits. But a majority of households in this income bracket do carry some credit card debt, which has become more expensive amid rising interest rates.And in terms of housing costs, rents haven\u2019t risen much \u2014 but a sharp rise in mortgage rates has made homes less affordable for anyone looking to buy.Add it all up, and while the benefits of a surging economy, tax cuts and the rising stock market are real, they net out to a less favorable economic reality for a family in the middle of the income scale than the economic headlines might imply. This math is oversimplified \u2014 it doesn\u2019t reflect how families may have changed their spending and saving patterns in the last two years, and conflates different definitions of middle income. But the back-of-the-envelope results are revealing:If you take the benefits of higher wages and the lower taxes, subtracting higher costs for consumer goods and higher interest rates on credit card debt \u2014 it works out to a gain of $122 a month.The median pay for a full-time worker in the United States \u2014 now $893 a week \u2014 has risen enough since late 2016 to generate an extra $204 a month in pretax earnings for a household with a single earner, a 5.6 percent gain.Subtract payroll taxes and federal income taxes on that raise, and that family is looking at $158 a month in additional earnings. Wages may not be growing very fast for middle-income people, but the good news is that prices of most of the things they buy have been rising even more slowly.The Consumer Price Index excluding housing costs is up only 3.2 percent since November 2016, adding about $101 to the monthly expenses of a family with spending patterns that match those of an average family in the middle 20 percent of the income distribution that year.When you look at individual items that compose a large portion of family budgets, the relatively low inflation comes through.Grocery prices \u2014 \u201cfood at home\u201d in the Labor Department\u2019s terminology \u2014 are up only 1.1 percent in the nearly two years since November 2016, adding $3.33 to the monthly grocery bill for an average family in the middle 20 percent of income.Outside of food, the pattern mostly recurs. Electricity bills are up 0.42 percent, a mere 50 cents a month of additional expense. Apparel is slightly less expensive than it was in November 2016, saving a middle-class family $1.22 a month. An 11 percent drop in the price of cellphone service saves that family $10.48 each month.The big exception is gasoline; its price has been marching steadily higher since late 2016. The 23.5 percent run-up in the price of motor fuels adds $37.38 to the typical family\u2019s monthly expenses.When it comes to housing, it matters a lot whether you\u2019re renting and planning to continue renting; renting but seeking to buy a home; or already own one.For renters who plan to stay renters, costs are rising modestly, just like overall inflation \u2014 3 percent since November 2016, tacking an extra $26.54 onto monthly costs for the average renter.Homeowners typically have their monthly mortgage costs already set. Their wealth \u2014 the value of their home \u2014 has risen a bit in two years. The median sale price for a home in the United States was $214,000 in November 2016, according to data from Zillow, and the national appreciation rate since then implies such a house would now be worth $230,000.Things are trickier for a renter looking to buy a home, because of rising mortgage rates. A side effect of the surging economy and deficit-increasing tax cuts has been higher rates, which means that even though home prices aren\u2019t up all that much in the last two years, the cost for a buyer needing credit is considerably higher.The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.5 percent at election time two years ago, and is now 4.83 percent. Combined with the rise in the price of the median home, a middle-income American family looking to buy with 20 percent down would be looking at a monthly mortgage payment that is $196 a month higher now than in November 2016, wiping out gains from higher wages and lower taxes.The Trump administration has pointed to the booming stock market as evidence of success: The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has returned about 29 percent, including reinvested dividends, since November 2016.But middle-income families typically have minimal direct exposure to the stock market. Their financial holdings tend to be modest at best, meaning that rising stock prices create only a small wealth increase.Among middle-income families in 2016, only 52 percent held stocks either directly or indirectly, such as through a mutual fund. And of those 52 percent, median stock holdings were only $15,000. (That would be up to around $19,000 now if they left the money in an S.&P. 500 index fund since then without making further contributions.)Stock investments are much more a feature of upper-income brackets. The same survey showed that 94.7 percent of families in the top 10 percent of income held stocks, with a median value of $363,400.Many middle-income Americans, 84.3 percent of them, do tend to hold some form of debt. And rising interest rates in the Trump economy \u2014 a consequence of strong economic growth and Federal Reserve actions meant to prevent the economy from overheating \u2014 are making that debt more costly.In other words, debtors \u2014 and the average middle-class American fits that description \u2014 are paying a price for the surging economy even as they enjoy the benefits of higher pay and low inflation.Given the limitations in the data on which these calculations are based, it\u2019s best to think of this analysis as an impressionistic painting rather than a high-resolution photograph of the economic lives of the middle class.But it is a telling one, and helps explains the limits of a political message built on what seems to be a booming economy. It booms for some people more than others.To develop this portrait, we started with two government surveys from 2016: the Labor Department\u2019s Consumer Expenditure Survey, which provides details of household spending patterns broken down by income bracket, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, which details assets and debt.Then, we simply extrapolated forward to the fall of 2018. If those patterns among middle-class families held steady as they were buffeted by economywide forces, would they be better or worse off in the days before the midterms?This is assuming that they had no radical changes to their financial lives like getting a lucrative new job or winning the lottery, and that their wages, costs and investment performances plugged along at average rates over the last 23 months.Because of limitations in the data available for the recent past, we had to combine data sources that aren\u2019t really meant to be combined. We had to switch between different definitions of middle income, and we made some simplifying assumptions. (For example, we calculated how higher gasoline prices would increase people\u2019s spending without adjusting for how they might react to higher prices by driving less.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Key Factors That Will Determine How Long the Hot Job Market Lasts", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhere is this growth really coming from; how real is the concern over inflation; and how many more workers are out there?Employers keep creating jobs at a healthy clip, 250,000 of them in October, a boom that was apparent in every major sector and that continued unabated even as the American economy inched closer to full employment.The unemployment rate remained at a multidecade low of 3.7 percent. More notably, the proportion of the population either working or looking for work rose 0.2 percent. The number of adults not in the labor force at all fell by 487,000.And employers evidently needed to pay higher wages to coax these workers off the sidelines. Long the soft underbelly of this expansion, average hourly earnings are now up 3.1 percent over the last year, from 2.8 percent in the previous reading.Put it together, and this is the best time for the American labor market in at least 18 years and maybe closer to 50 \u2014 though it would be nice to see sustained wage growth substantially higher than inflation, not just in a single month, before making any comparisons to the boom of the late 1960s.There\u2019s a reason people call economics \u201cthe dismal science,\u201d though, so it\u2019s worth puzzling through some of the questions that remain unanswered \u2014 and that, depending on your view, could make a person a little more cautious about the new data.Economists tend to divide the economic effects of the trillion dollar tax cuts into two buckets. The first is the simplistic demand stimulus from throwing money at the economy. This Keynesian stimulus effect can be powerful, especially during recessions, but also is short-lived.The second is creating stronger incentives for business to invest in long-lasting, productivity-enhancing capital. If a cut in corporate income taxes succeeds in doing that, there should be growth benefits for a long time to come.It sure looks as if the boost in growth so far in 2018 is mostly about the first set of effects: Investment spending has been nothing special, and in the third quarter fixed investment \u2014 a category that includes both housing and business investment \u2014 was actually negative.If the strong growth is going to be sustained, we\u2019re going to need to see a handoff from Keynesian stimulus to stronger investment in higher productivity. There\u2019s not much evidence of that happening so far.For years, a debate has been playing out at the Federal Reserve over how much faith to put in traditional economic models in which low unemployment generates higher wages and thus feeds through into overall inflation.For most of that time, the skeptics \u2014 people who have wanted to wait until there is hard evidence of inflation in the economy before trying to choke off the expansion with higher interest rates \u2014 have been vindicated.The inflation doves have been right the last couple of years; that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll continue to be.One important factor that will help determine answers to both of those questions is how many more potential workers are still on the sidelines, perhaps able to be coaxed back into the work force if wages keep rising and the jobs boom continues.The more there are, the more growth the economy can sustain without stumbling into an inflationary spiral.Strikingly, though, there is still room to run on this measure compared with the last two economic peaks. That figure was 80.3 percent in January 2007 and 81.9 percent in April 2000.Does the economy still have the potential to reach those levels, or reach still higher ones? If so, there\u2019s no reason this kind of job growth can\u2019t continue for at least a few more years.If, on the other hand, some of those who have left the labor force won\u2019t be pulled in no matter what, the economy will be hitting a simple constraint of not having enough workers \u2014 all the more so given more stringent policies limiting immigration.So celebrate the latest jobs numbers, while hoping that this proves to be the middle of a nice boom rather than the beginning of the end.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the House Fell: Republican Chaos and Democratic Focus", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe message from Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, was urgent and unsparing. In a meeting with Republican lawmakers before they left Washington for the August congressional recess, Mr. McCarthy warned that time was running short: Unless they intensified their campaign efforts and forcefully delivered a coherent message, he said, Republicans would suffer grievous losses in November.Instead of arresting their political decline, House Republicans proved unable at every turn to stay ahead of their troubles \u2014 including many of their own making.By Labor Day, Republicans were fatally unprepared for an onslaught of Democratic campaign spending that overwhelmed their candidates from South Florida to Seattle. Party leaders on Capitol Hill and in the White House soon turned on one another and against their candidates with growing intensity. Two key groups \u2014 the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party\u2019s campaign arm in the House, and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a powerful Republican super PAC \u2014 plunged into all but open warfare over messaging and money.Democrats, in turn, delivered a message about health care with the repetitive force of a jackhammer. They cracked congressional maps drawn to favor Republicans and seized an array of open seats, while also felling longtime incumbents who had grown complacent.And in the end, President Trump may have delivered the final blow to his party across the diverse and growing metropolitan communities that decided control of the House. In the last weeks of the campaign, Mr. Trump cast aside a positive Republican message about economic prosperity in favor of stoking racial panic about immigration \u2014 with appeals that veered into overt racism, alienating moderate swing voters and further enraging Democrats.Republicans lost control of the House Tuesday night after eight years in power, with Democrats picking up seats in several suburban districts where the party traditionally did well. But if House Republicans were badly shaken by their defeat, few party leaders were genuinely surprised at the nature of their losses. In interviews with dozens of lawmakers, campaign strategists, activists and donors in both parties, a clear consensus emerged about the arc of the 2018 election.It was a campaign defined early by Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive persona and hard-right ideology, and by Republican leaders\u2019 unswerving decision to align themselves with Mr. Trump and his overwhelmingly white, rural base rather than politically vulnerable moderates in Congress who hailed from the country\u2019s population centers and represented the political middle.A campaign of retribution against Republicans who did not pledge fealty to Mr. Trump \u2014 and to Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s legislative agenda \u2014 triggered an exodus of senior legislators that opened the way for a Democratic takeover.Representative Ed Royce of California was not the first Republican to decide he would not run for re-election in 2018. But his announcement, in January, was the warning bell that tolled most ominously for Republican leaders.The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Royce held a quickly diversifying Orange County seat that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 even as it re-elected him. But he told colleagues that he bitterly resented the fruitless, politically damaging health care debate, and announced his retirement in a statement that took the N.R.C.C. by surprise.Within weeks, Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, followed suit. Though he had pledged to seek re-election, Mr. Frelinghuysen was incensed over the way Mr. Ryan treated him during the tax overhaul debate \u2014 the speaker, Mr. Frelinghuysen told associates, had threatened to eject him from his chairmanship.\u201cHe was appropriations chair, and there were lots of people trying to tell him what he could and couldn\u2019t do as appropriations chair,\u201d said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the head of the N.R.C.C. \u201cAt that point you\u2019re not as much of a chair.\u201dWith their pursuit of an orthodox conservative agenda on health care and taxes, Republican leaders split their party, driving moderate lawmakers into retirement and handing Democrats their most powerful issue of the campaign season \u2014 defending popular insurance coverage mandates in the Affordable Care Act.The shift to the left in the House in the 2018 Midterm elections went well beyond the districts Democrats flipped.By last spring, more than 40 House Republicans were leaving the chamber. In the Senate, two Republicans alienated by Mr. Trump, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, also quit in frustration.But the most stunning exit was Mr. Ryan\u2019s. After alienating senior colleagues with legislative arm-twisting and committing his conference to a hard-line agenda that left them gravely vulnerable, Mr. Ryan announced abruptly in April that he was retiring. While he promised to keep raising money for fellow Republicans, Mr. Ryan\u2019s contributions to the party would steadily decline; in the last fund-raising quarter of the campaign, his political committee transferred a paltry $1.4 million to the N.R.C.C., less than some first-time Democratic candidates raised for themselves.Mr. Ryan\u2019s decision left the Republican conference in a baleful mood \u2014 and enraged senior White House aides and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.\u201cHe thought it was selfish,\u201d said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell\u2019s top political adviser, recalling the lawmaker\u2019s reaction to Mr. Ryan\u2019s announcement: \u201cIf he wanted to leave, he could leave after the election. He let all his guys hang out to dry.\u201dMr. Stivers acknowledged that Mr. Ryan\u2019s retirement had choked the party\u2019s fund-raising. Mr. McCarthy and Representative Steve Scalise, the Republican whip, had stepped up to solicit donors as they jockeyed to succeed Mr. Ryan. But Mr. Stivers said there was no substitute for a formidable speaker.Beyond the speaker, Mr. Stivers said he pleaded with colleagues to run again and named several \u2014 including Mr. Frelinghuysen and Representatives Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Dennis Ross of Florida \u2014 as having undermined the party. He sniped at Mr. Ross, who quit the day Mr. Ryan retired: \u201cHe saw the cover of Paul retiring, and he slid right under it.\u201dMr. LoBiondo suggested he could change his mind and run for re-election, provided he could hang on to the chairmanship of a congressional subcommittee he was scheduled to relinquish. Republican leaders assented, but it was not enough.\u201cHe got what he said he wanted, and he still retired,\u201d Mr. Stivers said.Without the retirements, the Ohioan told a reporter who joined him as he knocked on doors in his district last Saturday, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even be talking about the House being in play.\u201dModerate Republicans in the House also quickly lost patience with what they saw as Mr. Ryan\u2019s deference toward the House Freedom Caucus, a far-right group aligned with Mr. Trump. \u201cListening to the Freedom Caucus is a problem,\u201d said Representative Will Hurd of Texas, a Republican who on Wednesday was clinging to a lead of a few hundred votes in his swing district.Former Representative Pat Tiberi of Ohio, a long-serving Republican who resigned in January to take a private-sector job, said Republicans had \u201coverreached\u201d and handed Democrats a decisive advantage on health care as a political issue.\u201cWe probably should have taken on infrastructure in a bipartisan way first and then maybe tax reform next, rather than health care first,\u201d Mr. Tiberi said.The tweet came without warning, on the day of the South Carolina primary. Watching television aboard Air Force One, on a flight back from his summit in Singapore with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean despot, Mr. Trump decreed that Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina must be defeated.Mr. Sanford, an idiosyncratic conservative who routinely criticized the president, was in a tough primary battle with Katie Arrington, a state legislator running as a Trump loyalist. Hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s message, Mr. Sanford conceded defeat.If Mr. Sanford suffered in June for his apostasy, Mr. Trump\u2019s party paid another price Tuesday: Ms. Arrington lost the general election in a heavily Republican district to Joe Cunningham, a Democrat.Mr. Trump\u2019s capricious approach to politics was destabilizing for Republicans up and down the ballot, leaving candidates exposed to the president\u2019s whims and grievances and the machinations of White House advisers. Rather than approaching the midterm campaign as a task of holding together a political coalition and steering it to victory, Mr. Trump focused chiefly on rewarding perceived friends \u2014 and punishing those who crossed him.He helped drive two senators, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake, into retirement, castigating them in humiliating terms online and driving up their unpopularity with Republicans. In gubernatorial elections, Mr. Trump helped anoint highly divisive nominees in states like Florida and Georgia \u2014 where the national G.O.P. had to burn millions staving off defeat \u2014 and Kansas, where Mr. Trump\u2019s favored candidate, Kris Kobach, was defeated by a Democrat, Laura Kelly.In other cases, Mr. Trump\u2019s associates lashed out at Republican candidates who failed to prostrate themselves sufficiently. When Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa issued a supportive statement about a renegotiated trade deal with Canada and Mexico, a White House aide sharply rebuked a strategist for Ms. Reynolds\u2019s campaign \u2014 because the governor did not praise Mr. Trump by name in her comment. And because of the perceived slight, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides dropped plans for the president to headline a fund-raiser for the governor, instead insisting that the event be held for the Iowa Republican Party.And in some cases, Mr. Trump upended his party\u2019s well-laid plans, only to change his mind or lose interest. In Florida, he endorsed Ron DeSantis, a member of Congress who defended him frequently on Fox News, for governor. Yet when Mr. DeSantis broke with the president, over Mr. Trump\u2019s false claim that the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria had been nefariously inflated, the president turned on his handpicked candidate.Mr. DeSantis ultimately won the governorship by a tiny margin, but Mr. Trump criticized him bitterly in the final days of the race. The former congressman, he complained to a friend, \u201cwas low-energy.\u201d Mr. DeSantis even earned a nickname: \u201cLittle Ronny D.\u201dFor members of the House, Mr. Trump was most burdensome mainly because of a mercurial approach to policy that left them unable to map legislation or political messaging in a coherent way. In one instance, Mr. Trump aggressively pushed members to vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and then, after a private dinner with Democrats in the middle of June, publicly derided Republicans\u2019 health care legislation as \u201cmean.\u201dOn two other occasions \u2014 when Congress was set to reauthorize an intelligence-gathering law and again when it was about to pass a sweeping government-funding bill for 2018 \u2014 Mr. Trump telephoned a senior aide after watching unfavorable Fox News coverage early in the morning and demanded, without effect, that the bills be taken off the floor.At no point, Republicans said, did Mr. Trump forge a cohesive political bond with Mr. Ryan. Indeed, when Mr. Ryan disagreed last month with Mr. Trump over a proposal to eliminate birthright citizenship, the president shot back with hot anger that echoed his attack on Mr. Sanford: The speaker, he said, should not be discussing \u201csomething he knows nothing about!\u201dMr. Ryan\u2019s allies only rolled their eyes at the all-too-familiar counterattack, predicting that the president would soon also pin the loss of the House on the speaker.Nancy Pelosi did not want to talk about Planned Parenthood.It was a meeting of House Democrats early in 2017, during Republicans\u2019 drive that March to strike down the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Pelosi and her political lieutenants laid out their counterattack: Democrats would talk about pre-existing conditions and millions of people losing coverage. And they would talk about an \u201cage tax\u201d \u2014 a provision in the Obamacare replacement passed by the House, which would have allowed health insurers to widen the premium gap between younger and older customers.That narrow focus on health care and a few economic issues came to define the Democrats\u2019 midterm campaign. It represented a wholesale rejection of Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed strategy in the 2016 campaign, which focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for office.Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in an interview that it had been challenging to break the habit of responding with reflexive, public outrage to Mr. Trump\u2019s utterances, especially as those utterances grew increasingly inflammatory. On a campaign swing in his home state the weekend before the election, Mr. Luj\u00e1n said Democratic leaders envisioned a starkly different path to victory, noting that in 2016 a character-driven campaign \u201cdidn\u2019t work.\u201d But the temptation persisted.\u201cEvery time he would say something or tweet something, it would come back: \u2018We need to come right back at him! Define him!\u2019\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n recalled. \u201cWe would say: Look, we don\u2019t need to talk about him, he\u2019s going to do it himself. We need to continue to have a conversation with the American people about kitchen-table issues.\u201dThat judgment was backed up by a vast trove of research, collected by Democratic committees and super PACs through polling and focus groups. House Majority PAC, the caucus\u2019s main super PAC, carried out two intensive research projects, studying right-of-center suburban voters and blue-collar whites who supported Mr. Trump. It concluded that only a message about health care and jobs could win over both groups.In a presentation compiled for the PAC in the summer of 2017 by the Democratic polling firm Normington Petts, party strategists delivered an unambiguous assessment: \u201cThe strongest policies for a Democratic candidate are almost entirely economically focused.\u201d And it warned that Mr. Trump was not the \u201cmost important villain\u201d \u2014 congressional Republicans were.The same presentation, focused on the white working class, noted vaguely: \u201cIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind, Democratic leaders will be a significant villain highlighted by the G.O.P.\u201d If the report did not name Ms. Pelosi as a target, the meaning was clear.The determination by party leaders to control Democrats\u2019 message in 2018 \u2014 channeling a tidal wave of liberal activism into a winning electoral strategy \u2014 extended to primary elections. Ms. Pelosi authorized party groups to meddle aggressively in California\u2019s open-primary system to ensure viable Democratic candidates would emerge. Her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, anointed centrist nominees for the open seats in Tennessee and Arizona.To the occasional consternation of the left, Democrats engaged sparingly on the issue of immigration, condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s harshest policies but never matching him blow for blow. In January, when activists pushed for a government shutdown over immigration, House Democrats concluded after a night of polling in swing districts that such a confrontation risked becoming a fiasco.That strategy of restraint brought Democrats steady gains, as they made inroads into Republican territory in a series of special elections and off-year elections, winning an improbable Senate seat in Alabama late last year, then seizing a solid-red congressional district near Pittsburgh in March. The Democratic victor there, Conor Lamb, ran on a message about health care and economic fairness, and pledged never to support Ms. Pelosi for speaker.Mr. Lamb\u2019s upset rattled the Republicans and spurred other moderate Democrats \u2014 including a sizable group elected this week \u2014 to disavow Ms. Pelosi. On the Republican side, the race stirred new doubts about whether attacks on Ms. Pelosi could save their majority.\u201cWhat was apparent there,\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n said, \u201cis that Republicans did not have a playbook to run against our candidates.\u201dMs. Pelosi herself was seemingly untroubled: During a fund-raising trip to Pennsylvania early in the summer, she expressed no discomfort with Mr. Lamb. On the contrary, she named him and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the left-wing insurgent who won a New York primary in June, as the ideological poles of an emerging Democratic congressional majority.A majority, Ms. Pelosi made clear, that she fully intended to lead.A 43-year-old House Republican who represented the well-to-do Kansas City suburbs, Mr. Yoder had to read about how the National Republican Congressional Committee was pulling its advertising from his district because it did not think he could win.Furious, Mr. Yoder telephoned Mr. Stivers and blistered him about being disloyal, reminding the campaign chairman that he had been a vice chairman of the N.R.C.C. and always paid his dues to the committee.Mr. Stivers accepted the tongue-lashing, but Mr. Yoder\u2019s campaign was beyond repair: he lost by 9 percentage points to Sharice Davids on Tuesday.Abandoning Mr. Yoder was a ruthless act of triage, aimed at saving money that could be used to rescue other members. But bitter personal clashes between Republican Party strategists hobbled their efforts to spend money coherently in the last stage of the election.Open animosity erupted between the Congressional Leadership Fund, the House super PAC funded heavily by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, and the N.R.C.C. The super PAC would ostentatiously leak word of plans to pull funding from vulnerable lawmakers, leaving the committee scrambling in some cases to make up the difference. In some cases, the groups seemed to make decisions more for the purpose of outflanking each other rather than thwarting Democrats.In late September, C.L.F. decided to cut loose two lawmakers, Mike Bishop of Michigan and Mike Coffman of Colorado, calling them unsalvageable. Disagreeing, the N.R.C.C. rushed new money into Mr. Coffman\u2019s district.Soon, both groups would change their assessments: When a poll showed Mr. Coffman losing by 14 percentage points, the N.R.C.C. rescinded much of the money it hastily deployed. And C.L.F., after humiliating Mr. Bishop, returned to spending in his district within weeks, trying to save him after all.Mr. Coffman lost decisively on Tuesday, while Mr. Bishop was losing by nearly four points with nearly all precincts reporting.In the campaign\u2019s finale, Democrats established an overwhelming advantage on television: A coalition of outside-spending groups, coordinated by House Majority PAC, poured an estimated $200 million into advertising, mainly around the tightly-organized themes laid out in the party\u2019s suburban and working-class opinion research.Bolstered by online donations, more than 100 Democratic candidates out-raised their Republican rivals in contested general-election races. And in October, a super PAC financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, ambushed still-complacent Republican lawmakers on the air with massive, late spending, helping to defeat incumbents like Randy Hultgren of Illinois and Steve Russell of Oklahoma.Rather than rallying to face that veritable war machine, Republicans turned on each other. Corry Bliss, the super PAC\u2019s sharp-elbowed chief strategist, badmouthed party strategy around Washington, criticizing the House committee for spending millions on incumbents he saw as hopeless, such as Barbara Comstock of Virginia, who enjoyed infusions of party cash through the end of the election \u2014 and lost by 12 percentage points, becoming the first incumbent defeated nationwide on Tuesday.But the N.R.C.C. viewed Mr. Bliss\u2019s group as reckless in its spending and insensitive to the delicate web of egos and relationships in the Republican conference.\u201cFighting with allies is hard, just look back at World War II,\u201d Mr. Stivers said, likening Mr. Bliss to Bernard Montgomery, the capable but egocentric British general.Even before Mr. Trump began thundering against an \u201cinvasion\u201d from Latin America \u2014 spurning with finality the moderate swing voters that Republicans desperately needed \u2014 his party\u2019s facade of election-year unity was crumbling.Panic mounting, Republican factions began looking out for themselves: Mr. McCarthy, currying favor with the right as he positioned himself to succeed Mr. Ryan, revived a push to fund Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall. On the weekend before the election, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a far-right rival of Mr. McCarthy, began calling colleagues to gauge their interest in supporting him for minority leader in a Democratic-led House.As Mr. Trump swallowed the already-faint Republican economic message with deafening appeals to right-wing nationalism, Republican campaign chiefs began expressing discomfort with his turn toward raw racial politics. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, head of the Republican Senate committee, expressed anxiety to allies that Mr. Trump\u2019s obsession with a migrant caravan could harm his Senate re-election in 2020.Among White House aides, improvisation and favor-trading overrode any semblance of political strategy. Even Vice President Mike Pence, aides noted, appeared less than deliberate in his approach: When conservative media began rippling with interest in John James, a long-shot Senate candidate in Michigan, Mr. Pence phoned the president from the state and urged him to campaign there. The same day, a public poll found Mr. James losing by 17 points to Senator Debbie Stabenow.Johnny DeStefano, counselor to the president, told an associate he used \u201cevery ounce of capital\u201d to keep Mr. Trump from visiting Michigan and other states where his party was sure to lose.And in a move that baffled their political peers, both Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy visited Kansas City on the Friday before the election to campaign with Mr. Yoder, among other Republicans \u2014 more than a month after the N.R.C.C. concluded Mr. Yoder could not win.Last weekend, the gulf between the two parties \u2014 in strategy and message, in political tenacity and internal cohesion \u2014 could not have been greater. Meeting with campaign donors in San Francisco, Ms. Pelosi declared confidently that the House majority would soon be in Democratic hands. Next up, she said, would be a \u201chuge amount of work to repair the fabric of the country,\u201d according to a person in attendance who paraphrased her comments.Campaigning in Georgia for Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, Mr. Trump delivered a message with all the subtlety of an arsonist\u2019s house fire, accusing Democrats of seeking to inflict \u201cmore crime and more caravans\u201d upon the country.And in a fluorescent-lit Republican Party office in Sheboygan, Wis., beneath a bleak sky, Mr. Ryan beamed through an upbeat pep talk to local Republicans about the economy.\u201cTwo hundred and fifty thousand jobs were created in America in October alone,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThis is working!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Red-Leaning Kansas, Democrat\u2019s Target Isn\u2019t on Ballot (and It\u2019s Not Trump)", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGARDEN CITY, Kan. \u2014 State Senator Laura Kelly, the Democrat running for governor of Kansas, likes to talk about Sam Brownback, the Republican ex-governor. At a debate last week, she mentioned him five times. And that was just in her two-minute opening statement.Democrats see a path to power in red-leaning Kansas this way: Talk a lot about Mr. Brownback and his tax-slashing experiment that left gaping state revenue shortfalls in recent years. Then tie the ex-governor as closely as possible to Secretary of State Kris W. Kobach, the Republican nominee for governor, who has burnished a national profile with ominous warnings about vote fraud and illegal immigration.Polls have shown an especially close race, and Mr. Brownback, who left office in January to become an ambassador, looms large. His legacy is so problematic that Mr. Kobach has taken pains to distance himself without offending core Republican voters. And his name is so toxic that Ms. Kelly utters it as often as possible: in stump speeches, commercials, campaign emails.Speaking to the debate crowd at a packed middle school auditorium in Garden City, a Republican stronghold in the state\u2019s rural southwest, Ms. Kelly said, \u201cEverywhere you look: Our schools, our roads, our economy, our health care, all devastated by the Brownback tax experiment.\u201d\u201cDo we stay on the road to recovery and slam the door on the Brownback experiment once and for all?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr do we promote the man who has promised to repeat the Brownback disaster?\u201dKevin McWhorter, 60, a Republican investment banker from Wichita, said he planned to cross party lines to vote for Ms. Kelly. Mr. McWhorter, a self-identified moderate who has donated to Ms. Kelly\u2019s campaign, said he was pulled left by fears that Mr. Kobach would be a repeat of the Brownback years.\u201cKansas has always been a common-sense state. Even though it was very conservative, we had a lot of common-sense people,\u201d Mr. McWhorter said. \u201cWhen Sam Brownback came into office, that stopped.\u201d\u201cIf historical patterns were to hold true, they would suggest I would lose this race,\u201d Mr. Kobach said after he warned supporters in Dodge City that liberals were casting early ballots in large numbers. \u201cCounteracting that, you have the fact Kansas is a red state, Republicans do outnumber Democrats. Those two forces are kind of butting up against each other.\u201dMs. Kelly, who supports Medicaid expansion and talks often about funding schools and roads, has tried to take advantage of a longtime split between Mr. Kobach\u2019s conservative wing of the Republican Party and a sizable contingent of moderates.She also has regularly noted the endorsements of dozens of former Republican elected officials, including two ex-governors and two former United States senators. It\u2019s a way of playing up her claims of bipartisanship, but also a tacit acknowledgment that there aren\u2019t enough Democrats in Kansas to win with them alone.Former Gov. Bill Graves, one of the Republicans supporting Ms. Kelly, said he was moved to make his endorsement because \u201cGovernor Brownback\u2019s grand experiment was a complete and utter failure.\u201d\u201cWe need to get back to basics,\u201d said Mr. Graves, who suggested Mr. Kobach would revive the Brownback tax policy and that Ms. Kelly would govern from the center.Mr. Brownback, who served seven years as governor, was elected along with Mr. Kobach in 2010, and the two men have long shared a commitment to cutting taxes and enacting socially conservative policies.Mr. Brownback promised Kansas residents that his signature tax-slashing philosophy would be a national model and provide a \u201cshot of adrenaline\u201d to the state\u2019s economy, but that growth never materialized.\u201cShe\u2019s not actually running against me, she\u2019s running against Sam Brownback,\u201d Mr. Kobach said in the Garden City debate. After listing off points where he disagreed with Mr. Brownback, he added: \u201cWould the real Sam Brownback please stand up?\u201dDemocrats\u2019 enthusiasm aside, there are reasons for skepticism about their chances. Ms. Kelly\u2019s support for abortion rights and some forms of gun control could scare off swing voters. And Kansans wary of Mr. Kobach but not eager to vote for a Democrat have other options. Greg Orman, a businessman running for governor as an independent, has polled in the high single-digits in many polls and could tip a close race to the Republicans.There is also the matter of Mr. Brownback, Ms. Kelly\u2019s favorite rhetorical target, not being in Kansas anymore.\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily playing as well,\u201d said Kelly Arnold, the chairman of the Kansas Republican Party. \u201cGovernor Brownback is no longer the governor. He\u2019s out of the state.\u201dBut the awkwardness remains. At another debate this week, the moderator asked the candidates to raise their hand if they thought Mr. Brownback was a good governor.Mr. Kobach glanced ever so slightly to his left, then to his right. Then, for a little more than a second, he lifted his arm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Riled Up and Ready to Vote", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYoung voters discuss the issues motivating them this year.Ms. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants.The respondents frequently mentioned climate change, no matter their party affiliation, and health care, as well as a fear of the country\u2019s growing political divide. The sloganeering tactics Democrats have used in the past few years are identical to those of the radical left-wing students I see on campus every day. I am fed up with the inaction on climate change. I don\u2019t care if I have to pay more for electricity or if my tax rate goes up. I am fortunate enough that I can handle it and take on some of the burden for those who can\u2019t. I\u2019ll give up some comforts now if that means I will have a future into which I feel comfortable bringing children. It\u2019s going to take money, hard work, sacrifice and pain. But the sooner we start, the better we can control our destiny.Medicaid expansion is on the ballot in Nebraska, which would make life easier for thousands of people in this state. Kara Eastman, the Democratic candidate in Nebraska\u2019s second district, is running for Congress and I love that she doesn\u2019t accept corporate PAC money and that she supports affordable health care and education. I\u2019m fortunate because I can afford my health insurance and I\u2019m pretty healthy, but I know plenty of people who simply can\u2019t make insurance work.If I had to pick one issue that has always motivated me to vote, it would be entitlement reform. As someone with forty working years ahead of me, I don\u2019t want Social Security when I retire. Every year we sink an increasing portion of all federal spending into mandatory entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. This may sound a little Paul Ryan-ish of me, but it\u2019s a real problem and it\u2019s bad that both parties run away from this \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics. Today\u2019s Republican Party has essentially abandoned the principle altogether. The sooner we get young people saving for their own retirements, the better off we\u2019ll all be in the long run. Georgia\u2019s Hope Scholarship is the only reason I am in college and I work hard to keep the grades to maintain it. I would like to see an expansion of the scholarship so that more students have access, as well as more funds.Stacey Abrams, Georgia\u2019s Democratic candidate for governor, wants to expand access to Hope as well as add a need-based funding component to further help underprivileged students. I like that she is standing her ground as a progressive in a state that has been historically conservative. She pushes on even though the odds and the system are stacked against her. To me, that is the perfect representation of what it means to be a Georgian.We need individuals in office that recognize student debt as a top priority. I fear living a life where I cannot climb the economic ladder because of my student loan debt. My parents were able to save and become homeowners but I fear I won\u2019t be able to do the same.Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running for re-election in New York, is the best fit for my beliefs. He has said that ignoring climate change is a gross negligence by the government and he has shown interest in rebuilding education in the state and making public college tuition free for many.As the son of a Cuban political exile I cannot sit back and watch the slander and defamation of immigrants continue. The rhetoric coming from the Trump administration is unacceptable. The most recent attacks on immigration \u2014 Trump\u2019s proposed executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship and his deployment of troops to the border \u2014 have left me shocked. These elections are simply a referendum on the Trump agenda. I\u2019m happy with the current job the president is doing. I don\u2019t agree with him on everything \u2014 his affinity for tariffs and trade wars, for instance, and his disregard of climate change and some social issues, like restrictions on abortion \u2014 but as a recent college graduate, I\u2019m happy with what he\u2019s done for the country\u2019s economic performance, particularly tax cuts. And I\u2019m in agreement about immigration issues. We need a secure border and to end chain migration and the lottery system. I want Trump\u2019s positions on these issues to continue full throttle and I don\u2019t want to see gridlock for the next two years if the Democrats regain power. There\u2019s a joke in Alabama that we rank next to last in everything except football. I\u2019d like that to change in my lifetime. I want candidates who espouse fundamental conservative values and have a record of bipartisanship. I\u2019m missing the voices of certain conservatives of integrity and moral courage on the national level, like John McCain, and am now searching for that representation in local races. There are some days where I see tax breaks, a growing economy and lowered unemployment rates and think \u201cHey, things are getting better.\u201d Then the president tweets a porn star and calls her \u201chorse face.\u201d It is challenging to separate some of the conservative policy from the abrasive and offensive language coming from the Oval Office.I\u2019m tired of people who don\u2019t look like me or share my experiences constantly making decisions for me. I\u2019m tired of old, rich white people, predominantly men, speaking for me and deciding what I do with my body and my life. It isn\u2019t fair that they make the decisions but don\u2019t have to live with the effects of those decisions. I just want to have a say in what happens to my body. I want to know that if I am sexually assaulted again, and I choose to come forward this time, I\u2019ll be treated fairly. The Supreme Court nomination process of Justice Kavanaugh left me panicked. Every single reason I had for not coming forward was validated during those hearings. I want to feel safe walking in my front door and not be worried that my little sister is going to be shot while at school. I want to be able to afford my student loans, and still have a few dollars left over. There have been days that I\u2019ve gone without eating just so I had enough gas to get to work. I\u2019m supporting any and all Democratic candidates. I need to have the tide turn blue so that I can keep living.I believe keeping taxes lower while cutting spending will help the economy grow. Treating drugs as a mental health issue and not a crime is necessary to keep nonviolent offenders from serving long sentences, which leads to broken homes. I\u2019ve voted in every major election since I became eligible in 2008. We get the world we deserve. Not voting, while certainly making a statement, does not move us forward, in most cases. But until a more moderate candidate emerges from either major party, I find it difficult to be inspired by either extreme.Advertisement"}

A major scientific report on climate issued by 13 federal agencies over the holiday weekend says the U.S. will have to spend billions to protect against the effects of global warming.__________The company also aims to eliminate 8,000 salaried jobs, about 15 percent of its white-collar employees in North America.The cuts reflect our changing tastes: Gas prices have remained low for several years, and buyers are shifting to bigger trucks and SUVs. Demand has tumbled for small and midsize cars \u2014 like the Chevrolet Impala and Buick LaCrosse \u2014 produced at plants that will be idled. Above, Canadian workers at a union hall waited for an update on their future.\u201cWe are taking this action now while the company and the economy are strong to keep ahead of changing market conditions,\u201d G.M.\u2019s chief executive said._____4. Touchdown on Mars.InSight will study the Martian underworld, measuring tremors (a.k.a. marsquakes) and helping scientists understand how the planet formed.And that could shed light on the origin of our planet, too._____5. \u201cIt was raining fire.\u201dIn Paradise, Calif., above, buildings have been reduced to ash.

Security Council session to blame Ukraine for the confrontation, but the plan backfired, with Western nations accusing the Russians of recklessness._____7. The politics of the suburbs are complicated.For example, many suburban voters supported socially liberal agendas in Washington \u2014 but opposed affordable housing and school desegregation in their own communities.Rather than identifying as Republican or Democrat, or conservative or liberal, one expert told us, \u201cthey are homeowner, taxpayer and school parent.\u201d_____8.

{"Headline": "Inside the Fight to Turn Red California Blue ", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig swaths of the Golden State remain conservative, and changing the political fabric and voting patterns of a community takes more than one election. Ms. Pawel, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of \u201cThe Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation.\u201dTURLOCK, Calif. \u2014 It started so small. Twenty people in Crystal Sousa\u2019s living room, traumatized by the election of Donald Trump, trying to channel desperation into constructive action. Be the Change, they called the group that coalesced in this small, conservative city in the Central Valley of California. Almost all the leaders were women. Most had never engaged in politics. But they had been PTA mothers, Girl Scout leaders and teachers. They knew how to get things done.Last weekend, almost two years after she hosted her first house party, Ms. Sousa stood on a flatbed truck dispatching wave after wave of volunteers to knock on voters\u2019 doors. So many hundreds of canvassers showed up that teams were sent back to revisit houses where no one had been home the first time. Their message was straightforward: The four-term incumbent, Representative Jeff Denham, was an ally of President Trump, loyal only to the Republican Party, betraying the interests of the people of the 10th Congressional District.Whether their argument proved persuasive enough may not be clear for days. On Wednesday, Mr. Denham was holding a slim lead over his Democratic challenger, Josh Harder, with many votes uncounted, including provisional ballots cast on Election Day and mail-in votes still in transit.Even absent results, Mr. Harder cast his campaign as part of the Democrats\u2019 larger success in retaking the House. \u201cOur real opponent was not somebody else on the ballot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was apathy and cynicism.\u201dA 32-year-old political novice who grew up in Turlock, Mr. Harder put together an old-fashioned campaign that drew on lessons from recent Democratic victories: Underdogs can topple incumbents only by organizing, not for months but for years, not after a candidate is chosen but before, not just by demonizing President Trump but by tying Republicans to issues that resonate with voters \u2014 reduced access to health care, attacks on immigrants.On paper, Stanislaus County, the bulk of the 10th district, has had a Democratic majority since April 2008. But as in much of California, party registration is not necessarily predictive of voting patterns. In a state that grew up fiercely committed to repudiating political machines, ticket splitting is a given. Stanislaus Republicans have long held a lock on local offices, even as the county has voted, until 2016, for every winning presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1972.\u201cCalifornia with Southern hospitality and a Southern mind-set\u201d is how Ms. Sousa describes the community where she grew up, a legacy of the long-ago migration of Southern Democrats to the Central Valley. Democrats here historically refrained from advertising their beliefs; there were few lawn signs for Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, though each carried the district.That changed after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, in ways that both enlarged and further polarized the electorate. A dozen groups like Be the Change sprung up \u2014 Our Revolution, Indivisible Manteca, Patterson Progressive Alliance. The groups came together as the CA 10 Progressive Alliance, united in their determination to flip the district. They reached out to engage the young and disenfranchised. And they registered voters; the total in the district increased 18 percent since the last midterm, almost double the statewide average.As in the rest of California, the biggest increase came in independent voters, whose numbers since the last midterm grew more than 50 percent; they now make up almost a quarter of the district\u2019s voters. That further complicates the political calculus, underscoring the degree to which personal beliefs and connections outweigh party loyalty.It will take weeks of analyzing votes that have not even been tallied to determine exactly who voted and how much of the race turned on support or opposition to President Trump versus the contest between Mr. Denham and Mr. Harder. That the Republican may have eked out another win is a testament to the strength of incumbency and the convictions of his conservative base, who vote far more reliably than the new and the disillusioned voters whom the Harder coalition worked to enfranchise.On the issues, Mr. Denham\u2019s alliance with the president increased his vulnerability. Growers have been among Mr. Denham\u2019s core supporters, but Trump policies on immigration and trade have hurt the walnut and almond growers and dairies that are bulwarks of the local economy. The congressman highlighted Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to help get more water for farms, although the promises have yet to translate to action. And on health care, a key concern for many in a district that relies heavily on Obamacare, Mr. Denham reneged on a promise to vote against cuts in the Affordable Care Act, joining Republicans\u2019 unsuccessful effort to repeal and replace.Mr. Denham\u2019s campaign script sought to distract attention from the issues and sow doubts about the values of the man he only referred to as \u201cBay Area Harder,\u201d often adding \u201cliberal\u201d as the ultimate pejorative. Like many young people, Mr. Harder had left the valley \u2014 in his case to attend Stanford and Harvard and work at a venture capital firm. He was not politically involved and did not even vote until he moved back to Turlock to run for Congress, galvanized by the election of Mr. Trump. The result was an unheard-of army of volunteers with clipboards and smartphones, traditional one-on-one organizing married with apps that tracked progress in real time. Some volunteers stayed with locals and built relationships that, like the Harder campaign, may lay the groundwork for future change.\u201cThis is not just one election,\u201d said Ms. Sousa, a teacher who was recently elected to her school board. The grass-roots groups will continue to meet regularly, regardless of the outcome of the congressional race. \u201cThis is going to change the whole make up of our district. It\u2019s been life changing, honestly.\u201dWhatever the outcome in this congressional contest, the Democratic campaign has laid the foundation for much-needed change in a district where fewer than 18 percent of the people have college degrees and 40 percent rely on MediCal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid. The Harder campaign marked a milestone here in the Central Valley, potentially an inflection point to empower a community badly in need of help. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Cabinet Approves Draft Deal on Brexit", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrime Minister Theresa May\u2019s cabinet approved a draft agreement on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union during an emergency meeting on Wednesday, a crucial and perilous step, as the time left to strike a final deal runs short.Cabinet support relieves some of the pressure on Mrs. May, who has struggled for months to meet competing demands over the withdrawal, commonly known as Brexit, which is scheduled to occur on March 29.\u201cThe choices before us were difficult, particularly in relation to northern Ireland backstop, but the collective decision of Cabinet was that government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration,\u201d she said in a short statement. \u201cThis is a decisive step.\u201dBefore the meeting Wednesday, hard-line advocates of Brexit had tried to persuade the full cabinet to reject the draft agreement, or to resign in protest. Either outcome would have been devastating for Mrs. May.\u2022 There are still several steps before the agreement could take effect. The deal needs the approval of the British Parliament, which is far from a certainty. The European Parliament and the bloc\u2019s 27 other member states would also have to approve it.\u2022 A key sticking point is the Irish border. Negotiators are trying to find a way to allow people and goods to pass through without the imposition of border controls.Even before the cabinet met, the backlash was well underway, with hard-line Conservatives and members of opposition parties alike condemning the plan in statements, television interviews and debate in Parliament.Critics on both left and right argue that the deal would leave Britain subject to European Union rules, but without any say in making those rules. They are also alarmed that Britain would not have a unilateral right to quit the temporary customs union.On the floor of Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, traded barbs with Prime Minister Theresa May, but she refused to be drawn into offering any details of the agreement.\u201cFrom what we know the government\u2019s deal is a failure in its own terms,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t deliver a Brexit for the whole country. It breaches the prime minister\u2019s own red lines.\u201dMrs. May retorted that the Labour Party had \u201conly one intention, and that is to frustrate Brexit and betray the vote of the British people.\u201dJacob Rees-Mogg, a hard-core Brexit supporter, told the BBC that the proposed deal was \u201ca failure of the government\u2019s negotiating position and a failure to deliver.\u201dThe prime minister\u2019s Conservative Party does not have a majority in Parliament, so her government relies on Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which voiced opposition to the deal even before it was made public.Jeffrey Donaldson, a senior D.U.P lawmaker, went further, telling the BBC on Wednesday that what he had heard of the draft Brexit deal \u201cundermines the constitutional and economic integrity\u201d of the United Kingdom, and warning that he was not afraid of precipitating a general election by opposing the plan.The most delicate aspect of the plan is the so-called backstop to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union.From what is known of the draft, Britain would stay temporarily in a customs union with the European Union until a long-term trade deal is negotiated. But the obligations on Northern Ireland would be deeper, particularly in obeying standards laid down by the European Union\u2019s single market, leading to increased regulatory checks on goods flowing from Britain to Northern Ireland.That is seen as an almost existential threat by the D.U.P., which wants to remain part of the United Kingdom.Rest in peace, \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal.\u201d Long live compromise.Mrs. May is not generally seen as a stealthy political operator, but Wednesday signaled a sharp reversal of the pledge that has been her Brexit mantra. For nearly two years, she has repeatedly assured the country that \u201cno deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.\u201dThis promise \u2014 that she would walk away rather than compromise Britain\u2019s interests \u2014 helped her keep the allegiance of hard-line Brexiteers in her own party, while conveying to Brussels that it should give a little, to prevent a chaotic exit. It projected such confidence that the pound rose sharply in the hours after she first articulated it.But on Wednesday, it appeared that Mrs. May\u2019s message had been a bluff. It has been replaced by the opposite logic, conveyed in the most urgent terms: A compromise with the European Union \u2014 a package of wins and losses \u2014 is better than no deal.Economists and business leaders have warned that an abrupt, \u201ccliff edge\u201d Brexit, without an agreement to take the place of membership, could have disastrous consequences for Britain, including shortages of food and other goods and sudden price increases. Moderate voices have long urged compromise as the only sensible solution.But by adopting the language of her party\u2019s euroskeptic right wing for so long, Mrs. May ran the risk of a last-minute explosion.Corporate Britain has so far shown a mixed response to the Brexit plan. Business leaders want a stable, predictable environment, and are divided on whether the proposed deal can provide it.Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said in an emailed statement: \u201cThis is a welcome step towards a deal, as retailers urgently need certainty as we approach the date of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the E.U.\u201dTo understand why Ms. Vine\u2019s throwaway line matters, one must understand the incestuous nature of British politics in general, and the Brexit drama in particular.Aside from being a columnist for a powerful pro-Brexit tabloid, Ms. Vine is married to Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer and member of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s cabinet, and her remark seemed like confirmation that he would support the deal, propelling it toward a Parliament vote.It was another reminder that family ties \u2014 and conflicts \u2014 are a central organizing principle of Britain\u2019s elite.His older brother, Boris Johnson, left the cabinet over the compromise deal, but for the opposite reason: He is a standard-bearer of the Conservatives\u2019 hard Brexit faction.Their sister Rachel Johnson, a Daily Mail columnist, left the Conservative Party in 2017 because she opposed Brexit. Their brother Leo Johnson opposes Brexit and supports a second referendum.Brussels was tracking events in London nervously, concerned about whether Mrs. May can get the deal through her cabinet and the Parliament \u2014 and what would follow if she could not.In European Union offices, there is a general but unfocused hope that somehow Britain will reverse itself and remain in the European fold, presumably through a second referendum. But there is also deep fatigue, even annoyance, with the whole issue, which other member nations believe has diverted attention from pressing problems like migration, conflict with Russia, potential trade war with the United States, populist dissension within the bloc, and European elections next spring.As the British cabinet met Wednesday afternoon, ambassadors of the other 27 nations of the European Union were also be briefed on the draft deal. The agreement would have to be ratified by the leaders of the member nations, and by the European Parliament.The hope is that the European Union can hold a special Brexit summit meeting before the end of November to win approval for the agreement and the accompanying nonbinding political declaration. Britain is scheduled to leave the union on March 29.Leaks about the draft agreement have concentrated on the issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The resolution reportedly means Britain must adhere to European Union rules while no longer having a vote on them, an arrangement that critics have called \u201cvassalage.\u201dBut from the point of view of the bloc \u2014 a creature of rules, laws and regulations \u2014 anything that undercuts the single market is unacceptable, including competition on tariffs and regulations from a nonmember, as Britain soon may be.Beyond breaking Britain away from the rest of the European Union, Brexit also poses a growing risk of breaking up the country.Voters in Scotland rejected independence in a bitterly contested 2014 referendum, but separatism remains a potent force in Scottish politics. In 2016, Scotland voted by a wide margin, 62 percent to 38 percent, to remain in the European Union, while Britain as a whole voted to leave, 52 percent to 48 percent.So when word leaked that Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit deal would allow Northern Ireland to maintain a close relationship to the European market, at least temporarily, Scottish nationalists saw an opening. If Northern Ireland gets a separate deal, they asked, why shouldn\u2019t Scotland?Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party, tore into the deal in Parliament on Wednesday.Michael Wolgelenter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Threatens Car Tariffs, Europe Prepares to Strike Back", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Europe\u2019s top trade diplomat is bracing for a trade war with the United States and said on Wednesday that the European Union was preparing to strike back if President Trump followed through with his threat to impose tariffs on Europe\u2019s cars.The European Union and the United States are meeting this week to try to lay the foundation for trade talks that would reduce tariffs on a range of industrial goods. But as Mr. Trump and members of his administration vent about the pace of negotiations and continue dangling potential auto tariffs, the Europeans have begun drawing up a list of American products they would tax if the trade dispute escalates.\u201cWe have already suffered from the tariffs on steel and aluminum, and we think that they are deeply unjustified,\u201d Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union trade commissioner, told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. Europe has already challenged the United States at the World Trade Organization over its imposition of 10 percent tariffs on aluminum and 25 percent on steel and has retaliated with tariffs on American goods like peanut butter, whiskey and orange juice.\u201cWe would do the same were we to be targets of tariffs on cars and car parts,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said.Ms. Malmstrom said that she had prepared a draft list of American sectors that could face retaliation but that they needed to be approved by member states of the European Union. While she would not detail the products, she said that Europe could retaliate against a range of American goods, including autos and agriculture, and that the response would be fully compatible with World Trade Organization rules.Still, she said, the aim is to resolve the trade differences before tensions escalate further. \u201cWe think there is much more to gain from having a positive agenda jointly,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said.The remarks came after Ms. Malmstrom met with Robert E. Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, to chart a path forward for negotiations. She described the discussions as productive, but expressed frustration about the lack of progress in getting the steel and aluminum tariffs lifted.The steel tariffs and the fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China have begun to have serious consequences for European growth. Germany\u2019s official statistics office said Wednesday that the country\u2019s economy shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter of 2018 compared with the previous quarter, the first decline since 2015. One factor was a drop in German exports to China, where the economy has slowed in part because of American tariffs on Chinese goods.BMW, the German automaker, said last week that the trade war had so far cost the company nearly 300 million euros, or about $337 million, and that it might have to move some production from Spartanburg, S.C., to China to avoid retaliatory tariffs.The United States and Europe called a trade cease-fire last summer after Mr. Trump and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed that there would be no additional tariffs imposed as they embarked on trans-Atlantic trade talks.Ms. Malmstrom said that Europe was under the assumption that it would not face car tariffs while talks proceed but acknowledged on Wednesday that she had not received any assurances about such an exemption.Congress must grant the Trump administration \u201cfast track\u201d authority to formally begin talks with Europe and the 28 European Union member states must also agree to a framework before talks can begin in earnest. That process could take a year.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, warned on a trip to Europe last month that \u201cthe president\u2019s patience is not unlimited\u201d and lamented the lack of progress. However, on Wednesday, Ms. Malmstrom blamed the glacial pace of America\u2019s legislative system for inhibiting negotiations.There is already disagreement on the scope of the talks and whether the negotiations will include agricultural products. The Trump administration has been pushing for greater access to Europe\u2019s agricultural market \u2014 including selling more chicken, soy and dairy products. European officials say agricultural products are a no-go area, except for soybeans, while American officials want to break down barriers that make it difficult for farmers to sell beef and cheese in Europe.Expectations were low in Brussels on Wednesday that the talks in Washington would lead to a reduction in tensions that have begun to inflict tangible damage to the European economy.European leaders view Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on their auto exports as a nuclear option that would force them to break off talks and impose a new round of retaliatory measures. Shocked and surprised when Mr. Trump imposed tariffs this year on European steel and aluminum, they are still struggling to cope with his use of brinkmanship to negotiate with a longtime ally.Such sentiments offer a taste of why a comprehensive trade agreement with Europe could be difficult.Armed with statistics on wine tariffs, Ms. Malmstrom noted that there was a minimal difference in the import taxes that the United States charged on foreign wine and what Europe charged.\u201cIn practical terms, it\u2019s not really correct to say that,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said of Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion. \u201cWe are happy to buy the American wine, and I think many Americans are happy to buy European wine as well. The costs are more or less the same when it comes to tariffs.\u201dAlan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Jack Ewing from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. to Idle Plants and Cut Thousands of Jobs as Sales Slow", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeneral Motors announced Monday that it planned to idle five factories in North America and cut roughly 14,000 jobs in a bid to trim costs. It was a jarring reflection of the auto industry\u2019s adjustment to changing consumer tastes and sluggish sales.The move, which follows job reductions by Ford Motor Company, further pares the work force in a sector that President Trump had promised to bolster. Referring to G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, he told reporters, \u201cI spoke to her and I stressed the fact that I am not happy with what she did.\u201dMr. Trump also invoked the rescue of G.M. after its bankruptcy filing almost a decade ago. \u201cYou know, the United States saved General Motors,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cand for her to take that company out of Ohio is not good. I think she\u2019s going to put something back in soon.\u201dIn addition to an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, the cuts affect factories in Michigan, Maryland and the Canadian province of Ontario.Ms. Barra said no single factor had prompted G.M.\u2019s cutbacks, portraying them as a prudent trimming of sails. \u201cWe are taking these actions now while the company and the economy are strong to stay in front of a fast-changing market,\u201d she said on a conference call with analysts.The idling of the five plants next year will result in the layoff of 3,300 production workers in the United States and about 2,500 in Canada. The company also aims to trim its salaried staff by 8,000. The cuts represent more than 10 percent of G.M.\u2019s North American work force of 124,000.Investors welcomed the news, sending G.M.\u2019s shares up 4.8 percent to their highest closing price in about three months.Word of the cutbacks in Canada had surfaced over the weekend. Just before G.M.\u2019s announcement, workers walked out of the plant in Oshawa, Ontario, into a driving rain. Waving red flags and clad in ponchos bearing the logo of their union, Unifor, they began blockading truck entrances.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had expressed his \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d about the closing to Ms. Barra.The United Auto Workers, representing workers at the American plants, said G.M.\u2019s move \u201cwill not go unchallenged.\u201d Closing domestic plants while expanding production in China and Mexico is \u201cprofoundly damaging to our American work force,\u201d said the union vice president in charge of negotiations with G.M., Terry Dittes.The plants include three car factories: one in Lordstown that makes the Chevrolet Cruze compact; the Detroit-Hamtramck plant, where the Chevrolet Volt, Buick LaCrosse and Cadillac CT6 are produced; and the plant in Oshawa, which primarily makes the Chevrolet Impala. In addition, the company will halt operations at transmission plants in the Baltimore area and in Warren, Mich.G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler are all poised to negotiate new labor contracts next year. Some of the affected G.M. plants could resume production, depending on the outcome of the bargaining. Carmakers often agree to keep plants open in exchange for other concessions from the union.Closing auto plants outright \u2014 rather than idling them, as G.M. says it plans \u2014 has been rare since the industry emerged from the recession. The last permanent shutdown of a plant in the United States came in 2016 when Mitsubishi Motors shuttered one in Normal, Ill. Before that, Ford closed a truck plant in St. Paul in 2011.More typically since rebounding from the recession, carmakers and their suppliers have restarted shuttered plants, adding new ones across the South and hiring tens of thousands of workers a year.But demand for small and midsize cars has plunged. Two-thirds of all new vehicles sold last year were trucks and S.U.V.s. That shift has hit G.M.\u2019s Lordstown plant hard. Just a few years ago, the factory employed three shifts of workers to churn out Chevy Cruzes. Now it is down to one. In 2017 the plant made about 180,000 cars, down from 248,000 in 2013.More broadly, the yearslong boom in car and truck sales in North America appears to be ending, said John Hoffecker, vice chairman at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm with a large automotive practice. \u201cSales have held up well this year, but we do see a downturn coming,\u201d he said. AlixPartners forecast that domestic auto sales will fall to about 15 million cars and light trucks in 2020, from about 17 million this year.Even though they are facing a potential slump, carmakers continue to spend heavily to develop electric vehicles and self-driving technology, both to meet regulatory mandates and to anticipate the future of driving. That shift is expected to remake the global industry and enable companies to enter new and potentially lucrative businesses, such as driverless taxi and delivery services.The Trump administration has moved to scrap stringent emissions requirements put into place under President Barack Obama, but the industry hopes that Mr. Trump will relent and reach an agreement with California, which sets its own emissions requirements. Automakers are wary of having two sets of standards.Before the election and after, Mr. Trump prodded Ford, G.M. and others to build plants in the United States instead of Mexico or China. As events have played out, however, his determination to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement is expected to have a modest impact on automakers, preserving much of the original 1994 accord.The terms negotiated with Canada and Mexico stipulate that at least 75 percent of an automobile\u2019s value must be produced in North America for a company to import it into the United States duty-free, and that 40 to 45 percent of a vehicle\u2019s value must consist of parts made by workers earning at least $16 an hour, a provision aimed at shrinking Mexico\u2019s wage advantage. Analysts believe the changes will have little to no effect on American jobs.Over all, the American auto industry has added nearly 350,000 jobs since the industry bottomed out in the wake of the recession. But the industry still employs tens of thousands fewer people than before the crisis, and hundreds of thousands fewer than in 2000.About 970,000 people worked in the United States auto industry in October, an increase of 12,800 since Mr. Trump took office. Most of that growth, however, came among manufacturers of recreational vehicles and trailers, as well as in auto parts. Through October, automakers like G.M. had cut about 7,000 jobs under Mr. Trump, government figures show. (Those numbers don\u2019t include the hundreds of thousands of workers employed by auto dealers, repair shops and related industries.)Ms. Barra said G.M. would set aside up to $2 billion in cash to pay for the job reductions announced Monday, and take noncash charges against its pretax earnings of about $1.8 billion. The charges will affect earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.Until last month, G.M. had been offering severance packages to entice salaried employees in North America to leave the company. In January, the company plans to cut additional white-collar jobs on an involuntary basis. Between the two actions, it aims to eliminate about 15 percent of its salaried jobs in North America.General Motors also said on Monday that it would stop production at two unspecified plants outside North America by the end of next year.Ian Austen and Ben Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan Was Overlooked. Not Any Longer.", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLANSING, Mich. \u2014 There is a tendency for people to define Gretchen Whitmer by who she is not.Ms. Whitmer was not one of the surprising, insurgent Democratic nominees for governor this cycle, as her campaign for Michigan\u2019s governorship was flush with money and key endorsements from the outset. She did not have the up-from-nothing background story of some other Democratic candidates; after all, a building in downtown Detroit is named for her father, the former chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield. She was not Abdul El-Sayed, the fiery leftist whose campaign for governor captured national attention, but who lost badly to Ms. Whitmer in the primary.And she was not Hillary Clinton, whose 2016 failure in Michigan still reverberates among Democrats throughout the state.But after a nearly 10-point victory Tuesday over the Republican state attorney general, Bill Schuette, Ms. Whitmer is finally getting recognition for who she is: a shrewd politician tailor-made for Michigan, whose pragmatic approach to policymaking has consistently been underrated by opponents in both parties.In the weeks leading up to the election, a slate of new Democratic stars emerged who gained national attention: Andrew Gillum in Florida, Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas, Stacey Abrams in Georgia. None won on Tuesday \u2014 Mr. Gillum\u2019s and Ms. Abrams\u2019s races have not yet been called \u2014 while the Whitmer-led ticket in Michigan soared, flipping two House seats and electing women to key statewide posts.Ms. Whitmer, 47, has also united a Michigan Democratic Party that was wounded and embarrassed after President Trump\u2019s 2016 victory in the state. She buried the pervasive belief that a ticket led by a woman could not succeed in the industrial Midwest, winning over a once-skeptical Detroit community and even some voters who backed Mr. Trump.That\u2019s partly because she\u2019s the anti-Clinton, said Lon Johnson, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party.\u201cI think that Hillary was viewed as a part of the hyper partisanship of this country, and Gretchen is not,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cShe\u2019s rightly viewed as someone who\u2019s reasoned and effective and doesn\u2019t join the shouting.\u2019\u2019Ms. Whitmer\u2019s folksy appeal was evident during the campaign as she traversed Michigan, an ideologically diverse state that is still rebounding from a recession that considerably damaged its labor-heavy economy.Ms. Whitmer, the former state Democratic Senate leader, leaned on her statehouse connections early in the race. She also diverged from the traditional Democratic formula for the primary \u2014 consolidating support in the outer areas of the state before focusing on Detroit later in the cycle.Fueled by her \u201cFix the Damn Roads\u201d bus tour and the belief that Democrats have not adequately reached out to working-class people of all races, Ms. Whitmer visited all 83 Michigan counties: union voters in Macomb County who voted for Mr. Trump, Flint residents still wrestling with the continuing water crisis and teacher unions hobbled by a Republican administration hostile to labor.\u201cLove you, Gretchen!\u201d one man called as she headed toward a diner in Lansing, her hometown, a common occurrence for a person who seems to be on a first-name basis with many voters.\u201cGretchen is like a football team that just runs the ball and runs the ball and runs the ball,\u201d said Mark Bernstein, the powerful Democrat and a member of the Board of Regents at the University of Michigan. Ms. Whitmer, a big sports fan who went to college with hopes of being a sideline broadcaster, would appreciate the reference.\u201cLots of times people want to see like 30-yard passes or fancy stunt play, but that\u2019s just not her style,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is Michigan, where we respect candidates who campaign how they live and work \u2014 and she does that.\u201dMs. Whitmer described her approach as being \u201ctethered to the things that matter to people.\u201d\u201cPart of the failures of past Democratic campaigns, I believe, was in not showing up,\u201d she said. \u201cIn assuming that you know what people are confronting and what they need and what they expect.\u201dLast month in her Lansing campaign office, Ms. Whitmer outlined some of the defining contours of her life in public service. She credited her parents, a Michigan power couple who worked in state government, with instilling in her a desire to give back to others. She also cited two life-changing experiences as the motivating forces behind her pragmatic approach to policymaking: caring for her dying mother in the early 2000s while she was nursing her first child and being sexually assaulted in college.\u201cI\u2019ve come to appreciate that these experiences are what compels me to just come in and fix problems,\u201d she said. \u201cIt eliminates my patience for anyone who wants to politicize an issue instead of just rolling up their sleeves and getting to work.\u201dRepublicans struggled to find a consistent line of attack against Ms. Whitmer. Mr. Schuette, who heavily spent his own money in the governor\u2019s race, tried to tie Ms. Whitmer to the tenure of former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, whose administration struggled with a slumping economy and the financial collapse of Detroit during her two terms.Mr. Schuette even called Ms. Whitmer by Ms. Granholm\u2019s name in a recent debate, though he quickly corrected himself.\u201cMaybe Bill Schuette will finally learn my name,\u201d Ms. Whitmer said at a campaign stop on Election Day.The most lasting criticism of Ms. Whitmer came from Mr. El-Sayed, her primary opponent who later endorsed her. In a recent interview, Mr. El-Sayed said \u201cit\u2019s no secret\u201d that his definition of a progressive differs from Ms. Whitmer\u2019s. He also said Ms. Whitmer\u2019s establishment ties significantly helped her in the primary.\u201cI think she was really effective at being able to leverage her influence with insiders in the party to keep other people out of the race\u201d who would have eaten into her vote, he said. \u201cShe was up against it. And a lot of folks were worried about what her candidacy would mean.\u201dMr. El-Sayed consistently chided Ms. Whitmer on health care. Though Ms. Whitmer was integral in helping Michigan expand Medicaid in 2013, she refused to back the Medicare-for-all proposal that Mr. El-Sayed and other progressive stalwarts attributed to her close connection with the health care industry and companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield.Ms. Whitmer bristles at the establishment label and said she simply refused to overpromise things to voters she did not feel the current system can deliver.\u201cYou can be both progressive and want to get things done \u2014 they\u2019re not mutually exclusive and that\u2019s what I bring,\u201d she said.The establishment label sticks particularly well to Ms. Whitmer, a product of a powerhouse Michigan family. Her mother, Sherry, was a Democrat and a top lawyer in the attorney general\u2019s office. Richard Whitmer, her father, led the state Department of Commerce in a Republican administration before leading Blue Cross Blue Shield as C.E.O. for years.The eldest of three children, Ms. Whitmer had dreams of covering sports for ESPN or a local television station that were upended after she took an internship with a local representative in Lansing, she said. She then decided to forgo broadcasting and enter Michigan State\u2019s law school, igniting a political awakening that coincided with her parents\u2019 rise to prominence in statehouse politics.She won her first primary election for the State House of Representatives less than three years after graduating from law school, kick-starting her political ascent that culminated with her becoming the first woman to lead a party caucus in Michigan\u2019s Senate.Ms. Whitmer has said she pursued the necessary charges based on the information she was given at the time, and the Nassar case was eventually taken out of her jurisdiction. She also notes that she made several reforms to the prosecutor\u2019s office in her six-month tenure, including opening a unit dedicated to investigating domestic violence.Political experts in Michigan point to the Medicaid expansion as a defining moment for her bipartisan credentials. Some Democrats in 2013 were torn about whether to work with the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, such a key legislative accomplishment, but Ms. Whitmer gained fans throughout the state for her willingness to put policy over politics.Debbie Stabenow, the Michigan senator who won re-election Tuesday, credits Ms. Whitmer for helping women secure victories across the ticket. Ms. Stabenow said it was especially important to do so by emphasizing their job qualifications, not their gender.\u201cSooner or later in American history this moment was going to come, where women were stepping forward and being recognized as the most qualified candidate,\u201d Ms. Stabenow said, as Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cR-E-S-P-E-C-T\u201d blared from Ms. Whitmer\u2019s campaign bus on Tuesday. \u201cAnd that didn\u2019t happen because we were in a back room and planned this together, but because each of us ran on our own merits.\u201dThe next song in the queue was Ms. Whitmer\u2019s favorite: Lizzo\u2019s women\u2019s empowerment anthem, \u201cGood as Hell.\u201d\u201cBoss up and change your life,\u201d the future governor sang. \u201cYou can have it all, no sacrifice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sweden\u2019s Push to Get Rid of Cash Has Some Saying, \u2018Not So Fast\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "Cash is disappearing in the country faster than anyone thought it would. Now, officials are trying to slow its demise as they determine the societal costs.Supported by\u201cWhen you are where we are, it would be wrong to sit back with our arms crossed, doing nothing, and then just take note of the fact that cash has disappeared,\u201d said Stefan Ingves, the governor of Sweden\u2019s central bank, known as the Riksbank. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn back time, but you do have to find a way to deal with change.\u201dConsumer groups say the shift leaves many retirees \u2014 a third of all Swedes are 55 or older \u2014 as well as some immigrants and people with disabilities at a disadvantage. They cannot easily gain access to electronic means for some goods and transactions, and rely on banks and their customer service.And the progress toward a cashless society could upend the state\u2019s centuries-old role as sovereign guarantor. If cash disappears, commercial banks would wield greater control.Among 18- to 24-year-olds, the numbers are startling: Up to 95 percent of their purchases are with a debit card or a smartphone app called Swish, a payment system set up by Sweden\u2019s biggest banks.Ikea, whose flat-box furniture is a staple of young households, has been experimenting to gauge the allure and effect of cashless commerce. In Gavle, about 100 miles north of Stockholm, managers decided to go cashless temporarily last month after they realized that fewer than 1 percent of shoppers used cash \u2014 and Ikea employees were spending about 15 percent of their time handling, counting and storing money.Patric Burstein, a senior manager, said the cashless test had freed employees to work on the sales floor. So far, around 1.2 of every 1,000 customers have been unable to pay with anything but cash \u2014 and mainly in the cafeteria, where people tend to spend change. Rather than bother with bills, Ikea has been offering those customers freebies.\u201cWe said, \u2018If you want a 50 cent hot dog, be my guest, take it. But next time maybe you can bring a card,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Burstein, who is 38.The test so far suggests that cash is not essential and, instead, may be costly, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot of resources on a very small percentage that actually need the service,\u201d he said.The nearby branch of the Swedish National Pensioners Organization has led protests against the experiment, in part, because many retirees like to go to the Gavle Ikea for a bite to eat.\u201cWe have around one million people who aren\u2019t comfortable using the computer, iPads or iPhones for banking,\u201d said Christina Tallberg, 75, the group\u2019s national president. \u201cWe aren\u2019t against the digital movement, but we think it\u2019s going a bit too fast.\u201dThe organization has been raising money to teach retirees how to pay electronically, but, paradoxically, that good effort has been tripped up by an abundance of cash. When collections for training are taken in rural areas \u2014 and the seniors donate in cash \u2014 the pensioner in charge must drive miles to find a bank that will actually take the money, Ms. Tallberg said. About half of Sweden\u2019s 1,400 bank branches no longer accept cash deposits.\u201cIt\u2019s more or less impossible, because the banks refuse to take cash,\u201d she said.Banks have propelled the cashless revolution by encouraging consumers and retailers to use debit and credit cards, which yields banks and credit card companies lucrative fees. That includes the bank-developed Swish smartphone app.Sweden\u2019s banks have cut back on cash in part for safety reasons after a rash of violent robberies in the mid-2000s. The national psyche is marked by an infamous helicopter heist in Vastberga in 2009, when thieves landed on the roof of a G4S cash service depot and stole millions \u2014 a drama now being turned into a Netflix film. Last year, only two banks were robbed, compared with 210 in 2008.In recent years, banks have dismantled cash machines by the hundreds. So little cash is used now that it has become expensive to track and maintain, said Leif Trogen, an official at the Swedish Bankers\u2019 Association.There are two proposals by the Swedish authorities to keep cash at hand. Parliament wants just the biggest banks to handle cash. The central bank is holding out for all banks to keep money flowing. Swedbank, SEB and other big Swedish financial institutions are fighting the lawmakers\u2019 demands, saying it would place an undue burden on them to provide greater access.\u201cThe demand for cash is decreasing at an ever faster pace,\u201d Mr. Trogen said. \u201cTherefore, it is fundamentally wrong to legislate to influence the demand for cash.\u201dChristine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, noted last week that several central banks were \u201cseriously considering\u201d digital currencies. \u201cWhile the case for digital currency is not universal, we should investigate it further \u2014 seriously, carefully and creatively,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of an official at the Swedish Bankers\u2019 Association.

{"Headline": "Who Is Carlos Ghosn and Why Is He in Trouble? ", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA titan of the auto industry, Mr. Ghosn was known for cost-cutting and performance-based compensation. His management of his own pay package may be his downfall. Carlos Ghosn, the man who created what was effectively the world\u2019s largest carmaker, was arrested in Japan on Nov. 19. The arrest is a remarkable fall from grace for a man regarded as one of the most powerful executives in the auto industry.Mr. Ghosn (pronounced \u201cGoan\u201d) has been credited with reviving Japan\u2019s Nissan car company and the French automaker Renault, in an alliance that later expanded to include Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. Last year, the three companies sold 10.6 million cars.Nissan said its investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower who said that Mr. Ghosn had been misrepresenting his salary and using company assets for personal purposes. Greg Kelly, Nissan\u2019s first American director and its former head of human resources, was also arrested. The two men are suspected of masterminding a long-running scheme to mislead financial authorities. Neither man has yet been charged. The prosecutor\u2019s office could request additional extensions from the court, to hold Mr. Ghosn for up to a total of 23 days, before it decides whether to seek an indictment.Renault has been more cautious. It is keeping Mr. Ghosn as chairman and chief executive, but the board has tapped Thierry Bollor\u00e9, the chief operating officer, to assume Mr. Ghosn\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities. Philippe Lagayette, the board\u2019s lead independent director, will take over as chairman temporarily. The French government is Renault\u2019s biggest shareholder. The finance and economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said France had no evidence of the accusations that Mr. Ghosn faces in Japan. But labor unions are already concerned about the affect the arrest could have on the more than 47,000 workers at Renault. Yes. But chief executives do \u2014 and Mr. Ghosn had a reputation for rewarding good performance and expecting to be rewarded for his job performance.After he took over as chief operating officer at Nissan in 1999, Mr. Ghosn overhauled how senior employees were paid. Instead of the Japanese tradition of rewarding seniority, Mr. Ghosn enforced a performance-based system and gave bonuses to midlevel managers. According to the Tokyo prosecutor\u2019s office, he is being investigated for hiding tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of compensation from 2011 to 2015. Prosecutors said he underreported his pay package by more than \u00a55 billion ($44.5 million) \u2014 understating his true earnings by half \u2014 in reports to a bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance.Mr. Ghosn has been embroiled in several fights over his executive pay, attracting the ire of investors and politicians. In 2016, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, who was at the time the finance minister, pressured Renault into reducing Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation. His salary came under scrutiny again the next year, and in 2018 he agreed to a 30 percent pay cut in return for another four-year term as chief executive. His own pay far outstripped those of his counterparts in Japan \u2014 he earned four times the pay of Toyota\u2019s chairman in 2017 \u2014 and he was unrepentant. In 1999, Renault acquired a large stake in Nissan, and Mr. Ghosn was sent to Japan to become chief operating officer. Months later, he closed five domestic factories and eliminated about 21,000 jobs, some 14 percent of the work force. Mr. Ghosn was pilloried in the press, but the aggressive cost-cutting worked and stabilized Nissan finances. He is seen as an innovator for how he later engineered an arrangement that allowed the two automakers to operate like a single carmaker, sharing the cost of developing new models and buying components together. He stepped down as Nissan\u2019s chief executive last year, but remained chairman and continued to lead the alliance. He was lionized in business circles, seen as the epitome of a high-flying, multitasking manager as he zipped between Paris and Tokyo. But in Japan, he was a rarity: a foreign leader at a domestic company, who instituted equally rare layoffs and was paid handsomely compared with other Japanese leaders, if not by international standards. The allegations against Mr. Ghosn could trample his legacy. An economist from Japan Macro Advisors in Tokyo described his arrest this way: \u201cLosing Mr. Ghosn from the Japanese corporate managerial scene is a loss for Japan. We need more non-Japanese corporate bosses who are willing to take risks, propose a vision and exert top-down leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Signs New Trade Deal With Canada and Mexico After Bitter Negotiations", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 President Trump and his Mexican and Canadian counterparts sought to put the acrimony of the past two years behind them on Friday as they signed a new trade agreement governing hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce that underpins their mutually dependent economies.But Mr. Trump faces a daunting challenge at home, where Congress must approve the deal before it can take effect.The complicated politics of trade would have made the task formidable enough even before the midterm elections, but it will grow only more so once Democrats assume control of the House in January.The agreement with Canada and Mexico is a signature achievement for Mr. Trump, who has long derided nearly every major trade deal that the United States has entered.Some pro-trade lawmakers complain that the revised agreement puts too many limits on the free flow of goods and services across borders, while trade skeptics maintain that it does not do enough to safeguard American jobs, encourage higher wages and protect the environment.Submission to Congress will open a frenzy of fresh negotiations over legislation to enact the agreement, potentially unraveling the careful balance achieved with Mexico and Canada.The appearance of the three leaders side by side in Buenos Aires to attend an economic summit meeting of the Group of 20, or G-20, was meant to paper over the bitterness, but the hard feelings were still evident.\u201cWe worked hard on this agreement,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s been long and hard. We\u2019ve taken a lot of barbs and a little abuse, and we got there. It\u2019s great for all of our countries.\u201dMr. Trump did not say that he was the one who had dished out most of the barbs and much of the abuse, but he insisted that he had come out of the process with a stronger relationship with the two leaders.He said that Mr. Trudeau, whom he once assailed as \u201cvery dishonest and weak,\u201d had become \u201ca great friend,\u201d despite it all.\u201cIt\u2019s been a battle,\u201d he added, \u201cand battles sometimes make great friendships.\u201dStoic and unmoved, Mr. Trudeau did not respond directly but seemed to refer implicitly to speculation that he might not attend the ceremony and send a lower-level official to sign in his place.His schedule for Buenos Aires did not initially list the ceremony. He opted to attend anyway, saying the deal \u201cmaintains stability for Canada\u2019s entire economy\u201d and removes the dangers associated with a threatened United States withdrawal.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new agreement lifts the risk of serious economic uncertainty that lingers throughout a trade renegotiation process.\u201dMr. Trudeau pointedly referred to the accord as the \u201cnew North American Free Trade Agreement\u201d and described it as \u201cmodernizing Nafta,\u201d despite Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to rebrand it as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.The Canadian leader also used the occasion to press Mr. Trump on steel and aluminum tariffs, which remain unresolved.\u201cMake no mistake, we will stand up for our workers and fight for their families and their communities,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cAnd Donald, it\u2019s all the more reason why we need to keep working to remove the tariffs on steel and aluminum between our two countries.\u201dThe signing came shortly after a separate ceremony, hosted by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, presenting Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, with Mexico\u2019s highest award for foreigners in honor of his role in negotiating the trade agreement.In accepting the Order of the Aztec Eagle from Mexico, Mr. Kushner insisted that the president\u2019s harsh language did not reflect the trust that has developed between the leaders of the two countries.\u201cThrough your direction and leadership we were able to accomplish a lot of great things,\u201d Mr. Kushner told Mr. Trump at the ceremony. \u201cWhile there has been a lot of tough talk, I have seen the genuine respect and care that President Trump has for Mexico and the Mexican people, and I do believe we have been able to put that in the right light.\u201dWhile analysts said the new trade agreement was not as much of a transformation as Mr. Trump has suggested, it does rewrite the rules for an extraordinary amount of commerce between the three nations.The United States did $581.6 billion in business with Canada last year, and $557.6 billion with Mexico, making them the nation\u2019s second- and third-largest trading partners.The deal also updates provisions on the digital economy, agriculture and labor unions, but it preserves an international dispute mechanism that Mr. Trump had sought to eliminate.Whether Mr. Trump can reach across the aisle to sell it to Congress remains an open question. In nearly two years in office, he has made little effort to forge bipartisan consensus in Congress, as Republicans controlled both chambers.Mr. Trump played down the challenge on Friday, expressing confidence that he would easily win approval by Congress.\u201cIt\u2019s been so well reviewed, I don\u2019t expect to have very much of a problem,\u201d he said.Business groups and some Republicans praised the agreement and called for expeditious endorsement by lawmakers. \u201cI believe it will create more jobs and expand economic opportunities for American workers, farmers and manufacturers by leveling the playing field on trade,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader and a longtime critic of Nafta, said on Friday that the new agreement could not be \u201csimply a rebranding of the same old policies that hurt our economy and workers for years\u201d if it is to pass Congress.\u201cIt must prove to be a net benefit to middle-class families and working people in our country and must have strong labor and environmental protections, which in the present deal are too weak,\u201d he said.A dozen Republican senators sent Mr. Trump a letter last week urging him to submit the agreement for approval in the lame-duck session of the departing Congress before Democrats assume control of the House in January.Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania who signed the letter, said the deal still needed to be improved even now, despite what he considered the improvements to the trade structure between the three nations.\u201cUnfortunately, the benefits of these enhancements are more than offset by the trade-limiting provisions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHowever, I would be willing to vote for the agreement if the president takes steps to strengthen it in the coming weeks through pro-trade modifications in the implementing legislation.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}

It also collides with the president\u2019s policy objectives of promoting fossil fuels, particularly coal.There\u2019s a lot more still to unpack from the 1,656-page assessment, so keep watching this space as we continue to report on this important story.Every year, smartphone makers unveil their newest models, faster and sleeker than the dinged-up devices in our pockets. Building-size ads tempt us to buy a new phone for loved ones this holiday season, or to take advantage of upgrades for ourselves.But you might want to think twice before replacing your phone, because the devices that support our virtual lives have a surprisingly large environmental impact in the real world.What\u2019s more, the average person hangs onto a phone for only two years. \u201cThis is not driven by the fact that these smartphones become obsolete in functionality,\u201d said Lotfi Belkhir, an entrepreneur and engineering professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. It\u2019s because of a business model that promotes frequent upgrades while masking the true financial and environmental costs of phones, he said.Purchasing fewer new phones will send a powerful message to industry that it needs to change, Dr. Belkhir said. \u201cThe amount of resources we are digging out of the earth to make new cellphones only to have them wasted at the end of their shelf life is simply not sustainable,\u201d he said.It will be a lot easier to tackle climate change if the world can figure out how to make various clean energy technologies \u2014 like carbon dioxide removal or electric vehicles \u2014 much, much cheaper. But what\u2019s the best way to do that?The researchers found that there hadn\u2019t been a single big breakthrough that made solar panels cheaper. Instead, a dizzying array of small improvements added up over time. What helped make this possible, the researchers found, were policies in countries like Japan and Germany, and later the United States and China, to install a bunch of solar power when it was still relatively pricey. These countries didn\u2019t just wait around for someone to invent a dirt-cheap solar panel, they subsidized deployment early on. Costs then fell as production ramped up and manufacturers got bigger and more skilled.The researchers concluded that these \u201cmarket-stimulating\u201d policies, such as tax credits or mandates for renewable energy, helped drive about 60 percent of the decline in solar costs, in part by spurring private investment. Publicly funded research also played a crucial role, especially in the early years. Jessika E. Trancik, a co-author of the study, said her team at M.I.T. was hoping to conduct similar analyses of other low-carbon technologies, like nuclear power, to better understand the most effective mix of policies for cutting costs. \u201cWe can cut emissions more quickly if we\u2019re strategic about how we design energy policies and invest in R&D,\u201d Dr. Trancik said. \u201cAnd one way to do that is to learn from past successes and figure out exactly why they happened.\u201dThe climate scientist Kate Marvel is answering your questions about understanding climate change, how we\u2019re affecting our planet and actions you can take to help protect the earth.Ask her a question here, and see the answers she\u2019s provided so far.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three New Takes on Feminism: In the Dorm, in the Economy and Around the World", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistFreitas offers an in-depth accounting of the problem of sexual assault on college campuses, analyzing both the likely exacerbating factors and various successful or ill-advised response strategies from universities. Based on a decade of research, her book is measured and rigorously reasonable, taking pains not to stray too far in any ideological direction. Freitas, a lecturer on women\u2019s issues and a well-regarded Y.A. author, elucidates the role alcohol and partying play in assaults, but insists that young women must not be held responsible for the violence committed against them. She stresses that the cultural factors that enable sexual assault are pervasive beyond the campus walls, but is optimistic that institutions can implement policies to help their students navigate sex responsibly and safely.She is most emphatic and prescriptive in her examination of \u201chook-up culture,\u201d the ritualized patterns of casual sex that are common among young people. Hook-up culture has long been a source of moral panic for adult observers of college life, and those who are weary of such condemnations might find Freitas a bit grating when she says that one cause of sexual assault on campuses may be the absence of emotional intimacy between college sexual partners. It\u2019s a claim that ignores both the statistics showing that a great deal of sexual violence occurs within romantic relationships, and the reality that a lot of thoroughly consensual sex happens between people who are not in love.The book gets into the weeds with a detailed study of failed university responses to sexual assaults, and readers outside the academy might lose interest toward the end, which specifies the ways large universities can be slow-moving, traditional and behind the times. But Freitas is worth reading for her interviews with college students, whom she treats with an uncommon degree of dignity and respect. They are, she reminds us, the experts in their own lives.An unconventional collaboration between a former World Bank economist and a novelist, \u201cEquality for Women = Prosperity for All\u201d analyzes how women\u2019s exclusion from work and educational opportunities inhibits economic growth. L\u00f3pez-Claros and Nakhjavani set out to prove the equation in their title by examining the fiscal ramifications of social phenomena like \u201cson preference,\u201d domestic violence, workforce gender imbalance, job segregation, cultural taboos, civil rights and education. The book serves largely as a showcase for data collected by the World Bank\u2019s Women, Business and the Law initiative, and provides a convincing argument that women\u2019s rights and education can stimulate economic growth at the national level, in some cases dramatically.The book is guided by an economist\u2019s sensibilities, and Nakhjavani\u2019s lyrical novelist\u2019s ear rarely manages to mitigate the dryness of L\u00f3pez-Claros\u2019s writing. As a reading experience, it leaves something to be desired \u2014 a lost opportunity, given the inherent drama and moral stakes of their argument. But the book\u2019s most distracting flaw is that morality itself seems tangential to its thesis. Viewing women primarily as human capital with earning potential, rather than as human beings with imaginations, desires, enthusiasms and senses of humor, makes sense for the calculations of an economist. But the posture becomes distracting when, for example, the book shifts abruptly from a discussion of Maria Da Penha, a Brazilian woman whose abusive husband twice attempted to murder her in 1982 (first with a gun, then by electrocution and drowning), to the impact that domestic violence can have on women\u2019s productivity at work. L\u00f3pez-Claros and Nakhjavani are persuasive in arguing that such systematic mistreatment of women impedes economic growth and leads to lost revenue, lost opportunities and wasted money. But it\u2019s depressing to think that anyone would need to make such a crass economic case in advocating for women\u2019s rights.After a successful campaign to get feminism included on Britain\u2019s A-level standardized tests, the 20-year-old Irish-born Nigerian-British feminist Eric-Udorie makes her publishing debut with \u201cCan We All Be Feminists?,\u201d an anthology of essays she edited in which 17 writers consider feminism\u2019s problems, failures and inadequacies. The book highlights feminist complacency regarding women of color; immigrant women; lesbian, bisexual or transgender women; sex workers and others. The anthology\u2019s writers wield their perspectives as members of these groups to challenge the presumption in the title of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s 2014 manifesto, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists.\u201dMany of the essays observe that mainstream white feminists have been bigoted, callous or insular, and they gesture at opportunities to make the movement better reflect the full range of women\u2019s experiences. Eishar Kaur, a member of Britain\u2019s Punjabi diaspora, explains how her treasured cultural heritage has been reductively dismissed as patriarchal oppression by an incurious, white-dominated feminist movement. Evette Dionne, the black American editor of Bitch Media, provides a devastating history of violence, including sexual violence, inflicted on black women by the police \u2014 and traditional feminism\u2019s disturbing willingness to ignore it in the interest of cozying up to law enforcement.Other essays miss the mark, or contain odd conceptions of what a feminist project might be. The disability rights advocate Frances Ryan dubiously suggests that abortion rights may be ableist, since pregnancies with abnormal fetuses are sometimes terminated. In another essay, on the power of media representation, the commentator Aisha Gani claims a victory for feminism in the success of the Somali-American beauty queen Halima Aden, a semifinalist in the Miss Minnesota U.S.A. pageant. Gani does not explain what is particularly liberating about victory in a competition that ranks women based on their attractiveness to men. Much of \u201cCan We All Be Feminists?\u201d reminds us just how often feminists have failed to listen. Parts of the book also remind us how feminism has not been listened to.Moira Donegan is a writer living in New York. Her first book, on sexual harassment and assault, is forthcoming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rural Patch of Hong Kong Where Rare Birds Sing and Developers Circle", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHong Kong DispatchHONG KONG \u2014 Squeezed tightly between two megacities with a combined population of 20 million are some of East Asia\u2019s most important wetlands, where rare birds sing out amid traditional shrimp ponds.Look up, and looming right above this rustic setting are the crush of skyscrapers in Shenzhen, China, almost close enough to touch. Just out of view behind some hills to the south are the congested streets of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.But in this corner of northwest Hong Kong, tens of thousands of cormorants, herons, egrets, sandpipers and other birds, including endangered species like the black-faced spoonbill, gather each winter to feed on the mud flats. Eucalyptus trees line a path that cuts along the shrimp and fishponds, where small restaurants serve up the day\u2019s harvest.For bird watchers, bike riders and day-trippers from Hong Kong, the wetlands offer welcome respite from the city\u2019s crowds, even if the sound of birdcalls is regularly interrupted by the clank of hammers and the beep-beep of reversing vehicles from an industrial district nearby.But in a place where land prices are among the most expensive in the world, shopping malls and apartment blocks are far more profitable than shellfish, and the area is increasingly attractive to developers.\u201cIn a few years, this will all be housing,\u201d said Yip Ka-kit, 32, as he took a break from riding his bicycle around Nam Sang Wai, a 400-acre wedge of the wetlands bounded by two rivers and filled with fish ponds and reed beds. \u201cPeople in Hong Kong only care about the economy.\u201dSigns warning of the punishment for arson \u2014 up to life in prison \u2014 hang prominently in the wetlands, a reminder of one of their most imminent threats: fire. A series of blazes this spring scorched parts of Nam Sang Wai.It is not the first time suspicious fires have burned in the area, which environmentalists and officials believe may have been set to undermine its ecological value.Police say they are investigating, but have arrested no suspects. Last year during a public hearing, a representative of a company that has applied to develop the area denied it had any role in the blazes.\u201cThere has been a longtime struggle between the landowners and preservationists about the future of that piece of wetland,\u201d said Eddie Chu, a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council who represents the area and has called for protection of Nam Sang Wai.Seen from above, the wetlands look like a net, with thin bands of land looping around blue blocks of water.For centuries, rice paddies filled the area. Then beginning in the 1940s, the people who worked this land, many of them refugees from war and political chaos in China, turned the paddies into fishponds that earned far more than rice.For decades, landowners have sought to develop the area, only to be rebuffed by the courts and government agencies. Last year the local planning board rejected the most recent proposal from a developer because of concerns about the potential loss of wetlands. The developer said it would appeal.The total size of the wetlands area is about 4,350 acres, equivalent to five of Manhattan\u2019s Central Park. Part of the wetlands are off limits to large-scale development, including the Mai Po Nature Reserve, which is protected under the Ramsar Convention, an international treaty for the conservation of wetlands.The reserve includes traditional shrimp farming ponds that have largely disappeared from the rest of China. The ponds, known as gei wai, make use of the tides to suck in young shrimp from Deep Bay. The ponds are then closed off, allowing the shrimp to grow in protected lagoons, until they are harvested by draining the water during an ebb tide.The World Wide Fund for Nature in Hong Kong operates 21 gei wai in the reserve. The shrimp are harvested at night.One night several pounds of shrimp were netted as a group of environment officials from mainland China watched and later dined on the shrimp, which were accompanied by soy sauce, chili peppers and beers.\u201cWhen we harvest there are small fish and shrimp we don\u2019t want, and the birds come and eat,\u201d said Wen Xianji, assistant director of the Mai Po reserve. \u201cThis traditional way of aquaculture benefits both humans and birds.\u201dThe nature reserve has the added protection of its location along Hong Kong\u2019s border with Shenzhen, where permits limit entry from the Hong Kong side, and a 15-foot fence topped with barbed wire blocks people from crossing from the mainland.Still, poachers do sometimes visit by boat to catch mudskippers, amphibious fish used in Chinese medicine.But other areas nearby, like Nam Sang Wai, have less concrete protections.The most recent development proposal in Nam Sang Wai would have included apartments for 6,500 people.The developer, a joint venture between a family that has long owned the land and Henderson Land Development, a large Hong Kong property company, said it would follow a model like the London Wetland Center, which included a residential development that financed a habitat preservation project.The proposed development itself would take up less than 10 percent of Nam Sang Wai\u2019s 400 acres, with the remainder preserved as managed wetlands, its backers say.Environmental groups, however, oppose the plan.\u201cSo far from what we\u2019ve seen the scale of development is not compatible with the area,\u201d said Woo Ming-chuan, conservation officer for the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society. \u201cIt\u2019s quite sensitive and unique, and they want to build residential towers.\u201dMs. Woo said she believed any plan that sacrifices some of the wetlands would only encourage further encroachment.\u201cWe are afraid that once approved it will be a precedent for similar applications in the future,\u201d she said.For now, the area remains a popular weekend destination for walkers, cyclists and nature lovers, with the entrance to the wetlands a short walk from a shopping mall that sits atop a rail station.A short sampan ride takes visitors across a branch of the Shan Pui River. The captain can often be found sleeping on the boat, waiting for passengers to board the small wooden craft, with a maximum capacity of seven. It is the only ferry in Hong Kong that traverses a river and the only one human-powered.Among people who visit the area, the fear is that the forces of development will eventually win out.\u201cOf course I want them to preserve this place,\u201d said Mr. Yip, the cyclist. \u201cIf they fill in everywhere in Hong Kong with houses, there will be nothing left to do here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the waterway that is traversed by a sampan to the wetlands. It is a branch of the Shan Pui River, not an eddy in the river.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dozens From Migrant Caravan Line Up at Border, Seeking Asylum Interviews", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 The vanguard of what President Trump has labeled an invasion force formed an orderly line at about 6:45 a.m. on Thursday near a major border crossing between Tijuana and the United States and waited patiently.About 80 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people who have been traveling with a large migrant caravan had come to the crossing, with stories of victimization and persecution, to make appointments for asylum interviews in the United States.But other than the line of migrants, it was mostly business as usual along this westernmost stretch of the Mexico-United States southwest border.A steady flow of pedestrians and cars traversed the official border crossings, in an apparently smooth and normal process. Contractors worked on the steel border fence that reaches across the beach and into the Pacific Ocean, unfurling concertina wire along the top of the barrier and across the sand while American military police officers looked on.The migrants in line had been the first members of the caravan, which started in Central America more than a month ago, to make it to Mexico\u2019s northern border. They arrived on Sunday, and by trying to set up their asylum interviews were now moving yet another step closer to their goal of reaching American soil.Joe Rivano Barros, a field officer for Raices, a Texas-based advocacy group that has been helping the entourage, scoffed at the notion that this group was a menace to the United States.They are poor, and harmless, he said, \u201cand they\u2019re excited to be part of the United States.\u201dMigrants from the caravan have been arriving in Tijuana since Sunday in spurts \u2014 scores here, hundreds there \u2014 entering the city mostly on donated buses.Some 800 had made it by Wednesday night and 900 or so more by Thursday, with the rest expected over the next few days.The caravan\u2019s coordinators and government officials said they expected a total of about 5,000 migrants to gather in Tijuana and nearby municipalities in the next several days, while some municipal and state authorities have offered a more conservative estimate of 3,000 to 4,000.Officials from the state of Baja California said Thursday that some 9,000 migrants were currently moving through Mexico in caravans, though not all were expected to wind up in the state.For weeks leading up to the midterm elections, Mr. Trump and his administration issued frenetic warnings about the caravan\u2019s threats to national security and the American economy.The president, calling the caravan \u201can invasion,\u201d deployed thousands of troops to reinforce border security, and border agents were reassigned to buttress staffing at major entry points.\u201cMy plan is to cross to the other side,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Amaya, 36, a Honduran migrant, adding that he had not ruled out any option, legal or illegal.But Irineo Mujica, a member of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a transnational advocacy group assisting the caravan, cautioned, \u201cWe are definitely not going to storm the wall.\u201dAlthough the caravan has not posed any apparent danger to the United States, it is already threatening a potential crisis for Tijuana and the surrounding state of Baja California.Local and state officials have been scrambling to figure out how to shelter and care for the thousands of migrants. Even before the caravan\u2019s arrival, the region was under stress because of a backlog in asylum applicants forced to wait as many as five or six weeks for an appointment to make their case at the American border.Many have holed up in migrant shelters in the meantime.With the caravan\u2019s arrival this week, the region\u2019s network of shelters is now close to or at capacity, officials said, and supplemental emergency shelters have been forced to open in churches and other places.On Wednesday night, the authorities opened a temporary shelter in a sports complex in the city, but it has capacity for fewer than 400 migrants because, officials said, there was insufficient money to cover the costs of housing more.State officials said the governor had appealed to the federal government for financial assistance to forestall a possible humanitarian crisis.But some migrants from the caravan have avoided the shelters, saying they feared being trapped behind locked doors at night and detained by the migration authorities. Instead, they have slept outdoors \u2014 in parks and on the beach.Many migrants who have already arrived have been biding their time and figuring out their next move: whether to apply for sanctuary in the United States, try to cross illegally or remain in Mexico and possibly seek legal status here.For those who intend to apply for asylum \u2014 likely a minority of the total caravan \u2014 coordinators and advocates hope to organize legal workshops to review their cases and help them to prepare for their interviews with American border officials.Last spring, advocates provided similar help to a large caravan of mostly Central American migrants that traversed Mexico and ended up in Tijuana. At its peak, that caravan numbered about 1,500, by some estimates.Of those, several hundred eventually applied for asylum, with hundreds of others either crossing illegally into the United States or remaining in Mexico.Several migrants said Thursday that they were waiting for the rest of the caravan to show up before they settled on their strategy. Groups that have been helping to coordinate the caravan have inculcated in the participants the philosophy of strength in numbers.And for many participants, the size of the caravan, which began in Honduras in mid-October, was a big draw, promising security from the perils of the migrant trail.The high profile of the caravan also attracted an outpouring of humanitarian support along the way, making the migration nearly free for its participants, who survived on donated food, water, medical care, used clothing and other services.But in some sectors of Tijuana society, patience with the caravan is already wearing thin. Late Wednesday night, a group of residents in an affluent beachside neighborhood confronted migrants who were spending the night in a park.The residents cursed the migrants, telling them they were not welcome. A contingent of police officers rushed to the scene and kept the sides apart until the confrontation subsided.Several migrants said they remained awake and vigilant for the rest of the night, worried they would be attacked while they slept.Advertisement"}

The vote count had been delayed overnight, and Mr. Lamont was not declared the winner until Wednesday morning.In his victory speech, Mr. Lamont struck a unifying tone, calling on members of both parties to work together to guide the state through financial straits.\u201cI\u2019ve got to bring people together to make sure this is a state that hangs together going forward, making decisions we need to get this state growing again,\u201d Mr. Lamont said.With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Lamont captured 48.6 percent of the vote to Mr. Stefanowski\u2019s 46.9 percent, according to The A.P.Oz Griebel, an independent candidate, took 4 percent of the vote.The tally was delayed because ballots had become wet when voters, caught in the rain, dripped water onto the voting cards, Secretary of State Denise W. Merrill said early Wednesday. Machines were having trouble reading wet ballots, she said.Mr. Lamont\u2019s campaign looked to portray Mr. Stefanowski as an acolyte of President Trump, who remains out of favor in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans five to three.The founder of a company that delivered cable television to college campuses, Mr. Lamont faces the task of fixing Connecticut\u2019s fiscal woes, highlighted by a budget deficit that is projected to surpass $4 billion over the next two years. Mr. Lamont\u2019s proposals have centered on economic development and job training, in contrast to his opponent\u2019s calls to cut state spending and reduce taxes.Mr. Lamont, who contributed millions to his own campaign, had made several attempts at winning a high-profile public office.In 2006, he angered some party Democrats when he mounted a surprising primary upset of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. Mr. Lieberman, however, ran as an independent and defeated Mr. Lamont in the general election. In 2010, Mr. Lamont fell short in a bid for the Democratic nomination for governor.Democrats swept the night in Connecticut, winning the entire congressional delegation and top statewide posts.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a 45-year-old Democrat, easily won re-election to his second term by defeating Matthew Corey, a Republican and Navy veteran.After his win, Mr. Murphy took direct aim at Mr. Trump.\u201cWe are not a nation that tolerates bullies or wannabe tyrants,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cWe are a democracy, and maybe louder and clearer than anything we can say tonight, we\u2019re saying, here in Connecticut, that if you come after our democracy, then we are coming for you.\u201dIn the House, Democrats held on to all five of the state\u2019s seats, with four incumbents winning re-election.Ms. Hayes, 45, easily defeated her opponent, Manny Santos, a Republican and former mayor of Meriden. Elizabeth Esty, the incumbent Democratic representative, did not seek re-election after a sexual harassment case involving her former chief of staff.\u201cThe thing is while it may be atypical for a member of Congress, it\u2019s not really that strange for people in our communities,\u201d Ms. Hayes said in an interview after her victory. \u201cIf we are truly representing people, we have to have a true understanding of what people are experiencing and what they\u2019re going through.\u201dDemocrats dominated statewide races: William Tong, a member of the State House of Representatives, was elected state attorney general; Kevin Lembo won a third term as the state comptroller; and Ms. Merrill was elected to a third term. Shawn Wooden, the former Hartford City Council president, prevailed in the race for treasurer.Kristin Hussey contributed reporting from Hartford.Advertisement"}

Are they right?You can look at it very roughly in the United States as, the people in power think things are going fine, and the people not in power are deeply alarmed at what appear to be threats to our basic values as Americans.I would say, though, that you know, none of the institutions that make up this country have fallen. No one has seized power in a military coup. Things seem to be happening that are very alarming but the system, so far, still stands.Republicans who are running the White House would say, and do say, that the issue people have isn\u2019t so much that democracy is failing, but that they are angry that democracy has worked out in a way that they\u2019re not happy with.But a lot of people\u2019s issues are questions of values: civility, discourse, rule of law. All those sorts of things that we care so much about seem to be severely tested by the rhetoric and behavior of the White House.Was there any pattern to the questions non-American readers sent you?The questions ranged from very basic philosophical questions to \u201cWhat the hell is going on over there?\u201d to wonderfully specific ones.People from abroad look at our system and they believe that we\u2019re in a permanent state of campaigning, which was vaguely true.There are all sorts of mechanisms that people don\u2019t understand, and there\u2019s no reason they really should. Some readers didn\u2019t even know what the word gubernatorial means. [It describes governor races.]What experience from the midterms will you remember five years from now?I went to a Trump rally, and that was a pretty vivid experience. There were maybe eight or nine thousand people in this big arena in Erie, Pennsylvania. And the press was penned into this thing in the middle, which is normal at these rallies.But what was so odd to me was that we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the pen on our own. So we weren\u2019t allowed to interview any of the people in the auditorium, and it was sort of unclear why.The whole thing was weird. People weren\u2019t in any way mean, except when they were jeering and shouting as if we were people in a cage. But afterward, everybody was super nice.Some of the nice ladies I talked to felt sorry for me because I work for a place that was so full of lies and fake news. And every time I tried to say, well, we actually work really hard, and we try really hard, they just looked sad.And some final news on the midterms: Earlier this week I looked into the trade implications for Canada of the Democrats again controlling the House of Representatives.Dan wrote this week about the great marijuana shortage that followed the great marijuana legalization rush.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The American Casualties of Trump\u2019s Trade War", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "FeatureTariffs on Chinese imports have endangered small business around the United States \u2014 a growing nightmare that critics say the president could have avoided.Supported byIn the packed hearing room, Cobb listened as dozens of witnesses detailed how tariffs on Chinese-made bicycles and tires and fruit juice \u2014 and the reciprocal taxes that would inevitably be imposed on American exports to China in response \u2014 would lead to higher prices and lost jobs in the United States. This was part of a series of public hearings to address a proposed Section 301 tariff list, named after the provision of the Trade Act of 1974 that permits the United States to impose tariffs on other nations in response to unfair trade practices \u2014 in this case, the administration claimed, the Chinese theft of intellectual property. The proposed tariffs would hit businesses from virtually every industry, including many that had little to do with intellectual property.For Cobb and the 247 employees of Real Wood\u2019s affiliated companies, the stakes were high. Their business is exporting hardwood from the forests of southern Missouri to their partners in China, who mill it into veneer, laminate it to a plywood subsurface and finish it into designer flooring. The partners then ship the engineered hardwood back to Real Wood, which sells it to high-end builders from coast to coast \u2014 an ocean-spanning supply chain that nevertheless keeps costs down. The simple possibility of tariffs had killed virtually all the company\u2019s orders for engineered hardwood from China. Real Wood was already paying an anti-dumping duty of as much as 25 percent on much of the flooring it imported from that country, a tariff that the International Trade Commission had levied on a number of Chinese flooring companies whose prices it deemed to be below market value. The Trump administration\u2019s proposal called for an additional 10 percent tariff, with the threat of a further 15 percent in 2019, which Cobb claimed would force Real Wood to make large price increases and would hamstring the whole industry.Cobb, 42, a genial, bearlike, bearded father of seven, stayed up late the night before the hearing, rehearsing his performance in the mirror of his hotel room, cutting it in half to make sure it stayed within the strict time limit. He was dressed sharp for the event, in a three-piece suit, with a pocket square and nonprescription eyeglasses to make him look smart, or so he hoped. He purchased the entire outfit in China while on one of his countless trips there.Now he got up to make his pitch for real. \u201cYou have five minutes,\u201d an official from the Office of the United States Trade Representative told Cobb.\u201cOur group of companies comprise the second-largest employer in the poorest county in Missouri,\u201d Cobb said. He talked about how high-quality engineered flooring couldn\u2019t be manufactured domestically at a competitive price. He talked about the hardship of the potential loss of good jobs in his heartland hometown. As he spoke, Cobb suspected that the hearing, despite the presence of career officials from a broad cross-section of departments and agencies, wasn\u2019t designed to give him a meaningful voice in the process. Questions from the government panel were perfunctory, typically one per witness, and it seemed to him that the decision to levy the tariffs had already been made.As the session adjourned, Cobb started to chat with one of the Chinese reporters covering the proceedings, who was astounded at the damage the tariffs might do to American companies. A senior policy adviser from the Department of Agriculture, who had sat stone-faced listening to the testimony, approached Cobb \u2014 an unprecedented breach of protocol, in Cobb\u2019s experience. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to go through all this,\u201d the official said to him quietly, according to Cobb. \u201cWe have no idea what\u2019s going on here, either.\u201dCompanies were also permitted to submit written arguments for why they should be excluded from the tariffs, and the deadline for those written submissions was in less than three weeks, at midnight on Sept. 6. Liz Levinson, a trade lawyer whom Real Wood and a group of other flooring companies had retained, made sure her tightly reasoned 11-page brief arrived on time. Thousands upon thousands of other companies from across the private sector had made similar submissions, arguing that the tariffs would gut their businesses, and that the reasoning behind the Trump administration\u2019s proposal made no sense. \u201cDuties on flooring would accomplish nothing with respect to encouraging China to reform its intellectual-property regime,\u201d Levinson wrote. \u201cFlooring is not a high-tech industry.\u201dFor a person to read and weigh all the submissions would take weeks, if not months, but the day after the deadline \u2014 as if to prove his indifference to the formality of the investigation \u2014 President Trump announced that the tariffs on $200 billion in goods could \u201ctake place very soon.\u201d He also upped the ante, saying, \u201cBehind that there is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want.\u201dThe tariffs, which took effect on Sept. 24, have been front-page news, but their impacts on the domestic economy \u2014 which traded $710 billion in goods and services with China in 2017 \u2014 have not been reckoned with yet. Tariffs are a powerful weapon in a trade war, but finding the right targets can prove challenging. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to impose tariffs on billions of dollars in imports without shooting yourself in the foot,\u201d says Wendy Cutler, a former acting deputy United States trade representative. Historically, Cutler says, the various branches of government that deal with global trade \u2014 the Departments of Commerce and of the Treasury, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative \u2014 have tried to carefully study the domestic impacts of sanctions like tariffs before they were imposed, aiming to anticipate unintended consequences, calculating ways to minimize harm to the United States while maximizing pain for the intended target.By contrast, in Trump\u2019s new tariff regime, Cobb and other business owners see a hurried and blunt approach that has been carried out, they believe, with little public debate about how it could affect the American economy and equally little sense of the long-term strategy. Was Trump playing a giant game of geopolitical poker with President Xi Jinping, or was he unilaterally declaring war?\u201cAt first, the Chinese saw Trump as a businessman and assumed he wanted a deal,\u201d says Chad P. Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank devoted to economic policy. \u201cNow they don\u2019t know what Trump wants.\u201dReal Wood\u2019s headquarters sits down a gravel road off the main highway, a collection of warehouses filled with various kinds of flooring packed onto shrink-wrapped pallets. When I visited in late October, one side of the main warehouse was piled high with finished flooring from China, veneered in different varieties of American hardwoods like white oak and walnut and hickory. On the other side were finished boards that had been manufactured in Cambodia and Indonesia. Real Wood\u2019s 55,000-square-foot facility was filled with more than $6 million in flooring, the most the company had ever had in inventory; Cobb was racing to import as much as possible from China before the additional tariff of 15 percent was imposed at the end of the year.The weeks after Trump\u2019s announcement on tariffs were unsettling for Cobb, as he tried to cope with the impact of the new tax and guess at the intentions of a president who seemed to be intent on escalation but also quite possibly bluffing. Engineered hardwood was just one type of good among more than 5,745 product lines tariffed; in this one sector, nearly 500 million square feet of engineered hardwood flooring is sold in the United States annually, and roughly a third of that is imported from China. In the wake of the tariffs, Real Wood had postponed five new hires, along with the purchase of a new van and truck. For the past three years, the company grew at a healthy rate of 15 percent. But now, with the new 10 percent tariff, the best-case scenario was for revenue to be flat next year \u2014 and even that seemed improbable.\u201cThe economy is going to slow down,\u201d Cobb told me. \u201cPeople will figure out how to get around the tariffs over time, but it\u2019s definitely going to have an impact on our business and lots of others.\u201dThe range of consequences wasn\u2019t entirely negative, or even understood yet. The day before I arrived, Cobb discovered that it might be possible to rebid on a flooring contract for a Los Angeles apartment project that he had narrowly lost; the winner, it turned out, proposed a tariffed product, while Real World hadn\u2019t. Cobb\u2019s existing Chinese suppliers were able to provide products at low prices largely because of their lower labor costs. The question was how competitive their prices would still be after the tariff. Cobb said that a project he was pricing for 325,000 square feet of flooring in an upscale Manhattan residential development perfectly illustrated the new reality. Finished Indonesian flooring cost the company $4 per square foot, while flooring from the Netherlands was $4.50 and Italian flooring $5.70. The flooring Cobb preferred to sell \u2014 and that many interior designers liked most, he said, because of its distinctive artisanal appearance and low price \u2014 was Chinese-made and cost about $3.50 per square foot before the tariff.Real Wood\u2019s main supplier was a company in Liaoning Province in northern China. Some of its other Chinese suppliers refused to share the cost of the tariff, but the Liaoning company agreed to split the 10 percent tax on one product line, as well as the pending 25 percent step-up. Cobb, though, wasn\u2019t confident the deal was sustainable. There was one factor that might help Real Wood, however. Its main supplier had already shifted some of its production to Cambodia, where labor was even cheaper \u2014 and the anti-dumping duty didn\u2019t apply. This early migration put the manufacturer in a good position to rush even more of its operations to Cambodia, Cobb told me. Doing the work in Cambodia, which had carved out an economic zone where many other Chinese companies had moved, meant that China-specific tariffs wouldn\u2019t be levied, even as all the profits would continue to accrue to Chinese companies.\u201cEveryone speaks Chinese there,\u201d he said. His supplier \u201csent their skilled managers to Cambodia. There are real job losses going on in China. Our main supplier is going to get as much as he can to Cambodia as soon as possible.\u201dThe notion that jobs being lost in China would somehow magically result in jobs being created in America was risible to Cobb. Making flooring was hard and relatively low-paying. Cobb said he couldn\u2019t find enough local workers for the company\u2019s local affiliated mill as it was, and the cost structure for the products it sold made the economics impossible. Turning lumber into veneers required the quarter-inch-thick planks to be separately tempered, a very labor-intensive process. One of the new veneers Cobb had recently perfected, in collaboration with the Liaoning company, required every plank to be hand finished to make it look as if the wood had been reclaimed from old buildings. Cobb thought it was preposterous to believe that this could be done in the United States for a competitive price. Even if it could, he went on, building a factory in the United States would be not just expensive but extremely risky, given that the tariffs on China could be removed at any time by the president or some future administration. Cobb noted that some of his competitors manufactured engineered hardwood flooring in America through the use of prison labor \u2014 an arrangement that illustrated the economic reality of the global market, where inexpensive labor makes high-end flooring affordable.\u201cIt makes me wonder if anyone is pro-trade in this country anymore,\u201d he said.Tariffs totaling $200 billion on nearly every part of the American economy presented an entirely different magnitude of complexity, and the U.S.T.R. was ill prepared to cope with the challenge. One former trade executive, who asked to remain anonymous, told me he saw it as his duty to try to avoid harming American interests as much as possible. He began advocating that the U.S.T.R. develop a method to determine, as accurately as possible, the effects of the proposed tariff package: the number of American factories that would close, the number of jobs eliminated, the value of sales lost and so on.\u201cI thought the U.S.T.R. needed a systematic approach so if a court reviewed the tariffs it would be able to see a consistent analytical framework,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was for domestic legal challenges. We could show that there wasn\u2019t favoritism or politics involved in who the tariffs were applied to. I thought we should have something like that.\u201dA formalized methodology for determining harm might also have helped the U.S.T.R. deal with the tsunami of applications for exclusion from the tariffs that arrived this fall. It became increasingly evident to some within the agency that the decision-making process was now very top down, involving the president and the cabinet with little input from career officials.As it happened, almost none of the applications were accepted. The rejection letters were perfunctory and often cited a failure to show severe economic harm, without saying how that was defined. Another frequently cited justification was that the product in question was strategic to the Made in China 2025 policy, a Chinese government initiative to make China a direct high-tech competitor of the United States by that year. The implication seemed to be that if China said it wanted to compete in an industry, that was enough to drive America\u2019s own trade policy for that industry.The implementation of the tariffs and the tariffs themselves elevated the ideology of Robert Lighthizer, who is 71 and came out of retirement to occupy the normally obscure cabinet-level position of United States trade representative. A former corporate lawyer, Lighthizer developed his views on trade during and after a long career in Washington, both inside and outside the government. A formative experience came during his tenure as deputy United States trade representative during the Reagan administration, which in the 1980s forced Japan to curb auto and steel exports to the United States.That success is often cited by tariff advocates today, but some historians question the analogy. \u201cChina is much bigger than Japan was,\u201d says Douglas Irwin, the Dartmouth economist and author of \u201cClashing Over Commerce: A History of U.S. Trade Policy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not an ally; it\u2019s a rival. We don\u2019t have the leverage with China. Japan never retaliated, but China did so immediately. The Chinese lived through the Opium Wars and the unequal treaties, which involved Western interference. The Chinese clearly resented that and will make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. China won\u2019t be pushed around on trade matters.\u201dAfter leaving the government, Lighthizer spent decades practicing law, doing advocacy work for American steel producers during their downward spiral and China\u2019s inexorable rise. In this role, Lighthizer was often taking the petitioner side of trade disputes in front of federal authorities, portraying China as a menace and a cheater, a view shared by many leading trade unions and Democrats. \u201cAn identity of interest with your clients develops,\u201d says Alan Wolff, a deputy director of the World Trade Organization, who worked alongside Lighthizer for decades. \u201cYou think in similar terms \u2014 client and country don\u2019t diverge.\u201dAlong the way, Lighthizer developed an America-first ideology long before Trump used the slogan. Testifying before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission in 2010, Lighthizer laid out at length his argument that China was America\u2019s biggest source of trade difficulties, costing millions of jobs and destroying domestic manufacturing. Since China ascended to membership in the World Trade Organization in 2001, he said, it had failed to turn into a market economy in the mold of Western nations, as many hoped. To the contrary, Lighthizer claimed that China\u2019s form of state capitalism did not respect intellectual-property rights or the rule of law.Now in the White House, Lighthizer has a firm ally in the presidential adviser Peter Navarro, director of Trump\u2019s Office of Trade and Industrial Policy. An economist who has run unsuccessfully for a variety of political positions in California, Navarro is a rabid antagonist to everything Chinese; in his 2011 book, \u201cDeath by China,\u201d he calls the U.S.-China relationship \u201cparasitic\u201d and refers to China as \u201cthe dragon.\u201d Lighthizer, who rarely appears in the press, declined to comment for this article, as did Navarro, but Navarro is routinely on cable television making vociferous arguments against trade with China. In his book, he described companies doing business with the \u201cmurderous gangster regime\u201d of China as \u201ccorporate turncoat lemmings.\u201d\u201cAt some point,\u201d Lighthizer noted in his 2010 testimony, \u201cone must ask whether potential retaliation from China really would or could even remotely offset the benefits to the United States of more aggressive trade measures.\u201d He also said, \u201cWe need strong leaders who are prepared to make tough decisions, and who will not be satisfied until this crisis has been resolved.\u201dThe real process of deciding what Chinese-made goods would receive tariffs took place behind closed doors. When the tariffs were proposed earlier this year, a long list of target products started circulating within the upper reaches of the government, according to a former senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A list was created by the U.S.T.R. identifying products that America bought from China that could also be bought from other countries, so domestic supply wouldn\u2019t be hurt by tariffs; the list also included products that only China manufactured and that therefore should be exempted to avoid needlessly damaging the American economy. Certain industries were also recommended for exclusion. One of these was housing, and so flooring, nails, trim and all manner of building-related products were dropped from the preliminary list.But trade hawks in the administration challenged the recommendations, the former senior official said, pushing the president to make the tariffs as broad as possible and reminding him that he had made a campaign pledge to take action against China. On one side of the argument stood anti-China figures like Navarro and Lighthizer, who advocated tariffs; on the other, the people Trump and his inner circle called \u201cglobalists,\u201d including Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and the former National Economic Counsel director Gary Cohn, who chiefly advocated protecting intellectual property and gaining access to Chinese markets for American companies and resisted widespread and untargeted tariffs. Ultimately, the former senior official recalled, the president decided that he was going to put tariffs on \u201call of it,\u201d and the decision was final. (The White House declined to comment on the decision-making process.)\u201cThere was no sense of reality,\u201d the official said. It would take years to build factories in America, and who would want to spend that kind of capital with uncertainty about Trump\u2019s re-election, or the real possibility of Trump\u2019s changing his mind and tariffs being lifted? There was no evidence any of that would happen. \u201cAll the president needs is one or two people to tell him he\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cPeople are making these decisions that don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a clue.\u201dScheurich, a Trump supporter, said he couldn\u2019t believe the president intended to hurt his business, but the process for getting an exclusion nonetheless seemed overwhelming. He would have to fill in 84 different forms, one for each product he imported, with various law firms offering to assist at a price of $3,500 to $5,000 per form, which he couldn\u2019t afford. After completing the forms himself, he received only a handful of exemptions.\u201cMaybe the ends justify the means,\u201d Scheurich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If only I could get in front of the president, I could change his mind. Businessman to businessman. I would hope that a light would come on.\u201d He paused. \u201cGood lord,\u201d he sighed.The co-founder of Real Wood Floors, Sam Cobb\u2019s father-in-law, Clyde Elbrecht, chuckled when I told him about the idea of appealing to Trump as a businessman. A lifelong Republican, Elbrecht didn\u2019t think Trump was much of a businessman. Elbrecht, 73, had recently invested $3.5 million in a mill called Missouri Hardwood, he said, saving roughly 100 jobs in tiny Birch Tree, population 656, only to lose 25 percent of its business with customers in China because of the trade war. Likewise, a lumber yard that he had started developing in Arkansas, employing a dozen people, with many more to be hired as it expanded, had come to what he called a screeching stop.\u201cI was shipping a container of timber a day to China,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s around $20,000 per day, or $5.5 million annually, and I\u2019ve stopped shipping entirely.\u201dAs painful as the tariffs in the United States appeared to be as they took hold, they seemed to be having their intended effect in China. Elbrecht had just returned from a trip to visit his main manufacturer in Liaoning, and he said that the owner was very frightened by what was happening to his business. He described the owner as \u201calmost Western\u201d in his thinking, a phrase he meant as praise for the man\u2019s keen business sense and integrity; the affection and empathy for his partner were palpable.\u201cHe\u2019s moving to Cambodia as quickly as he can,\u201d Elbrecht said. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t made the decision to move some of the production there years ago, we\u2019d be in big trouble. Our other Chinese suppliers who haven\u2019t already set up in Cambodia or somewhere else will get hurt the worst. They don\u2019t have an escape plan.\u201dElbrecht said that only a fraction of the value per square foot went to China, while Real Wood had to pay the tariff on the entire price of the flooring. But he wasn\u2019t sure anyone in Washington wanted to hear about his struggles. West Plains\u2019s member of Congress, Representative Jason Smith, toured the mill in March, and at the end of the visit, Elbrecht tried to explain the permanent and real damage tariffs could do to his companies and the fragile economy of the Ozarks. \u201cWith tariffs you won\u2019t have a business model,\u201d Elbrecht said. He explained to the young Republican congressman that China was the biggest market for red oak, and that was the predominant species in the forests in those parts. But the congressman seemed indifferent. (Smith, who serves on the House committee that oversees trade and tariffs, declined to comment for this article; he was re-elected in the midterms with 73 percent of the vote.)\u201cIt was like he didn\u2019t care, he didn\u2019t understand it and he didn\u2019t care to understand it,\u201d Elbrecht said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so disappointed in my representative my whole life. I expect him to care about the people in his district. This impacts their lives. He should try to understand the facts.\u201d\u201cI love China,\u201d Scott Gill, Real Wood\u2019s vice president of sales, told me. \u201cThe people. The food. I was amazed by the beauty of the country.\u201d He was a reluctant Trump voter and himself the father of a recently adopted Chinese boy, now 15. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we both win from trade?\u201d he went on. \u201cWhy does it have to be zero sum?\u201dA member of Real Wood\u2019s finance team walked into the room. \u201cWe got our first invoice for the tariff,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve been Trumped,\u201d someone joked.The summary for the Harmonized Tariff Schedule provided a multidigit code for engineered wood flooring. The purchase price to Real Wood on the invoice was $65,842, and in a column across the page was a line item for the additional tax the company had to pay: $6,584.20. The sum seemed small, perhaps, but Cobb says he expects to pay more than $200,000 in tariffs before the year is out.The president could remove the tariffs at any moment, but identifying the winners this early in the age of the Trump tariffs is difficult, if not impossible. Economists tend to agree that all sides are likely to lose, at least in the short term. Employees of a nail manufacturer in Poplar Bluff, Mo., recently told a local television station that they were counting on presidential intercession to save their jobs. In South Carolina, a television maker named Element Electronics announced that it was closing down and laying off 126 workers as a result of the tariffs, only to gain salvation when Gov. Henry McMaster and other state political figures personally interceded to get the company an exclusion, the kind of random political intervention that trade policy is meant to prevent.In recent days, Cobb and his sales force traveled to Phoenix, Ariz., for a series of meetings with builders, hoping to win contracts to supply hardwood floors to small and midsize single-home companies across the country. The sessions went well, with Real Wood presenting its nontariffed products from Cambodia and Indonesia, not even bothering to show the favored China-made flooring styles. One builder mentioned that for his next project he might swap out hardwood flooring from China for vinyl, to save on costs.\u201cDo you know your vinyl flooring is on the tariff list?\u201d Cobb asked. \u201cIt\u2019s also tariffed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors,\u201d the builder said. \u201cWhat else is on the list?\u201d\u201cNails, molding, cabinetry, all types of flooring,\u201d Cobb said, citing only a few of the thousands of items subject to tariffs \u2014 no exclusions allowed \u2014 that will hit the entire American economy.\u201cIs that really going to happen?\u201d the builder stammered.\u201cIt already has,\u201d Cobb replied.Advertisement"}

And while investors were relieved that the results conformed with Wall Street expectations, longstanding financial concerns were made even more visible while introducing a series of other political problems.\u201cThe midterm results only highlight the ongoing political divisions within the country and the parties,\u201d John Raines, head of political risk at the business information service IHS Markit, and Lindsay Newman, a principal analyst there, wrote on Wednesday.Sooner rather than later, the focus of financial markets is likely to shift to new sets of political and economic concerns.On the political side, these include:\u25a0 The likelihood of investigations of the Trump administration in the House of Representatives and perhaps, down the road, impeachment proceedings.\u25a0 The prospect of congressional gridlock and vituperation.\u25a0 Rising partisan conflict as politicians prepare for 2020.At the same time, the markets will refocus on the bread-and-butter concerns that have weighed on stock and bond returns for much of the year.Among these worries are the possibilities that:\u25a0 The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases will slow the economy, puncturing the prices of risky assets like stocks, which have already begun to lose altitude.\u25a0 After a long recovery, the economy will fall into a recession in the next two years, pushing stocks into a deep bear market.This may seem like an excessively glum list, right after elections that sent the stock market into a bout of euphoria. If the markets abhor uncertainty, then these midterm elections were wonderfully reassuring.\u201cThe consensus was right,\u201d John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial, wrote on Wednesday. Wall Street generally viewed the election\u2019s broad outcome as highly probable and fairly desirable, though not the outcome thought most likely to produce the highest future stock returns.That would have been a Republican sweep with a large majority in the Senate as well as the House, leading to a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and cuts in programs like Social Security and Medicare.The UBS Global Wealth Management Chief Investment Office gamed out the various possibilities ahead of the election, concluding that such a sweep \u201cshould boost global stock markets, limit increases in long-term bond yields, and support the U.S. dollar.\u201dBut the data bears this out only when a Democrat has been president and Republicans have held either the House or the Senate. Since 1901, in all such cases, the Dow Jones industrial average has outperformed its long-term average, an analysis by Bespoke Investment Group shows. When a Republican has been president during a stretch of gridlock, the market has lagged.In the five previous congressional sessions since 1901 in which Republicans controlled the White House and the Senate while Democrats controlled the House \u2014 the political alignment in Washington starting in January \u2014 the annualized return has been a loss of 1.69 percent. That\u2019s not encouraging, though the data is too scanty to use \u201cas a blueprint for what to expect this time around,\u201d Bespoke said.But President Trump could demand that a deal on the Dreamers be paired with funding for his coveted border wall, an objective that many Democrats abhor.The stock market fell sharply during the truncated Nixon impeachment process, but that is likely because of the recession that began in November 1973. That downturn continued until March 1975, impairing the political prospects of President Gerald Ford, Nixon\u2019s successor.That is a reminder that while the stock market can withstand political stress, it is one of the many victims of recessions, which throw people out of work, destroy wealth and alter political destinies. A recession would be the market\u2019s biggest worry. It might become Mr. Trump\u2019s, as well.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "There\u2019s No Going Back. The G.O.P. Is Trump\u2019s Party. ", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president has reclaimed the formula that made the landslide victories of the Nixon and Reagan years possible. Mr. McCarthy is editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Quarterly.Donald Trump\u2019s conservative critics have one last hope: defeat. If Republicans suffer humiliating defeats in the midterm elections, they suggest, President Trump will get the blame. Influential donors and grass-roots Republicans will turn on him, and the party will get back to normal. Not so long ago this was the party of Paul Ryan and free trade. This was the party of George W. Bush and compassionate conservatism. This was a party whose self-performed autopsy after the 2012 election called for more minority outreach. After Mr. Trump, why can\u2019t the Republicans be that party again?The ranks of anti-Trump Republicans grow thinner by the day. They\u2019re retiring from Congress. They\u2019re writing memoirs blasting their former friends. But they hold out hope for the future. If the Republican Party could undergo such a profound change in personality and policy thanks to just one man in a mere three years, who\u2019s to say it can\u2019t change back? The Trump coalition seems so impermanent, after all, a motley mix of Southern evangelicals, businessmen who think like the Chamber of Commerce and disaffected white voters from the Rust Belt. Throw in foreign-policy hawks and anti-interventionist America Firsters, and Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican Party looks like an impossible contradiction. It can\u2019t last. Can it?Yes, it can. In fact, the party that President Trump has remade in his image is arguably less divided and in a better position to keep winning the White House than it has been at any time since the 1980s. What Mr. Trump has done is to rediscover the formula that made the landslide Republican Electoral College victories of the Nixon and Reagan years possible. Mr. Trump\u2019s signature themes of economic nationalism and immigration restriction are only 21st-century updates to the issues that brought the Republican Party triumph in all but one of the six presidential elections between 1968 and 1988.Some of the parallels are obvious. President Trump talks about crime and left-wing agitation in much the same way that Richard Nixon once did \u2014 and Ronald Reagan, too, especially during his time as governor of California. Mr. Trump\u2019s combination of force with an aversion to large-scale military interventions and nation-building also bears a resemblance to the policies of Republican presidents past. Dwight Eisenhower and Mr. Reagan also preferred to build up military strength without engaging in the kinds of prolonged wars for which Lyndon Johnson and George W. Bush are remembered. And while Mr. Nixon was mired in Vietnam, he ran as a candidate eager to find an exit.But the most important ways in which Mr. Trump recapitulates the winning themes of earlier Republicans are less direct. Throughout the Cold War, Republicans presented themselves as the party of greater nationalism in the struggle against a global threat. If the United States was to survive in a world that seemed increasingly subjugated by international Communism, the country would have to embrace the party that was most anti-Communist.The Soviet Union is long gone, but our national distinctiveness \u2014 the American way of life \u2014 is perceived to be under threat by new global forces, this time in the form of competition from China and international economic and regulatory bodies that compromise national sovereignty. Many voters see immigration as part of this story. They want America to control its borders by political choice, not to admit more immigrants because a global labor market insists that more must come for the good of all.Even in the area where Mr. Trump seems most different from Republicans past, on trade, he has really returned to an older style of politics. Mr. Reagan was an economic nationalist, too, not just because he protected a company like Harley-Davidson against competition from Japan but more important because his pro-growth policies of deregulation and tax cuts were themselves the appropriate forms of economic nationalism for the 1980s. In the decades before the rise of China as an industrial superpower, economic nationalism was chiefly a matter of keeping the American economy entrepreneurial \u2014 defending it against red tape and business-unfriendly policies at home rather than the predatory economic strategies of foreign governments.By the early 1990s, the Reagan economic strategy \u2014 a mix of entrepreneurship, tough bargaining and limited protection \u2014 had succeeded against stiff competition from Japan. That victory was squandered, however, by Republicans and Democrats starting later in that decade who pursued economic policy not in terms of national industry but as an exercise in global ideological consumerism.The business side of President Trump\u2019s coalition still puts its bottom line ahead of its theoretical commitments: Mr. Trump has produced a very good environment for business, no matter what the business executives think about his tariffs. They want to win elections so that they can continue to prosper, and if that means electing more protectionists after Mr. Trump, that is a price they are readily willing to pay.Grass-roots evangelical Christians and Rust Belt workers, meanwhile, both find something to like in an America that reaffirms its economic exceptionalism and sovereignty. That, no less than Mr. Trump\u2019s loyalty to Christian conservatives on abortion and other issues, is why evangelical voters have not abandoned him. And it\u2019s why Mr. Trump won states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that had eluded other Republican presidential nominees since 1988.Few Republicans running this year seem to understand what gave Mr. Trump his edge in 2016 \u2014 it was not that he was simply combative and rhetorically right-wing. It was that he had a vision of what it meant to make American great again, by making the Republicans a party for the nation again.Advertisement"}

Italy\u2019s populist government, which faced a deadline Tuesday to resubmit a national budget earlier rejected by the European Commission, made only minor concessions. The commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, is expected to respond next week.As Europe faces a confluence of economic and political turbulence, Germany and its powerful auto and machinery exporters have provided crucial stability.Without Germany as a locomotive, Europe would have much more trouble withstanding shocks that, in addition to Italy, include Britain\u2019s messy separation from the European Union and trade tensions with the United States.Economists expressed hope that Germany could bounce back quickly from the surprise decline in output, which was caused in part by temporary production backlogs at automakers. All of the major carmakers have struggled to adjust to new, more rigorous European emissions testing procedures.Germany\u2019s Federal Statistical Office blamed the setback on reduced exports. China is an important customer for Mercedes-Benzes, Volkswagens and BMWs as well as German-made factory machinery. But China has been buying fewer German goods because its economy has suffered from tariffs imposed by the United States.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is the start of a trend,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Bank in Germany. \u201cBut assuming it is, it clearly means bad news for the rest of the eurozone.\u201dItaly\u2019s continued confrontation with the European Commission could have economic consequences for the eurozone if not the entire world. The country is seen as a threat to financial stability because of its enormous government debt, which equals more than 130 percent of gross domestic product.The Italian government, a coalition between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right wing Lega, is trying to finance welfare programs as a solution to economic stagnation. But its spending would produce a deficit considered dangerously high for a country with so much debt.The spending is limited to what \u201cis strictly necessary to counteract the slowing of the economic cycle,\u201d Mr. Tria wrote. And he said some of the outlays were justified by emergencies, including flood damage and investment in roads and other infrastructure after a deadly bridge collapse in Genoa.The European Commission will issue an opinion by next Wednesday, a spokesman said. What happens after that is uncertain.Officials in Brussels will try to walk a fine line, enforcing European Union rules while avoiding a war of words with Rome that would play into the hands of populists. The commission could penalize Italy by imposing fines or withholding European Union funds for economic development. But the commission rarely moves quickly.The big risk is that investors will lose confidence in Italy and no longer buy government bonds at interest rates the government can afford, a development that would ripple through the economy. The risk premium on Italian bonds spiked early Wednesday, though it later retreated.The International Monetary Fund said the stimulus would be futile unless paired with measures to improve the functioning of the economy such as dismantling rules that make it costly for businesses to fire workers.\u201cItaly could be forced into a large fiscal consolidation when the economy is weakening,\u201d I.M.F. economists wrote. \u201cThis could transform a slowdown into a recession.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels, and Jason Horowitz and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Nation in Turmoil Prepares to Deliver a Verdict on Trump", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS LUNAS, N.M. \u2014 The tumultuous 2018 midterm campaign, shaped by conflicts over race and identity and punctuated by tragedy, barreled through its final weekend as voters prepared to deliver a verdict on the first half of President Trump\u2019s term, with Republicans bracing for losses in the House and state capitals but hopeful they would prevail in Senate races in areas where Mr. Trump is popular.The president was set to storm across two states Saturday, two Sunday and three Monday in an effort to pick off Senate seats in Indiana, Florida and a handful of other battlegrounds where Republicans hope to add to their one-seat majority in the chamber. Democrats and liberal activists, galvanized by opposition to Mr. Trump, gathered Saturday to knock on doors and make turnout calls from Pennsylvania to Illinois to Washington to try to erase the G.O.P.\u2019s 23-seat House majority.Republicans have grown increasingly pessimistic in recent days about holding the House, as polls show a number of incumbents lagging well below 50 percent and some facing unexpectedly close races in conservative-leaning districts.Democrats are also in contention to retain or capture governorships in rust belt states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that were pivotal to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and fertile ground for Republicans for much of the last decade.Despite these worrisome signs, some Republican leaders saw reason for measured optimism. While Mr. Trump said Friday that Republicans losing the House \u201ccould happen,\u201d Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who leads the G.O.P. House campaign committee, has continued to predict that his party will narrowly hold its majority. Republican strategists have argued that about two dozen races are within the margin of error in polling; should right-of-center voters swing back to them on Election Day, they say, Democrats could fall short of winning enough seats to take control of the House.Republican officials were more confident about their prospects in the Senate, where they had an opportunity to enlarge their majority in an otherwise difficult year. Nearly all of the most important Senate races are being fought on solidly conservative terrain, including North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, where Democratic incumbents are in close contests for re-election. Mr. Trump won all three states by landslide margins in 2016.There was an unmistakable dissonance between the relative health of the economy and the dark mood of a country as voters prepared to go to the polls just days after a wave of attempted mail bombings and a massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue that left 11 dead.The mood that has imperiled lawmakers like Mr. Curbelo has buoyed Democrats across the country. A class of first-time candidates has been lifted by an enormous surge of activism and political energy on the left, as a loose array of constituencies offended by Mr. Trump \u2014 including women, young people and voters of color \u2014 has mobilized with a force unseen in recent midterm elections.Early voting across the country reflected the intensity of the election: More than 28 million people had already cast ballots by the end of Friday, about 10 million more than at a comparable point in the 2014 midterm elections, according to the Democratic data firm Catalist.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.If Mr. Trump has animated a powerful national campaign against him, Democratic candidates have largely avoided engaging the president personally in the closing days of the election, instead hewing close to a few favored issues like health care.At a Saturday morning rally, Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, the head of the Democrats\u2019 campaign committee in the House, drummed home the party\u2019s ethos of ignoring Mr. Trump while riding the backlash against him.\u201cWe don\u2019t really have to even talk about this president \u2014 he\u2019s going to do all the talking about himself, for himself,\u201d Mr. Luj\u00e1n said, addressing volunteers in Los Lunas, where Democrats are making a push to pick up an open House seat. \u201cI want you to concentrate on families here in New Mexico.\u201dBut Senator Martin Henrich, appearing beside Mr. Luj\u00e1n and Xochitl Torres Small, a water-use lawyer who is the Democratic nominee for Congress, cast the election in dire terms familiar to anxious Democrats across the country. \u201cThis is a battle for who we are as a nation,\u201d said Mr. Heinrich, who is expected to win re-election easily on Tuesday.But many Senate Democrats have also decisively outraised their contenders, a sobering reminder to Republican officials about the rise of small-dollar and billionaire contributors on the left.\u201cIf alarm bells aren\u2019t ringing across the Republican landscape as a result of the dollars Democrats have raised and the mechanism they raised them with, then we don\u2019t deserve the majority,\u201d said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, who oversees the Senate Republican campaign arm.Mr. Gardner warned that the Democrats\u2019 newfound fund-raising prowess could buffet his party even more in 2020, when a less-inviting list of seats is up for election \u2014 including his own.\u201cWe may be able to survive with this map in 2018, but we cannot survive that map in 2020,\u201d he said.It is the House, though, where Republicans face greater peril.Most critical to determining control of the chamber are likely to be prosperous, culturally dynamic suburbs \u2014 around cities like New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles \u2014 where Republicans are defending several dozen districts packed with voters in open revolt against Mr. Trump. Democrats have won over many swing voters in these areas with a message focused on Republican health care and tax policies that are even less popular than the president himself.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can find a race in the country where health care hasn\u2019t been a dominant issue,\u201d the Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said.The fate of Republican lawmakers in the East Coast suburbs could offer an early harbinger on election night of whether the party can maintain even a tenuous grip on the House. Many of those communities could also tip powerful governorships into Democratic hands for the first time in a decade.Former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, the last Democrat to lead that state, said the election had effectively become a referendum on Mr. Trump, leaving Democrats \u201cconfident about the House and a little concerned about the Senate.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s on the ballot, regardless of whether his name is there or not,\u201d Mr. Strickland said of the president. Mr. Trump added that the shift in the political climate between 2016 and 2018 was like \u201cthe difference between heaven and hell.\u201dMr. Trump has appeared to turn his attention in the last few days away from the effort to keep control of the House, and toward shoring up Republicans in coveted Senate races. He has focused predominantly on electrifying the right rather than soothing some of the swing voters who backed him over Hillary Clinton two years ago.Mr. Trump\u2019s approach may resonate in several of the states with the closest Senate races, though it has the potential to backfire in several diverse states where Republican-held seats are at risk, including Nevada, Arizona and Texas.\u201cIt turns off independent voters,\u201d said Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat and head of the Democratic Senate campaign arm, arguing that such states offered his party \u201ca narrow path\u201d to a majority.Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster, said the Democratic message, focused on health care, was \u201cmore relevant\u201d to most voters than what Mr. Trump was offering them in his final argument. Likening the election to a tug of war, Ms. Matthews said the president was trying to energize his predominantly white and male base even as moderate women recoil from him.\u201cOn one end, you\u2019ve got white college-educated women pulling hard, pulling back from what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Ms. Matthews said. \u201cOn the other side of the rope, you\u2019ve got non-college-educated men pulling hard in the other direction.\u201dEven before his lunge toward culture-war rhetoric, Mr. Trump and his party appeared to be receiving scant political advantage from the state of the economy, which has grown steadily during his presidency and pushed the unemployment rate below 4 percent. A dip in the stock market over the final weeks of the campaign appeared to frustrate Mr. Trump, who suggested on Twitter \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that it reflected investors\u2019 concerns about a Democratic takeover.If many of the most closely watched elections are at the federal level, governors\u2019 races around the country may be the most consequential elections, long term, for both parties. Democrats are hoping to elect a history-making set of candidates, including Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida, who would be the first African-Americans to lead their states. And Republicans are struggling to defend their dominance across Midwestern state governments, from Michigan and Ohio to Wisconsin and Iowa.Should Democrats capture several of those governorships, it could help them redraw congressional district lines to their advantage after 2020. And Republican losses at the state level could complicate Mr. Trump\u2019s path to re-election, strengthening the opposition party in crucial battlegrounds where he failed to consolidate support after the 2016 election.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.But it was the bifurcated maps this year between House and Senate that made 2018 so unusual, with Republicans from different regions sounding as if they hailed from two opposing parties when discussing Mr. Trump.\u201cIf we pick up seats, he\u2019s going to be the only reason why,\u201d Mr. Gardner said, crediting Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive campaigning in red-state Senate races.Yet Mr. Curbelo, who like many of the most endangered House Republicans represents a metropolitan area, portrayed the president as a mildly irritating but distant bystander.\u201cRepublicans are running their own races in each of their districts while the president is talking about topics important to him,\u201d he said with a wry chuckle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One African Nation Put the Brakes on Chinese Debt. But Not for Long.", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 The new international airport in Sierra Leone was supposed to be a shiny welcome center for travelers \u2014 a symbol showing that after a devastating civil war and an Ebola epidemic, the nation was finally open for business.But last month, the government decided that the multimillion-dollar price tag was too high, so it canceled the financing that made construction possible: a more than $300 million loan from China that Sierra Leone might have struggled to repay.President Julius Maada Bio was soon hailed by analysts for putting the brakes on a project that could have deeply indebted his nation, already one of the poorest in the world.It seemed that Sierra Leone was heeding the hard-earned lessons of other developed nations that have found themselves owing enormous amounts to China.\u201cWe are a developing nation,\u201d Mr. Bio told the interviewer, \u201cand we look forward to nations that want to help us develop.\u201dAcross sub-Saharan Africa, governments like Sierra Leone\u2019s are opting to overlook glaring examples of developing countries teetering toward economic distress after borrowing heavily from China.Forty percent of countries in the region are close to falling into debt crisis, the International Monetary Fund has cautioned. And many of those are still seeking loans from Beijing for help to finance airports, highways, railways, dams and power projects.But Chinese-backed ventures have also hit snags in Africa.The added fact that China has flooded African markets with low-cost manufactured goods means that many African factories have been driven out of business, making it harder for African countries to raise the hard currency \u2014 mostly dollars \u2014 that they need to repay loans from Beijing.China has extended lines of credit to nations rich in natural resources like oil, bauxite, iron and other metals. So even if a resource-rich developing country has trouble repaying its loans for a while, the thinking goes, it can pay with natural resources sooner or later. China also gains politically by extracting promises of support for the Beijing government over Taiwan as a condition of eligibility for a loan.At the China-Africa Forum for Cooperation summit in Beijing this month, China announced that it had set up a $60 billion fund for African infrastructure projects to strengthen ties with the continent.Numerous analysts and experts, including the former secretary of state Rex W. Tillerson and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the monetary fund, have warned nations to be cautious about taking on too much Chinese debt.Angola, the Republic of Congo and Zambia were some of the nations that Moody\u2019s listed this month among the most indebted to Chinese creditors. A report from the financial research company said interest payments in Ghana, Angola, Zambia and Nigeria already absorbed more than 20 percent of government revenue.This month, while speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, Vice President Mike Pence accused China of using \u201cdebt diplomacy\u201d to expand its global influence. But Chinese officials have repeatedly disputed any notion that its loans are creating so-called debt traps for African nations.\u201cOn the contrary, cooperating with China helps these countries raise independent development capabilities and levels, and improves the lives of the local people,\u201d said Hua Chunying, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, in a statement responding to Mr. Pence.China has promised to forgive some of its loans to some of Africa\u2019s poorest nations. But it was unclear which countries would benefit, and the promise applied to only interest-free loans.China is strengthening ties in new areas on the continent, specifically in West Africa where it is adding more African countries to the list of nations in its Belt and Road initiative, which envisions major infrastructure projects backed by the Chinese government around the world.One of the new Belt and Road countries is Senegal, which was part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s four-country visit to the continent this summer. During a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Senegal\u2019s growing capital city, Mr. Xi handed keys to a new wrestling stadium built by the Chinese to President Macky Sall.Across the country, billboards line the roads touting Mr. Sall\u2019s \u201cEmerging Senegal\u201d plan to transform the economy with a new city, a new commuter rail link and other projects. Chinese loans are paying for a highway to the city of Touba and part of an industrial park.The agreements benefit both governments. Mr. Sall is facing re-election next year and eager for his vision to be completed. And Senegal, along Africa\u2019s westernmost coast, is of particular geographical importance to China as a base for manufacturing and exports.The same is true on the opposite side of the continent, in Mozambique, where Chinese loans are paying for bridges and numerous other projects. It\u2019s part of a plan to double down on places that have strategic importance, said Anna Rosenberg, sub-Saharan Africa director at Frontier Strategy Group, an emerging markets advisory firm.\u201cFor Africa this is not a bad thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need the infrastructure. They can\u2019t wait for aid to come from the West. They need it fast, and the Chinese government has realized that.\u201dFor nations like Sierra Leone that are eager to put years of political instability behind them, the lure of Chinese deals can be irresistible. With more than half of the population living under the poverty line and an economy struggling to get back to the levels reached before the Ebola outbreak, it has few other options.During his election campaign, Mr. Bio decried the new airport project, calling it a \u201csham that is clouded with secrecy\u201d and unnecessary for a nation that had no more than 40,000 travelers passing through each year. The monetary fund had also warned against the deal. Canceling the loan was one of the first major moves Mr. Bio made after taking office this year.But on Chinese television, Mr. Bio backpedaled, explaining that he was negative about only the terms of the airport deal, and that the cancellation wasn\u2019t intended as a sweeping indictment of dealing with China. He went on to praise a Chinese health center and other aid the nation has given to Sierra Leone.Sierra Leone is home to one of the largest iron ore deposits in the world and its economy is dominated by a China-backed mining project that exports ore for use in Chinese steel mills. Government officials declined to comment on plans for more loans from China.Analysts caution that African governments need to get better at negotiating loans with China, taking care to haggle over interest rates and adding clauses requiring full-time employment for local citizens.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in \u2026 Spain", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational real estateThe coastal province of Valencia is cheaper and more manageable than Spain\u2019s major metropolises, making it an appealing alternative for many home buyers. 11 PhotosWith limestone walls, ceramic tile floors and wood trim, the home is distinctly Mediterranean, but with stylistic influences from the prewar modernist movement and from older cave houses common to the region, said Ana Agramunt, an agent with Lucas Fox International Properties, which has the listing. Behind a large wooden gate, a stone pathway leads to the front door (and continues around the side of the house to the tennis court). The door, framed by an arch filled in with metal scrollwork, opens into a vaulted foyer lined with tall windows. The main living room beyond has a wood-burning fireplace suspended from the ceiling and a dining area at one end with a curved wall of glass doors that open out to a covered terrace.The formal dining room has arched doorways and a traditional Catalan ceiling, with plain bricks forming a slightly arced vault. Glass doors open into a room lined with windows and built-in shelving, which has been used variously as a library and an office, Ms. Agramunt said.A geometric ceramic mural by the Spanish ceramist and sculptor Enric Mestre adorns the corridor connecting the dining room and the kitchen. The kitchen, designed for service rather than gathering, has a stainless-steel prep area, a large wine refrigerator, an induction cooktop and integrated appliances that match the sleek cabinetry, Ms. Agramunt said.A staff bedroom and guest bath are also on the ground floor, along with a second sitting room with wood paneling and an accordion door that can be pulled across to close off the space.The second floor has three en suite bedrooms, as well as a smaller guest suite with a terrace overlooking the garden. Each of the main suites has a private balcony overlooking the swimming pool, giving the house a staggered facade. A winding staircase climbs through the center of the house to a third-floor garret. Spain\u2019s residential market has been on a gradual rebound since around 2012, when luxury properties began to recover following the global recession, said Kate Everett-Allen, head of international residential research for the real estate agency Knight Frank. During the financial crisis that began in 2008, home prices fell 30 to 35 percent across the country, she said, noting that they have since risen by about 8 percent overall, although prices in Madrid and Barcelona have recovered more rapidly.In Valencia, third-quarter sale prices averaged about 1,900 euros a square meter (or about $200 a square foot) this year, according to data from Lucas Fox.Foreign buyers are also interested in seaside properties, Mr. Cantos said, although they often prefer the beach areas just outside city limits, where more property is available and there is more new construction. While prices vary depending on location, a two-bedroom apartment in these areas generally goes for 250,000 to 500,000 euros ($280,000 to $565,000), he said. For foreign buyers, the appeal of Valencia \u2014 Spain\u2019s third largest city, with a population of roughly 790,000 \u2014 lies in its affordability and manageable size relative to Madrid and Barcelona, as well as the access to a historic city center and Mediterranean beaches, said Conor Wilde, the owner of Found Valencia, an agency that specializes in working with international clients.\u201cYou can get from one side of the city to the other in 15 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for people who don\u2019t want the typical holiday resort, this has more of a cultural and elegant feel.\u201dThe country\u2019s Golden Visa program grants non-Europeans \u201cthe fast-track right to residency\u201d if they invest at least 500,000 euros ($565,000) in real estate, Mr. Wilde said.There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Spain. But buyers from outside the country are strongly advised to work closely with a real estate agent and a lawyer who will perform the necessary due diligence, Mr. Wilde said.Taxes and fees, including legal fees and the 10 percent transfer tax, typically amount to around 15 percent of the sale price. The real estate agent\u2019s commission in Valencia is usually 4 to 5 percent, and is split between buyer and seller, Mr. Wilde said.Mortgages are available to foreigners, although typically not for more than 70 percent of the sale price, and less than that for investment properties, Mr. Cantos said.Spanish; euro (1 euro = $1.13)The annual taxes on this property are around 4,000 euros (or $4,500), Ms. Agramunt said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What an Italian Donkey\u2019s Fate Tells Us About the Future of Europe", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA fable about Italy, bond yields and politics in the European Union.Dr. Rubinelli is a research fellow in the history of political thought at Robinson College, University of Cambridge. When asked about the little donkey\u2019s peculiar name, he answered that it would help us all to laugh a little about Italy\u2019s troubled economy and years of instability. \u201cLo spread\u201d had become shorthand for everything that was wrong. The yield on a bond reflects how much interest a borrower \u2014 in this case, the government \u2014 has to pay to borrow money. Germany, with its booming economy, is considered an excellent credit risk. So its bond yields are very low. Italy, by comparison, is seen as an overspender, so its yields are much higher.The difference is, in effect, encapsulated by that one number, \u201clo spread,\u201d an object of respect and fear that tells us a lot about the messy state of European politics.\u201cLo spread\u201d soon took center stage not only in politics but also in everyday life. I saw it in graffiti condemning the European Central Bank. On a trip to the Dolomites, I heard it in casual conversations at the bar. \u201cLo spread\u201d even made it to pop music, including a song called \u201cIl ballo dello spread,\u201d or \u201cThe Dance of the Spread.\u201d The chorus says it all: \u201cWhile lo spread goes up, up, up, Italian citizens go down, down, down.\u201d You\u2019re supposed to dance to it by mimicking the oscillations of the spread.These various attempts to desacralize \u201clo spread,\u201d to make fun of it and demystify it, served partly to make sense of its sudden and inescapable presence on the scene of Italian politics and partly to blame Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s government for getting us there in the first place.The spread reigned sovereign. It was constantly scrutinized and regularly on the front page of Italian newspapers. The government approved or rejected policies depending on its movements. Lo spread seemed to have the final word on Italy\u2019s future.In 2013, when Italy\u2019s economic situation began to stabilize, the phantom of the spread retreated.It reappeared in March, when a new coalition government came to power \u2014 one elected on an anti-austerity, euroskeptic agenda. The gap between Italian and German bond yields again started to grow, and with it, the spread made its reappearance in the headlines.In other words, Italy\u2019s leaders have discovered what so many Italians realized long ago: Mockery is a powerful tool, particularly when applied to the European Union\u2019s rigid rules. Apocalyptic predictions about what would happen if \u201clo spread\u201d became too large have not come to pass, at least for now. The government no longer accepts an abstract bond finance term as the unappealable judge of Italian politics, and there is a widespread sense that it is time to challenge not just the commission\u2019s fiscal rules but also the E.U. in general.Instead of a symbol of Italy\u2019s weakness relative to Germany and the rest of Europe, \u201clo spread\u201d has become a symbol of all that is frustrating about the E.U.My grandpa figured this out a while ago. When Angela Spread was fully grown, he sold her.Lucia Rubinelli is a research fellow in the history of political thought at Robinson College, University of Cambridge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Reimposes Sanctions on Iran but Undercuts the Pain With Waivers", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Friday that it was exempting eight countries from bruising sanctions that the United States was reimposing against Iran, undercutting its pledge to economically punish Tehran\u2019s regional aggressions while widening a profound rift with European allies.Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, did not identify the eight countries that were being granted six-month waivers, but a senior official confirmed that they include India, South Korea, Japan and China \u2014 among the world\u2019s largest importers of Iranian oil.The sanctions were promised in May, when President Trump announced that the United States was withdrawing from a 2015 deal with world powers to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program.They were affirmed on Friday, the eve of a long-announced Nov. 5 deadline for nations to cease importing Iranian goods or face financial penalties, and days before crucial midterm elections in which the Trump administration is seeking to galvanize Republicans who support his hard-nosed foreign policy.Mr. Pompeo said the waivers were granted to the eight countries \u201conly because they have demonstrated significant reductions in their crude oil and cooperation on many other fronts.\u201d He said two of the eight were expected to end their imports of Iranian oil \u201cwithin weeks,\u201d and all must reapply for extended exemptions at the end of six months.South Korea and China are crucial to keeping pressure on North Korea to eliminate its nuclear weapons \u2014 another top Trump administration priority. Once South Korea was exempted, Mr. Trump could not deny the demands of Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whom the president has often described as the Asian leader with whom he has the greatest rapport.And India, like China, will most likely never stop importing Iranian oil; the waivers help \u201cavoid what would potentially be a very painful confrontation,\u201d said Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert during the Obama administration. He said the waivers have also helped keep oil prices in check ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections.The sanctions \u2014 and dearth of exemptions for European allies \u2014 threaten to dangerously deteriorate already-strained trans-Atlantic ties. Most big European companies have left Iran in recent months ahead of the looming penalties, but European diplomats vowed on Friday to continue efforts to protect legitimate trade with Tehran.\u201cOur collective resolve to complete this work is unwavering,\u201d diplomats from the European Union, Britain, France and Germany said in a statement.Iran remains a part of the nuclear accord, which it brokered in 2015 along with the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. International inspectors have concluded that Tehran is complying with the agreement by not developing nuclear weapons, and European officials have said that the deal is crucial to their national security.R. Nicholas Burns, a top diplomat in the administration of President George W. Bush, said imposing sanctions on countries for remaining part of an accord that the United States helped negotiate would be a huge mistake.\u201cWe still need these countries on other vital issues, like containing North Korea and Russia,\u201d Mr. Burns said.Many initially lifted as part of the nuclear deal, the sanctions will target more than 700 businesses, individuals and other entities involved in Iran\u2019s oil, banking, shipping, shipbuilding and insurance sectors. They go into effect on Monday and were jointly announced on Friday by Mr. Pompeo and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.Since the United States jettisoned the nuclear deal, Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, has lost more than two-thirds of its value, according to officials and experts, and the country\u2019s oil exports have plunged to 1.5 million barrels daily, from 2.5 million barrels.The penalties seek to force Tehran to end what the United States views as Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the Middle East, including its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The sanctions are \u201caimed at depriving the regime of the revenues it uses to spread death and destruction around the world,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.Shortly after the new penalties against Iran \u2014 and the waivers \u2014 were announced, Mr. Trump tweeted a poster of himself with the words \u201cSanctions Are Coming,\u201d using the font from the HBO show \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The words are a play on a well-known phrase from the show, \u201cwinter is coming,\u201d which refers to an impending deep freeze when an army of magical warriors will descend from the north to wipe out all kingdoms.Richard Nephew, a top sanctions official during the Obama administration, called Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d because of the economic pain that sanctions impose on the Iranian public.Whether Tehran will be able to hold out while its economy suffers is unclear. Iran undertook some of its most aggressive regional moves during the previous round of punishing sanctions between 2012 and 2015.Spontaneous protests in Iran have erupted in recent weeks among groups that had long been reliable supporters of the Islamic Republic, and public opinion may have also turned against the government\u2019s relative moderates. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, had advocated the nuclear deal as a means of improving his country\u2019s economy.Mr. Mnuchin defended the administration\u2019s decision not to directly impose sanctions on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a financial messaging service based in Belgium and known as Swift. Conservatives have insisted that Swift must be punished if it fails to expel Iranian banks from its network.\u201cIt is our intent that they cut off designated entities as was done before,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said of Swift.Mr. Pompeo said the eight countries that have been given waivers will pay for Iranian oil exclusively through a barter system. It requires Iran to be paid in goods rather than cash to limit the country\u2019s ability to use oil sales to fund military activities.Mr. Pompeo also said the list of waivers is far smaller than the 20 nations that were exempted from American sanctions under President Barack Obama.Peace groups denounced the sanctions as \u201cthe latest step in a calculated campaign by this White House to provoke war with Iran,\u201d Paul Kawika Martin of Peace Action said.Friday\u2019s announcement is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of biting economic tools, including tariffs and sanctions, to further his foreign policy aims. But American sanctions on Russia, Venezuela and North Korea have so far produced few tangible victories.David E. Sanger contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain and E.U. Agree on a Draft Deal for Brexit", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 British and European Union officials reached a long-awaited draft agreement on Tuesday on Britain\u2019s troubled withdrawal from the bloc, opening the way for a high-stakes meeting of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s most senior ministers to consider the plans, the prime minister\u2019s office said.Cabinet ministers will have a chance to review the draft text before a critical meeting of the full cabinet at 2 p.m. Wednesday, the prime minister\u2019s office said.In the worst case, defections from the cabinet or an outright rejection of the pact could threaten her leadership.Mrs. May was reportedly meeting Tuesday evening with officials like the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, whose support she cannot afford to lose.The breakthrough followed months of discussions over an issue that has divided Britons and split the governing Conservative Party. But the prime minister\u2019s problems are far from over.Even assuming she gains the cabinet\u2019s approval on Wednesday without a politically damaging raft of resignations \u2014 not a given \u2014 Mrs. May faces daunting odds in pushing the compromise plan through Parliament, where it has many opponents.If Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet signs off on the draft agreement, the next step is for European Union leaders to give it their blessing at a meeting at the end of the month.It would then need the approval of the European Parliament and of British lawmakers in London. If that is forthcoming, the agreement would lead to a standstill transition period during which very little would change before the end of 2020.However, Mrs. May cannot be certain of support from lawmakers in London because both hard-line supporters and opponents of Brexit have criticized her strategy.Many of those issues will remain unresolved until trade negotiations, which would take place during the transition period. An outline deal on those plans is expected to be reasonably vague.In recent weeks, talks had stalled over the divorce terms to be enumerated in a withdrawal agreement, particularly over the backstop plan for the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union.Conservative, pro-Brexit hard-liners fear that a plan to prevent border checks might keep the United Kingdom tied indefinitely to European customs rules, preventing it from striking free trade deals further afield. They want a mechanism under which the government in London could quit unilaterally, something the European Union has adamantly resisted.There was an ominous warning from the Democratic Unionist Party, on whose 10 lawmakers Mrs. May relies, that it would not accept a plan under which Northern Ireland would have some different economic rules than the rest of the United Kingdom.The party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, said in a statement that was \u201cnot acceptable,\u201d adding that these were \u201cmomentous days and the decisions being taken will have long-lasting ramifications.\u201dBut there is opposition among pro-Europe Conservatives too, a fact that was underscored last week when Jo Johnson quit his post as a rail minister. Mr. Johnson \u2014 the brother of the pro-Brexit former foreign secretary Boris Johnson \u2014 campaigned to remain in the European Union. But in a withering resignation statement, he accused Mrs. May of drawing up plans that presented lawmakers with a choice between \u201cvassalage and chaos.\u201dIn a statement, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, suggested that he would likely instruct his lawmakers to vote against the draft deal in Parliament.\u201cFrom what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country,\u201d he said in a statement.Nevertheless the conclusion of a draft deal is a big moment for Mrs. May.They now have to decide whether her compromise plan is good enough to keep their support.One influential pro-Brexit lawmaker, Steve Baker, said on Tuesday that about 50 pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers might oppose Mrs. May\u2019s deal.\u201cWhat the prime minister is likely to ask us to support is not merely imperfect. It is to put us into a position that is worse than Article 50, worse than E.U. membership \u2014 less of a voice, more difficult to escape from.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not kind of a grubby compromise that we can put up with and sort later,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than membership.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consulting Firms Keep Lucrative Saudi Alliance, Shaping Crown Prince\u2019s Vision", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia charmed Goldman Sachs bankers and Silicon Valley executives on an American tour this spring, some of his most trusted lieutenants were taking care of business in Washington.In a low-key ceremony two blocks from the White House, Saudi officials signed an agreement with Booz Allen Hamilton, the American consulting company, to help train the kingdom\u2019s growing ranks of cyberfighters.The work is lucrative \u2014 the three firms have earned hundreds of millions of dollars altogether on projects in Saudi Arabia. McKinsey\u2019s work in the kingdom grew from two Saudi projects in 2010 to almost 50 the following year and kept accelerating, to almost 600 projects from 2011 to 2016.McKinsey consultants spread across the kingdom in recent years to advise government agencies such as the planning ministry, nicknamed the \u201cMinistry of McKinsey\u201d by some Saudis; the royal court; and a coterie of companies in industries such as banking, media, telecommunications, real estate and energy, internal McKinsey documents viewed by The New York Times showed.Last year, McKinsey bought a politically connected Saudi consultancy, adding that firm\u2019s 140 employees to more than 300 already in the region.\u201cOmar has a multitude of negative tweets on topics such as austerity and the royal decrees,\u201d the author, who McKinsey says is a researcher based in Saudi Arabia, wrote in bullet points. Mr. Alkami \u201cwrote multiple negative tweets regarding austerity.\u201dThough McKinsey said the report was prepared for an internal audience, Mr. Alkami was subsequently arrested, and Mr. Abdulaziz said two of his brothers were imprisoned. A third, pseudonymous account was shut down, and it remains unclear what happened to the person behind it.The crackdown was an early sign of the Saudi government\u2019s extreme measures to quash criticism, which culminated in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s murder.McKinsey said it was \u201chorrified\u201d at the possibility that its information could have been misused. In a note to former employees, McKinsey said the researcher had published the analysis in January 2017 on an internal system and that it was intended only to \u201cshowcase techniques to gauge social media usage and reaction.\u201dAfter Prince Mohammed was installed as defense minister in 2015, BCG landed a contract to help overhaul the ministry\u2019s procurement systems and improve its handling of finances and personnel, two people familiar with the contract said.Press officers for the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to emails seeking comment.In February 2016, consultants for McKinsey and BCG escorted five emissaries from the Saudi royal court to make the rounds of think tanks in Washington. They informed Gulf experts about Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s grand goals to remake Saudi life while the consultants, who outnumbered the Saudis, quietly took notes.Last month\u2019s Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, a conclave championed by Prince Mohammed, underscored Saudi Arabia\u2019s importance to the consulting firms. While executives, companies and journalists pulled out amid the global furor over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s murder, they stayed on.McKinsey led panels on money and energy, the event program showed. Boston Consulting Group focused on unspecified \u201cintelligence.\u201dIn a statement, BCG said it focused in Saudi Arabia on work that could \u201cpositively contribute to economic and societal transformation\u201d and that the company has turned down work that goes against that principle. The firm declines projects that involve military or intelligence strategy, a spokesman said.Dozens of American military veterans work for Booz Allen in Saudi Arabia. One retired rear admiral with combat experience in the region advises top Saudi officers on military planning. Others have extensive shipboard experience that could be used to train Saudis on how to carry out blockades and how to operate equipment like electronic warfare gear that can detect and interfere with enemy radars and missiles.A spokesman for Booz Allen said the firm\u2019s work with the Saudis did not include training on blockades or electronic warfare equipment. The spokesman said such work was out of the parameters of its United States government license covering the company\u2019s work with the Saudis.In a statement, Booz Allen said that it had provided no support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, and that the company coordinates with the American government to ensure that its work \u201cis consistent with U.S. foreign policy and trade regulations.\u201d The firm did not address whether the troops and sailors it trains participate in the Saudi blockade in Yemen.Booz Allen did advise the Saudi government on a plan to provide humanitarian aid to Yemen. But the project, the Yemen Comprehensive Humanitarian Operations, is seen by aid groups as an ineffective effort that undercuts the United Nations\u2019 own program.Booz Allen denied that its work with the Saudis involved hacks \u201cor the use of cyber for offensive purposes.\u201d But cyberexperts say that the same defensive maneuvers used to discover vulnerabilities or otherwise protect computer networks can easily be redirected to target other governments or dissidents as well.As for McKinsey, its work with Saudi Arabia is controversial even within the firm. Amid the Arab Spring, its consultants in the region argued that the firm should consider curtailing business in Saudi Arabia, said one former McKinsey consultant who worked in the Middle East.But more senior consultants, including partners, said McKinsey was not in the business of passing judgment on its clients\u2019 cultures and values. The best way to improve the kingdom, they argued, was to modernize the economy and make government and companies work better.Rather than scaling back in Saudi Arabia, McKinsey doubled down.Many foreign consultants working in Saudi Arabia fail to understand the local culture or how an authoritarian government could exploit their work, said one consultant who has worked with the higher reaches of the Saudi government. He qualified that by saying that his colleagues take care to try not to cause harm.In a statement, a McKinsey spokesman said, \u201cWe are proud of our record in Saudi Arabia,\u201d citing job creation and improved health outcomes.Consultants who aim to help authoritarian governments from the inside often give in to a desire to preserve their lucrative assignments, said Calvert W. Jones, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies the role of consultants in the Middle East.\u201cThey soft-pedal,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir fear is if they speak truth to power at this state of their interactions, they will be tossed out.\u201dThe surge in business for BCG, McKinsey and Booz Allen also stems from Prince Mohammed\u2019s need for expertise as he pushes his proposals to revamp the country. His dependence on consultants is so great that some of the companies have people embedded at the royal court to respond quickly to requests, according to three consultants who have done work for the kingdom.Some reported being asked to turn around proposals in 24 hours, much faster than they often work. And the crown prince will sometimes ask different companies for proposals, then have their consultants pitch to each other as he looks on, the consultants said.\u201cIt\u2019s like a beauty pageant,\u201d said one.But not long after the government released those held, the consultants moved back in.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How China\u2019s Rulers Control Society: Opportunity, Nationalism, Fear", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "They didn\u2019t like the West\u2019s playbook. So they wrote their own.As China grew richer, the West assumed, political freedoms would follow. Now it is an economic superpower \u2014 and the opposite has happened.In the dusty hillsides of one of China\u2019s poorest regions, Gong Wanping rises each day at 5:10 a.m. to fetch well water and cook her son\u2019s breakfast. She washes his feet while he keeps his nose in English and chemistry books. She hits him if he peeks at her cellphone.To Ms. Gong, 51, who dropped out of school, the future of her son, Li Qiucai, 17, is paramount. If Qiucai does well on the college entrance exam, if he gets a spot at a top university, if he can achieve his dream of becoming a tech executive \u2014 then everything will change.\u201cHe is our way out of poverty,\u201d she said.To achieve all this, Ms. Gong and millions of other Chinese like her have an unspoken bargain with the ruling Communist Party. The government promises a good life to anyone who works hard, even the children of peasants. In exchange, they stay out of politics, look away when protesters climb onto rooftops to denounce the forced demolition of their homes, and accept the propaganda posters plastered across the city.Ms. Gong is proud of China\u2019s economic success and wants a piece of it. Politics, she said, doesn\u2019t matter in her life. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the leaders,\u201d she said, \u201cand the leaders don\u2019t care about me.\u201dHow China became a superpowerFor years, many Western analysts believed the Chinese people, having endured decades of hardship under Mao, would tolerate one-party rule in exchange for rising incomes and more social freedom until the day \u2014 or so the argument went \u2014 that a newly prosperous nation would demand political freedoms, too.Instead, the opposite has happened. Income levels have jumped, yet China\u2019s authoritarian leaders have consolidated power. President Xi Jinping could be a ruler for life. China\u2019s people still place demands on the party, but the old assumption that prosperity inevitably stirs democratization is being challenged.It turns out that the unspoken bargain that binds Ms. Gong and others to the state is more complicated. It resonates, in part, because China is still intent on addressing the questions that it asked itself one century ago, before the Communist Revolution in 1949: What made it so weak and held it back as the West advanced? And what did it need to do to get ahead?Back then, the blame was placed on a conservative traditional culture that emphasized hierarchy, discouraged individual initiative and rewarded knowledge of Confucian classics over more practical topics like mathematics and science. The Communists sought to smash that culture through Marxist-inspired policies, but that ended in disaster.Yet China\u2019s leaders, and its people, have continued to look for answers, as the party crafts new ones that build on and reshape traditional culture without rejecting it entirely.The government has offered education as a path to social mobility, unleashed private enterprise by removing Confucian and Marxist stigmas against the merchant class and cultivated a potent brand of nationalism, blending pride and humiliation into a narrative of restoring Chinese greatness.But for many Chinese, those incentives are only part of the calculation. So, too, are the costs of rejecting the party\u2019s bargain.Over the years, the party has expanded its repressive capabilities.For some, like the ethnic minority Uighurs in Xinjiang, the country\u2019s turn toward hard-nosed authoritarianism has meant the devastation of entire families, cultural and religious practices and ways of life. For others, just the fear of repression is enough to keep them in line.It is impossible to know how many Chinese disapprove of the system. In private, many middle-class Chinese have voiced frustrations with, for example, Beijing\u2019s handling of the growing trade war with the Trump administration. But few dare to speak out.Memories of famine and political upheaval have shaped Ms. Gong\u2019s generation and are passed down in the form of whispered warnings: China has too many people. China is not ready for democracy. Stay out of politics. Don\u2019t ask questions.But so far, frustrations and fears have been overshadowed by the surge in pride \u2014 and the sense of opportunity \u2014 that has come from seeing the motherland\u2019s rise.Once, the allure of the West was considered irresistible; now many Chinese educated in Europe or the United States have returned, eager for their children to know a China that is proud and powerful. James Ni had a chance to study in America but instead remained in China and became a multimillionaire. Hua Yijia, a venture capitalist in Beijing, studied and worked in America but wants her 8-year-old daughter to take pride in being Chinese.\u201cI want her to understand the beauty of the language and the hard work and sacrifices of the people, especially in the countryside,\u201d Ms. Hua said. \u201cChina used to be a very backward country, but her generation will have so many more opportunities.\u201dMany analysts and Western diplomats are now confronting the likelihood that so much of what they assumed about how China would change \u2014 and become more like the West \u2014 is turning out to be wrong.\u201cThe Chinese mentality is very practical,\u201d said Xu Zhiyuan, a Beijing-based historian and writer. \u201cFrom a young age, you are told not to be idealistic, you are told not to be different. You are encouraged to survive, to compete, to excel within the system.\u201d\u201cThe whole society is a competitive playground.\u201dIt was Aug. 9, exactly 302 days until the college entrance exam, and Li Qiucai was frantic.In the halls of Huining No. 1 High School, in the northwestern province of Gansu, teachers were already turning up the pressure. The school is a powerhouse in producing rural students with top test scores, and teachers urged Qiucai to preserve the school\u2019s reputation and \u201cshine like the sun.\u201d Signs posted in the hallways warned that students must tolerate a little pain now to avoid a \u201clife of suffering.\u201dSince Qiucai began attending the school two years ago, his life has been a blur of late-night cram sessions, practice tests and mastering the art of finishing geometry problems while slurping noodles. He starts each day by running around a racetrack chanting, \u201cThe heavens reward industrious people!\u201dHe attends classes until almost 10 p.m., with only a short break on Sundays, and lives nearby in a $32-a-month apartment with his mother, who cooks and cleans so that he can study full time.All of it is pointed toward next June, when Qiucai will be one of nine million students taking a test that is at the core of China\u2019s high-stakes meritocracy \u2014 those who perform best get a ticket to the Chinese dream.\u201cOnly if I do well on the test,\u201d Qiucai said one recent night as he worked on physics problems, \u201ccan I have a better life.\u201dYet if the gaokao is a symbol of opportunity, it is also a tool of social control. Scholars say it is a clever governing tactic borrowed from the keju, the Confucian examination system that determined the selection of government officials in China for more than 1,300 years. Even in dynastic China, the keju lent the government an aura of meritocracy, as it was open to all men. But only 1 percent of applicants passed the exam for the highest degree, since few had the time and money to prepare.In a modern China rife with corruption, the gaokao is seen as relatively fair and incorruptible, meaning that those who fail are unlikely to blame the government.\u201cIt allows the government to say: \u2018If you are not successful, you can only blame yourself. You did not work hard enough,\u2019\u201d said Yong Zhao, an education professor at the University of Kansas. \u201cThat is a very powerful way of governing.\u201dThe gaokao was established in 1952, under Mao, and initially only students with class backgrounds deemed suitably red were allowed to apply. The test was suspended during the Cultural Revolution \u2014 the turbulent period in which teachers were beaten and schools shuttered \u2014 and then restored in 1977, after Mao\u2019s death. More than 10 million students rushed to take the exam, which was now more meritocratic, and open to almost anyone.In the decades since, the spread of basic literacy and numeracy, and the cultivation of top technical talent, have resulted in immeasurable economic gains. But the gaokao has contributed to concerns that China\u2019s education system overemphasizes rote memorization and instills values of obedience and conformity, not critical thinking.So some are opting for another way to get ahead: They apply to join the Communist Party.James Ni is fine with not being a member of the Communist Party. He is a fabulously wealthy private entrepreneur whose company, Mlily, is the official pillow and mattress partner of the English soccer club Manchester United. His goal is for Mlily to become a global brand.Growing up in a small town in Jiangsu Province, Mr. Ni came of age during China\u2019s once-unimaginable economic transformation. Private enterprise wasn\u2019t even legal when he was born in 1975. And once the state did open the door for private entrepreneurs, they faced persistent obstacles \u2014 as they still do even today.\u201cOf course, there are a lot of things that are unfair,\u201d Mr. Ni said. \u201cThe state-owned companies have an advantage. Those who have the right connections have an advantage. But in this environment of development and expansion, anyone can find their own way.\u201dToday, Mr. Ni estimates his personal wealth at $400 million. Many Chinese executives cozy up to local governments to gain advantages, but Mr. Ni says he keeps a distance from officials, hewing to a philosophy that \u201cit\u2019s better for business to stay business.\u201dIn the long view of Chinese history, it is remarkable how the country now embraces entrepreneurs, given the traditional Confucian condescension toward profit-seeking merchants. To catch up to the West, the party embraced market mechanisms and capitalist ideas not as end in itself but as a means through which to achieve national wealth and power.Party leaders have always worried that private business could evolve into an independent economic force, and some in the West predicted that capitalism could be a Trojan horse for democratization. Yet though Mr. Ni resists joining the party, he is fiercely patriotic, loves China and believes that, ultimately, party leaders want what is best for the country.\u201cThis country is my land,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as long as I live on this land, I will be comfortable and have self-respect. That is what\u2019s important to me.\u201dParty leaders legalized certain private enterprises in 1979 and made a historic shift in 2001 by accepting capitalists as members of the party itself.\u201cAllowing private entrepreneurs into the party really reinforced a certain mutual dependence between the party-state and the private economy,\u201d said Kellee Tsai, the dean of humanities and social sciences at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.Even so, the rules of competition have been tilted in favor of state-owned enterprises. Mr. Ni\u2019s first business venture, selling software, failed. He got into the bedding business after noticing the high prices of memory foam pillows in a shop display. But while state-backed companies could easily get bank loans, Mr. Ni, a private entrepreneur with no credit history, was shut out.Instead, Mr. Ni raised 500,000 renminbi \u2014 about $60,000 at the time \u2014 in seed money in 2003 from friends and family, with over half coming from a single cousin. These trust networks are at the heart of China\u2019s huge \u201cgray\u201d economy, operating outside the formal banking structure and providing an investment engine for a private sector.As Mr. Ni\u2019s company grew in Nantong, a city in Jiangsu Province, local cadres began to take notice. But Mr. Ni said they did not interfere because he complies with regulations, employs about 3,000 people and is a major tax contributor. That, in turn, helps the officials advance their careers by meeting production targets.And even when the party does hand down orders, there is sometimes room to push back. Four years ago, Mr. Ni\u2019s vice chairman told him that the government wanted the company to create a party cell inside Mlily.\u201cI said no,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt is just some middle-level officials trying to please higher-ups. It wasn\u2019t an order that came down from Xi Jinping.\u201dBut there are signs that under Mr. Xi, the space for maneuver may be shrinking. In recent months, leftist scholars, bloggers and government officials have publicly endorsed what appears to be a state-led shift away from free-market policies. Mr. Xi has recently sought to reassure private business leaders, praising their contribution to China\u2019s economic miracle, but his broader approach has favored the state-owned sector.\u201cToday you have the largest bureaucracy in history, with a capacity to intrude in anything,\u201d said William C. Kirby, a professor of China studies at Harvard. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just ideology. There are now enormous numbers of interest groups that don\u2019t like competition.\u201dFor guidance, Mr. Ni often looks to Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Alibaba, who is China\u2019s richest man and a cultlike figure among many businessmen. Mr. Ni is currently enrolled in a business school program that Mr. Ma established to cultivate China\u2019s next generation of entrepreneurs.Over the years, Mr. Ma has spoken publicly about the push-pull relationship between private companies and the government, though there is one piece of his advice for entrepreneurs that Mr. Ni seems to have especially taken to heart: \u201cFall in love. But don\u2019t marry.\u201dOver time, Hua Yijia felt the pull of China. The feeling surprised her.Living in Boston, Ms. Hua had received an elite education in the United States, landed a consulting job and even contemplated applying for American citizenship. She loved jazz and American pop culture.But more than a decade after she left China, she decided to return in 2007.Part of it was opportunity: a job prospect at a consulting firm in Beijing. Part of it was a tinge of disillusionment: She had seen Chinese friends hit a \u201cbamboo ceiling\u201d in corporate America, even as the careers of friends in China seemed to be taking off. And part of it was something deeper: a desire to help the country catch up with the West and to reconnect with her Chinese roots.Now a partner at a venture capital firm, Ms. Hua, 44, has a daughter whose elementary school offers a steady dose of Tang dynasty poems, calligraphy lessons and excursions to ancient sites. \u201cShe needs to know where she came from,\u201d Ms. Hua said.Exposed to liberal democracy, Ms. Hua\u2019s generation was supposed to be the one that demanded it at home. Middle-class Chinese students poured into universities in the United States and Europe \u2014 then seen as the most promising path to wealth and prestige \u2014 and some Western analysts predicted that they would return to China as a force for political change.Like many other middle-class parents, Ms. Hua worries about repression and rampant materialism in Chinese society. Yet many of these parents say they want their children to see themselves as Chinese above all else \u2014 to understand China\u2019s roots as an agrarian society and to have a sense of pride in the perseverance of the Chinese people through decades of poverty and strife.Patriotism has run through centuries of Chinese history, uniting the country in difficult times and, more recently, blending a pride in the cultural legacy of China\u2019s civilization with deep resentment over the humiliations at the hands of foreign powers during the colonial era. It is a volatile mix that the party skillfully manipulates to stir the feeling that China needs to stand up in the world.Even as some analysts argue that China\u2019s success has more to do with the resilience of its people than the Communist Party and its policies, leaders have been adept at shaping a politicized nationalism that reinforces the primacy of the party \u2014 and defends the authoritarian model as the best bulwark against chaos.\u201cChinese nationalism binds the people with the state, not to each other,\u201d said Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.Mr. Xi has selectively revived traditional Chinese culture \u2014 an effort, experts say, to give people something to be proud of. That approach, however, is rich with historical irony. Both the modernizers who overthrew the Qing dynasty and then Mao and his communists once blamed Chinese tradition for holding the country back.But with communist ideology long ago having lost its appeal to the public, Mr. Xi is drawing on Chinese tradition to reinforce the idea that the country needs a strong leader to prevent chaos and to guard against outsiders. That leaves some worrying that he could be leading the country into a new period of isolation.\u201cOpening up and learning from the West is not a humiliating thing,\u201d said Zhu Dake, a scholar and cultural critic in Shanghai. \u201cChinese culture is not a self-enclosed culture, and our greatness is not wholly self-created. Unfortunately this is a minority point of view.\u201dMs. Hua\u2019s apartment complex overlooking Chaoyang Park in central Beijing is covered with propaganda posters, including displays celebrating \u201csocialist\u201d values like \u201cpatriotism\u201d and \u201chonesty.\u201d She said she worried that it had become nearly impossible to criticize the country without being labeled unpatriotic, and she is uneasy with tightening censorship and information control.\u201cI\u2019m a Chinese citizen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I think everything in China is great.\u201dBut if she has grievances, she still believes society is moving in the right direction \u2014 and has made peace with waiting. \u201cTwo steps forward, one step backward,\u201d she said.Ms. Hua has started to take her daughter on trips to poor parts of China, to show her the vast inequalities that still persist, even in an age of mobile payments and self-driving cars. She hopes her daughter will live in a more tolerant China, one still open to the outside world.But that is not the same as wanting China to be just like the West.\u201cI hope my daughter will have the chance to be exposed to different worlds and different cultures,\u201d she said. \u201cBut she was born in China. She grew up here. She will always need some understanding of who she is and what it means to be Chinese, from the very beginning.\u201dJavier C.

{"Headline": "Too Rich to Jail", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistWASHINGTON \u2014 When I was in Reykjavik in August, Icelanders were bragging about putting the corrupt bankers who ravaged their economy in prison. In America, it works somewhat differently.We let the corrupt bankers who ravaged our economy roam free with bigger bonuses, more lavish Hamptons houses and fresh risky schemes. The big banks are bigger than ever and prosecution of white-collar crimes is at a 20-year low. And, cherry on the gilded cake, we put white-collar criminals in charge of the country \u2014 elevating epic grifters to the presidency and powerful cabinet posts.Reading all the recent stories about the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, it\u2019s easy to see the neon line leading from Barack Obama\u2019s failure to punish Wall Street scammers to the fact that Republican scammers are now infecting the entire infrastructure of government.President Obama and his Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. made a terrible mistake by letting the miscreant bankers off the hook rather than saying, as F.D.R. did, \u201cI welcome their hatred.\u201dSome saw it as the end of the Democratic Party. Democrats were the party of workers, charged with protecting people from big money, big banks and big fraud. Obama, the great hope to revitalize the left, immediately folded. Some analogized that the failure to send bankers to jail or even on perp walks made the party\u2019s white blood cell count drop to the point that G.O.P. infections could run wild.David Axelrod, the Obama counselor who fought during the crisis to \u201ckick the offenders harder,\u201d as he puts it, says he still feels \u201cvery conflicted.\u201d \u201cWe feared that if you took a brick out of the wall then the whole damn wall might fall down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t helpful, as far as Trump. To the extent that people felt the deal was rigged against them and in favor of the powerful, it gave him fodder.\u201dDonald Trump scooped up \u201cthe forgotten,\u201d promising to punish Wall Street for \u201cgetting away with murder,\u201d and pledging to break up the big banks and force bankers to pay higher taxes.Trump\u2019s White House started off like a branch office of Goldman Sachs, as Elizabeth Warren noted. Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s former economic adviser from Goldman, showed that Wall Street\u2019s arrogance shines bright when he recently told Reuters that borrowers were just as responsible for the 2008 crisis as lenders.\u201cWho broke the law?\u201d Cohn asked, adding: \u201cWas the waitress in Las Vegas who had six houses leveraged at 100 percent with no income, was she reckless and stupid? Or was the banker reckless and stupid?\u201dLike his new boss, Matthew Whitaker has a pattern of thuggishness, threats, scams and abusing the power of his office to wage partisan feuds. Our new top cop was on the board of a shady patent company that has claimed Bigfoot exists and time travel could be coming. It also touted a \u201cmasculine toilet\u201d to give well-endowed men \u201cpeace of mind\u201d by ensuring that their genitals would not touch porcelain.Now, after trashing the idea of the Mueller investigation in 2017, Whitaker \u2014 flush with power \u2014 is the oddball sycophant charged with ensuring that Robert Mueller can finish his report.I\u2019m sure we have nothing to worry about, though. As Sarah Huckabee Sanders noted Friday, \u201cThere must be decorum at the White House.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Winning the House Is Not Nothing", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bumbling, exasperating Democratic Party claws back one branch of government.Mr. Baker is a novelist and historian.To borrow from Churchill, election night 2018 was not the end of the Trump phenomenon. It was not even the beginning of the end. But it was, perhaps, the end of the beginning.If the blue tsunami that Democrats were hoping for did not quite materialize, the party did manage to retake the House of Representatives and claw back at least some hold on our national government. It will enable them both to promote their own ideas and initiatives \u2014 and to provide some real oversight of the Trump White House, even if impeachment is not on the table. Much more important, it will also enable Democrats to save health care for millions of Americans (myself included), though President Trump will doubtless now continue his Ahab-like pursuit of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy in the courts and the federal bureaucracy.Have no doubt about it: the 2018 elections were a referendum on Mr. Trump, and he must own it. Since it is not the president\u2019s wont to accept responsibility for anything, you will hear much in the weeks (and months and years) ahead about how rare it is for any incumbent president\u2019s party to gain or hold seats in a midterm race.This is true. It has happened only three times since the Civil War, and then every time in the wake of a national trauma of one sort of another: in 2002, when the Republicans managed it a little over a year after the 9/11 attacks; in 1998, when a nation fed up with the endless hunting of President Bill Clinton enabled Democrats to keep from losing any seats in the Senate and pick up five in the House; and in 1934, when Americans, finally managing to pull themselves up at least partly from the nadir of the Great Depression, rewarded President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s Democrats with a remarkable nine seats in each house.The field was set for Republicans to pull off the same trick in 2018. Whatever his responsibility for either, Mr. Trump could boast of a red-hot economy and a campaign that drove ISIS from its last major citadels. Toss in a summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un that proved more comical than scary, a shaking up of both our more complacent allies and China, and Mr. Trump might have fashioned a reasonable case that his methods, crude and unsavory though they might be, were accomplishing something. A sudden switch in tone and tactics, a commitment to building something (something more inspiring than a border wall, that is), and a few high-minded, kumbaya speeches might have thrown the opposition completely off balance and provided Mr. Trump, for once, with something that really was a historic accomplishment.He couldn\u2019t do it. What we got instead were simply more displays of churlishness and solipsism, running from his oblivious response to the horrible massacre of Jewish Americans at a Pittsburgh synagogue (it was somehow the fault of the \u201cfake news media\u201d which is \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d and hey, they should have had better security), to his implication that pipe bombs sent to his enemies were a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation, to his incessant pillorying of the \u201ccaravan\u201d of desperate refugees fleeing Central America, right down to a final ad considered so racist that it was even pulled from Fox.\u201cA lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of times, so you know,\u201d was Mr. Trump\u2019s comment on this, nearly his last comment of the campaign.He drew the reaction he deserved. The former congressman Steve Israel told me that he divided this strange, often frightening election season into three parts: an initial blue wave of anger, followed by a countering red wave of anger over the Kavanaugh hearings \u2014 but then another blue wave of anger, as Mr. Trump injected himself into the race again.\u201cMidterm voters, especially, vote on visceral emotions, fear and anger,\u201d Mr. Israel said. \u201cRepublicans tried running on fear. This is the first time I have ever seen Democrats voting in the midterms motivated by anger.\u201dIt was a mood reflected in much of Manhattan. At my polling place \u2014 appropriately enough, the Alfred E. Smith School on the Upper West Side, named for New York\u2019s original \u201cHappy Warrior\u201d \u2014 lines were longer than I had seen them on any Election Day save for the Obama-McCain election of 2008. This time the feeling in the lines was entirely different from that day ten years ago, and not just because the balmy sunshine had been replaced by rain. My fellow voters seemed grimly determined, quietly set on delivering a message even though there were no competitive races (or competitive Republicans) on the ballot.So where are we and where do we go from here?A tip that Mr. Trump should take from a much better politician than himself, the man who did pull off the impossible, is that there are times to get off the stage. Even when things were going well, Franklin Roosevelt liked to say, periodically, that it was time for him to disappear \u2014 to keep a low profile, get out of the public eye and go fishing, even in that much less media-freighted era. No one wants a president in her face all the time, and no TV show is on every night.It is not advice Mr. Trump will take. Even on election night, he was giving himself full credit in his tweets for what he called a \u201ctremendous success\u201d and retweeting what the writer Ben Stein had said about him, namely that \u201cMr. Trump has magic about him. He has magic coming out of his ears. He is an astonishing vote-getter and campaigner.\u201dWell, the magical Mr. Trump has become a permanent low-pressure system hovering over us, dominating our conversation, filling our airwaves, distracting us from exercising our great right to be left alone. But he is constitutionally incapable of giving up the tweet-glow, and so will likely exhaust even his most devoted followers in the end.Regarding those followers: we have all been told, over and over again, by one expert after another from nearly every possible spot on the political spectrum that none of us must ever, ever talk down to these, our fellow Americans, or criticize their choice of Mr. Trump in any way, lest we further alienate them.Fine. I will say this then: listen to yourselves. Listen to your experience, to that little voice in your heart or in your head, to what you can recall of what used to be acceptable presidential behavior in this country. It will tell you that this is not a fit man to be president, in any way whatsoever. It will tell you that this is not what you have to settle for, that you yourselves can do better in choosing someone else, no matter how often you have been disappointed in the past.For Democrats, this campaign had its own heartbreaks: Beto O\u2019Rourke, Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum losing to three of the most obnoxious candidates in the race. The wrenchingly narrow failure to knock the likes of Steve King or Chris Collins out of the House. And of course, Republicans keeping the Senate means not only that Mr. Trump will have something to brag about (when does he not?) but that he can jam through as many appointments \u2014 particularly judicial appointments \u2014 as he likes, perhaps starting with a replacement for Justice Clarence Thomas at a politically convenient moment like, say, 2020.As is our wont, we liberals bombarded ourselves \u2014 and our candidates \u2014 with endless litanies of advice on what we should and should not say. In one October week, I had a close friend rage to me that Nancy Pelosi had spoiled everything by daring to say, months before, that the proposals of the Democrats\u2019 newly minted star from the Bronx, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, would not always reflect those of House Democrats going forward \u2014 only to have another friend email me angrily that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was going to spoil everything by proposing that we spend $36 trillion dollars on her socialist ideas!As it worked out, Ms. Pelosi, one of the most consistently and unfairly maligned politicians of our time, will now become the first congressperson to regain the speakership of the House since Sam Rayburn did it back in 1955. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will join her in the House, and judging by how intelligent, tough and savvy both women are, they will no doubt learn a great deal from each other.This is something that would have been all but impossible just thirty years ago, and unthinkable fifty years ago: the Italian-American woman Speaker of the House mentoring the Hispanic woman representative of a chunk of Mr. Trump\u2019s old borough \u2014 both of them part of a group of what is now more than one hundred women in the House. The bumbling, exasperating, sometimes corrupt, often oblivious Democratic Party \u2014 always the party of immigrants and (however belatedly) the party of people of color \u2014 is the party of inclusion, and its win this year, in the face of relentless demagoguery and racism, makes it truer than ever to say it was a good night for our democracy.Kevin Baker is a novelist and historian and the author, most recently, of \u201cAmerica the Ingenious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Cheap Labor Drives China\u2019s A.I. Ambitions", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldSome of the most critical work in advancing China\u2019s technology goals takes place in a former cement factory in the middle of the country\u2019s heartland, far from the aspiring Silicon Valleys of Beijing and Shenzhen. An idled concrete mixer still stands in the middle of the courtyard. Boxes of melamine dinnerware are stacked in a warehouse next door.Inside, Hou Xiameng runs a company that helps artificial intelligence make sense of the world. Two dozen young people go through photos and videos, labeling just about everything they see. That\u2019s a car. That\u2019s a traffic light. That\u2019s bread, that\u2019s milk, that\u2019s chocolate. That\u2019s what it looks like when a person walks.\u201cI used to think the machines are geniuses,\u201d Ms. Hou, 24, said. \u201cNow I know we\u2019re the reason for their genius.\u201dMost importantly, this thinking goes, the Chinese government and companies enjoy access to mountains of data, thanks to weak privacy laws and enforcement. Beyond what Facebook, Google and Amazon have amassed, Chinese internet companies can get more because people there so heavily use their mobile phones to shop, pay for meals and buy movie tickets.But the ability to tag that data may be China\u2019s true A.I. strength, the only one that the United States may not be able to match. In China, this new industry offers a glimpse of a future that the government has long promised: an economy built on technology rather than manufacturing.\u201cWe\u2019re the construction workers in the digital world. Our job is to lay one brick after another,\u201d said Yi Yake, co-founder of a data labeling factory in Jiaxian, a city in central Henan province. \u201cBut we play an important role in A.I. Without us, they can\u2019t build the skyscrapers.\u201dWhile A.I. engines are superfast learners and good at tackling complex calculations, they lack cognitive abilities that even the average 5-year-old possesses. Small children know that a furry brown cocker spaniel and a black Great Dane are both dogs. They can tell a Ford pickup from a Volkswagen Beetle, and yet they know both are cars.A.I. has to be taught. It must digest vast amounts of tagged photos and videos before it realizes that a black cat and a white cat are both cats. This is where the data factories and their workers come in.Taggers helped AInnovation, a Beijing-based A.I. company, fix its automated cashier system for a Chinese bakery chain. Users could put their pastry under a scanner and pay for it without help from a human. But nearly one-third of the time, the system had trouble telling muffins from doughnuts or pork buns thanks to store lighting and human movement, which made images more complex. Working with photos from the store\u2019s interior, the taggers got the accuracy up to 99 percent, said Liang Rui, an AInnovation project manager.\u201cAll the artificial intelligence is built on human labor,\u201d Mr. Liang said.AInnovation has fewer than 30 taggers, but a surge in labeling start-ups has made it easy to farm out the work. Once, Mr. Liang needed to get about 20,000 photos in a supermarket labeled in three days. Colleagues got it done with the help of data factories for only a couple thousand dollars.\u201cWe\u2019re the assembly lines 10 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Yi, the co-founder of the data factory in Henan.The data factories are popping up in areas far from the biggest cities, often in relatively remote areas where both labor and office space are cheap. Many of the data factory workers are the kinds of people who once worked on assembly lines and construction sites in those big cities. But work is drying up, wage growth has slowed and many Chinese people prefer to live closer to home.Mr. Yi, 36, was out of a job and trying to get other ventures going with elementary school classmates when someone mentioned A.I. tagging. After online searches, he decided it wasn\u2019t super technical but needed cheap labor, something Henan has in abundance.In March, Mr. Yi and his friends set up Ruijin Technology, which rents offices the size of two professional basketball courts in an industrial park for $21,000 a year. It was previously the park\u2019s Communist Party committee\u2019s event space, so the ceiling lights are covered with red hammers and sickles.Ruijin, which means smart gold, now employs 300 workers but plans to expand to 1,000 after the Chinese New Year holiday, when many migrant workers come home.Unlike workers and business around the world, Mr. Yi isn\u2019t worried that A.I. will take his job.\u201cThe machines aren\u2019t smart enough to teach themselves yet,\u201d he said.Hiring is a bigger worry.Ruijin\u2019s pay of $400 to $500 a month is higher than average in Jiaxian. Some potential job candidates worry that they don\u2019t know anything about A.I. Others find the work boring.Jin Weixiang, 19, said he would quit Ruijin after the Chinese New Year and go to sell furniture in a physical store in southern city Guangzhou.\u201cI\u2019m a people\u2019s person,\u201d said Mr. Jin. \u201cI\u2019m doing labeling for the money.\u201dBut for some former migrant workers, the job is better than working on assembly lines.\u201cIt was the same work, same movement, day after day,\u201d said Yi Zhenzhen, a 28-year-old Ruijin employee who once worked at an electronic component company. \u201cNow I have to use my brain a little bit.\u201dMost of the time, customers don\u2019t tell these data factories what the task is for. Some are obvious. Labeling traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians are usually for autonomous driving. Labeling many types of camellia flowers could be for search engines.Once Ruijin was given the task of labeling the images of millions of human mouths. Mr. Yi said he wasn\u2019t sure what it was for. Maybe facial recognition?Roughly 300 miles to the north, in the Hebei city of Nangongshi, Hou Xiameng runs her data factory out of her in-laws\u2019 former cement factory. Her first job out of college was labeling faces for Megvii, the Chinese facial recognition company with a $2 billion valuation that\u2019s most famous for its technology platform called Face++. To this day, some facial recognition systems recognize her before they do her friends because, she says, \u201cmy face is in the original database.\u201dBut life in Beijing was too tough and expensive. She and her then-fianc\u00e9, Zhao Yacheng, decided to move back to their hometown and start a data factory. Ms. Hou\u2019s parents would pay for computers and desks. They are renovating the warehouse next door to hire 80 more people.Like Mr. Yi, Ms. Hou doesn\u2019t spend time thinking about the implications of her work. Are they contributing to a surveillance state and a dystopian future that machines will control human?\u201cCameras make me feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in control of the machines for now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You can hire a personal trainer to come to your house, for example, secure a sitar player for your next dinner party, rent a neighbor\u2019s boat for a weekend or exchange professional services such as accounting or graphic design. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that revenue from the sharing economy will increase to $335 billion in 2025 from around $14 billion in 2014.With more people moving to cities, embracing minimalism and connecting with like-minded people via smartphone apps, the sharing economy is affecting almost every aspect of our lives \u2014 and improving our society in surprising ways. Like our first-grade teachers taught us: Sharing is good.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to spend half their paycheck on housing and a car these days,\u201d says Julia Steyn, the vice president of urban mobility and Maven at General Motors. \u201cThey want to increase their experiences, not possessions.\u201dMany people appreciate the connection that often comes with sharing someone\u2019s home. In a response to the sharing economy boom, hotel chains are now adding personalized, quirky touches to their previously standardized rooms. \u201cHotels are realizing they can borrow some tricks from these folks and make it a more authentic experience,\u201d Stephany says.Car-sharing apps such as Maven allow members to easily find and rent cars, and they enable car owners to earn extra income by renting their car during times when it would normally just be parked. Considering that the majority of cars sit unused 95 percent of time, this type of sharing can help free up parking spots and increase the efficiency of cities.Transportation sharing can also have a positive impact on the environment. \u201cIn the long run, sharing will likely lower the average person\u2019s ecological footprint,\u201d says Arun Sundararajan, professor of business at New York University and author of \u201cThe Sharing Economy.\u201d Fewer cars are being used for more people, maximizing efficiency and minimizing traffic.PULL QUOTE 2\n___\n\u201cThe sharing economy puts a value on making underutilized assets available to a community.\u201dWhen shared cars run on electricity rather than gas, air quality can improve. \u201cMaven has about 1,000 electric Chevrolet Bolt EVs available for sharing,\u201d says Alex Keros, the smart cities chief at Maven. \u201cThis creates environmental benefits for the community and also introduces more drivers to electric vehicles.\u201dBy having access to a wide variety of transportation options and being able to try out vehicles before they commit to one, more people are enjoying greater privileges and flexibility with car sharing. \u201cIt\u2019s increasing quality of life,\u201d Sundararajan says.\nPULL QUOTE 3\n___\n\u201cSharing is in all of us.

{"Headline": "U.S. Added 250,000 Jobs in October; Unemployment at 3.7%", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s really the strongest part of the broader economy at the moment,\u201d Michelle Girard, chief United States economist at NatWest Markets, said of the labor market.A swerving stock market, tariffs and weakening growth in other countries may be causing agita, but they have done little to dent economic momentum in the United States. Employers added 250,000 jobs in October, extending a record streak of growth to 97 months, the Labor Department reported on Friday.\u201cJobs and the economy\u201d was also cited more frequently than other issues as the most important in a survey conducted in early October for The New York Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey.Friday\u2019s roundup also offered evidence that sidelined workers are not only feeling optimistic about job prospects but are actually finding work, which is why the jobless rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent even as employers hired more people. An estimated 711,000 people joined the labor force last month. President Trump, on Friday, called the numbers \u201ctremendous.\u201dA modest monthly wage gain of 0.2 percent nonetheless produced a surprisingly big 3.1 percent jump in annual growth. That was partly because of an unusual drop in pay in October last year after hurricanes. Yet even if the year-over-year increase was somewhat inflated, the underlying trends point to a pickup in wage growth.Some analysts saw warnings of inflation, but others said the pay increase should not bother policymakers at the Federal Reserve. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something the Fed should worry about,\u201d Ms. Girard said. \u201cProductivity growth is picking up, and workers should earn more. It doesn\u2019t mean companies have to pass on higher wage costs to consumers. They can afford to pay them more.\u201dThe Fed, which has increased rates three times this year from historically low levels, is expected to raise them again to 2.5 percent in December as a hedge against inflation.In a call with reporters, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, cited productivity growth as the explanation for higher wages, and not an overheating economy. He also took the opportunity to say that the president respects the Fed\u2019s independence.As always, the monthly jobs report captures only a particular moment; the underlying trend is what\u2019s important. That caution is particularly pertinent this time.The back-to-back hurricanes in September and October may have distorted the data in unpredictable ways. \u201cIt looks good, but it\u2019s never happened before when you have hurricanes making landfall in successive survey weeks,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Manufacturing jobs \u2014 which have traditionally paid well and have been a focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 increased by a healthy 32,000.\u201cIf I were a Republican politician, I would be shouting about it,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said, referring to manufacturing. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way that growth is going to continue.\u201d Manufacturing sectors in China, in particular, and Europe are weakening sharply. Producers, he said, are worried about \u201ctariffs, tariffs, tariffs.\u201dOctober\u2019s figures will be revised twice more, and September\u2019s once more.October\u2019s report, however, is among several recent signs that wage growth is gathering steam.According to a report last week from the research arm of the payroll processing firm ADP, American workers are earning nearly $1 more per hour on average than they were a year ago.Protolabs, a digital manufacturing company based in Minnesota, hired 50 people last month, bringing the year\u2019s total to 340, a pace it expects to match in 2019, said Renee Conklin, vice president for human resources. But the competition for workers is becoming stiffer. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more employers making counteroffers to retain people,\u201d Ms. Conklin said.Since the recession ended, analysts have struggled to understand how many more potential workers are out there. Before the financial crisis, more than 66 percent of the population 16 or older was working or looking for a job. In recent years, that number \u2014 the labor-force participation rate \u2014 has rarely risen above 63 percent.Many of those missing workers will never rejoin the labor force \u2014 some have reached retirement age, others have seen their skills lose value, and a number are too disabled to work.Economists continue to argue about how many more people could be lured back to the labor market. Rising wages are certainly one attraction.Women are coming back into the work force at a much faster rate than men, however. And over the past year, a net total of 1.4 million women have joined compared with 845,000 men. Drawing in even more women would require better child care, paid parental leave and more flexible hours, said Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan. \u201cWe know what to do for women,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really at a loss as to what to do to induce more men back.\u201dJob opportunities are also rippling out to groups that were largely bypassed during much of the recovery: African-Americans, Hispanics, less-educated workers and people with disabilities have all seen their unemployment rates drop in recent months.Employers say they are constantly on the hunt for workers. \u201cI speak to probably a thousand businesspeople a month,\u201d said Rick Lazio, a former Republican congressman who is a senior vice president at Alliantgroup, a tax-credit consulting firm. Midsize manufacturers are turning down lots of business, he said, \u201cbecause they can\u2019t find the people and they can\u2019t get the equipment fast enough.\u201dHelp is not coming from abroad: The number of immigrant visas issued by the government has declined for two years in a row.Worries about fierce competition for holiday hiring have prompted employers to be more aggressive, putting offers out earlier than usual and raising wages, recruiters said.United Parcel Service has said it plans to hire 100,000 seasonal workers. Several applicants for packing or delivery positions who showed up at the company\u2019s hulking customer center in Manhattan during a recent nationwide hiring drive said they hoped temporary stints would turn into permanent jobs. A company spokesman said holiday positions paid $10.35 to $30 an hour, depending on the location.\u201cI\u2019m just praying,\u201d said Chanique Cox, 42, who did not finish high school. She knocked her knuckles on a wooden counter and clicked her blue nails. \u201cI\u2019m only finding temporary jobs. I would love it if I got a permanent job.\u201dBen Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hard Road to Conservative Reform", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistLike all small sects, reform conservatism had its share of internal divisions, but the basic idea was to claim a middle ground between left-wing pessimism about the post-1970s American economy and right-wing faith in the eternal verities of Reaganomics. The left looked at the years from Reagan to the younger Bush and saw an ascendant plutocracy and an immiserated working class. The official orthodoxy of the right \u2014 embodied most notably by the Wall Street Journal editorial page \u2014 saw a long period of solid post-stagflation growth that only lacked for more supply-side tax cuts to be truly turbocharged.The reform conservatives aspired to a more nuanced take. Reaganomics had been a relative success in its own time, we thought, part of a necessary turn toward deregulation and freer trade and lower taxes that had pulled Western economies out of their 1970s malaise. Inequality had increased, but middle- and working-class Americans had enjoyed gains nonetheless; even when wages had stagnated, tax cuts and transfer payments had helped boost most Americans\u2019 incomes, and they had shared in the benefits of lower prices and ample consumer goods.That was the story we wanted Republican politicians to tell. Instead Donald Trump came along and told a darker one. \u201cSadly the American dream is dead,\u201d he announced after that escalator ride, and proceeded to campaign on a radically pessimistic message about the post-Reagan economic order, in which bad trade deals and mass immigration were held responsible for what he called \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in working-class communities.But I could also have called it \u201creform conservatism\u2019s more politically successful twin,\u201d because of course Trump won \u2014 twice over, in fact, triumphing over both the Republican politicians (Rubio, Jeb!) who tried to borrow some of reform conservatism\u2019s themes and a Democratic nominee linked, through her husband\u2019s record, to the post-Reagan economic consensus.And while Trump was winning, a certain amount of evidence emerged to confirm his darker view of the American situation \u2014 the surging opioid epidemic, the rise of what Anne Case and Angus Deaton called \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d among lower-income white Americans, growing evidence that the opening to China had worked out far better for Beijing\u2019s government than for the American worker, and more.All of this has left conservative policy wonks, the erstwhile reformocons and others, with a dilemma. Should they defend the post-Reagan economic order against Trump\u2019s blustering, blundering assault \u2014 defend the benefits of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d and free trade and global openness, warn against the sclerosis that protectionism and industrial policy often bring, champion the innovative culture of Silicon Valley against its populist despisers? Or should they take Trump\u2019s success as evidence that even reform conservatism was ultimately too sanguine and too moderate, and that there are deeper problems in the economic order that require a more-than-moderate conservative response?Cass\u2019s bracing tone reads like (among other things) an attempt to fix reform conservatism\u2019s political problem, as it manifested itself in 2016 \u2014 a problem of lukewarmness, of milquetoast wonkery, that Trumpism\u2019s more sweeping promises simply steamrolled in political debate.The critics\u2019 concerns vary, but a common thread is that Cass\u2019s diagnosis overstates the struggles of American workers and exaggerates the downsides of globalization, and in so doing risks giving aid and comfort to populist policies \u2014 or, for that matter, socialist policies, from the Ocasio-Cortezan left \u2014 that would ultimately choke off growth.But the argument over Cass\u2019s book also raises a larger question that both right and left are wrestling with in our age of populist discontent: Namely, is the West\u2019s post-1980 economic performance a hard-won achievement and pretty much the best we could have done, or is there another economic path available, populist or social democratic or something else entirely, that doesn\u2019t just lead back to stagnation?A great deal turns upon the answer. Economic growth since the 1970s has disappointed relative to what many optimists imagined in 1965; at the same time it has been stronger than what many Carter-era pessimists feared we could expect. If you emphasize the disappointment, then experimenting with a different policy orientation \u2014 be it Cass\u2019s work-and-family conservatism or an Ocasio-Cortezan democratic socialism or something else \u2014 seems like a risk worth taking; after all things aren\u2019t that great under neoliberalism as it is.But if you focus on the possible fragility of the growth we have achieved, the ease with which left-wing and right-wing populisms can lead to Venezuela, then you\u2019ll share the anxieties of Cass\u2019s conservative critics \u2014 who are willing to tinker with work-and-family policy but worry that to make any major concession to globalization\u2019s critics puts far too much at risk.Perhaps the best reason to bet on Cass\u2019s specific vision is that the social crisis he wants to address is itself a major long-term drag on growth \u2014 because a society whose working class doesn\u2019t work or marry or bear children will age, even faster than the West is presently aging, into stagnation and decline.At the same time it might well be, as some of his critics think, that the working class\u2019s social crisis is mostly or all cultural, a form of late-modern anomie detached from material privation. In which case political-economy schemes to \u201cfix\u201d the problem won\u2019t have social benefits to match their potential economic costs.So the decision for Cass\u2019s kind of conservative reform would be, necessarily, a real policy gamble, based on the hope that a greater human flourishing and a more mid-20th-century style of growth is still possible in rich societies like ours. And if the first iteration of reform conservatism was defined and limited by its moderation, his version 2.0 may succeed or fail based on the right\u2019s appetite for trying something else immoderate, even radical, after the Donald Trump experiment has run its course.

{"Headline": "Preserving the Wealth That Conservation Built", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe Trump administration views conservation and the environment primarily through the lens of conflict \u2014 of business versus government.For 53 years, the bipartisan conservation act supported more than 40,000 conservation projects including expanding national parks, wildlife refuges and migration corridors, historic battlefields and the like, funded by a small fee on offshore oil drillers. The administration first called for a 90 percent cut to its budget and in October, Republicans in Congress effectively killed it (or, more accurately, chose not to renew it).The problem with this kind of \u201czero-sum\u201d thinking about business and the environment is that it is sometimes deeply incorrect. Sometimes, in fact, making rules more favorable to business can lead markets to fail and destroy private sector value, while cleaning up pollution or protecting public spaces can unlock value in the private sector and allow it to grow.A rather sparkly example of this comes from a building with the president\u2019s name on it in my hometown \u2014 the Trump Hotel and Tower on the banks of the Chicago River. The tower is among the tallest buildings in America. On sunny days, the giant chrome T-R-U-M-P letters shine down on the bustling riverfront crowds below.Yet for much of the 20th century, most people didn\u2019t want to live anywhere near the river. Companies dumped all manner of unpleasant things in the water. It stank up the city and poisoned its residents.If Chicago had not been forced by the federal government to clean up the water beginning in the 1970s and continuing today \u2014 and had it not reserved open space and built the walk around it \u2014 the river would have remained an eyesore. There would be fewer tourists there, no Apple store, and certainly no luxury Trump Hotel and Tower. Billions of dollars of economic value would never have existed.Here, the public sector corrected a market failure. The individual companies dumping into the river were collectively ruining the neighborhood. When the government regulated their behavior, it ended up unlocking loads of private sector value. Though there are many examples of government regulations run amok, or of pointless public investments \u2014 and we should eliminate them \u2014 let us not forget the important situations where government can prevent market failures and unlock value.But think about the broader harm done by this zero-sum mentality. Accessible public lands and vibrant wildlife bring people to small towns and rural areas. They attract tourists and give residents a reason to stay, and give an enormous boost to the private sector in the very places the administration is trying to help.A shortsighted approach to public assets and the environment threatens to repeat at a national level the mistakes cities made when they industrialized waterfronts and spoiled what could have been the crown jewels of their landscapes. You would think that someone whose name is on a billion-dollar building on the banks of the Chicago River would understand that.Austan Goolsbee, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, was an adviser to President Barack Obama.

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.Highland Park, Tex., is kind of like a red-state version of Berkeley.Some of President Trump\u2019s biggest financial backers live here. It\u2019s where George W. Bush goes to church and where Dick Cheney once lived. These are literally \u201ccountry club Republicans\u201d \u2014 attendees of the expansive 122-year-old Dallas Country Club that stands in the center of the neighborhood.But drive past the leafy mansions on Mockingbird Lane four days before Election Day and you see something interesting: Lawn signs for Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic candidate for Senate, sprinkled between ones for his Republican opponent, Ted Cruz.In the final days, much of the midterm election seems to have clarified around a central question: What is American identity?In some ways, Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive style meant this election would always be a referendum not simply on his presidency but on issues of race, gender and American values.In the final weeks, a burst of identity-fueled violence \u2014 like the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to focus on a dark, anti-immigrant message have moved those emotionally charged questions to the center of the race, overshadowing other topics like health care and the economy.That\u2019s part of the reason that Republicans stand a decent chance of winning Senate seats in places Mr. Trump won, like Missouri, North Dakota, Arizona and Indiana, where the White House\u2019s message fuels the G.O.P. base.But discomfort with the president\u2019s rhetoric among college-educated white voters, particularly women, is also part of the reason that Democrats have a shot of winning long-held Republican House seats in suburbs like Highland Park, which has been represented by the Republican Pete Sessions since 2002.Many voters, on both sides, say these midterms feel bigger than just another election. It feels, they say, like a fight to preserve their way of life.At a campaign rally Friday morning for Mr. Cruz, Ann Harbuck, 65, praised Mr. Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201cnationalist\u201d to describe himself at a campaign rally last week. Critics say the term is coded language for racism and anti-Semitism, pointing to its association with far-right politics and fascism.\u201cA nationalist is somebody who cares about our nation,\u201d said Ms. Harbuck, a retired teacher.Ms. Harbuck and others at the event told me that they worried about illegal immigration, particularly a caravan of migrants many believed was just about to cross the U.S. border.\u201cThey say, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t worry about it, they\u2019re two months away, a thousand miles,\u2019 but those people are catching rides,\u201d said Warren Fachner, 63, a disabled retiree. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the politicians that say the president is doing this as a stunt for ginning up the base.\u201dBut, remember Mockingbird Lane? There were indications of that divide even here, among Mr. Cruz\u2019s most loyal backers.Mr. Fachner, who attended the rally with his sister, said his wife was turned off by what she saw as Mr. Trump\u2019s disrespectful treatment of the other candidates during the 2016 election. During the primaries, she voted on the Democratic ballot, telling him that she just didn\u2019t like Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s iffy whether she\u2019s voting for Beto or not,\u201d said his sister, Victoria Fachner, 62. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like when we talk politics.\u201d____________________I know what you\u2019re thinking about: Texas\u2019s BBQ.So where to find the best brisket and sausage in Texas?A very brief cheat sheet:\u2022 Austin: Black\u2019s (if you want to wait longer: La Barbecue or Franklin\u2019s)\u2022 Dallas: Pecan Lodge\u2022 Houston: Gatlin\u2019s or BurnsGot a beef with that? (Get it?) Come at me.____________________With less than a week until Election Day, 28 million ballots have been cast through early and absentee voting. That\u2019s a lot: Four years ago, 27 million people voted early. We\u2019ve already passed that, and we still have a whole weekend to go.\u2022 37 states, plus Washington, D.C., allow early voting. In half of those, early voting totals have already topped the early totals from 2014.\u2022 Nearly 4 million votes were cast over just 10 days in Texas \u2014 about 85 percent of their final total from 2014.\u2022 Even a few states without major competitive races, like Maryland and Louisiana, have surpassed their early voting numbers from the last midterms.See the numbers for yourself.____________________Big Picture: There\u2019s only a sliver of a difference between a very close election night and a gain of 40-plus Democratic House seats. So many super close races.You can see all our polling here.________________________________________Mine is \u201cLerer: That\u2019s fine! the midterms are almost done.\u201d Really!_____________________Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "Bakers From Baghdad, Who Fled Violence Against Christians, Pursue a Sweet Dream", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Neediest Cases FundSPRING VALLEY, Calif. \u2014 The marriage of Nael and Manar al-Najjar was forged in sugar.Mr. Najjar grew up working in his family\u2019s Baghdad sweet shop. When he proposed, three months after meeting his future wife at a family wedding, he traveled six hours to her hometown, carrying 15 boxes of confections: baklava, kenafeh and Turkish delights.The couple settled in Baghdad, opened a bakery and started a family. As Catholics, though, they faced discrimination and threats of violence. When those threats turned deadly, they fled and sought asylum in America.\u201cNow we have a big name,\u201d Mrs. Najjar beamed.Amid the turbulence of life in Iraq during this period, the family still found its routine, running the bakery, raising the children. \u201cWe lived, like, no problem,\u201d Mrs. Najjar said.Fifty-eight people died in the attack. Among the victims were two of Mr. Najjar\u2019s relatives, one of them an infant.Two weeks later, Mrs. Najjar, who had not been at the church during the attack, found a note slipped under the front door of the family\u2019s home. It said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to kill you,\u201d she recalled recently.Their children were 4 and 2 years old at the time, and the Najjars decided they needed to pack up the family in a few suitcases and join the exodus of Iraqi Christians fleeing to northern Iraq, then to Turkey.Once there, the Najjars initially settled in Usak, a provincial capital in eastern Turkey, where Mr. Najjar quickly found a job at a bakery. Soon after, they applied for asylum in America. It was granted in 2014, and the family moved to the San Diego area, where the parents worked in bakeries for three years and dreamed of again opening their own.\u201cWe wanted to make something together, something strong,\u201d said Mrs. Najjar, 38. \u201cIt is my dream and my husband\u2019s dream.\u201dTheir new bakery, Al Hamdani Sweets, opened in a popular shopping center near an interstate in August 2017. Mr. Najjar bakes, while Mrs. Najjar handles management, marketing and deliveries.Their experience running a bakery in Baghdad, though, went only so far in Spring Valley. Taxes, permits, health codes and other regulations proved challenging. \u201cIn Baghdad, you don\u2019t have taxes,\u201d Mr. Najjar, 43, said in the back room of the shop, with Turkish delights on the counter and stacks of trays and pastry boxes piled up around him.As the Najjars tried to keep their business, named after the town where the couple married, going after a slow start, the International Rescue Committee helped the Najjars navigate the unfamiliar rules and manage their finances.\u201cI.R.C. helped so much,\u201d said Mrs. Najjar, who kept her Bluetooth device in her ear throughout an interview last month. \u201cThey make everything easy.\u201dSome of the shop\u2019s baking equipment was purchased through funds from the committee\u2019s individual development accounts program, a saving program that, in March, matched $4,000 of the couple\u2019s business income.Financed by three-year federal grants, the program is intended to ease refugees into the economy by helping small-business ventures. Over the past three-year cycle, it has enrolled 115 clients in the San Diego area, matching almost $420,000 in savings, said Fady Amin, a committee coordinator who worked with the Najjars. Funds are used to help buy assets, like a house, business equipment or a car. (The Najjars just purchased a new Toyota Sienna, which Mrs. Najjar uses to make deliveries.)In a separate loans program, the organization doled out more than $1.4 million nationwide in 743 small-dollar loans from July 2016 to September 2018. Most borrowers were from Syria or Iraq.More than a year in, business at the Najjars\u2019 shop is good, with a steady stream of customers, many from a nearby hookah lounge. They have hired two employees. A wide variety of sweets, which Mr. Najjar bakes daily, are sold at local grocery stores and a university, and wholesalers in Sacramento and Seattle buy them, too.Early next year, the family will be eligible for citizenship, and they plan to apply. The couple\u2019s two children, now 13 and 10, enjoy school and sometimes help at the bakery.In the back room, Mrs. Najjar scrolled on her smartphone through photos of the children, laughing and covered in flour. Others were taken at SeaWorld, where the family has an annual pass.\u201cHere, my children have a good future,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a coordinator with the International Rescue Committee. He is Fady Amin, not Fadi.Advertisement"}

What Now for the Rest?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVarious approaches could lessen the economic shocks that globalization and technological change have delivered. Some might even be bipartisan.Instead, we\u2019re living in a world where a small number of superstar companies choose to locate in a handful of superstar cities where they have the best chance of recruiting superstar employees.But what\u2019s the economic future for a Hartford or Akron or Tulsa or the countless smaller towns and rural areas that didn\u2019t get so much as a serious look from Amazon?Some promising answers are bubbling up, although there may not be a single plan that all the people who study these issues can agree upon.They argue for heavy investment in digital skills, even in areas without a large existing high-tech sector. They seek new channels to ensure that businesses in struggling areas have access to capital, including small-business lending from banks and venture capital for start-ups.And finally, they suggest more federal support for people who want to move to greater economic opportunity \u2014 a countermeasure for one of the more surprising trends of the last generation, a decline in Americans\u2019 mobility in pursuit of better jobs.The authors also point out things they think haven\u2019t worked in reducing regional inequality.Using tax incentives to try to poach companies from elsewhere, for example, tends to weaken communities\u2019 tax bases, while any growth benefits are zero sum, at least in economywide terms.The authors are similarly skeptical of large-scale infrastructure projects, arguing that such efforts in Europe, called \u201ccohesion policy,\u201d have tended to create nice roads and bridges in remote, poorer areas, while doing little to help incomes and employment rise in those areas over time.\u201cWhat\u2019s increasingly clear after the 2016 election is that the forces that have been really good for the economy in the aggregate, like globalization and technological change, create local shocks that are extremely powerful,\u201d Ms. Hendrickson said. Their work is only the latest in efforts to wrestle with potential policy answers.Steve Case, whose venture capital firm Revolution has worked to advance entrepreneurship outside the big coastal tech hubs, said, \u201cWith the Amazon second headquarters, if the result isn\u2019t what people may have wanted, it could still help jump-start a discussion around regional innovation that could lead to better results down the road.\u201cI\u2019m just eager for it to move into action so there\u2019s less of a feeling of being left behind and more optimism about the future.\u201dAt the Economic Innovation Group, a tech industry-backed research outfit, the ideas veer more toward getting people the training and education they need.\u201cWe have to leverage universities better,\u201d said John Lettieri, the group\u2019s president. \u201cHow do we make them healthy, how do we upgrade the ones that need upgrading, make them more research focused?\u201dHe also mentions an overhauled immigration policy to help attract more people with advanced skills, especially to struggling regions, and changes to labor laws such as banning the \u201cnoncompete\u201d clauses that make it hard for people to switch jobs.Reading the various academic papers, think-tank policy briefs and business pitches makes it clear there\u2019s no conventional wisdom on how to address these issues. But there are a range of possibilities for a politician to choose from in shaping an agenda.Even as Washington prepares for divided government, regional development is one area where ideological lines are not calcified. There may be some room for deal making, as with the Jobs Act, aimed at spurring small business, that was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President Obama.Even if that doesn\u2019t turn out to be the case, candidates for the presidency in 2020 have a huge political opportunity to pull together a policy approach that sends a message that the whole country can enjoy the benefits of prosperity, not just a handful of rich regions.For the people most in the thick of the research on the issue, there\u2019s a sense of urgency \u2014 but also a feeling of modesty in facing this complex challenge.\u201cWhile we may not know the complete and perfect solutions,\u201d said Mr. Muro of Brookings, \u201cwe do know that we need to get started with the experiments.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Others looked more like sterile drugstores or hipster cafes, only instead of cough syrup or lattes, they were selling cannabis-infused face creams, potent marijuana concentrates and jelly treats.When a senior City Hall official told me Vancouver had more black market marijuana dispensaries than Starbucks outlets, I was skeptical. But a marijuana dispensary crawl across the city and a call to Starbucks soon revealed that she was right.The coffee chain had 50 outlets in the city of Vancouver.

Even if the authorities came to close down her stores, she said she would merely reopen them.As it is, she has already been served with an injunction, and said her criminal record made it all but impossible for her to get a legal license.Others marijuana retailers like Jessika Villano, owner of Buddha Barn in the bohemian neighborhood of Kitsilano, welcomed legalization, saying they were tired of living in fear of being shut down.Ms. Villano told me she opened her health store about five years ago after seeing how the cannabis cakes she baked for her mother helped her emphysema. She has paid $7,500 to apply for a provincial license and $30,000 for a municipal license, and has turned over three years of financial records to the government.She has also rebranded her shop, since operating a medical marijuana retail operation is officially illegal.

{"Headline": "Carlos Ghosn Is Removed as Chairman of Mitsubishi Motors", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a statement on Monday, Osamu Masuko, chief executive of Mitsubishi, said the board had removed Mr. Ghosn because \u201che lost the trust of Nissan, and he cannot execute his duties as chairman and representative director any longer.\u201dMr. Masuko added that if Mr. Ghosn remained as chairman, it could expose Mitsubishi to \u201creputation risk.\u201dProsecutors have also been questioning Greg Kelly, a former Nissan human resources manager who was removed from the company\u2019s board last week over allegations that he conspired with Mr. Ghosn to underreport Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation in government securities filings and to use company funds for personal expenses. Nissan has described Mr. Kelly as \u201cthe mastermind of this matter, together with Carlos Ghosn.\u201dIn his first remarks to the news media, Yoichi Kitamura, a lawyer representing Mr. Kelly, said his client denied the allegations. \u201cHe said he hasn\u2019t intentionally understated the executive compensation that should be disclosed in the securities report nor instructed others to do so,\u201d Mr. Kitamura said in an interview.Mr. Kitamura said that Mr. Kelly would be held until at least Friday but that his detention could be extended for 10 days. He said he expected that prosecutors would eventually get an indictment after extending the period of questioning.Like Mr. Ghosn, Mr. Kelly is being held in a room of about 50 square feet. \u201cThe room is very small,\u201d Mr. Kitamura said. \u201cIt is inhumane.\u201dMr. Kelly is also represented by Aubrey Harwell Jr., a longtime criminal defense lawyer based in Nashville. Mr. Harwell said on Monday that Japanese authorities had not provided details of the allegations against Mr. Kelly and therefore it was impossible to say what his defense might be.But Mr. Harwell said that during a long career at Nissan, Mr. Kelly \u201chas never been accused of any inappropriate, unethical or illegal conduct. This doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201dMr. Ghosn, 64, has not been allowed to see any members of his family, although he has been visited by the French ambassador and the Brazilian consul general. Mr. Ghosn holds both French and Brazilian citizenship. Mr. Kelly has also not been allowed to see his family, Mr. Harwell said.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s lawyer in Japan, Motonari Otsuru, did not return calls seeking comment. Mr. Ghosn has also retained the New York law firm Paul Weiss.Former Japanese prosecutors have said that in the interrogation process, suspects are not allowed to have their lawyers present during questioning.Some critics have questioned the way in which Mr. Ghosn has been detained. Speaking to reporters at the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Japan on Monday, Nobuo Gohara, a former prosecutor, described the Tokyo public prosecutor\u2019s office as \u201cvery reckless and dangerous.\u201d\u201cI would have thought being careful would be the norm,\u201d Mr. Gohara said. \u201cBut in this case, I feel they have not been careful.\u201dMr. Gohara said he was concerned that prosecutors had not assembled enough evidence to support an arrest.The news of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest and detention has roiled business communities in Japan and France, where Renault, Nissan\u2019s largest shareholder, is to conduct an audit of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s finances this week, Bruno Le Maire, the French economy minister, said on Sunday. The French government owns 15 percent of Renault.Mr. Le Maire said that Nissan had yet to share details of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s alleged misdeeds with the French government and Renault, where Mr. Ghosn remains chairman and chief executive. \u201cWe have no information,\u201d Mr. Le Maire told BFM television.Renault and Nissan executives are planning to gather on Wednesday in Amsterdam for a routine operations meeting. Although the meeting was scheduled before Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest, officials are likely to discuss the fate of the alliance.Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, told workers in a company meeting on Monday that there was an excess concentration of power in a single person, citing Mr. Ghosn\u2019s positions as chairman and chief executive of Renault while he held the chairmanships of Nissan and Mitsubishi, according to a Nissan spokesman.Mr. Saikawa also told employees that, until recently, any attempts at conversations between the boards and executives of Renault and Nissan would go through Mr. Ghosn, a dynamic that limited communication.Reporting was contributed by Liz Alderman from Paris, Jack Ewing from Brussels, and Makiko Inoue, Hisako Ueno and Shunta Takino from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nissan Chairman, Carlos Ghosn, Is Arrested Over Financial Misconduct Allegations", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Carlos Ghosn, who created an alliance between Nissan and Renault that made it effectively the world\u2019s largest carmaker, was arrested by the authorities in Japan on Monday in a remarkable tumble for one of the industry\u2019s most powerful and admired leaders.Mr. Ghosn, a larger-than-life figure widely hailed for saving Nissan, reviving Renault, and rethinking how automakers could share technologies, was detained after an internal company inquiry found that he had underreported his compensation to the Japanese government for several years.The alliance, which in 2016 was broadened to include Mitsubishi, accounts for 10.6 million cars sold annually. The arrest of Mr. Ghosn, who is chairman of Nissan, chief executive of Renault and chairman of the board at Mitsubishi, stunned the industry. It comes at an uneasy time: The companies face a slowing economy, a global trade war and a shift toward electric cars.If the alliance were one entity, it could be considered the world\u2019s largest automaker, on track to sell more cars than Toyota or Volkswagen this year \u2014 if it can match results in the first six months of this year, when it sold 5.5 million vehicles.Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, said he would recommend to his board, which will meet Thursday, that Mr. Ghosn be removed. \u201cNeedless to say, this is an act which cannot be tolerated by the company,\u201d he said.Mr. Saikawa, speaking at a 90-minute news conference at Nissan headquarters in Yokohama, described Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a director who was also arrested Monday, as \u201cmasterminds\u201d of a long-running scheme to mislead financial authorities. He offered few details, citing the prosecutors\u2019 continuing investigation.\u201cI feel a big disappointment,\u201d said Mr. Saikawa, who did not bow in deep apology before television cameras, as is customary in Japan. \u201cAnd I feel frustration and despair, and indignation or resentment.\u201dMr. Kelly was Nissan\u2019s first American director, appointed in 2012, but had a much lower profile than Mr. Ghosn. Neither of the men could be reached for comment.Nissan said it was cooperating with Japanese prosecutors and that its investigation into Mr. Ghosn began after a whistle-blower said he had been misrepresenting his salary and using company assets for personal purposes.Born in Brazil to Lebanese parents and educated at elite universities in France, Mr. Ghosn made his reputation after joining Nissan in 1999. Renault, where Mr. Ghosn was an executive vice president, had bought a large stake in the Japanese company, which was on the verge of collapse at the time.Mr. Ghosn made sweeping changes at Nissan, closing five domestic factories and cutting 21,000 jobs. Later, he engineered an arrangement between Renault and Nissan that allowed them to operate like a single carmaker. Short of a full merger, the alliance enabled them to share the cost of developing new models and to negotiate better deals with suppliers by buying components together.As chairman and chief executive of the partnership, Mr. Ghosn was celebrated in Japan: His life story was made into a manga comic, although critics on the left noted he had earned his French nickname, \u201cLe cost killer.\u201d Still, he had enough political savvy to retain the support of the French government, which owns 15 percent of Renault, despite some bitter pay disputes.In 2016 and 2017, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s salary at Renault was questioned publicly, by French government officials and a shareholder group; this year he agreed to a 30 percent pay cut in return for another four-year term as chief executive.Under Mr. Ghosn, the alliance overcame the kinds of differences in corporate and national cultures that have often doomed megamergers like the ill-fated marriage between Daimler and Chrysler, which was dissolved in 2007.He earned a reputation as a hard-nosed manager who drew up rigorous business plans and kept close track of their progress.\u201cHis world is the world of efficiency,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows the auto industry. \u201cIt\u2019s the American style of management: clear plans, clear goals and permanently monitored.\u201dMr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer said it was questionable whether Nissan or Renault would have survived in the brutally competitive market for mid-price autos without Mr. Ghosn. In a measure of investors\u2019 regard for him, Renault shares slid 10 percent on the Paris stock exchange Monday; Nissan shares fell 9 percent in trading in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Nissan was down more than 5 percent in early trading in Tokyo.According to Nissan\u2019s securities filings, Mr. Ghosn was paid 735 million yen, about $6.5 million, in cash in 2017. That is a drop of 33 percent from the \u00a51.1 billion he received in 2016.In insular Japan, where foreign leadership of domestic companies is rare, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s downfall could be taken as a referendum on the perils of working with outsiders.\u201cHe\u2019s always the go-to when people say foreigners can never succeed in Japan,\u201d said Pernille Rudlin, managing director of Rudlin Consulting, which specializes in intercultural consulting with Japanese companies. \u201cNow there are no good examples left.\u201dThe misconduct allegations about Mr. Ghosn are of another order, analysts said.\u201cFor Nissan, Mr. Ghosn is a big hero,\u201d said Shin Ushijima, a lawyer who specializes in corporate governance. \u201cThis news is so embarrassing.\u201dAt a news conference with the Belgian prime minister on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron of France said it was too early to comment. But the French state, as a major Renault shareholder, would be \u201cextremely vigilant about the stability of the alliance\u201d between Renault and Nissan, he said.Mr. Macron added that the French government would seek to maintain stability and \u201cfull support\u201d for Renault\u2019s workers. The company employs more than 47,000 workers in France.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s pay was long debated there. In 2016, Renault was pressured by Mr. Macron, the finance minister at the time, to reduce his compensation. In 2017, he insisted on a package of 7.4 million euros, about $8.5 million. The French government balked but Renault shareholders ultimately approved that payout.In Japan, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation made him an outlier. Japanese executives typically earn far less than their American or European counterparts. Takeshi Uchiyamada, chairman of Toyota, for example, was paid \u00a5181 million in 2017, compared to Mr. Ghosn\u2019s reported \u00a5735 million.Foreign investors tend to criticize Japanese companies as not paying executives enough. \u201cFor the Japanese market, the main concern from foreign institutional investors is the question of whether compensation will be less incentive driven,\u201d said Hideaki Miyajima, professor of commerce at Waseda University in Tokyo. \u201cThe criticism of Japanese firms is that compensation is not related to performance, and Japanese leaders are less likely to take risks.\u201dReporting was contributed by Jack Ewing from Frankfurt, Liz Alderman from Paris, and Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Don\u2019t We Have Vaccines Against Everything?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 Things We\u2019d Really Like to KnowMoney is just the obvious obstacle. A few diseases, like H.I.V., so far have outwitted both the immune system and scientists.Vaccines are among the most ingenious of inventions, and among the most maddening. We have children\u2019s vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, chickenpox, polio, hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae and meningococcal disease.They have changed our expectations of mortality \u2014 and of parenthood. In 17th century England, one-third of all children died before age 15. Today, thanks largely to those vaccines, less than 1 percent of English children do.In tropical countries, there are vaccines against yellow fever, cholera, Japanese encephalitis, meningitis A, typhoid, dengue and rabies. But there is still \u2014 despite 30 years of effort \u2014 no AIDS vaccine. None for parasites like Chagas, elephantiasis, hookworm or liver flukes. None for some viral threats that could become pandemic, like Nipah, Lassa and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. None for some that already have, including Lyme, West Nile, Zika and hepatitis C.None for respiratory syncytial virus, which kills infants, nor even for the dozens of causes of common colds.Vaccines are among the world\u2019s greatest medical advances, like clean water, soap, bleach, sewage systems and antibiotics. In a rational world \u2014 one where budgets are built on lives saved per dollar \u2014 spending on vaccine research would rival that on defense research.And as with weaponry, fear changes everything. In epidemiologically quiet times, the anti-vaccine lobby sows doubts; when Ebola or pandemic flu strikes, Americans clamor for protection.There are two obstacles to faster progress, said Dr. Gregory A. Poland, director of the vaccine research group at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cOne is scientific, and one is embarrassing,\u201d he said.While defense research is driven by one mega-customer, the Pentagon, vaccine researchers face a confusing hodgepodge of potential backers.Private industry largely pursues high-priced vaccines for American children, militaries and adventure tourists. Potential bioweapons like anthrax, plague and rabbit fever attract bioterrorism funds.But vaccines meant to protect only poor people in faraway countries usually must wait for donor governments and philanthropies like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, even though we know these plagues cross borders.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussThe scientific obstacles, though more intractable, are relatively rare. Many pathogens are genetically farther apart than rhinoceroses and bees: A defense against a horn does not protect against a sting, and vice versa.Most vaccines work by creating antibodies \u2014 Y-shaped proteins \u2014 that block the disease agent\u2019s own proteins. While viruses have only handful of target proteins, bacteria have up to 6,000 and parasites even more, noted Dr. Paul A. Offit, director of vaccine education at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. And even some smallish viruses, including H.I.V., flu and hepatitis C, mutate so rapidly that their surfaces change shape before antibodies can lock onto them.As a rule, if a disease normally leaves even a few survivors who are completely disease-free and immune for life, a vaccine against that disease is possible. \u201cNatural infection is the mother of all vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Smallpox meets the criteria; H.I.V., malaria and tuberculosis do not. H.I.V. mutates as fast in one day as flu does in a year; it also survives by splicing its DNA into the very immune cells that hunt it.TB bacteria can survive even when \u201cwalled in\u201d by white blood cells.And malaria, a shape-shifting parasite, never triggers lifetime immunity. People who survive repeated bouts get less sick each time, but that immunity disappears if they move out of the malarial region. If they return, the first mosquito bite may kill them.Other diseases are complex, with many subtypes. For example, Pneumovax 23, the anti-pneumonia shot given to middle-aged people, negates 23 strains of one bacterium.Nonetheless, many diseases now rampaging at large are relatively easy targets, according to interviews with half a dozen experts. They could be beaten with vaccines if the world committed more money.Thus far, the coalition has raised about $630 million, but its ambitious plans \u2014 including DNA and RNA platforms that will cut vaccine-making time to weeks instead of months \u2014 will require billions of dollars.\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me 18 months ago whether a TB vaccine was possible, I\u2019d have said no,\u201d said Dr. Penny Heaton, chief executive officer of the new Bill and Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute. \u201cBut I think the field is now very promising.\u201dSome candidate vaccines rely on startling mechanisms for defeating the dizzyingly complex parasites \u2014 including injecting humans with a gene that produces an antibody that destroys a worm\u2019s gut when it sucks blood.But, like all the other projects in the works, that one needs more money \u2014 and not just from the usual suspects (the United States, Britain and the Gates Foundation).\u201cIn this multi-trillion-dollar economy,\u201d Dr. Hotez said, \u201cit\u2019s a little discouraging that we can\u2019t raise the funding.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a vaccine against pneumonia.

{"Headline": "Those Halls Won\u2019t Deck Themselves: Pros Help With Holiday Lights", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserIt is that time of year again, the time for outdoor holiday lighting, and homeowners now have options besides climbing a ladder in the cold to hang decorations.Professional lighting installers say business is brisk as the economy skates along, with homeowners willing to pay to avoid the headache of untangling strings of lights and running extension cords.Nick Schriver, founder of Decorating Elves in Tampa, Fla., said people increasingly outsourced chores like mowing lawns and picking up dry cleaning, so hiring someone to put up Christmas lights was an extension of that trend. \u201cThe culture is becoming more service oriented.\u201dMr. Schriver said he began hanging Christmas lights as a side job while in college some 16 years ago and eventually founded his own outdoor lighting company. Decorating Elves, he said, now has 10 full-time employees and adds 50 during the holiday season. (The firm also provides year-round outdoor lighting services.)\u201cIt\u2019s becoming bigger,\u201d he said, adding that the company is busy enough that it has to turn down jobs during holiday crunchtime.While Christmas d\u00e9cor accounts for the bulk of his seasonal business, Mr. Schriver said, he also has some demand for Hanukkah-themed displays, like large menorahs illuminated with blue and white lights.Outdoor holiday lighting is so popular that the Association of Outdoor Lighting Professionals, a trade group, gives an annual award just for that category (which Mr. Schriver\u2019s company won in 2016 and 2017).Safety may also be a factor behind the interest in professional installations. The Consumer Product Safety Commission last year estimated that in 2016 there were 14,700 holiday decorating-related injuries treated in emergency rooms, or an average of 240 per day during November and December. The most frequent decorating incidents were falls, the commission said, including three deaths involving falls from ladders.Many professional companies not only hang and remove the holiday lights, but also store the decorations after the holidays.How much does it cost to have a professional take over the decorations? That will vary by region, the size of your house and the dazzle of the display. Basic d\u00e9cor, like lights that outline your roof and front door, may cost $500 or less if you own a single-story home. But if you have a larger house with lots of gables or want more eye-catching d\u00e9cor, the price can stretch to thousands of dollars.At Christmas Decor, a professional holiday decorator with locations across the country and in Canada, the average cost of a display in the United States is $1,650, said Brandon Stephens, the company\u2019s president. Pricing tends to be higher on the coasts, he said, and lower in the nation\u2019s interior.\u201cI\u2019d say there\u2019s a larger group of people more willing to spend on decorations,\u201d he said. The company said its sales last year rose by 14 percent, with a similar increase expected this year.While classic white lights remain popular, consumers have choices far beyond the traditional. Homeowners may now select tubes of glowing lights that mimic falling snowflakes, giant ornament decorations or app-controlled light strips that blink in patterns synchronized with music.\u201cPeople are looking for that showstopper,\u201d Mr. Stephens said. Specialty items include six-foot-tall, three-dimensional snowflakes.Christmas Decor\u2019s representatives take a photo of your house with a tablet, then superimpose lighting displays on the image. If the suggested display is too costly, the software can adjust the proposed lighting until the represented results fit your budget.While professional installations are costlier than doing it yourself, the advent of LED lighting, which is much more energy-efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs, means powering the holiday d\u00e9cor doesn\u2019t have to be as wallet-draining as it once was. Some people still prefer the look of incandescent lights, but professionals say the quality of LED lighting has improved significantly in recent years. The bulbs no longer \u201cflicker\u201d and are available in a range of colors.Here are some questions and answers about professionally installed holiday lighting:How can I manage the cost of my outdoor holiday display?Try teaming up with other homeowners on your street for a group quote for lighting installation. \u201cIf you and your neighbors get together, you may get a lower per-house rate,\u201d said Sarabeth Asaff, chief writer with Fixr.com, a home services site. Putting the lights on a timer will help manage your electrical costs. And as with other home improvement projects, she said, seek three bids to get a true picture of what the job should cost.What if I prefer hanging lights myself?You have company. The National Retail Federation expects holiday spending, including money spent on decorations, to increase by about 4 percent this year.Just be careful on those ladders!How much will LED lighting save me on my electric bill?Quite a bit, said Steve Rosenstock, senior manager of customer technical solutions with Edison Electric Institute, an association that represents investor-owned electric companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Expect From Europe\u2019s New Bank Cop", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsLenders shouldn\u2019t expect much help with their bad debts from Europe\u2019s new senior financial watchdog.The European Central Bank on Wednesday nominated Andrea Enria as chair of its supervisory board, which oversees the continent\u2019s 118 biggest lenders. Mr. Enria, from Italy, is currently the respected head of the European Banking Authority, and is unlikely to take a softer line on tackling lenders\u2019 bad debts. The industry\u2019s chronic low profitability and poor money-laundering controls present bigger challenges.Some might hope that his promotion would lead to softer treatment of Italian lenders, many of which are still grappling with bad debts. They are likely to be disappointed. Colleagues joke that Mr. Enria, a former Bank of Italy economist, is sufficiently northern that he may as well be Austrian. His orthodox credentials, and his experience of dealing with large, international financial institutions as chair of the European Banking Authority since 2011, helped him secure the nomination over Sharon Donnery, the deputy governor of Ireland\u2019s central bank.It\u2019s true that Mr. Enria has shown dovish impulses. In 2017 he called for the creation of a regional \u201cbad bank\u201d to help clean up dud loans. That would have implied a degree of risk sharing by European governments \u2014 anathema to Germany \u2014 and his plea fell on deaf ears. Since then, the E.C.B. has pushed banks to tackle their own problems.If confirmed, Mr. Enria will have bigger issues to tackle. First up are the European Union\u2019s lax money-laundering controls, which have led to the sudden closure of banks in Malta and Latvia this year. The scandal in which up to 200 billion euros of potentially suspicious funds flowed through Danske Bank\u2019s Estonian unit has cast a cloud over the Danish lender, and could yet infect others. But the E.C.B. has no formal anti-money laundering powers, instead relying on national authorities \u2014 or U.S. authorities \u2014 to take action.Then there is the thorny issue of low profitability. Inside the E.C.B., there is widespread dismay that, despite a benign economy and record-low bad debt charges, banks still can\u2019t make good profits. The European banking industry\u2019s average return on equity is 7.2 percent, according to European Banking Authority figures, well below a probable 10 percent cost of capital.Tackling these issues, rather than doing favors for banks in his home country, will be Mr. Enria\u2019s top priorities.Advertisement"}

Lael Brainard, a fellow Fed governor, said they would \u201cweaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system.\u201d But Greg Baer of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said they don\u2019t go far enough.More details from Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner of the NYT:\u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel that we\u2019re unequal or we\u2019re not respected anymore,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, 33, a product marketing manager at Google\u2019s YouTube who helped call for the walkout. \u201cGoogle\u2019s famous for its culture. But in reality we\u2019re not even meeting the basics of respect, justice and fairness for every single person here.\u201dIt\u2019s the latest sign of how the tech industry\u2019s rank and file employees are embracing activism \u2014 and pushing back against their leaders. Workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies have recently spoken out about their employers\u2019 willingness to work on military projects, the gender pay gap and other issues.Last month was painful for investors. At its worst, the S.&P. 500 was down more than 9 percent, though it rebounded in the last few days to finish October with losses of around 7 percent.Only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. The S.&P. 500 has been dragged down disproportionately by smaller, domestically focused companies, cyclically sensitive industrial firms and global manufacturers like Caterpillar.And he also lists the issues that spooked investors:President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.The streaming service has changed its stance on not showing movies in theaters before streaming them. It will screen three movies that it wants to be considered for Oscars, including Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d in theaters for several weeks before they go online.Netflix\u2019s modified distribution approach should persuade more theaters to participate.

Near the front of the estate, a newly renovated \u201cadobe house with a cane roof, typical of local construction,\u201d is divided into a one-bedroom caretaker\u2019s apartment and a two-bedroom guesthouse, said Fernanda Canals, the president of ReMind Group, an affiliate of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate in Argentina, which has the listing.Past a large iron gate, a nearly mile-long driveway leads through the vineyards, gardens and orchards to the home\u2019s stone stairway and double entry doors. The foyer, which has a porcelain tile floor, opens on the right to the \u201cquincho,\u201d or barbecue room, with a beamed ceiling and pine floor. A large copper-hooded fireplace with a rotisserie faces the dining table. Across the room, a stone fireplace complements the seating area.To the left of the entrance hall is a formal living room with a 26-foot gabled ceiling, a fireplace, Lapacho hardwood floors and four sets of French doors leading to a covered terrace. The room is dominated by a colorful mural painted by Sergio Roggerone, a local artist. The mural is among the items, including furniture, that are included in the sale, Mr. Scopinaro said.Down the hall, a den opens to porches on two sides and, on a third, to the kitchen, which has custom wood cabinets, marble countertops and a center island with a hooded range.Up a short flight of stairs, the master bedroom has a vaulted wood-plank ceiling, a sitting area, east- and west-facing balconies and two walk-in closets. The porcelain-tiled master bath includes a double vanity with a marble counter and separate rooms for an antique cast-iron bathtub, a shower, and a toilet and bidet. Four more en suite bedrooms are downstairs, each with garden access, mountain views and a tiled bathroom with a vanity, a cast-iron tub, a toilet and a bidet.Two studios upstairs have large arched windows that open to east- and west-facing balconies. One has bookshelves and is currently used as an art studio; the other is being used as a children\u2019s playroom. A wine cellar, maid\u2019s quarters and a three-car garage are on the lower level.Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo sits at the eastern foot of the Andes Mountains, in the high-altitude vineyards of the upper Mendoza valley. The area is known for its malbec, but produces other varieties of wine as well. Several wineries are within a five-minute drive of the property, and the center of the city of Mendoza is about 25 minutes away. The mountainous area also offers hiking, horseback riding, boating and skiing. Governor Francisco Gabrielli International Airport, in Mendoza, is a 40-minute drive.Like the rest of the housing market in Argentina, Mendoza\u2019s real estate has been \u201cstrongly impacted\u201d by the country\u2019s recent currency devaluation, Ms. Canals said.In August, Argentina\u2019s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to 60 percent in an effort to stanch a sharp decline in the value of the peso. The devaluation may have helped Mendoza\u2019s regional wine export business, Ms. Canals said, but the benefits were \u201cneutralized by the inflation that made costs go up.\u201d During a flurry of buyer activity in early November, she said, her office discounted prices by 10 to 20 percent.Viviana Reissis Etchegoin, sales manager of Ginevra Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said that investors, typically the most common buyers in Mendoza, are now \u201creluctant to invest in Argentina,\u201d and many foreigners are selling their assets. \u201cWe have a lot of properties for sale, but not too many interested in buying.\u201d At Algodon Wine Estates, a wellness, golf, tennis and equestrian resort with coveted backyard vineyards, only six or seven houses have been finished in phase one of development, out of approximately 97 lots that range from half an acre to seven acres and start at $120,000.The most popular locations with foreign and luxury buyers are \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d private gated communities with \u201cbeautiful amenities,\u201d said Fanny Cruz, the owner of Fanny Cruz Real Estate, as well as 24/7 security.Ms. Etchegoin seconded that: \u201cIn Argentina,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to think about security.\u201d But three-bedroom, two-bathroom houses in those communities \u201cthat last year were selling for $325,000\u201d Ms. Cruz said, \u201ctoday are at $250,000.\u201dCondominiums are plentiful and popular. \u201cThey are widely requested by an ascending socioeconomic class,\u201d she said, particularly buyers between 35 and 45 seeking round-the-clock private security and a \u201cpremium lifestyle.\u201d Units of about 1,200 to 1,300 square feet sell for $280,000 to $300,000, she said.In Mendoza, foreign buyers are mostly from Brazil and Chile, with some Americans in the mix, Ms. Etchegoin said.The Europeans and Americans who do buy in the area usually prefer \u201cfincas\u201d \u2014 estates or rural properties, Ms. Canals said.Damian Tabakman, dean of the EN Real Estate School of Business in Buenos Aires, said that several gated real estate developments with vineyards previously drew foreigners to Mendoza, but \u201cnowadays, because of the local economic situation, only Argentines are buyers there.\u201dNoting that Argentina\u2019s economy has historically cycled through booms and busts, however, Mr. Tabakman expressed optimism about the future: \u201cI hope that Mendoza will be able to have foreign buyers again, from Europe and the U.S.A., because projects there are similar to what you may find in Napa Valley.\u201dDollars, not Argentine pesos, are used for pricing and transactions.Among the requirements for foreign buyers are \u201ca corresponding visa, an ID provided by the government of Argentina and an address certificate provided by the province of Mendoza,\u201d Ms. Cruz said.Argentina places some restrictions on properties close to a national border or on a lake. In Mendoza, buying properties west of Ruta 40, a highway that runs the length of Argentina and bisects the city of Mendoza, requires authorization from the Ministry of the Interior, Ms. Canals said.A notary is necessary to obtain a deed.Spanish; Argentine peso (1 ARS = $0.03)Property taxes on this house are about $2,000 a year.Closing costs run close to 10 percent of the sale price; that includes a 2.5 percent stamp tax and about 4 percent for notary fees and deed expenses. In addition, the buyer and seller each pay a 3 percent commission to the real estate agent.Advertisement"}

China\u2019s tech industry is becoming more serious about grappling with its products\u2019 unintended consequences \u2014 and about helping the government.\u201cTencent has been dedicated to dealing with terrorist information online and other internet crimes, in line with the government\u2019s crackdown,\u201d Chen Yong, an executive in Tencent\u2019s security management department, said at the event.At Wuzhen, by contrast, Mr. Xi appeared only by proxy. The head of the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda department, Huang Kunming, conveyed a message of thanks from Mr. Xi and then delivered an opening address that extolled the world-changing power of internet access.Among Chinese companies this week, private enterprises showed off the ways in which they increasingly support and work with the government, while state-backed companies demonstrated they were not doomed to be tech laggards.The Tencent executive, Mr. Chen, described in an interview the company\u2019s relationship with law enforcement.Political activists have reported being followed based on what they have said on WeChat. Chat records have turned up as evidence in court, fueling speculation about whether Tencent, the app\u2019s developer, may be the source.Mr. Chen said Tencent reports illegal activity discovered on its platforms to the government, after which the authorities can request specific user information.

Or, for that matter, appear publicly with any Democrat running in the midterm elections.\u201cEvery election is about the future,\u201d Mr. Tucker said, as he drove to a campaign fund-raiser in Little Rock.As Democrats search for their identity in the Trump era, one aspect has become strikingly clear: Mr. Clinton is not part of it. Just days before the midterm elections, Mr. Clinton finds himself in a kind of political purgatory, unable to overcome past personal and policy choices now considered anathema within the rising liberal wing of his party.The former president, once such a popular political draw that he was nicknamed his party\u2019s \u201cexplainer-in-chief,\u201d has only appeared at a handful of private fund-raisers to benefit midterm candidates, according to people close to him.In an election shaped by the #MeToo movement, where female candidates and voters are likely to drive any Democratic gains, Mr. Clinton finds his legacy tarnished by what some in the party see as his inability to reckon with his sexual indiscretions as president with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, as well as with past allegations of sexual assault. (Mr. Clinton has denied those allegations.) Younger and more liberal voters find little appeal in Mr. Clinton\u2019s reputation for ideological centrism on issues like financial regulation and crime.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that with all the issues he has, he could really be that helpful to the candidates,\u201d said Tamika D. Mallory, an organizer of the Women\u2019s March, who\u2019s now promoting female candidates across the country. \u201cIt would do the Democratic Party well to have Bill Clinton focus on his humanitarian efforts.\u201dRebecca Kirszner Katz, a veteran Democratic strategist, says many Democrats have reassessed the party\u2019s support for Clinton\u2019s behavior in light of changing views about women, power and sexual misconduct.\u201cIt was an abuse of power that shouldn\u2019t have happened and if the Clintons can\u2019t accept that fact 20 years later, it\u2019s hard to see how they can be part of the future of the Democratic Party,\u201d said Ms. Katz, who worked as a top strategist on Cynthia Nixon\u2019s bid to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York this year.Mr. Clinton, 72, currently chairs the board of the Clinton Foundation, helping to promote and manage the philanthropic organization he founded after leaving the White House. Angel Ure\u00f1a, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said the former president believes \u201cthis election should be about these times and these candidates.\u201d\u201cPresident Clinton is encouraged by the large number of impressive Democrats running for office who are personally telling their stories and laying out their vision for how to get America back on track,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the people voters need to hear from.\u201dSeveral party strategists who have been in discussions with Democrats weighing presidential bids suggested that reckoning with Mr. Clinton\u2019s legacy could become a litmus test in the 2020 primary race, with candidates being asked whether he should have resigned after the affair became public.The Clintons recently announced a 13-city arena tour, produced by Live Nation, guaranteeing they\u2019ll continue to be in the spotlight into the spring. Some Democrats worry the tour will become a distraction just as the party attempts to shape a national message that could effectively challenge President Trump in the presidential election.The couple still has pull, in part because of their decades-long personal relationships with so many strategists, donors and activists. Few Democrats were eager to talk publicly about Mr. Clinton\u2019s future role in the party. Though they\u2019re reluctant to say it out loud, Mr. Clinton\u2019s political exile is an open secret in Democratic circles.Mr. Clinton\u2019s absence from the campaign trail is all the more striking given the number of candidates with close ties to the Clinton legacy. Beyond Mr. Espy, there\u2019s Ms. Shalala, also a former president of the Clinton Foundation, and Nancy Soderberg, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a White House national security aide under Mr. Clinton. Both are running for House seats in Florida.Former Clinton speechwriter Josh Gottheimer is running for re-election to a House seat in New Jersey. J.B. Pritzker, the Democratic nominee for governor of Illinois, is a family friend and, like a number of other candidates across the country, supported Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.In August, the New Hampshire Democratic Party stripped Mr. Clinton\u2019s name from its annual fall dinner, changing it from the \u201cKennedy-Clinton Dinner\u201d to the \u201cEleanor Roosevelt Dinner.\u201d The state party chairman, Raymond Buckley, said the new name is aimed at highlighting the party\u2019s \u201csteadfast commitment to electing Democratic women.\u201dFriends of Mr. Clinton say he understands the current climate, even as he misses the campaign trail.\u201cIt\u2019s not a time for national Democrats who are not thinking of running for president to be out on the campaign trail,\u201d said Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and White House aide to Mr. Clinton. \u201cHe never stops or wants to stop but he\u2019s a very smart politician and understands the rhythms this cycle.\u201dThe math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Still, many Democrats are mystified by what seems like the Clintons\u2019 inability to respond to questions about Mr. Clinton\u2019s past that are inevitable in the #MeToo era.Even in his home state, some Democrats are struggling with how to reconcile Mr. Clinton\u2019s policy achievements with his personal behavior.\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of what he\u2019s said recently about #MeToo,\u201d said Claire Brown, 37, a Little Rock real estate agent, as she mingled with other donors at a fund-raiser for Mr. Tucker\u2019s campaign. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you understand the economic impact that man has had on the local economy and our state. The gratitude for that will be infinite.\u201dClinton supporters say concerns about Mr. Clinton\u2019s past behavior are unfair, given the numerous sexual assault allegations that have been leveraged against the current president.\u201cFrankly, everything is relative, so if people are upset with him in connection with the #MeToo movement all they have to do is look at Trump,\u201d said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe, who speaks regularly with Mr. Clinton.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.As she wrangled her toddler son across the room at the fund-raiser, Jennifer Hopkinson, 35, noted that she was surprised to hear a Little Rock mayoral candidate recently cite Mr. Clinton\u2019s life as an inspiration for his political career.\u201cI thought it was risky,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might sink his campaign right there.\u201dMark Baillie, 37, agreed, saying he didn\u2019t approve of Mr. Clinton\u2019s behavior but believed the allegations paled in comparison to the charges that have dogged Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s all relative,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople probably are just tired of hearing about Clinton around here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It cited strong growth and the continued decline of the unemployment rate.\u25a0 The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate remains between 2 percent and 2.25 percent.\u25a0 The Fed is expected to increase that range by a quarter percentage point at its next meeting, scheduled for Dec. 18 and 19.The seismic shift in the political landscape on Tuesday, as Democrats regained control of the House, is unlikely to matter much for the course of monetary policy. The economy continues to grow, and the Fed has made clear it plans to keep raising rates, slowly but steadily, well into next year.But this meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was a place holder: a chance for Fed officials to discuss the latest economic data. The Fed signaled in advance that it didn\u2019t plan to raise rates any sooner than December.By most measures, the American economy remains in good health. The economy continues to grow at what the Fed called a \u201cstrong rate,\u201d expanding at an annual pace of 3.5 percent in the third quarter. And employers added 250,000 jobs in October, dropping the unemployment rate to 3.7 percent.The economic assessment in the Fed\u2019s post-meeting policy statement contained only two changes from the Fed\u2019s last statement, in September. The Fed noted the decline in the unemployment rate. It also said that business fixed investment \u201cmoderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.\u201dThat leaves the Fed on course to raise rates at its final meeting of the year.To quote Bank of America\u2019s pre-meeting preview, \u201cSee you in December.\u201dThe Fed is currently raising its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point every quarter. At that pace, the rate will reach about 3 percent by the middle of next year. That is roughly the level the Fed regards as neutral, meaning it would neither stimulate nor discourage economic activity.Some Fed officials are already pressing for the Fed to raise the rate into restrictive territory, arguing that inflation is likely to rise if the central bank does not begin to step on the brakes. A smaller number of officials, however, argue the Fed is moving too quickly. Wage growth is just beginning to increase, raising concerns the Fed will slow the economy as workers are starting to reap real benefits.Mr. Powell has described the Fed\u2019s task as a balancing act. On the one hand, he wants to raise rates to keep inflation in check. On the other hand, he is not trying to slow economic growth \u2014 at least not yet.Mr. Trump\u2019s stated concern is that higher rates will slow economic growth. He also has expressed concern that higher rates will increase the federal government\u2019s borrowing costs.Mr. Powell\u2019s plan increases his opportunities to speak for the Fed and communicate the rationale behind its approach \u2014 and it increases the Fed\u2019s flexibility in determining the timing of future increases in the benchmark rate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How New York Times Journalists Took the Measure of China\u2019s Rising Power", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderQ. How did this project come together? Out of all that came some discussion that we should really try to do something that is set apart. Not a series of typical newspaper stories about this or that about China, but something that made more of a statement that we\u2019re in a different world now.We\u2019ve all, in the past generation, grown up with a sense that there is a single superpower in the world, the United States, and most of the issues have been defined as for or against American interests around the world, like radical Islamist terrorism. That\u2019s changing, and it\u2019s time to just pause and make a statement that it\u2019s changing.We spent a big part of the initial effort just gathering data, looking for some of the harder metrics on very broad issues like social mobility or export power or the size of the Chinese internet, to see whether that could help us make some broader statements. It was an attempt, rather than looking for the usual newsy development that allows us to say something broader in the middle of the story, to broaden from the start and tell this in a more explanatory way. So we really set out to put some bigger conclusions and data-driven analysis first, and then figure out the story.The tricky part is that, when you take on a big project like that early in 2018 and try to land it late in 2018, you don\u2019t know what the macro news environment is going to be. For all we knew at that time, we could be at war in the South China Sea, or on the Korean Peninsula, or Trump and Xi could become best friends and resolve the trade war. It kind of worked out, timing-wise, but we couldn\u2019t have known that.Is there anything surprising we\u2019ve learned about what kinds of China stories will pull people in? We tried something similar to this when I was an editor at The Atlantic seven or eight years ago, but it was hard to get people into it.It\u2019s still hard to get people into it. We have a giant investment in a really high-quality China staff, we translate a lot of things into Chinese, we have everyone from the science desk to Washington paying attention to it.The audience we have for this project is really a testament of the drawing power of The New York Times when we frame something well, present it well and promote it heavily \u2014 as opposed to there having been some unarticulated, deep desire for more China reporting that we\u2019d suddenly tapped into.It speaks to the role of the institution to pick a moment when people might not be pining for China coverage to say, \u201cActually, you should be paying attention to this.\u201d And it seems like they are.I hope so. I think that is a role that, ideally, from time to time, The New York Times can play. I think we play it pretty regularly on our big investigative efforts.It\u2019s not like people were saying, \u201cWhere\u2019s your story on Trump\u2019s family taxes?\u201d But when we deliver the story on Trump\u2019s family taxes, we create a moment around that and conversation around it. I think this is similar. You can\u2019t do it all the time, but when we pick our spots well, I think we can help focus the conversation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Men Who Want to Push Britain Off a Cliff", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheresa May has a Brexit deal. Now a group of feckless Conservatives wants to torpedo everything.Contributing Opinion WriterLONDON \u2014 I am scared. The markets are scared. The politicians I have been talking to are scared, or livid.A few days ago, Prime Minister Theresa May unveiled her deal with the European Union. Within 48 hours, Britain\u2019s government spun into crisis. Mrs. May\u2019s survival is threatened as furious prominent Brexiteers go public with their intention to unseat her. Four ministers have resigned, more resignations may follow and nobody believes that she has the votes to get her deal through Parliament. What happens after that is a conundrum.The cause of this paralysis is the hard-line Brexiteers, a frighteningly powerful cohort within Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party, a group that is heedless about economic damage to Britain in pursuit of a political goal.The first minister to resign was Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, a cold-eyed man in a hurry, a flintily ambitious Thatcherite. The bid to topple Mrs. May was initiated by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a vain, drawling member of Parliament, a financier who once campaigned alongside his nanny in a Mercedes and has built a career as a political rock star and possible leader on the back of such affectation. They join an earlier defector, the flailing, floppy-haired Boris Johnson, a man who is half-crazed by his repeated failure to become the Conservative Party\u2019s leader and who is desperate to grasp at his last chance, even if it means undermining the country.Everything is up in the air in Britain\u2019s tumultuous politics right now, but there is one certainty: There is no limit to the practical, economic and psychological damage these Brexiteers are prepared to inflict on the rest of us in the pursuit of their delusions or their demented desire for power.They savage Mrs. May\u2019s deal and offer no practical suggestions for anything else. This is an utter failure of responsibility. Yes, the prime minister\u2019s deal is pitiful, an awkward compromise that will hobble Britain\u2019s economy and diminish our power. But the truth is \u2014 and everyone knows this \u2014 there is no better, purer Brexit available without a permanent economic hit.If they were reasonable people, the pro-Brexit faction would now be shocked into facing reality. But they are not. These are the same politicians who tricked voters out of Europe by promising them that leaving would be all gain and no pain. Britain would become proud, sovereign, powerful, more prosperous. It could slash immigration, enrich its health service, cut magnificent and profitable trade deals with the rest of the world, opt out of European Union laws and still trade with and travel freely in Europe.Mrs. May finally managed some wriggling round the edges, reducing part of the huge and unavoidable economic penalties of Brexit by keeping Britain in the European Union Customs Union and parts of the single market. It is a valuable concession, and one the European Union has agreed to principally in order to not inflame sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland, which would otherwise have to rebuild a border with the Irish Republic. The price that must be paid for remaining in the market is that Britain agrees to faithfully track and follow its rules, while no longer having any voice in how they are made.These restrictions have sent the hard-line Brexiteers into a cold fury, but they were inevitable. You can\u2019t even join a tennis match if you insist on drawing your own courts and deciding your own scores. The Brexit fanatics blindly ignore that. They have learned nothing, acknowledged nothing.Rather than accepting their shameful role in deceiving voters over what was possible, they are doubling down on denunciation. They accuse Mrs. May of betrayal, of trapping and binding the country, of breaking her word. It is sheer selfish manipulation, political destructiveness on a huge scale, because they cannot get what they want; indeed, they cannot agree among themselves on what they want. They want the prime minister removed, but while they may secure the votes to challenge her, they\u2019re unlikely to get enough to unseat her.Even if they succeed in wounding her so deeply that she decides to step down and a hard-line Brexiteer takes her place, a new prime minister cannot negotiate a harder Brexit; the European Union has made it clear that the withdrawal deal is closed. If these craven politicians did find their way to power and tried to force a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit \u2014 leaving the European Union without any kind of agreement in place \u2014 Parliament and the country would revolt. Nearly four out of five voters thought Brexit was going badly this July. In some areas that voted Leave, there have been big swings toward staying in the European Union.In their grab for power, these monstrous, preening egos, desperate for validation and vindication, are already steering the Brexit process out of control, knocking Mrs. May\u2019s deal sideways, increasing the speed at which investors and businesses flee. This chaos could last weeks or months. But the group\u2019s ruthlessness in mowing down the middle ground of a compromise Brexit may give them whiplash. For members of Parliament, who must pass the final vote on any Brexit deal, the recent Brexiteer extremism has made their choices far starker and has raised the stakes.If Mrs. May\u2019s deal cannot get through Parliament, and the nightmare of a no-deal looms, then it becomes much more likely that a decisive number of members of Parliament will resolve that the final decision has to be returned to the electorate, in a second referendum that is being called the People\u2019s Vote. Last month, an estimated 700,000 people marched in London in support of such a referendum.These hard-liners are ruthless. They aren\u2019t prepared to accept a compromise that the prime minister has constructed for them. Instead, they are blowing it up. By eliminating the center option, they intend to push Britain to the hardest possible Brexit, toward the wrecked economy and shattered lives that would follow. They have destroyed any sense that I \u2014 and many others \u2014 had, that we owe it to them to honor and accept the original referendum. They are polarizing and galvanizing us. If no deal is the Brexiteers\u2019 preferred option, I can with a clear conscience campaign for Remain in a People\u2019s Vote. Anyone else could, too.It\u2019s just possible that the crash the Brexiteers are engineering could also be their own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Climate Report Warns of Damaged Environment and Shrinking Economy ", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A major scientific report issued by 13 federal agencies on Friday presents the starkest warnings to date of the consequences of climate change for the United States, predicting that if significant steps are not taken to rein in global warming, the damage will knock as much as 10 percent off the size of the American economy by century\u2019s end.\u201cThere is a bizarre contrast between this report, which is being released by this administration, and this administration\u2019s own policies,\u201d said Philip B. Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center.All told, the report says, climate change could slash up to a tenth of gross domestic product by 2100, more than double the losses of the Great Recession a decade ago.Scientists who worked on the report said it did not appear that administration officials had tried to alter or suppress its findings. However, several noted that the timing of its release, at 2 p.m. the day after Thanksgiving, appeared designed to minimize its public impact.Still, the report could become a powerful legal tool for opponents of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to dismantle climate change policy, experts said.\u201cThis report will weaken the Trump administration\u2019s legal case for undoing climate change regulations, and it strengthens the hands of those who go to court to fight them,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton.The results of the 2014 report helped inform the Obama administration as it wrote a set of landmark climate change regulations. The following year, the E.P.A. finalized President Barack Obama\u2019s signature climate change policy, known as the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to slash planet-warming emissions from coal-fired power plants. At the end of the 2015, Mr. Obama played a lead role in brokering the Paris Agreement.But in 2016, Republicans in general and Mr. Trump in particular campaigned against those regulations. In rallies before cheering coal miners, Mr. Trump vowed to end what he called Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal\u201d and to withdraw from the Paris deal. Since winning the election, his administration has moved decisively to roll back environmental regulations. The report puts the most precise price tags to date on the cost to the United States economy of projected climate impacts: $141 billion from heat-related deaths, $118 billion from sea level rise and $32 billion from infrastructure damage by the end of the century, among others.But the new report also emphasizes that the outcomes depend on how swiftly and decisively the United States and other countries take action to mitigate global warming. The authors put forth three main solutions: putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions, which usually means imposing taxes or fees on companies that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; establishing government regulations on how much greenhouse pollution can be emitted; and spending public money on clean-energy research.A White House statement said the report, which was started under the Obama administration, was \u201clargely based on the most extreme scenario\u201d of global warming and that the next assessment would provide an opportunity for greater balance. The report covers every region of the United States and asserts that recent climate-related events are signs of things to come. No area of the country will be untouched, from the Southwest, where droughts will curb hydropower and tax already limited water supplies, to Alaska, where the loss of sea ice will cause coastal flooding and erosion and force communities to relocate, to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where saltwater will taint drinking water.More people will die as heat waves become more common, the scientists say, and a hotter climate will also lead to more outbreaks of disease.Two areas of impact particularly stand out: trade and agriculture.Mr. Trump has put trade issues at the center of his economic agenda, placing new tariffs on imports and renegotiating trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. But climate change is likely to be a disruptive force in trade and manufacturing, the report says.Extreme weather events driven by global warming are \u201cvirtually certain to increasingly affect U.S. trade and economy, including import and export prices and businesses with overseas operations and supply chains,\u201d the report concludes.Such disasters will temporarily shutter factories both in the United States and abroad, causing price spikes for products from apples to automotive parts, the scientists predicted. So much of the supply chain for American companies is overseas that almost no industry will be immune from the effects of climate change at home or abroad, the report says.It cites as an example the extreme flooding in Thailand in 2011. Western Digital, an American company that produces 60 percent of its hard drives there, sustained $199 million in losses and halved its hard drive shipments in the last quarter of 2011. The shortages temporarily doubled hard drive prices, affecting other American companies like Apple, HP and Dell.American companies should expect many more such disruptions, the report says.\u201cClimate change is another risk to the strength of the U.S. trade position, and the U.S. ability to export,\u201d said Diana Liverman, a University of Arizona professor and co-author of the report. \u201cIt can affect U.S. products, and as it drives poverty abroad we can lose consumer markets.\u201dThe nation\u2019s farm belt is likely to be among the hardest-hit regions, and farmers in particular will see their bottom lines threatened.\u201cRising temperatures, extreme heat, drought, wildfire on rangelands and heavy downpours are expected to increasingly disrupt agricultural productivity in the U.S.,\u201d the report says. \u201cExpect increases in challenges to livestock health, declines in crop yields and quality and changes in extreme events in the United States and abroad.\u201dBy 2050, the scientists forecast, changes in rainfall and hotter temperatures will reduce the agricultural productivity of the Midwest to levels last seen in the 1980s.See how days at or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit have changed in your lifetime and how much hotter it could get.The risks, the report noted, depend on the ability of producers to adapt to changes.During the 2012 Midwestern drought, farmers who incorporated conservation practices fared better, said Robert Bonnie, a Rubenstein Fellow at Duke University who worked in the Agriculture Department during the Obama administration. But federal programs designed to help farmers cope with climate change have stalled because the farm bill, the primary legislation for agricultural subsidies, expired this fall.The report says the Midwest, as well as the Northeast, will also experience more flooding when it rains, like the 2011 Missouri River flood that inundated a nuclear power plant near Omaha, forcing it to shut down for years.Other parts of the country, including much of the Southwest, will endure worsening droughts, further taxing limited groundwater supplies. Those droughts can lead to fires, a phenomenon that played out this fall in California as the most destructive wildfire in state history killed dozens of people.The report predicts that frequent wildfires, long a plague of the Western United States, will also become more common in other regions, including the Southeast. The 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, which killed 14 people and burned more than 17,000 acres in Tennessee, may have been just the beginning. But unlike in the West, \u201cin the Southeast, they have no experience with an annual dangerous fire season, or at least very little,\u201d said Andrew Light, a co-author of the report and a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.Climate change is taking the United States into uncharted territory, the report concludes. \u201cThe assumption that current and future climate conditions will resemble the recent past is no longer valid,\u201d it says.There is always some uncertainty in climate projections, but scientists\u2019 estimates about the effects of global warming to date have largely been borne out. The variable going forward, the report says, is the amount of carbon emissions humans produce.Coral Davenport reported from Washington, and Kendra Pierre-Louis from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What 52,000 Percent Inflation Can Do to a Country", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyI walked into the empty restaurant in Managua carrying a backpack stuffed with cash, thick stacks of Nicaraguan c\u00f3rdobas bound by rubber bands. The waiter, as expected, asked me to hand over the entire stash. It may have looked like an illicit transaction. But this was Nicaragua, in 1990, at the end of its war with the American-trained contra rebels, and I was only trying to buy a meal before my money lost its value. A decade of guerrilla war and deficit spending had whipped up a maelstrom of hyperinflation and shortages. Only two items on the menu were available, and prices had doubled in a matter of weeks. With inflation surging past 13,000 percent annually, the restaurant now demanded payment upfront \u2014 to ensure that the staff had enough time to tally it. As I ate my rice and beans, two waiters at another table counted every bill. I finished before they did, even though the meal \u2014 and all those millions of c\u00f3rdobas \u2014 added up to less than $10.Hyperinflation is a mercurial phenomenon, a rupture that occurs when a government persistently spends (or prints) money that it doesn\u2019t have, and the public loses confidence in the process. The distortions that emerge \u2014 like the backpack full of soon-to-be-worthless cash \u2014 can seem absurd, even laughable. Yet there is nothing amusing about the damage that hyperinflation can inflict on the lives of people and nations. \u201cIf you can\u2019t trust the money the government issues, then you can\u2019t trust anything,\u201d says Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and a leading expert on hyperinflation (which he has defined as 50 percent monthly inflation sustained for at least 30 days). Hanke has studied the 58 cases of hyperinflation that have been recorded, from Germany\u2019s Weimar Republic to the episode I witnessed in Nicaragua, each one an earthquake that caused people to lose faith in the very foundation \u2014 the value of money \u2014 on which their lives depended.The newest addition to the ignominious list, and a cause for alarm in Washington, is the crisis in Venezuela. Even with the world\u2019s most-abundant oil fields, Venezuela has mismanaged its way to economic disaster. Hyperinflation and its common companion, chronic shortages of food and medicine, have impoverished almost all of the country\u2019s 31 million people. Nine out of 10 Venezuelans do not earn enough money to buy sufficient food, according to a recent survey. Over all, Venezuelans have lost an average of 24 pounds each. Malaria is on the rise, as is crime. Those who can are getting out: More than 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country, including more than half of the nation\u2019s doctors.The situation is still out of control. Venezuela\u2019s economy shrank by 35 percent between 2013 and 2017, and economists forecast another 18 percent drop in 2018. Oil production, crippled by the lack of maintenance and investment, fell in July to its lowest point in nearly seven decades. According to Hanke, the rate of inflation over the last 12 months was 52,000 percent. The chaos poses a risk for the entire region. \u201cVenezuela has sparked the most serious economic, humanitarian and political crisis in the Americas in decades,\u201d says the Brazilian economist Monica de Bolle, the director of Latin American studies at the Johns Hopkins University School for Advanced International Studies. \u201cThere has never been a crisis quite like this in the region, and we\u2019ve had plenty.\u201dLenin\u2019s dark musings seemed almost prophetic in the jittery aftermath of World War I. Weimar Germany had gambled, badly, in financing its losing war effort with borrowed funds. Buried in debt and forced, in 1921, to pay reparations to the victorious Allies, Germany printed bank notes and ignited the most infamous bout of hyperinflation. By late 1923, prices were doubling roughly every three and a half days, and at one point a single American dollar was worth 6.7 trillion German marks. An even more severe hyperinflation followed the end of World War II, when Hungary printed notes of ever-higher value to finance its recovery. The fastest-ever recorded hyperinflation resulted: At its peak in July 1946, prices doubled every 15 hours.War has often played a catalytic role in hyperinflation, but it rarely acts alone. In the early 1990s, the phenomenon stalked countries in Eastern Europe (Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Armenia) that were confronting wars and the fall of the Soviet Union. A decade later in Zimbabwe, despite a long slide in agricultural output, Robert Mugabe\u2019s regime printed money to pay the bloated bureaucracy and to line its own pockets. By the time Mugabe declared inflation illegal in 2007, people had lost belief in their currency. Within a year, inflation shot up to 79.6 billion percent, so high that even the government\u2019s $100 trillion bills became useless souvenirs soon after they were printed.Hyperinflation is not, as some might assume, just inflation gone bad. It\u2019s a different beast altogether, driven by politics and psychology as much as economics. A government\u2019s decision to continue spending (or printing money) far beyond its means is political, whether done to finance war, win an election or assuage its populace. Such monetary incontinence, unchecked, leads to a spiral of food shortages, price hikes and currency devaluations. Those hit hardest are not the rich (whose wealth is in property, stocks and commodities) but the middle class, which depends on local-currency salaries, savings and pensions whose value is siphoned off by hyperinflation.Venezuela now finds itself isolated, like a virus contained. In 1990, three South American countries \u2014 Peru, Argentina and Brazil \u2014 were in the throes of hyperinflation. Venezuela\u2019s case doesn\u2019t look contagious, but it could still have destabilizing impacts on the region. The millions of refugees flooding into neighboring countries are already sparking a backlash. In Brazil, where army troops have been deployed to control the border, the presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro has used the Venezuelan migrants to fuel his Trump-like anti-immigrant campaign \u2014 and warn against leftist populism.Maduro has made only halfhearted efforts at reform. In August, he lopped five zeros off the bol\u00edvar and introduced a new currency tied to the \u201cpetro\u201d cryptocurrency. The move has had no impact, in part because the petro isn\u2019t traded. But there has been one unexpected result: As people turn to credit cards or bank transfers for even small transactions, Venezuela has accidentally become a nearly cashless society.Normally, a country facing insolvency would turn to the I.M.F. for a bailout. But Venezuela broke off relations with the I.M.F. in 2007 and has turned to China instead. For the past decade, China has kept Maduro\u2019s bankrupt regime afloat with more than $50 billion in loans. In September, Maduro traveled to Beijing and received several billion dollars more of credit to boost oil production and double oil exports to China. \u201cWe are taking the first steps into a new economic era,\u201d he said.A new era isn\u2019t likely to begin as long as Maduro remains in power. He has shown no interest in taking steps that might restore economic balance, like cutting spending and tying the bol\u00edvar to a solid foreign currency. Washington murmurs about regime change. But the biggest threat to Maduro now may be a series of civil cases in American courts against Citgo. The Venezuela-owned company is the regime\u2019s biggest generator of hard currency, the only asset creditors can go after. If these cases succeed in claiming damages for being nationalized by the Ch\u00e1vez regime, Maduro\u2019s main lifeline could be cut off. \u201cIf the money disappears,\u201d de Bolle says, \u201cso does his support, and the regime crumbles.\u201d Only then, it seems, will Venezuelans be able to escape a nightmare in which they can\u2019t trust the money in their hands.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "As U.S. Sanctions on Iran Kick In, Europe Looks for a Workaround", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Europeans consider the 2015 Iran nuclear deal crucial to their national interests, and say they intend to keep honoring it. But to date, they have not managed to put in place a mechanism for sidestepping the sanctions without antagonizing the Trump administration.European Union members including Britain, France and Germany have said they will continue to abide by the nuclear deal, as have China and Russia. They are trying to keep Iran in compliance, too, by countering the American economic sanctions.So far, however, no European country has agreed to host the vehicle, for fear of American retaliation.\u201cWe remain committed to implementing\u201d the nuclear deal \u201cas a matter of respecting international agreements and of our shared international security, and expect Iran to play a constructive role in this regard,\u201d the statement said.Realistically, European officials say, they may be able to preserve only 20 percent to 30 percent of existing trade with Iran, given that large European companies with ties to the United States have already pulled out of Iran or are in the process of doing so to avoid the sanctions. Stefano Stefanini, a consultant and former Italian diplomat based in Brussels, said that the European officials think 40 percent would be optimistic.Of all the issues between Europe and the Trump administration, Iran has become the most divisive. The Europeans are actively working against United States policy, which effectively puts them in league with Russia, China and Iran.\u201cIt is a huge strain in the trans-Atlantic relationship,\u201d Mr. Stefanini said.If the Europeans manage to create \u201ca small breach in the hold that the U.S. has on international financial transactions, that could be replicated,\u201d he said. And if they fail, he said, \u201cit will be another big grievance with Washington, creating another minefield.\u201dSo far, European unity is holding, but there are worries among some European officials that Britain may not remain so firm in the face of a Washington that wants to give little quarter to Iran.Russia, which has less exposure to American sanctions and is allied with Iran in Syria, has said that it will continue to buy and trade oil and gas from Iran \u2014 much of which they then sell to other countries.And Washington has also granted waivers to eight countries, including Turkey and China, to continue to buy Iranian energy, but only, Washington says, to keep the oil market stable. Those waivers are not permanent.Iran has been willing to remain in the agreement and has promoted European support for it at home, despite the increasing economic pain of the sanctions.\u201cIran will have patience for another five or six months, but the streets matter,\u201d said Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations, referring to Iranian public opinion and public demonstrations.At the same time, the assassination attempts in Denmark and France \u201cwon\u2019t mean that the Europeans will pull the plug on the deal,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it definitely dampens the attitude to go farther on economic easing.\u201dMs. O recently returned from Iran and said the mood there was defiant and wary. \u201cThere is a general sense of despair among interlocutors,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s more and more difficult for them to support engagement with the West.\u201dMr. Trump has said that his main aim is to force Iranian leaders into negotiations that would include restrictions on their missiles and their support for regional allies. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the sanctions are meant to make Iran choose: \u201cEither fight to keep its economy off life support at home or keep squandering precious wealth on fights abroad. It won\u2019t have the resources to do both.\u201dSpeaking on Fox News on Sunday, Mr. Pompeo said that Mr. Trump was \u201cputting the world on notice that the terror regime which threatens Israel through Iranian funding of Lebanese Hezbollah, that the terror regime that attempted to conduct an assassination in Denmark over that past few weeks, that the terror regime that continues to fund Houthis launching missiles into Riyadh and into Dubai, that\u2019s going to stop.\u201d\u201cThat behavior must change,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, \u201cand sanctions of the United States will be reimposed at midnight tonight.\u201d\u201cThe extent to which the Islamic republic feels threatened or senses opportunity in its neighborhood largely defines its conduct,\u201d the report said. \u201cMeasured against that standard, the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policy is likelier to spur Iran\u2019s regional activism than to curb it.\u201dIn the meantime, European and Iranian officials are watching the midterm elections in the United States, as is the rest of the world, and trying to gauge how likely Mr. Trump is to be re-elected in two years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yemen Girl Who Turned World\u2019s Eyes to Famine Is Dead", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 A haunted look in the eyes of Amal Hussain, an emaciated 7-year-old lying silently on a hospital bed in northern Yemen, seemed to sum up the dire circumstances of her war-torn country.A searing portrait of the starving girl published in The New York Times last week drew an impassioned response from readers. They expressed heartbreak. They offered money for her family. They wrote in to ask if she was getting better.On Thursday, Amal\u2019s family said she had died at a ragged refugee camp four miles from the hospital.\u201cMy heart is broken,\u201d said her mother, Mariam Ali, who wept during a phone interview. \u201cAmal was always smiling. Now I\u2019m worried for my other children.\u201dThe Khashoggi killing has cast light on Saudi tactics in Yemen, where an economic war has pushed millions to the brink of starvation.The grievous human cost of the Saudi-led war in Yemen has jumped to the top of the global agenda as the outcry over the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi prompts Western leaders to re-examine their support for the war.Recently, the United States and Britain, Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest arms suppliers, called for a cease-fire in Yemen. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it should take effect within 30 days. \u201cWe have got to move toward a peace effort here, and we can\u2019t say we are going to do it some time in the future,\u201d Mr. Mattis said on Tuesday.Riveting images of malnourished Yemenis like Amal \u2014 one of 1.8 million severely malnourished children in Yemen \u2014 have put a human face to fears that a catastrophic man-made famine could engulf the country in the coming months.The United Nations warns that the number of Yemenis relying on emergency rations, eight million, could soon rise to 14 million. That\u2019s about half Yemen\u2019s population.Aid workers and now political leaders are calling for a cessation of hostilities, as well as emergency measures to revive the battered economy of Yemen, where soaring food prices have pushed millions to the brink.On a trip to Yemen to see the toll the war has taken, we found Amal at a health center in Aslam, 90 miles northwest of the capital, Sana. She was lying on a bed with her mother. Nurses fed her every two hours with milk, but she was vomiting regularly and suffered from diarrhea.Dr. Mekkia Mahdi, the doctor in charge, sat by her bed, stroking her hair. She tugged on the flaccid skin of Amal\u2019s stick-like arms. \u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cNo meat. Only bones.\u201dAmal\u2019s mother was also sick, recovering from a bout of dengue fever that she had most likely contracted from mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water in their camp.Saudi airstrikes had forced Amal\u2019s family to flee their home in the mountains three years ago. The family was originally from Saada, a province on the border with Saudi Arabia that has borne the brunt of at least 18,000 Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen since 2015. Saada is also the homeland of the Houthi rebels who control northern Yemen, and are seen by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, as a proxy for rival Iran.The geopolitics of the war seemed distant, however, in the hushed hunger wards in Aslam.Amal is Arabic for \u201chope,\u201d and some readers expressed hope that the graphic image of her distress could help galvanize attention on a war in which tens of thousands of civilians have died from violence, hunger or disease. Last year, Yemen suffered the largest cholera epidemic in modern times, with over a million cases.The Khashoggi crisis has called attention to a largely overlooked Saudi-led war in Yemen. On a rare trip to the front line, we found Yemenis fighting and dying in a war that has gone nowhere.Amal was discharged from the hospital in Aslam last week, still sick. But doctors needed to make room for new patients, Dr. Mahdi said. \u201cThis was a displaced child who suffered from disease and displacement,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have many more cases like her.\u201dThe family took Amal back home, to a hut fashioned from straw and plastic sheeting, at a camp where relief agencies do provide some help, including sugar and rice. But it was not enough to save Amal.Her condition deteriorated, with frequent bouts of vomiting and diarrhea, her mother said. On Oct. 26, three days after she was discharged from the hospital, she died.Dr. Mahdi had urged Amal\u2019s mother to take the child to a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Abs, about 15 miles away.But the family was broke. Fuel prices have risen about 50 percent in the past year, part of a broader economic collapse, and that has pushed even short, potentially lifesaving journeys beyond the reach of many families.\u201cI had no money to take her to the hospital,\u201d Ms. Ali said. \u201cSo I took her home.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshReporting was contributed by Fuad Shaif al Kadas in Sana and Saeed Al-Batati in Al Mukalla, Yemen.Advertisement"}

As more airlines try to squeeze more passengers onto their planes \u2014 and then squeeze more money out of those passengers by charging for things that used to be free (like checked baggage and onboard snacks) \u2014 passengers are increasingly looking for, and willing to pay for, a better travel experience. To answer that demand, many airlines are turning to a new class of service: premium economy. Around 20 airlines, most of which are based abroad, currently offer dedicated premium economy cabins on long-haul routes. More carriers are set to introduce them in the coming years. On airlines from American to Qantas, premium economy offers travelers bigger seats and improved amenities for a price that is somewhere between regular economy and business class.

{"Headline": "\u2018It Could Happen,\u2019 Trump Says of Democratic House Takeover: 4 Days to Go", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWelcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters.President Trump, at the rally Friday afternoon in West Virginia, acknowledged four days before the midterm election that Republicans could lose the House.\u201cIt could happen, could happen. We\u2019re doing very well, and we\u2019re doing really well in the Senate, but could happen,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the face of an intense Democratic campaign effort to overcome the G.O.P.\u2019s 23-seat majority in the House.\u201cAnd you know what you do? My whole life, you know what I say? \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll just figure it out,\u2019\u201d he said.A few observations:\u2022 Republican officials have been worrying for months about dozens of party-held House seats where incumbents retired or Democrats fielded strong candidates, but Mr. Trump has mostly projected optimism \u2014 in part because he has endorsed so many of the Republican House candidates who are now in tough races.\u2022 His self-made image as a party kingmaker is very much on the line on Tuesday.\u2022 Mr. Trump has his next rally Friday evening in Indianapolis. We\u2019ll see if he changes his tune to a more upbeat note.One of the hottest topics as we enter the final weekend before the midterms is the state of the Senate race in Texas:\u2022 Does Senator Ted Cruz really enjoy a comfortable lead over Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke?\u2022 Or are the polls not accounting for a surge in turnout, especially among millennials and first-time voters?Internal Republican polling indicates that Mr. Cruz is ahead by about 8 or 9 points, depending on the survey. Those polls, according to G.O.P. officials, are assuming a turnout of just over six million voters.That would be a sizable turnout for a midterm election. In 2014, when Greg Abbott, the Republican nominee for governor, defeated Wendy Davis, slightly more than 4.7 million voters went to the polls. By contrast, in the 2016 presidential election, just under nine million Texans cast ballots.Public polls and Democratic surveys have showed a tighter race \u2014 a Quinnipiac poll taken last week showed Mr. Cruz leading by 5 points \u2014 and many Democrats believe that Mr. O\u2019Rourke can narrow the gap.What may determine the ultimate margin is, yes, turnout. Will the total number of voters be closer to the 2016 election or the last midterms? If it\u2019s a big number, the thinking goes, it\u2019s a boost for Mr. O\u2019Rourke.It was a split-screen moment in Texas on Thursday afternoon.As President Trump, at the White House, warned of an immigration \u201ccrisis,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke described a different reality during a campaign event less than two miles from the southern border.\u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time for us to be alive, to be from Texas and to be from the U.S.-Mexico border,\u201d he told several hundred supporters at a rally in Brownsville, Tex. Mr. O\u2019Rourke spoke as troops dispatched by Mr. Trump began arriving on the border.Though he has shied away from negative attacks, rarely mentioning the president by name, Mr. O\u2019Rourke dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s recent moves on immigration as scare tactics.\u201cThis desire to stir paranoia and fear on the part of the American public is a political ploy, five days away from the deciding election of our lifetime,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said.President Trump has been using one word a lot lately: \u201cmomentum.\u201dRepublicans had it, he has argued, but lost it a bit in recent days. At a rally in Missouri on Thursday, he offered a cause: mail bombs and the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.\u201cWe did have two maniacs stop a momentum that was incredible because for seven days nobody talked about the elections,\u201d he said, applying a level of executive punditry rarely seen from past presidents so soon after national tragedies. \u201cIt stopped a tremendous momentum.\u201dMr. Trump quickly acknowledged the horror \u2014 \u201cwe don\u2019t care about momentum when it comes to a disgrace like just happened to our country,\u201d he said \u2014 before returning to his core point, in case anyone missed it: \u201cBut it did nevertheless stop a certain momentum.

{"Headline": "Markets Are Revealing the Sum of All Risks ", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s not a main reason for the sell-off, but a widening sense of unease that several types of problems are rising at once. The most telling thing about the pummeling that the stock market has taken recently, and especially this week, is that there\u2019s no simple single cause to point to.That reflects the fundamental economic risk for 2019 and beyond. There isn\u2019t a lone caution on the horizon that can be identified and monitored and that policymakers can respond to.Rather, markets reflect a widening sense of unease that several different types of risks are rising at once \u2014 and that although any one of them might be manageable, together they could lead the economy into serious trouble in 2019 or 2020.And while stocks are down 9.5 percent since early October, the yield on longer-term Treasury bonds is at about the same level. The bond market tends to be more closely tethered to the direction of the overall economy than stocks, so that suggests investors in recent weeks have not radically reshaped their view on future growth.But when you tick through the list of fears causing the sell-off, it\u2019s easy to see why stock investors in particular are getting jittery, driving steep market drops Monday and Tuesday.The giant tech companies that have propelled the market for years are facing risks of slowing growth (especially Apple) and new regulation (especially Facebook). Oil prices are plummeting, sending the share prices of energy companies downward. Investors are starting to worry that companies with heavy debt loads could struggle to handle them, with General Electric as Exhibit A. The trade war, long at a steady simmer, could boil over at any time.But before running for the hills in panic, there are a few things worth considering. First, bad things happen all the time in the economy, and in markets. Usually, the damage is localized to the industries directly affected.Bondholders and credit ratings agencies lost confidence in those industrial icons\u2019 corporate debt, causing plenty of pain for the automakers\u2019 employees and stock prices. But the overall economy kept humming along. (It was a recession rooted in other sectors, three years later, that dragged American automakers toward bankruptcy.)Similarly, it\u2019s easy to look at the slowdown in home sales and building activity, for example, and fear that it could lead to a repeat of the 2008 recession.But in that episode, housing starts peaked in January 2006. For nearly two years, the economy largely held up; as housing contracted, other sectors grew. It was only after the housing downturn triggered a financial crisis that a recession began in December 2007.In terms of a slowing global economy, in 1998 an emerging markets crisis seemed to endanger a booming American economy enough that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates late that year to try to guard against damage. As it turned out, 1999 was a boom year.What these episodes all show is that adjustments \u2014 whether in the credit markets, the housing market or emerging markets \u2014 tend to cause huge economic disruption only if there are compounding factors, or inadequate policy responses.The implicit message: If all of these negative forces really do start to harm growth, the Fed will slow the pace of rate increases, rather than stick to some preordained path.The great fear for the economy in the next couple of years shouldn\u2019t be the risks we know about. It is that those risks will materialize and interact in unpredictable ways, and together cause damage that none of them alone could. And if that happens, the last few weeks will look like a crucial moment when it began.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Real China Challenge: Managing Its Decline", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThose whom the gods wish to destroy, they first tout as countries of the future.Opinion ColumnistIn 2009, The Economist wrote about an up-and-coming global power: Brazil. Its economy, the magazine suggested, would soon overtake that of France or the U.K. as the world\u2019s fifth largest. S\u00e3o Paulo would be the world\u2019s fifth-richest city. Vast new reserves of offshore oil would provide an added boost, complemented by the country\u2019s robust and sophisticated manufacturing sector.The rocket never reached orbit. Brazil\u2019s economy is now limping its way out of the worst recession in its history. The murder rate \u2014 175 people per day in 2017 \u2014 is at a record high. One former president is in jail, another was impeached. The incoming president is an admirer of the country\u2019s old military dictatorship, only he thinks it should have killed the people it tortured.Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first tout as countries of the future.Why should current clich\u00e9s regarding China\u2019s supposed rise be any different?One answer suggested by The Times\u2019s series is that Beijing has ignored orthodox economic nostrums about the need for ever-greater market liberalization and fewer state controls while still managing to thrive. There\u2019s something to that. Quantity has a quality all its own, goes the saying, and Beijing can supply quantity like no other country save for India.Tyrannies do not work in the long run. But they do know how to make people work in the short term.Maybe that\u2019s because individual rights, democratic choices, rule of law, competitive markets, high levels of transparency, low levels of government corruption, independent news sources, and freedoms of thought, conscience and speech are assets beyond price \u2014ones that Westerners tend to value too lightly while foolishly assuming others do as well. If you define power as the power to attract and not simply compel, then Beijing \u2014 with its dystopian vision to fully surveil and rate all citizens by 2020 \u2014 isn\u2019t a rising power at all. It\u2019s a collapsing one.All this may seem an excessively glum take. What about the skyscrapers of Guangzhou? What about the world-beating test scores of students in Shanghai? What about the hundreds of millions brought out of subsistence living and raised to, or above, the middle class?China\u2019s rise is not some kind of mirage. But what matters is the future, not the past, and whether a nation built on constraining the freedoms granted to ordinary people can outpace, outsmart, and outlast another nation built on defending and broadening those freedoms. On current evidence, that seems utterly doubtful.American policymakers and pundits often talk about the challenge of managing China\u2019s rise. They had better start thinking instead of the challenge of managing its decline, beginning at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires this weekend. Japan and Europe went gently into eclipse, and the Soviet Union surrendered without a fight (at least until its current revanchist phase).Will China\u2019s current leadership accept the possibility of their own decline so philosophically, after having convinced themselves of their rapid rise to primacy? Nobody should bet on it. A wounded tiger is rarely a placid one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Long Struggle for America\u2019s Soul", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApparently, the self-evident truth that all people deserve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is far from settled.Mr. Delbanco writes about American culture in the 19th century.Like many Americans, I\u2019ve been following events at our southern border \u2014 the separation of children from their parents; the president\u2019s denigration of nonwhite migrants as criminals, rapists and animals; his bluster about denying birthright citizenship to their children; and his pledge to send federal troops to intercept a dwindling caravan of frantic refugees.To my ears, it all sounds eerily familiar. This is not the first time America has been torn apart over how to respond to people of color desperate to escape inhuman conditions. Nor is it the first time a president has threatened to deploy federal troops to return them to the horrors from which they fled.I\u2019m thinking, of course, of African-Americans, who were regarded for much of American history not as human beings but as a species of animate property no different from cattle and sheep. Their circumstances under slavery were certainly different from those of illegal immigrants today. For one thing, the authorities in their \u201chomeland,\u201d the American South, wanted to keep them rather than lose them. Slave owners worked hard to prevent their slaves from running away. South Carolina adopted its first \u201cAct to Prevent Runaways\u201d as early as 1683. A hundred years later, Georgia established a nightly slave patrol in its main port city that came to be known as the \u201cSavannah Watch.\u201d In the waning years of British rule, colonial officials favored draining wetlands in order to prevent \u201cdeserting slaves and wild beasts\u201d from finding shelter in the swamps.Yet despite such efforts, when delegates from the former British colonies convened at Philadelphia in 1787, the problem of runaway slaves posed a serious threat to the project of creating a new nation. If a durable union was to be forged between the South, where slavery was the bedrock of economy and culture, and the North, where it appeared headed toward extinction, slaves running for freedom across America\u2019s internal border would have to be stopped. In Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, the founding fathers attempted to stop them:No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, delegate from South Carolina, exulted that \u201cwe have obtained a right to recover our slaves in whatever part of America they may take refuge, which is a right we had not before.\u201dPinckney spoke too soon. Stating the principle proved much easier than carrying it out \u2014 just as chanting \u201cBuild the Wall!\u201d has proved easier than building it. From the Southern point of view, citizens in any state, Northern or Southern, were obliged to return runaways just as they would be obliged to return stray livestock or stolen cash. But as the nation expanded westward, the boundary between slavery and freedom became longer and more porous. Northern states put up barriers to enforcement, including \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d laws guaranteeing jury trials for fugitives and prohibiting state officials from assisting in returning them to the South.Slave owners tried to cut off the problem at the source. Shoes \u2014 issued to field slaves to prevent foot injuries that could sideline them from work \u2014 were collected at night to discourage slaves from taking flight. From Georgia and the Carolinas to Virginia and Tennessee, runaways resisting arrest could be killed with impunity \u2014 and the only witness might be the killer himself.Under such conditions, most fugitives never made it very far. Some were mutilated \u2014 tendons cut, faces branded \u2014 as warnings not to try again, and to others not to try at all. Still, they kept on trying, just as in our own time the immigrants keep on coming. In 1841, when Charles Dickens came to the United States on a lecture tour, he was amazed by newspaper notices, \u201ccoolly read in families\u201d as \u201ca part of the current news and small-talk,\u201d offering rewards for returning runaways:Ran away, a negro woman and two children. A few days before she went off, I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face. I tried to make the letter \u201cM.\u201dBy the 1840s, despite all measures to contain them, the flow of runaways had made the fugitive slave problem, in the words of Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, \u201cthe gravest and most vital of all questions, to us and the whole Union\u201d \u2014 so grave that calls for secession arose throughout the South.In an effort to blunt the rising sentiment for disunion, Congress tried to solve the problem once and for all by shifting enforcement responsibility from the states to the federal government. In August of 1850, it passed a bill \u201cto provide for the more effectual execution of the third clause of the second section fourth article of the Constitution of the United States\u201d \u2014 known ever since as the Fugitive Slave Act. In September, President Millard Fillmore signed it into law.It was a law without mercy. To accused fugitives arrested under its authority, it denied the most basic right enshrined in the Anglo-American legal tradition: habeas corpus \u2014 the right to challenge, in open court, the legality of their detention. It forbade them to testify in their own defense. It ruled out trial by jury. Except for proof of freedom, such as emancipation papers signed by a former owner, it disallowed all forms of exonerating evidence, including evidence of beatings or rape while the defendant had been enslaved. It criminalized the act of sheltering a fugitive and required local authorities to assist the claimant in recovering his lost human property. It put the power of extradition in the hands of \u201ccommissioners\u201d appointed by the federal government and limited the disputed issue to confirming the identity of the person who had tried to flee to freedom. If the accused could be shown to have belonged to the claimant according to the laws of the state from which she had fled, she was ordered back to captivity.In early 1851, in concert with white abolitionists, free black people began to organize resistance. In Boston, slave catchers seized a young man known as Shadrach who had escaped a few weeks earlier from slavery in Norfolk, Va., and found work in a Beacon Hill coffeehouse. While serving breakfast, he was seized with his waiter\u2019s apron still on and taken to the nearby courthouse. As news of the arrest spread, a mostly black and angry crowd gathered in Court Square.Led by Lewis Hayden, a fugitive from Kentucky, a group of men rushed the courtroom and hustled Shadrach into the crowd outside, which, like a \u201cblack squall\u201d (the words of the white antislavery attorney Richard Henry Dana), swirled around him. Whisked from Boston to Cambridge, then through Concord, Leominster and Fitchburg, he eventually made it to Canada. Theodore Parker, a white clergyman who became known as \u201cMinister at Large for Fugitive Slaves,\u201d declared that \u201cif I were a fugitive and could escape in no other way, I would kill [the slave catcher] with as little compunction as I would drive a mosquito from my face.\u201dParker proved prophetic. In Lancaster County, Pa., a Maryland slave owner who tried to force a fugitive to return with him to Maryland was shot and killed by a local black man. In Syracuse, a biracial crowd attacked a police station where an accused fugitive was being held. Armed with clubs, axes, and a battering ram, they smashed into the building and spirited away the prisoner, who, like Shadrach, found refuge in Canada. In Milwaukee, a fugitive named Joshua Glover, who had escaped from St. Louis, was held in jail until, as one his rescuers later remembered, \u201ctwenty strong and resolute men seized a large timber some eight or ten inches square and twenty feet long and went for the jail door; bumb, bumb, bumb, and down came the jail door and out came Glover.\u201dThese events took place, of course, in a world vastly different from our own. In the United States of 1850, more than three million black people were still legally enslaved within the country\u2019s own borders. Politicians \u2014 even those with qualms about slavery \u2014 did not hesitate to express frank racist contempt for African-Americans, and if called out for doing so, they did not deny it. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who favored gradual emancipation, denounced Shadrach\u2019s rescue by black Bostonians as an outrage perpetrated \u201cby African descendants; by people who possess no part\u201d in \u201cour political system.\u201d The chief justice of the United States, Roger Taney, declared that blacks \u201chave no rights which the white man was bound to respect.\u201dThere is an aphorism attributed to Mark Twain (though no evidence exists that he ever said it) that while history does not repeat itself, it does rhyme. The story of the fugitive slave crisis is a rhyming story filled with echoes in our own time.For one thing, Boston; New Bedford, Mass.; Syracuse; Cincinnati; and Rochester, among other places, became \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d where the domestic illegal immigrants of their day sought safe haven. The left, which had once decried the principle of states\u2019 rights, began to see the federal government as an evil force controlled by the right. Black people feared the sight of law enforcement officers in the streets. For large sectors of the public, the legitimacy of Congress and the courts collapsed. Politics became radically polarized. The leading intellectual of the North, Ralph Waldo Emerson, reacted with horror at the thought that a man \u201cwho has run the gauntlet of a thousand miles for his freedom\u201d must now, by law, be hunted down and sent \u201cback again to the dog-hutch he fled from.\u201d Meanwhile, a leading newspaper in the South, the Georgia Citizen, declared it past time to send \u201ca naval and military force\u201d sufficient \u201cto batter down the walls of Boston and lay it in utter ruin\u201d as reward for its sedition.But the strongest \u201crhyme\u201d between fugitive slaves in the 19th century and illegal immigrants today is their shared anguish \u2014 the \u201cdegenerating sense of nobodiness,\u201d in the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s devastating phrase \u2014 inflicted by a society that treats them as non-persons. People demeaned in this way forced Americans then, and force us now, to confront the central question of our history: Who is \u2014 or isn\u2019t \u2014 recognized as fully human? Our Declaration of Independence was supposed to answer this question with the proposition that \u201call men are created equal\u201d and \u201cendowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,\u201d including \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201dAt certain decisive moments in our history, attempts have been made to extend this principle beyond the cadre of the propertied white males who first articulated it. In 1854, as the crisis over slavery deepened, Abraham Lincoln called upon America to \u201creadopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it.\u201d By destroying slavery, the Civil War brought what he called a \u201cnew birth of freedom\u201d for black Americans. The postwar constitutional amendments sought to guarantee the rights of citizenship \u2014 notably the right to vote \u2014 to all American men, including former slaves and naturalized immigrants. The New Deal tried to protect vulnerable citizens from the destructive effects of dynamic capitalism. The Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and \u201960s tried to dismantle the legacy of slavery in the form of Jim Crow.But if we\u2019ve learned anything in the age of Trump, it\u2019s that rights can also be constricted and rescinded. The self-evident truth that all people deserve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is a long way from settled in the American mind. The question of who is considered fully human has returned with a vengeance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Be Afraid of Economic \u2018Bigness.\u2019 Be Very Afraid.", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the 1930s it contributed to the rise of fascism. Alarmingly, we are experimenting again with a monopolized economy.Mr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust.In the aftermath of the Second World War, an urgent question presented itself: How can we prevent the rise of fascism from happening again? If over the years that question became one of mostly historical interest, it has again become pressing, with the growing success of populist, nationalist and even neofascist movements all around the world.Common answers to the question stress the importance of a free press, the rule of law, stable government, robust civic institutions and common decency. But as undoubtedly important as these factors are, we too often overlook something else: the threat to democracy posed by monopoly and excessive corporate concentration \u2014 what the Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201d We must not forget the economic origins of fascism, lest we risk repeating the most calamitous error of the 20th century.It is a story that should sound uncomfortably familiar: An economic crisis yields widespread economic suffering, feeding an appetite for a nationalistic and extremist leader. The leader rides to power promising a return to national greatness, deliverance from economic suffering and the defeat of enemies foreign and domestic (including big business). Yet in reality, the leader seeks alliances with large enterprises and the great monopolies, so long as they obey him, for each has something the other wants: He gets their loyalty, and they avoid democratic accountability.There are many differences between the situation in 1930s and our predicament today. But given what we know, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that we are conducting a dangerous economic and political experiment: We have chosen to weaken the laws \u2014 the antitrust laws \u2014 that are meant to resist the concentration of economic power in the United States and around the world.From a political perspective, we have recklessly chosen to tolerate global monopolies and oligopolies in finance, media, airlines, telecommunications and elsewhere, to say nothing of the growing size and power of the major technology platforms. In doing so, we have cast aside the safeguards that were supposed to protect democracy against a dangerous marriage of private and public power.Unfortunately, there are abundant signs that we are suffering the consequences, both in the United States and elsewhere. There is a reason that extremist, populist leaders like Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Xi Jinping of China and Viktor Orban of Hungary have taken center stage, all following some version of the same script. And here in the United States, we have witnessed the anger borne of ordinary citizens who have lost almost any influence over economic policy \u2014 and by extension, their lives. The middle class has no political influence over their stagnant wages, tax policy, the price of essential goods or health care. This powerlessness is brewing a powerful feeling of outrage.After the fall of the Third Reich, the Allies broke up the major Nazi monopolies specifically so that they could not be \u201cused by Germany as instruments of political or economic aggression,\u201d in the words of the law used to do so. The United States took its medicine, too: In 1950, Congress passed the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 to curb politically and economically dangerous concentrations. It empowered the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to block or undo mergers when the effect was \u201csubstantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly.\u201dIt would be understandable if you assumed that the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 had been repealed. But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary. Consequently, over the last two decades we have allowed successive waves of mergers that make a mockery of the 1950 law, and have concentrated economic power in ways that are dangerous to the polity.We need to figure out how the classic antidote to bigness \u2014 the antitrust and other antimonopoly laws \u2014 might be recovered and updated to address the specific challenges of our time. For a start, Congress should pass a new Anti-Merger Act reasserting that it meant what it said in 1950, and create new levels of scrutiny for mega-mergers like the proposed union of T-Mobile and Sprint.But we also need judges who better understand the political as well as economic goals of antitrust. We need prosecutors willing to bring big cases with the courage of trustbusters like Theodore Roosevelt, who brought to heel the empires of J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, and with the economic sophistication of the men and women who challenged AT&T and Microsoft in the 1980s and 1990s. Europe needs to do its part as well, blocking more mergers, especially those like Bayer\u2019s recent acquisition of Monsanto that threaten to put entire global industries in just a few hands.The United States seems to constantly forget its own traditions, to forget what this country at its best stands for. We forget that America pioneered a kind of law \u2014 antitrust \u2014 that in the words of Roosevelt would \u201cteach the masters of the biggest corporations in the land that they were not, and would not be permitted to regard themselves as, above the law.\u201d We have forgotten that antitrust law had more than an economic goal, that it was meant fundamentally as a kind of constitutional safeguard, a check against the political dangers of unaccountable private power.As the lawyer and consumer advocate Robert Pitofsky warned in 1979, we must not forget the economic origins of totalitarianism, that \u201cmassively concentrated economic power, or state intervention induced by that level of concentration, is incompatible with liberal, constitutional democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Tell Everyone We Scalped You!\u2019 How Caste Still Rules in India", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHATI, India \u2014 When Sardar Singh Jatav set out walking on a muggy night in early September to talk with the men who employed his son, he found them already waiting for him in the road. But they were not in the mood for discussion.The higher-caste men greeted Mr. Sardar with a punch to the face. Then they broke his arm. Then they pinned him down. Mr. Sardar shrieked for help. Nobody came.One higher-caste man stuffed a rag in his mouth. Another gleefully pulled out a razor. He grabbed Mr. Sardar\u2019s scalp and began to lift and cut, lift and cut, carving off nearly every inch of skin.\u201cTake that!\u201d Mr. Sardar remembers them saying. \u201cTell everyone we scalped you!\u201dMr. Sardar is a Dalit, a class of Indians who are not just considered lower caste, but technically outcaste \u2014 what used to be called untouchable. Bound at the bottom of India\u2019s Hindu society for centuries, the Dalit population, now estimated at more than 300 million, has been abused for as long as anyone can remember.And now, according to crime statistics, the violence against them is rising.This might seem surprising against the new narrative India is writing. So much has changed. Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. The Indian economy is now one of the world\u2019s biggest. Everywhere in the country, there are new roads, new airports, new infrastructure.But in many places, especially in poorer rural areas, caste infrastructure is still the one that counts. And those who rebel against it, like Mr. Sardar, are often greeted with unchecked brutality.It is violence intended to send a message, pain inflicted to maintain India\u2019s old social order. The crimes are happening across the country and Dalits are not simply killed: They are humiliated, tortured, disfigured, destroyed.\u201cYou may talk about India being a world power, a global power, sending satellites into space,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the outside world has an image of India they don\u2019t know. As long as Hinduism is strong, caste will be strong, and as long as there is caste, there will be lower caste,\u201d he added.\u201dThe lower castes don\u2019t have the critical numbers to counterattack,\u201d he said. And the result has been violence that he described as \u201cintimate, sadistic and cruel.\u201dFor decades, India has struggled to de-weaponize caste. When the Constitution was being written in the late 1940s, intellectuals knew caste was a sore spot that needed to be urgently addressed. They included specific protections for Dalits, who make up about 15 to 20 percent of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people.Affirmative action programs, though they have generated deep resentments among upper castes, have helped some Dalits escape poverty. Today there are Dalit poets, doctors, civil service officers, engineers, and even a Dalit president, though it is mostly a ceremonial post.Experts say this violence is committed to sow terror. They liken it to the many well-publicized horrors inflicted on women here, intended to dehumanize and put people in their place.Another factor may be that Dalits like Mr. Sardar are speaking out more, demanding what is theirs.What ignited the confrontation that night in September was Mr. Sardar\u2019s insistence that the higher-caste landlords pay his son about $80 in back wages that he was owed for working in their rice paddies.\u201cAll I asked for was what I was due,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Sardar, who has a large, rounded forehead, a square jaw and a strong handshake, even while lying on his back in a hospital bed.His village, Thati, is about 200 miles south of India\u2019s capital, New Delhi. It is home to about 300 families, squeezed together in little brick houses that on a recent day wore a fine coat of dust. Women scrubbed pots with handfuls of mud, and older men lay shirtless on rope cots.In traditional Indian society, castes designated occupations. The untouchables were the ones who did the dirty work, such as skinning animals or cleaning toilets. Today the caste-occupation relationship has broken down a bit; in Thati just about all the families, whatever their caste, are involved in farming.But Thati still observes an old social order that the arrival of electricity, cellphones and more opportunity for the lower castes has not dismantled.The Gujjars are hardly at the top of the overall caste ladder, far below the Brahmins, who are considered the highest. In some places, Gujjars complain that they themselves are discriminated against because of their caste. But in Thati, they are the most powerful and own most of the land. Gujjars live in bigger homes, and many have tractors and small cars. Most Dalits don\u2019t even have bicycles.Dalits must show Gujjars respect. They are not supposed to look Gujjars in the eye or touch their food or water cups \u2014 Gujjars would consider it polluted. The two castes have separate water taps, like in the Jim Crow American south.All of this is illegal.At the edge of Thati village stands a sacred peepal tree. Beneath its nubby branches lies a small Hindu temple. Dalits are not allowed to sit at this temple, but any Gujjar, including a child, can. This is how it goes for many Dalits, their life circumscribed by what they are not allowed to do.When one young Dalit man said he was willing to break the taboo, another quickly grabbed his arm and said: \u201cDon\u2019t! If you do, there will be a fight tomorrow.\u2019\u2019While this was happening, a Gujjar farmer happened to walk by. Seeing three journalists talking to the Dalit men, he couldn\u2019t resist joining the discussion. He insisted that Thati was a happy place and that Dalits and Gujjars lived \u201clike brothers.\u2019\u2019\u201dBrothers?\u2019\u2019 one Dalit man shot back. \u201cBrothers don\u2019t scalp each other!\u201dPolice officers have arrested several Gujjar men accused in the attack on Mr. Sardar, who is around 55 years old \u2014 he\u2019s not exactly sure of his age. But the authorities say that caste played \u201cno role\u201d and that the crime was precipitated by a personal dispute between Mr. Sardar and a landlord.That claim made Mr. Sardar laugh \u2014 a dry, bitter laugh. He shook his bandaged head, still recovering from a painful skin graft from his thigh. It\u2019s a common complaint: that the police (who are usually from higher castes) always side against the Dalits.One police commander tried to claim that the assailants hadn\u2019t intended to scalp Mr. Sardar but that part of his scalp had simply fallen off when they hit him in the head with a stick. Two doctors who treated Mr. Sardar at a government hospital disagreed. They said just about all the skin on the top of his head had been forcibly removed with a sharp instrument, leaving his skull undamaged but much of the bone exposed.Mr. Sardar said that while he was being scalped, the Gujjars taunted him for wearing a turban, something that Dalits are not supposed to do. He remembers the men saying: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take away your crown.\u2019\u2019Now, he said, he is going to bear a horrible scar that will remind him, for the rest of his life, what the higher caste men did to him.\u201cI wish I were a different caste,\u2019\u2019 he sighed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Man Who Brought Weimar Into Germans\u2019 Living Rooms", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBERLIN \u2014 Like many people, Volker Kutscher reads daily newspapers to keep up with things. What\u2019s less usual is that the two papers he relies on, the Vossische Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt, have been out of print for more than seven decades.In the papers \u2014 which he reads front to back on microfilm in the city\u2019s old state library, weeks\u2019 worth in one sitting \u2014 he finds news of violent demonstrations, rising rents, traffic accidents, robberies and murders. He finds reviews of risqu\u00e9 cabarets, modern theater and promising new media (talking films). And in federal politics, there is endless news of weak coalition governments that take far too long to form.To modern Germans all this \u201cnews\u201d would seem eerily familiar.Mr. Kutscher has sold more than 1.7 million books in Germany, while tens of millions have watched the TV show there. Two of his books are in print in the United States, with at least two more coming, and Netflix is offering \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d in America.\u201cHis trick is ingenious,\u201d said Tom Tykwer, the principal creator of \u201cBabylon Berlin.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s created a portrait of an era through the lens of genre fiction.\u201dHaving spent a good part of his professional life in the two tumultuous decades between two world wars, the 55-year-old former journalist has found success as Germans have increasingly become fascinated with the era.By bringing an American-style detective story to Weimar Berlin \u2014 a city Mr. Kutscher calls the most American European city \u2014 he has helped popularize an era that has remained shrouded in Germany because of the monstrosities and guilt of the Nazi era that succeeded it. His novels have become almost essential reading in a German discussion about the creation of the modern democratic state, founded 100 years ago.And with the contemporary rise of populist nationalism and the perception that \u2014 despite a booming, culturally blossoming era \u2014 chaos is at the doorstep, the era is one that many Germans recognize as a mirror \u2014 if a warped one \u2014 of their present-day country.\u201cI\u2019m very much against direct comparisons: to say that we live in the Weimar Republic again is not \u2014 luckily \u2014 true,\u201d said Mr. Kutscher, before gamely pointing out the key differences.The modern German economy is humming, whereas in 1929, the year Mr. Kutscher\u2019s first novel is set, the stock market crash had shaken a nation already traumatized by hyperinflation. The current populists, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, who entered Parliament last year for the first time, are not the National Socialists.\u201cBut when I started writing, I would not have thought that we would once more live in a time where democracy is similarly endangered,\u201d he said.Daniel Sch\u00f6npflug, a historian of the era, has praised \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d for its historical accuracy and for making the era accessible to a wide audience.Mr. Kutscher has done this in part by giving his characters modern habits and placing well-known brands in the story.\u201cSome of my characters shower almost every day, which wasn\u2019t normal then, but I wanted them to be relatable,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are just much cleaner than their brethren.\u201dMr. Kutscher admits that part of his success is luck. His works became best sellers at a time when Germans were ready to re-examine the Weimar Republic. Mr. Tykwer, of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d concurs.\u201cWe started writing the script in 2013,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was almost uncanny how the real world around us seemed to want to conform to the era we were describing.\u201dBesides the $45.5 million TV show \u2014 the most expensive ever made in Germany \u2014 the books have spawned radio theater, a comic book, a podcast and walking tours. Mr. Kutscher created one picture book with Kat Menschik, a well-known illustrator, that tells the back story of one of the characters in his world without being part of the detective series.Like his main character, the dogged and ethically compromised police inspector Gereon Rath, Mr. Kutscher is actually not a Berliner, but a longtime resident of Cologne.\u201cIt was like being the priest or the mayor, maybe less important, but you were visible and had to be responsible,\u201d he said.\u201cThe city was much less colorful then,\u201d he said during an extensive interview in a hip hotel in Berlin, right at a spot where a fictional tobacconist introduced Inspector Rath to Camel Cigarettes in 1931.After seven years as the local editor of the paper, he quit to focus on his project: a series of books that would document the Weimar Republic and the first years of the Nazi era. Since he had written only three relatively unknown local crime thrillers (a new genre in Germany at the time), finding a publisher to consider such a hefty project took nearly two years. By the time Kiepenheuer & Witsch signed on for the first book \u2014 with options for the following manuscripts \u2014 he had almost given up and was looking for his next job in journalism.\u201cThe goal really was just to be able to do this full-time,\u201d he said. That was assured after his third book, \u201cGoldstein,\u201d came out in 2010 and made it onto the German best-seller list (it\u2019s available as an e-book in the United States from Picador Press, with a paperback to follow next year).His latest novel, \u201cMarlow,\u201d yet to be translated, is set in the city after the Nazis have come to power. The Vossische Zeitung has closed after a nearly two-century run, while the liberal Berliner Tageblatt, in Jewish hands since its founding in 1872, has been taken over by the Nazis.Mr. Kutscher still forces himself to read it, to know what his characters, navigating Berlin in 1935, would have read.\u201cIt\u2019s just awful now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Good Cheap Flights Still Exist. Here\u2019s How to Find Them.", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you\u2019re willing to search, you can get a vacation deal. You\u2019ll even be able to check a bag at no extra cost. Over the past decade, airlines have developed a reputation for nickel-and-diming their passengers. For the most part, the days of free checked baggage and free seat assignments are long gone. Even the days of free carry-on bags seem to be dwindling. And tickets are still expensive enough to be a major purchase for most fliers, especially around the holidays.We spoke by phone recently about the best ways to search for those fares. A transcript of our conversation, which has been condensed and edited for clarity, follows.Absolutely. You can definitely find cheap fares that include bags and seat assignments and, depending on where you\u2019re headed, even a meal. It\u2019s all about flexibility. You need to be flexible about what date you\u2019re traveling, or even the time of day. Business travelers don\u2019t have that flexibility, so if you fly at times that business travelers aren\u2019t on the road, like Tuesday or Saturday nights, you could find a better fare.Avoiding peak holiday travel days will really make a difference. The Sunday after Thanksgiving will be probably one of the most expensive days to fly of the year. Flexibility is key.My go-to site whenever I\u2019m beginning my search for airfare is Google Flights. You can find a flight on Google Flights almost as easily as any Google search, and you can see pricing for months at a time. The other great benefit of using Google Flights is you can set fare alerts. To do that, it\u2019s really straightforward: You put in your origin, destination and the dates you want to travel and choose the flights you want. If you\u2019re logged into your Gmail account, click \u201ctrack\u201d and you\u2019ll get an email whenever the fare changes. Google will also email you if it\u2019s expecting the fare to change based on historical data.Typically, we see domestic fares increase considerably within two weeks of departure. Of course, there are exceptions to that rule. If an airline has many seats available on a flight that\u2019s going to mostly appeal to leisure travelers, you may even see fares drop on the day of travel. International flights are more likely to drop or stay the same. It\u2019s not unusual to see international airfares stay the same while domestic airfares shoot through the roof. That\u2019s really where frequent-flier miles come into play, for those last-minute flights. Airlines may not drop the cash price, but they may open up awards seats. The general rule of thumb is two weeks out unless you\u2019re traveling during a super peak period.I like to travel in early January, right after the Christmas-New Year\u2019s rush. The first couple of weeks in January tend to be a slower period. As you get closer to Presidents\u2019 Day in the United States, that\u2019s another peak period because it\u2019s usually a three- or four-day weekend.In early January, you can find some great deals both on flights and on hotels. It doesn\u2019t really matter where you go during that period. Caribbean, domestic flights, ski destinations \u2014 those are all accessible.I like to catch the shoulder season, especially if it\u2019s a ski trip. Skiing in Colorado in March can be a great experience. Temperatures are bearable, hotels are cheap, and you\u2019re not dealing with a million people on line for the lift. It\u2019s a challenge. In that case, I recommend falling back on frequent-flier miles if you have them, and booking far in advance. If you know you have to fly on specific days, check award availability almost a year out. This is the time of year to be planning next year\u2019s holiday season trips.You can find great deals even during peak periods to places people are less likely to go. A lot of people are not going to want to take their entire family to Europe for a long weekend. Those flights are going to have tremendous value. If you have no flexibility, that\u2019s when that price tracker from Google is really going to come in handy. Basic economy fares pose quite a challenge to families, and really to all travelers. You really don\u2019t have any flexibility. There\u2019s no way on some of these fares to select your seat in advance. On United, you can\u2019t even bring a carry-on bag. Any savings that you got are essentially erased by the carry-on bag fees. Even if you do pay for a carry-on, you may not have space for it on the plane, so there\u2019s not much upside. Except with American \u2014 on last-minute flights, a basic economy fare can be hundreds of dollars lower than regular economy fares. There can be value in basic economy fares, but it\u2019s rare to come across a ticket that actually makes sense.If you do end up booking a low-cost carrier like Spirit or Frontier, keep all the fees in mind. You may have to dig a little bit to see the exclusions, and you\u2019re definitely going to have to dig to see the fees. Spirit, for example, charges $100 to bring the carry-on on the plane if you haven\u2019t paid for it in advance. You could end up paying quite a bit more than a flight on a full-service carrier.Look at vacation packages. If you know you\u2019re going to need a hotel room as well, all of the major carriers have vacation deals. The price of a package including a hotel can be less than the price of the flights alone. On a trans-Atlantic flight with a lie-flat business seat, you can save a couple thousand dollars by booking your hotel through the airline. Advertisement"}

But some areas, like the state\u2019s seventh congressional district, are home to farmers who are hit by retaliatory duties and manufacturers whose costs have gone up. That helped Susan Wild, a lawyer and first-time Democratic candidate, defeat Marty Nothstein, a Republican former Olympic and professional cyclist, to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats nationwide have won a majority.Duties on U.S. agricultural products imposed by China and other nations have particularly hurt Iowa. Representative David Young, a Republican who represents the state\u2019s third district in Congress, criticized Trump\u2019s tariffs and even wrote an op-ed in the Des Moines Register saying that they are bad for the state. But he still lost to Cindy Axne, a Democratic businesswoman.Another Republican who was critical of Trump\u2019s tariffs, Congressman Steve Russell of Oklahoma, also surprisingly lost to the Democrat Kendra Horn. He tried to allay trade fears and toured an Anheuser-Busch Metal Container plant in his district, which is worried about the aluminum levies. But Ms. Horn, a lawyer, accused him of not doing anything to stop the tariffs.Other areas hurt by the trade conflict still have faith in Mr. Trump, who has also played to fears about illegal immigrants. The Mid Continent Nail Factory in Butler County, Mo., which previously had 500 employees, has laid off or not replaced about 200 people since steel tariffs were imposed. But Mr. Trump overwhelmingly won that county in 2016 and residents rewarded his favored Republican Senate candidate, Josh Hawley, the state\u2019s attorney general, on Tuesday. Mr. Hawley defeated the incumbent Democrat, Senator Claire McCaskill, who had been a vocal critic of the administration\u2019s trade war.It is not a picture that\u2019s entirely clear one way or the other. But certain results show how the president\u2019s tariffs have hurt some of his fellow Republicans, many of whom have said that they would rein in Trump\u2019s protectionist moves but have not yet done so. It\u2019s a warning for a party that is usually the champion of free trade to remember its roots.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s poll numbers sagging shortly after the Republican National Convention in 2016, the solution was to reframe the race around an incendiary issue that has animated Mr. Trump for decades: immigration.Mr. Trump went to Arizona, where a year before he had first embraced the families of people killed by unauthorized immigrants, to give a major speech endorsing policies coveted by the most extreme immigration hard-liners.\u201cAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation,\u201d Mr. Trump vowed. \u201cThat is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise, we don\u2019t have a country.\u201dThe person who helped crystallize Mr. Trump\u2019s longstanding impulses around immigration into a political platform was Stephen Miller, his chief policy adviser. Now, as Mr. Trump searches anew for an electoral advantage, this time with his party\u2019s control of Congress at stake in Tuesday\u2019s midterm vote, Mr. Miller is again at his side.In the last two weeks, Mr. Trump has followed an instinct, one nurtured by Mr. Miller, that a foreboding message on immigration can galvanize his supporters.The president has sought to sow fear of immigrants by focusing on a caravan of people fleeing violence and poverty in their Central American countries, deploying active-duty members of the military to the border with Mexico and extolling the beauty of barbed wire as a deterrent. Mr. Trump has also resurrected one of his hardest-edge campaign proposals, calling for an end to \u201cbirthright citizenship.\u201dIt is an agenda Mr. Miller has pushed tirelessly inside the West Wing, where he has consolidated his power around the issue, even as several other aides have split into factions or left the administration. In Mr. Trump\u2019s world, no one has merged policy details and politics more forcefully than Mr. Miller.Mr. Miller, 33, has become known in that orbit for amassing frightening news articles and isolated statistics about immigration that he is aware might fuel a presidential declaration on Twitter. He has helped install a group of like-minded aides across the government, including at the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Justice Department, who have helped him pursue his agenda.The result is that Mr. Trump and Mr. Miller have thrust immigration \u2014 long an issue that conservatives felt was ignored by establishment Republicans \u2014 into the spotlight again and again.In 2016, the anti-immigration platform that the two men pushed was consistently tethered to an argument that unauthorized immigrants cost Americans jobs and were a drain on resources. But as the economy has continued to improve, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Miller will have the same effect with the issue this time.\u201cIt isn\u2019t just that DACA repeal and the \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 family separation policy are incredibly unpopular politically, it is that they motivated an entirely new demographic group, college-educated women, against the administration\u2019s immigration policies,\u201d said Todd Schulte, the president of the pro-immigration group FWD.us.Mr. Miller helped draft a policy plan posted on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign website \u2014 and taken down after he became the nominee in the summer of 2016 \u2014 that called for eliminating automatic citizenship for those born in the United States, tripling the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and defunding so-called sanctuary cities.In 2016, Mr. Miller began serving as a warm-up act for the president at his rallies, supplying a hypercharged, more polished version of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration talk.\u201cYou\u2019ve seen what it does to living standards, you\u2019ve seen what it does to wages, you see what it does in terms of transnational cartels,\u201d Mr. Miller warned at a rally in Texas in June 2016. \u201cYou have seen the heartbreak, you have seen the heartache, you have seen the needless death.\u201d\u201cEverybody \u2014 everybody \u2014 who is trying to stop Donald J. Trump wants that border to be wide open,\u201d he boomed, later asking, \u201cWhen did we forget that a country exists to serve its own citizens?\u201dA few days later, in Las Vegas, Mr. Miller asked the crowd, \u201cHow does it help America or lift up America or support America to bring anyone into this country who rejects our values, rejects our way of living?\u201dOnce inside the administration, Mr. Miller drew notice for declaring on a Sunday morning television program, after he and Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief strategist in the White House, had pushed through a travel ban targeting Muslim countries, that the president\u2019s powers \u201cwill not be questioned.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Miller is not the only person around Mr. Trump who has seen the immigration debate as having political value. With Mr. Trump\u2019s grip on his party tightening in the past year, he has pulled many Republicans toward his and Mr. Miller\u2019s views on policies they might not have supported before, such as reductions to legal immigration.Other advisers saw the issue gaining traction beyond the Republican base in the years before the 2016 election, particularly in relation to the economy. A 2014 polling memo from Kellyanne Conway, now the counselor to the president, took note that deportations of unaccompanied children crossing the border had seized national attention.\u201cThe time appears ripe for a national immigration conversation. There is a new open-mindedness to populist approaches, regardless of partisan or ideological preferences,\u201d Ms. Conway wrote in the memo, which was issued during a midterm cycle in which the immigration debate added to Democratic losses in the Senate.At a rally in Johnstown, Pa., in October 2016, Mr. Miller delivered a populist message of his own, taking aim at the elites who he said were making policy in Washington.Mr. Miller, who now lives in a sleek condominium building sheathed in glass in a trendy area of Washington, said people had no idea how corrupt the system was.They \u201clook down from their glass-windowed condominiums at all of you,\u201d he said. \u201cAs bad as you think it is, it is so much worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could Oysters Ease Trade Tensions With U.S.? European Leaders Hope So", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The United States and Europe may one day put aside their differences on trade, eliminate tariffs on industrial goods and work together to rein in their common economic adversary, China.But for Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, the most urgent task is to produce quick results, however humble, that will keep an impatient President Trump from imposing even more drastic penalties on European imports than the tariffs his administration has already levied.So when Ms. Malmstrom meets in Washington on Wednesday with her American counterpart, Robert E. Lighthizer, she will count it as a substantial victory if she can lower the barriers hindering one bit of trans-Atlantic commerce: oysters.The United States and Europe have long banned the importing of each other\u2019s shellfish. But a deal to ease trade on that front has been in the works for several years and could be dressed up by both sides as a success that helps smooth relations with the White House.Shellfish may seem like an odd focus for negotiators, but exports from the United States are worth about $1.7 billion a year. And international trade in clams, mussels, oysters and scallops \u2014 all of which are shipped live by air \u2014 is growing.The emphasis on mollusks also illustrates a strategy that officials in Brussels hope will prevent Mr. Trump from acting on a threat to impose steep tariffs on European cars, a potentially devastating blow to the European economy.Even before that development, it had become clear that it would probably take years to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal, and Ms. Malmstrom does not yet have a formal mandate from European Union members to conduct talks toward that goal.That is why Europeans are considering sectors where their regulatory standards and those of the United States are similar or identical in hopes it might be relatively easy to reach accord.\u201cWe are working as fast as possible to try to deliver a few positive outcomes as quickly as possible,\u201d Ms. Malmstrom said at a news conference in Brussels on Friday after European Union trade ministers met to discuss relations with the United States.Drugs are another category where a quick agreement might be possible. The European pharmaceutical industry is pushing for the United States to accept the results of clinical trials in Europe of its new drugs, and vice versa. That would cut the cost of testing drugs by millions of dollars and, by extension, help hold down prices for prescription medicines for everyone.Trade pacts typically take years to negotiate under the best of circumstances. European Union procedures require Ms. Malmstrom to first define the scope of any talks and then seek a mandate from the 28 member states. By the time that process is complete, she and other European Commission commissioners may be near the end of their terms, which expire at the end of next October.The meeting between Mr. Lighthizer and Ms. Malmstrom will be only their second since July, but lower-level officials have been meeting more frequently to discuss ways to produce quick results. Dismantling regulations is often easier than cutting tariffs, because negotiators are less likely to run afoul of World Trade Organization rules that require members to treat all other members equally.An agreement to open up the shellfish trade would hardly be a diplomatic breakthrough, because it was near completion anyway. But it would allow Ms. Malmstrom and Mr. Lighthizer to announce something concrete, and might help build trust.The Food and Drug Administration has banned European shellfish since the 1980s because of doubts about sanitation standards. Several years ago, though, food safety officials on both sides of the Atlantic began to perform detailed reviews of each other\u2019s quality controls and agreed that they were equally rigorous.Europeans also hope that with the midterm elections complete in the United States, Mr. Trump will be more willing to call a truce with Europe and join forces to deal with China. The European Union shares many of Mr. Trump\u2019s objections to Chinese trade policies, including de facto government subsidies for Chinese companies.For Americans, the trade war\u2019s negative side effects \u2014 higher prices, job losses \u2014 are likely to become clearer in the months ahead. When that happens, Mr. Trump could feel pressure to ease up on Europe. The German carmaker BMW said last week that the trade war had cost it nearly 300 million euros, or $337 million, and that it might have to move some production from Spartanburg, S.C., to China to avoid tariffs.A few optimists are holding out hope that the United States and Europe will pursue a stripped-down version of the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, better known as TTIP, a far-reaching deal begun under the Obama administration and abandoned by Mr. Trump.\u201cThere is a quiet belief in Brussels that after these midterm results the Trump administration will remain keen on a baby TTIP deal with the E.U. as tensions with China are almost certainly set to escalate,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director in Europe for the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm.But serious points of dispute in other areas remain. The United States wants Europe to open its doors to American producers of beef, cheese and other food. The European Union has ruled out discussions on agricultural products except soybeans, mindful that any deal that disturbed protections for French or Polish farmers in particular would be politically radioactive in Europe.Nor is there any sign that the Trump administration is ready to roll back tariffs it imposed on European steel and aluminum in May. Those tariffs, which stemmed from a Commerce Department investigation similar to the one involving cars, are seen in Brussels as a strong-arm tactic. (European officials retaliated with levies on American products like orange juice, peanut butter and whiskey. The reaction to auto tariffs would probably be the same.)\u201cTrump is using trade as a lever more than before,\u201d said Koen Berden, a trade expert at the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. \u201cThe Trump administration sees trade as selling out U.S. interests to some degree, and that needs to be corrected.\u201dThere is a palpable nervousness in Brussels that things could get much worse, that Mr. Trump will grow restive at the slow pace of trade talks and use car tariffs to ratchet up the pressure.\u201cTime,\u201d Margarete Schramb\u00f6ck, the Austrian economics minister, told reporters Friday, \u201cis definitely not our friend.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Brussels, and Glenn Thrush from Washington.

{"Headline": "Without a Trump Infrastructure Plan, an Aging Ohio Bridge Is in Limbo", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCINCINNATI \u2014 Many cities have a notorious choke point that torments commuters and keeps urban planners awake at night. In Cincinnati, it is the Brent Spence Bridge, a 1960s structure that straddles the Ohio-Kentucky border.It is creaky and rust stained. It is known for traffic jams and car crashes. People who live in both states avoid it if they can.\u201cI\u2019m scared to drive over it,\u201d Emily Essell said recently as she visited a park near the bridge. She said that she rolls down her windows when she crosses the bridge so that she can escape if her car falls into the Ohio River.So far, that has not happened. The bridge is one of the many critical projects across the country that have been in limbo as President Trump\u2019s calls for a big infrastructure plan have not gone anywhere.\u201cWe have a lot of things in common on infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Trump said of his willingness to work with Democrats.For train riders and drivers who are forced to rely on crumbling bridges and tunnels, help cannot come soon enough. In Ohio, there are calls from both parties to fix the bridge, and most leaders agree that it will require federal funding and tolls. The state\u2019s incoming governor, Mike DeWine, a Republican, has avoided blaming Mr. Trump directly for the lack of action and instead called on Congress to pass an infrastructure bill.But Cincinnati\u2019s mayor, John Cranley, has repeatedly criticized the president for failing to fix the bridge.\u201cPresident Trump made a promise, and he has done nothing to advance the promise that he made,\u201d Mr. Cranley, a Democrat, said in an interview.\u201cThe engineers say it has another 10 to 15 years,\u201d Mr. Cranley said of the bridge. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t get close to the wire on that.\u201dHuge infrastructure projects are often paid for by a mix of federal and local money. Mr. Cranley said leaders in Ohio were offering to pay for the local share with tolls, even though the idea of tolling such a heavily used bridge has been controversial. During the governor\u2019s race, Mr. DeWine said tolls had to be part of the solution, though elected officials in Kentucky have opposed them.A two-level structure with no shoulder and where several routes merge, the bridge is already dangerous. An eight-car crash in 2014 sent one car hurtling off the top deck, falling 25 feet to the bottom deck.The Brent Spence has been listed as \u201cfunctionally obsolete\u201d in the federal bridge inventory since the 1990s. State officials have proposed overhauling the existing bridge and building a new one next to it.Built in 1963 to carry 80,000 vehicles per day, the bridge now handles more than 170,000 vehicles each day. It is a critical link between the states and carries Interstate 75, a major American highway running from Michigan to Florida. Traffic on the bridge is so bad that some Uber drivers avoid taking it to Cincinnati from the city\u2019s closest airport across the state line in Kentucky, even though it is the most direct route.A constellation of local leaders agree the bridge needs to be fixed, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who is from Kentucky and is married to Elaine Chao, the federal transportation secretary. Ms. Chao declined requests to discuss whether the federal government should have a role in fixing the bridge. Her office provided a statement saying that the federal transportation department was willing to help Kentucky and Ohio with the project by offering \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d or by helping them find \u201cinnovative solutions.\u201dOn a recent afternoon, Cincinnati\u2019s riverfront was filled with families. A giant Ferris wheel and two gleaming sports stadiums made the Brent Spence Bridge appear shabby by comparison.\u201cIf our engineers are saying it needs to be fixed, then Trump needs to fulfill his promise and cough up the money,\u201d said Judy Lee, a home health care nurse who voted for Mrs. Clinton.Still, Mr. Trump won Kentucky and Ohio. Many of his supporters are loyal.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t fallen down yet,\u201d Paul Moore, a contractor and Trump supporter, said of the bridge.While Mr. Moore said he wants Mr. Trump to find a way to fix the bridge, he firmly supports the president\u2019s broader agenda. \u201cHe\u2019s taken the non-P.C. route,\u201d he said, in reference to political correctness.Alan Montague, a Trump voter who is retired, said he supported Republicans in the midterms because the economy was doing well. Like others in the region, he worries about the bridge.\u201cThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely dangerous.\u201dBut Ohio and Kentucky should help the federal government pay for a new one, Mr. Montague said.\u201cI don\u2019t like handouts from the government,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s for myself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macron Has a Long-Term Vision. But the French Have Urgent Needs.", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 President Emmanuel Macron of France has rolled out one ambitious change after another as he seeks to inject some dynamism into France.But as with each of his past steps, Mr. Macron did not have to look far for evidence of just how much his long-term vision for France is failing to meet its citizens\u2019 immediate and more urgent needs.Ordinary people say the president\u2019s speechifying about the fate of the planet overlooks the month-to-month struggle of their lives, and they are demanding he listen.\u201cHe seems to be deaf,\u201d said Fabrice Schlegel, who has helped lead some of the citizen protests that have convulsed France in recent weeks. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s talking to us about the \u2018ecological transition.\u2019 This is a politician who is floating in outer space.\u201dThe mass protests, organized on the internet, have sprung up out of nowhere and now cover the entire country. They are taking place outside the ranks of any political party or union and have shifting leadership. Many of the protesters say they have never before gone into the streets, and don\u2019t even vote.These protests, which some historians are comparing to the peasant revolts of the 14th century, may now present the most dangerous challenge yet to the young president, who has promised to transform not only France\u2019s energy industry, but also parts of its economy and the social safety net that he argues France can no longer afford.On a day when Mr. Macron had long planned to promote his energy program, he was instead forced to devote much of his speech not to the greening of France, but to its yellowing \u2014 the \u2018\u2018Yellow Vests,\u2019\u2019 as the protesters are called, after their symbolic roadside safety vests.\u201cWhat I want the French to understand \u2014 and especially those who are saying, more or less, \u2018We\u2019re hearing the President, the government, talk about the end of the world, but we, we are talking about the end of the month\u2019 \u2014 I want them to understand, we\u2019re going to deal with both,\u201d Mr. Macron said in his speech to government officials in Paris.Yet despite his insistence he understood the people\u2019s pain, the president offered no relief \u2014 particularly from an especially hated gasoline tax increase \u2014 and the speech struck many as out of sync with the political moment.As he spoke, French television showed images of the citizen protesters who filled the streets of Paris last weekend. That France, the world\u2019s most nuclear-dependent country, may reduce its use by 50 percent, was a matter of relative indifference to them, they said scornfully in interview after interview.From the moment he took office, the problem for Mr. Macron has been that the sweep of his vision was always greater than the actual depth of his support.On Tuesday, Mr. Macron insisted several times that he understood the tense situation prevailing in his country.\u201cI understand this fear,\u201d he said in his speech. \u201cI hear this discontent. I\u2019ve heard this anger, which has its share of legitimacy.\u201dHe promised a \u201cbig\u201d meeting \u201cat the grass roots,\u201d including members of the Yellow Vests, to come up with \u201csolutions.\u201dBut Mr. Macron did not vow to pull the gas tax increase that has spurred many protesters into the streets. He did not vow to fight for the higher wages, which Saturday\u2019s protesters, many of them working women and men, said were essential to their survival.He did not vow to lighten the tax burden on ordinary French people, which has increased by 25 billion euros every year between 2002 and 2017. The only possible compromise was a promise to review gas taxes every three months.As a result Mr. Macron may have failed to hit his mark in Tuesday\u2019s speech. The negative reactions from the Yellow Vests in wall-to-wall coverage on France\u2019s news channels, as well as the pans of his speech from Yellow Vest leaders in interviews, suggested as much. Mr. Macron\u2019s repeated expressions of sympathy and understanding failed to move his audience.They disdained his eloquence and his acknowledgment that many of the Yellow Vests had been placed in an impossible situation \u2014 forced out of the cities by high housing prices, and now priced out of rural areas by rising gas prices.\u201cI believe I understand, very deeply, the hopes and the frustrations, this silent anger, this resentment and rancor, that the citizens are feeling faced with officials who seem distant, indifferent,\u201d Mr. Macron said with a flourish.Those words did not appease Mr. Schlegel, the protest leader, who describes himself as an entrepreneur. \u201cIt was far from what is needed,\u201d he said by phone from the Jura, an area near the Swiss border. \u201cHe\u2019s not hearing the anger. This was pure Macron. The state\u2019s percentage in E.D.F.\u201d \u2014 the largely state-owned electricity company \u2014 \u201cthe French just don\u2019t give a damn about that.\u2019\u2019Another Yellow Vest leader was equally critical.\u201cMr. Macron put oil on the fire in not responding to the anger and suffering of the French,\u201d said Benjamin Cauchy, an insurance executive in Toulouse. \u201cHe\u2019s shut himself up in this \u2018ecological transition,\u2019 but he didn\u2019t respond to the fears about low salaries and dropping purchasing power.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m disappointed and scared because he didn\u2019t understand the anger,\u201d Mr. Cauchy added. \u201cHe\u2019s responding to all the emotion with technical measure.\u201dMr. Macron holds a big majority in the French Parliament, but even among members of his own political movement, La Republique en Marche, or Republic on the Move, there were expressions of disquiet.\u201cHe was elected to reform the country, but his reforms are seen as inegalitarian,\u201d said Patrick Vignal, a deputy in Parliament from Mr. Macron\u2019s party. \u201cThese are people who feel they are slipping, socially,\u201d Mr. Vignal said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to show them proof that we care for them.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s political opponents smelled blood after the speech.\u201cIt obviously wasn\u2019t at all the speech that the French, who are in despair about their end-of-months, were waiting for,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a total absence of response to this French anguish. It\u2019s really incomprehensible,\u201d she told reporters at the National Assembly.Mr. Macron\u2019s main opponent at the other end of the political spectrum, the far-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, said the \u201cpresident has run out of gas. He\u2019s just piling up the phrases. And he\u2019s not measuring the gravity of the situation. The barricades have gone up, all over France.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Schlegel said the Yellow Vest movement was not finished.\u201cThis situation is continuing to evolve,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018People haven\u2019t come this far for nothing. He hasn\u2019t discouraged anybody.

{"Headline": "The Key to Stopping the Illegal Wildlife Trade: China", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScience Times at 40The country is a critical market for animal contraband. Some scientists fear the official commitment to conservation may be wavering. Many of the creatures that share this planet with us may not be around much longer.But so is the global illegal trade in wildlife. For species like tigers and rhinos, poaching is a primary threat to survival.\u201cVery few ecosystems are not affected by wildlife trade,\u201d said Vincent Nijman, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University in Britain. \u201cIt directly impacts a very large number of species, and has a knock-on effect on many more species still.\u201dBut, as Dr. Nijman pointed out, any solutions for tackling illegal wildlife trade are unlikely to work without the involvement of one major player: China.Until recently, China seemed to have signed on to the cause. President Xi Jinping, who has pledged to turn the country into an \u201cecological civilization,\u201d stepped up seizures of contraband animal products and created a new national park to provide a haven for Siberian tigers. In January, Mr. Xi banned the domestic trade in ivory.\u201cThis development came as a surprise to us, because China, at the moment, is leading in so many ways on the environment,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program. \u201cWe should be stepping up protection for tigers and rhinos, not lowering it.\u201dChina\u2019s State Council directed that rhino horn and tiger bone be limited to use in scientific research and in traditional Chinese medicine, practiced by qualified doctors at certain hospitals.Officials also pledged to strictly control trade, a reassurance that did little to assuage concerns that poaching was about to spiral even further out of control.Indeed, just three days after China\u2019s announcement, Jose Louies, chief of the wildlife crime control division at the Wildlife Trust of India, received a call from an informant who said that tiger traffickers had begun anticipating a price increase.\u201cPoachers keep their ears to the ground \u2014 they feel everything that is happening in the market,\u201d Mr. Louies said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret for them that all the tiger materials are going to China.\u201dThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) banned international commercial trade of rhinos and most tigers in 1975. But for decades afterward, China permitted domestic sales of products made from these animals.And a few we\u2019d rather not discussIn 1993, under a law called the Pelly Amendment, President Bill Clinton threatened China with sanctions for undermining the Cites treaty. China responded with a ban on rhino horn and tiger bone, and poaching declined significantly.\u201cBy banning those products, the Chinese government made a significant contribution to conservation of rhinos and tigers over the past twenty years,\u201d said Zhang Li, a field biologist at the Beijing Normal University.Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine quickly followed suit, replacing the banned materials with sustainable substitutes and removing tiger bone and rhino horn \u2014 which have no scientifically proven benefits \u2014 from textbooks and the pharmacopoeia.\u201cIf the government\u2019s intention by lifting this ban is to support Chinese medicine, the result is the opposite,\u201d said Lixin Huang, executive director of the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in California.She suspects that the decision was encouraged not by practitioners of traditional medicine, but by \u201cthose dealing in the business of profit-making\u201d \u2014 tiger farmers.Rather than shutter after the 1993 ban, tiger farms continued to grow and now house over 6,000 captive animals. For over a decade, China has expressed interest in domestic trade of its captive tigers\u2019 parts.But at a Cites meeting last month in Sochi, Russia, Chinese officials strongly opposed the findings, according to Heather Sohl, a chief adviser at the World Wildlife Fund who attended the meeting.Officials did not mention the country\u2019s impending decision to reopen trade.\u201cChina has quite often restricted progress on tackling tiger trade discussions we have at Cites,\u201d Ms. Sohl said. The fact that officials questioned proposals to control tiger trade \u201cwasn\u2019t unusual and didn\u2019t give us any insight that this was coming.\u201dMichael \u2018t Sas-Rolfes, a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford who toured tiger farms at the invitation of the Chinese government in 2007, was not surprised.\u201cThe only part of this that was completely unexpected for me was the timing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese focus has always been more on conserving a species as a resource, not on the Western focus of conserving a species in its habitat.\u201dEven as Western countries have pushed for blanket bans on certain wildlife products, he continued, demand for those products in certain quarters of Asia has not fallen. Instead, illegal trade and the profits to be made from it have increased.\u201cI\u2019m hoping that China\u2019s move may serve as a bit of a wake-up call that the \u2018just say no\u2019 approach doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. \u2018t Sas-Rolfes said.\u201cThe conversation on drugs has evolved into something more sophisticated \u2014 smoking pot is not the same as shooting up with heroin. And we need to apply the same nuanced, evidence-based thinking to wildlife trade.\u201dSome are eager to see China\u2019s markets reopen.\u201cRather than criminals coming here, wantonly killing our animals, we can now supply horn from stockpiles to meet the demand and take pressure away from wild populations,\u201d said Pelham Jones, chairman of the Private Rhino Owners Association in South Africa.China\u2019s directive specified that tiger bones and rhino horns must come from farmed animals, but not that they be farmed in China. Conservationists believe the number of rhinos in China to be very small.By contrast, over 7,000 rhinos live on at least 300 private ranches in South Africa. Nearly 90 percent of rhino owners are keen to sell their animals\u2019 horns, which can be clipped every few years.The profits, they say, will help cover the steep security costs of keeping poachers at bay.\u201cThere\u2019s only one country in the world that can meet China\u2019s demand, and that\u2019s South Africa,\u201d Mr. Jones said.Whether a proposal to reopen international trade of rhino horn could pass at Cites depends on a number of technicalities in the treaty and on whether proponents could rally enough support.The United States has started looking into options of its own for ensuring that China\u2019s domestic ban on tiger and rhino trade remains in place, said Christine Dawson, director of the office of conservation and water at the State Department. That includes the possibility of recertifying China under the Pelly Amendment, which would pave the way for sanctions.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake for these two major economies, and the leverage may never be better for the U.S. to fold this issue into the broader trade issues going on right now,\u201d said David J. Hayes, executive director of the State Energy & Environmental Impact Center at New York University.Mr. \u2018t Sas-Rolfes pointed out, however, that the Pelly Amendment might have lost its potency in a China with rising influence on the world stage. In any event, officials now may simply decide not to follow through with the directive.\u201cLet us hope that China recognizes the stark inconsistency of this decision with its laudable stance on ivory, and takes steps to ban the trade of rhino horn and tiger bones altogether,\u201d said Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary of Britain. Whatever comes of the tiger bone and rhino horn controversy, Dr. Nijman emphasized that global collaboration \u2014 and perhaps compromise \u2014 with China might be key to solving the much bigger challenge of illegal wildlife trade.\u201cThat means trying to better understand the Chinese way of thinking and working directly with them for solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe solutions may not be the ones we initially thought were perhaps best from our Western perspective, but ultimately they may be the only way forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Week After the Election, Democratic Gains Grow Stronger", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2018 midterm election looked last Tuesday like a serious but not crippling setback for Republicans, yet the picture has grown grimmer for the party since then as a more complete tally of votes has come in across the country.What looked at first like a modest Democratic majority in the House has grown into a stronger one: The party has gained 33 seats so far and appears on track to gain between 35 and 40 once all the counting is complete.And Democratic losses in the Senate look less serious than they did a week ago, after Kyrsten Sinema was declared the winner in Arizona on Monday. It now looks like Democrats are likely to lose a net of one or two seats, rather than three or four as they feared last Tuesday.The underlying shifts in the electorate suggest President Trump may have to walk a precarious path to re-election in 2020, as several Midwestern states he won in 2016 threaten to slip away, and once-red states in the Southwest turn a purpler hue. The president\u2019s strategy of sowing racial division and stoking alarm about immigration failed to lift his party, and Democratic messaging about health care undercut the benefit Republicans hoped to gain from a strong economy.David Winston, a Republican pollster who advises congressional leaders, said his party should not use victories in the Senate to paper over severe losses with women, young people, independent voters and Latino voters, and Democratic gains with suburbanites and seniors.\u201cWe didn\u2019t lose the Senate, but losing by the margins that we did with a lot of these groups is unsustainable,\u201d Mr. Winston said.Ballot counting continues in close contests across the nation, and deadlines for final results, or recounts, are weeks away in some cases.There are warning signs for Democrats, too: Mr. Trump\u2019s party remains ascendant in rural America, giving Republicans a durable advantage in the Senate, where less-populous states have influence greatly disproportionate to their voting numbers. If Democrats cannot cut into Republicans\u2019 strength in areas far from major cities, they may struggle mightily to take back the upper chamber in 2020.And Republicans demonstrated a tenacious hold on two of the country\u2019s biggest swing states, Ohio and Florida, giving Mr. Trump an important foothold on the presidential map.Midterms are imperfect guideposts for presidential elections: In 2010, Democrats were defeated across Midwestern swing states and Florida and lost control of the House, only to prevail convincingly in the presidential race two years later. But for now, the big picture of the 2018 midterms is of a country in political flux, changing primarily to Mr. Trump\u2019s disadvantage.At the start of the 2018 election, the shortest path to a Democratic House majority appeared to run through Republican-held districts where Hillary Clinton won more votes than Mr. Trump in 2016. Democrats did exceedingly well in those districts and may ultimately capture about 20 of them, chiefly in suburban areas of states like California, Texas, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.But just as important to the Democratic takeover were at least 17 districts where Mr. Trump defeated Mrs. Clinton, and where voters elected a Democratic member of Congress last week. These seats make up about half of the Democrats\u2019 House gains, allowing them to achieve not just the 23-seat gain they needed for a bare majority but to win control by a comfortable margin.By winning a broader array of districts, beyond just Clinton-voting seats, Democrats proved that they could build a stronger coalition than they did in 2016 and chip away at the margins of Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral base.Still, Democrats made few inroads into solidly conservative districts. The Trump-voting seats they won were predominantly in the suburbs and exurbs, with enough moderate and college-educated voters to offset Republicans\u2019 strength in the districts\u2019 rural precincts. Democrats may also have a tougher time winning some of these districts in a presidential year, when voter turnout is even higher and partisan polarization can make it even harder for politicians to win on the opposing camp\u2019s traditional turf.In some cases, the districts themselves were starkly divided: In a conservative-leaning district outside Richmond, Va., Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, ousted Representative Dave Brat on the strength of suburban voters despite losing the district\u2019s less densely settled stretches. In a rural New Mexico district that voted strongly for Mr. Trump, Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat, won an open seat despite losing many of its far-flung counties, because she assembled muscular support in the outer suburbs of Albuquerque and the area around Las Cruces, the state\u2019s second-largest city.The texture of the midterm results has changed most starkly over the last week in the West, as slow-counting states like Arizona and California have tallied their ballots. Democrats have captured Republican-held Senate seats in Nevada and Arizona, partially offsetting their losses in the heavily white, conservative states where Republicans unseated Democratic senators.And in California, what looked like a night of incremental Democratic gains has turned into a slow-motion rout for the G.O.P. Republicans are on track to lose between four and seven seats there, chiefly in the suburbs of Southern California, where even Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a 30-year incumbent, went down in defeat.Further down the ballot, there were signs of Democratic gains in historically Republican parts of the Southwest: In Arizona, where Republicans have dominated state politics, Democrats also captured the office of education superintendent, and a second important statewide election \u2014 for secretary of state \u2014 was still too close to call a week into the count. In Nevada, where Democrats had not won a governor\u2019s race since 1994, they captured the governorship and the offices of lieutenant governor, attorney general, state treasurer and state controller.In Texas, Democrats gained at least a dozen seats in the Statehouse and, despite partisan gerrymandering, picked up two congressional seats. Five Republican congressional candidates there who were strongly favored to win ultimately prevailed with less than 52 percent of the vote.Texas and Arizona are unlikely to be blue states anytime soon, but after years of tilting at the Southwest with little to show for it, Democrats saw real signs that the region is becoming a battleground.Grant Woods, a former Republican state attorney general in Arizona who recently registered as a Democrat, said Mr. Trump and the Republican Party had moved too far right for voters in the Southwest. Mr. Woods, who is considering a run for Senate in 2020, said the midterm results were encouraging.\u201cThe extremism of the current Republican Party is a losing strategy for the future,\u201d Mr. Woods said. \u201cIn the Southwest in particular, where we\u2019re talking about a diverse population and, increasingly, a younger population, people just aren\u2019t going to put up with it.\u201dThe best news of the night for Mr. Trump may have been his party\u2019s triumph in Ohio. Republicans won the governorship there, along with every partisan statewide election, save one: the Senate race, in which Sherrod Brown, a populist Democrat, was elected to a third term. Historically a swing state, Ohio has been trending steadily toward Republicans and appears fairly secure in Mr. Trump\u2019s column at the start of the 2020 campaign.Two other conservative-leaning states in the Midwest, Indiana and Iowa, showed similar allegiance to the G.O.P., though Democrats picked up a pair of House seats in Iowa.Jon Husted, a Republican former speaker of the Ohio House who was elected lieutenant governor, said Democrats in the state were not strong enough in the cities to overcome Republicans\u2019 popularity with rural voters.\u201cWhat margins they do run up, we\u2019re able to more than make up in the rural counties,\u201d Mr. Husted said.Other Midwestern swing states, however, were a mirror image of Ohio, with Democrats achieving sweeping wins across Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Two years after Mr. Trump won upset victories in three of those states and came close to capturing the fourth \u2014 Minnesota \u2014 Democrats won every partisan statewide office on the ballot in all of them; they even ousted Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin and elected Representative Keith Ellison, an activist liberal who faced accusations of domestic abuse, to the office of attorney general in Minnesota.The division in the Midwest \u2014 between more urban, diverse states and more rural, agricultural states \u2014 presents challenges for both parties. Democrats will have a narrower path to the presidency nationwide as long as Ohio leans red. But the peril may be greater for Mr. Trump, who could have difficulty in 2020 replicating the regional sweep that made him president in the first place.Republican losses in the House were not nearly as steep as they might have been without the help of favorably drawn congressional districts. Even as Democrats gained at least 32 seats and won a clear majority of the popular vote, they failed to capture even a single seat in three big states with aggressively gerrymandered lines: Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina.In two other big, gerrymandered states, Democrats gained seats \u2014 but only a few. They took two Republican-held seats each in Texas and Michigan, but came painfully close in more than half a dozen others where partisan maps insulated Republicans from voters\u2019 anger.Without the maps on their side, it is easy to imagine Republicans having lost more than 50 House seats. And in states with more neutral maps, Democrats fared far better.Most illustrative may have been Pennsylvania, where in January a state court struck down the congressional district lines and ordered them redrawn. At the start of the last Congress, under a gerrymandered map, Republicans held 13 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18 House seats. After the redraw and the election, the House delegation will be split evenly \u2014 nine seats for each party.In most states, Republicans are likely to benefit from these maps again in 2020, but that may be the last time the lines are engineered so helpfully. With the inauguration of Democratic governors in states like Wisconsin and Michigan, Republicans will not have a free hand in redistricting after the 2020 census.An earlier version of this article misstated the extent of Democrats\u2019 gains in Nevada. They did not win every statewide office; one, secretary of state, stayed in Republican control.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turbulent Stock Market Is Flashing a Warning About the Economy", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment is near lows not seen in half a century. The American economy is set for its best year since 2005. Large corporations are producing giant profits. Even wages are starting to rise.And the stock markets are a mess.On Tuesday, the S&P 500-stock index turned negative for the year, stoking fears that one of the longest bull markets in history could be at risk.The stock market\u2019s struggles may seem incongruous against the backdrop of strong economic growth. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data.In recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that President Trump\u2019s global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits. Commodities and the companies that depend on them have been pummeled by the prospect of weaker demand should the global economy slow. Five tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix \u2014 have shed more than $800 billion in market value since the end of August, the fallout from slowing growth and regulatory scrutiny.The S&P 500 closed on Tuesday at 2,641.89, down 1.8 percent. Other markets also flashed warnings, with oil dropping by 6.8 percent, falling deeper into bear territory.The pressure eased on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 rising about half a percent in early trading after Asian markets ended the day largely positive and shares in Britain, France and Germany began the day higher.The sell-off doesn\u2019t mean the United States is headed into a recession. The stock market suffered several sharp stumbles in recent years before climbing to new highs on the back of booming corporate profits and strong economic growth.But the recent market drop could portend problems. In 2018, a hefty dose of fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax cuts, allowed the United States to shake off the growth worries in China, Europe and the rest of the world. It won\u2019t have the same potency next year, leaving the American economy and stocks more vulnerable to a range of risks, including a slowing global economy and continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\u201cI think there are very clear signs that investors are beginning to worry about weaker growth in the coming year or so, and how that\u2019s going to feed through to corporate earnings,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.Mr. Trump, on Tuesday, pointed to the health of the economy and instead blamed the Fed for contributing to the sell-off. Mr. Trump, who has taken credit for the rising stock market, has been critical of the rate increases, saying they undermine growth.\u201cI would like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the rate is too high.\u201dUntil recently, investors were willing to ignore the domestic political dramas, geopolitical turmoil and other issues clouding the outlook for American companies. Now they appear jittery, selling stocks at small signs that vague risks may become realities.So far this year, strong growth and deep corporate tax cuts have supercharged corporate profits. Once all the results are tallied up, the third-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up more than 28 percent from a year earlier \u2014 outpacing previous quarters, according to the financial data company Refinitiv.But those numbers haven\u2019t satisfied the markets. Investors have instead grown concerned about risks they face both from continued economic strength and, alternatively, an economic slowdown. Either path could upend a nearly decade-long rally that has lifted the S&P 500 nearly 300 percent.Strong economic growth at home would most likely mean a prolonged rise in interest rates and rising costs in areas like wages, which would hurt corporate profitability. Weaker growth abroad would cut into sales.In recent days, both forms of fear have fed the market decline.On Tuesday, shares of the retailer Target dropped by more than 10 percent, on worries that rising costs \u2014 from increased wages to higher prices for the Chinese goods facing tariffs \u2014 could continue to crimp profits. Investors also dumped shares of Kohl\u2019s and TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, which both saw freight costs eat into earnings.Apple continued its slide on worries about softening demand. The tech giant tumbled 4.8 percent after Goldman Sachs equity analysts cut their price target, citing deteriorating demand, especially in China.China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil, has also been weighing on commodities. The price of crude, now just above $53 a barrel, has fallen nearly 30 percent since early October. On Tuesday, energy was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500, with companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and the oil-field services provider Schlumberger losing more than 2.5 percent.Oil prices have been sliding despite signs that major producers like Saudi Arabia are considering cutting production. And that has amplified worries that China and the rest of the global economy may be in a weaker spot than markets realized.Last quarter, China\u2019s growth slowed to its lowest level since 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis. Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, is also looking shaky, with the economy contracting in the third quarter, amid a slowdown in trade and investment.Germany, the powerhouse behind Europe, also shrank unexpectedly during the third quarter as trade slumped and car production faltered. If Germany stumbles, it will add to the economic and political turmoil in a region already dealing with Britain\u2019s chaotic exit from the European Union and Italy\u2019s budget dispute with the bloc.In 2018, America\u2019s economy proved largely immune to such issues. But the global slowdown could eventually spill over into the United States, particularly as the impact of this year\u2019s tax cuts fades in the coming years. Economists expect that domestic growth, which is close to 3 percent this year, will slow to 2 percent by 2020, according to estimates published by FactSet.For the economy, that is a respectable performance. But for investors, a slowdown is likely to be uncomfortable.Disappointing data and earnings updates could ignite periodic panics over the threat of recession, even if remote. Markets are likely to be much choppier that than they\u2019ve been in recent years. Gains could be lower.In other words, the market may be messy for a while.\u201cI think this is what a low-return environment starts to feel like,\u201d said Joe Davis, chief economist with Vanguard. \u201cThe past five years, although entirely welcome from an investment standpoint, is clearly unsustainable.\u201dClifford Krauss and Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Harping on Immigration Do What Trump Wants It to Do?", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s unrelenting focus on migrants may prove ineffective because voters have already sorted themselves out along partisan lines.The authors are political scientists.Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on immigration has had real consequences, even though congressional candidates across the country have chosen to focus on other issues, like the economy or health care. Compared to recent elections, voters\u2019 beliefs about immigration are more strongly related to how they plan to vote in congressional races. This shows how Mr. Trump is shaping how Americans vote even though he\u2019s not on the ballot. His brand of identity politics has metastasized to states and districts across the country.The importance of immigration in 2018 has its roots in 2016. In the presidential election, attitudes toward immigration became more strongly correlated with voting for Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton than they were with voting for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. The increased role of immigration attitudes stemmed from the 2016 campaign itself: Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton took sharply divergent positions, embodied in Mr. Trump\u2019s call to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s argument that our diversifying nation was \u201cstronger together.\u201d Our research has shown that it was attitudes about identity-inflected issues like immigration \u2014 not a purely \u201ceconomic\u201d anxiety \u2014 that were distinctively important in 2016.Because Mr. Trump has linked the party to his position on immigration, white Americans\u2019 views of immigration now predict their vote for Congress more than in recent elections. To show this, we use data on the same set of 2,700 white respondents interviewed in December 2011, November 2012 and May 2018 in the Views of the Electorate Research Survey.In 2011, this survey asked whether immigration to the United States should be easier or harder, whether there should be a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and whether undocumented immigrants were mostly a benefit to or a drain on society. White Americans were divided on these questions: 48 percent wanted to make it easier to immigrate or keep it the same, while 44 percent wanted to make it harder (the rest were unsure). Similarly, 37 percent favored a path to citizenship, 42 percent opposed it and 22 percent were unsure. And while the majority (58 percent) said that undocumented immigrants were a drain, there were obviously many Americans who felt differently. We combined answers to these three questions to produce an overall measure of views about immigration.In 2012, white Americans did not appear to act on these views as much as they seem likely to in 2018. These 2011 views on immigration are more strongly correlated with how whites said they would vote in elections for House as of May 2018 than with how they actually voted in the 2012 House election. This is true even after accounting for other factors related to how people vote, including their identification as Democratic, Republican or independent and whether they described themselves as a liberal, moderate or conservative.Voting in congressional elections among whites has become more strongly associated with immigration attitudes. Anti-immigration voters are more likely to support Republicans this year than they were in 2012; pro-immigration voters\u2019 support of Republicans has dropped. The chart shows the chance that a white voter would support a Republican House candidate based the voter\u2019s view of immigration.VOTERS\u2019  VIEWSON IMMIGRATIONPROANTI100%(SUPPORT THE 8875%Voters in 201871Voters in 2012MORE REPUBLICAN SUPPORT50%3925%MORE DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT230100%VOTERS\u2019 VIEWSPRO-IMMIGRATIONANTI-IMMIGRATION(SUPPORTING88MOREREPUBLICANSUPPORTVoters in 201875%7150%Voters in 20123925%23INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT0By The New York Times | Source: analysis of the Views of the Electorate Research Survey by John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn VavreckWill this renewed debate over immigration helps the Republican Party\u2019s chances in 2018?That\u2019s far from clear. In 2016, Mr. Trump benefited because many white Obama voters disagreed with the Democratic Party on immigration. In December 2011, about a third of white Americans who would go on to vote for Mr. Obama believed that it should be harder to immigrate to the United States. Once the 2016 campaign made immigration a bigger issue, some of these white Obama voters who wanted restrictions on immigration shifted to Mr. Trump.But immigration may not be as effective a wedge issue in 2018. Immigration no longer divides Democrats as much as it used to. This shows how Mr. Trump is reshaping not only his own party, but the opposition. The result is fewer and fewer white Democrats who could be persuaded by Mr. Trump\u2019s message on immigration.This increasing polarization of the parties ensures a debate about immigration that extends well beyond this election. And it will be a particularly divisive and emotional debate precisely because immigration touches on fundamental questions about who deserves to be in America and what it means to be American in the first place.These are the questions that Americans will help to answer on Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Libraries, Gardens, Museums. Oh, and a Clothing Store.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShopping areas in Asia are about the experience, not just the retail sale.But train your ears toward another direction. In Asia, an entirely different story is being sung: one full of glimmer and potential; one that is not limited to luxury products but treats all customers as if they were buying luxury; one in which consumers are drawn like magnets to the physical reality of a \u2014 what to call it? Not a bazaar, really, or an arcade, or a plaza. An immersive aesthetic experience with shopping as a byproduct, perhaps.In Seoul, the 30,140-square-foot library in the COEX Mall includes approximately 50,000 books and magazines to browse, and offers couches and reading tables for passers-by as well as serving as a venue for cultural events.In Siem Reap, Cambodia, the 86,000-square-foot T Galleria by DFS (yes, the \u201cduty free\u201d folks, though this is not your standard airport experience) houses a multitude of brands alongside reflecting pools, verdant gardens and work from local artisans.To name a few.Together, these projects embody a new way of thinking about the physical space where stores congregate, one that borrows from the online playbook: prioritizing the idea of content over contents, and further demonstrating the way in which the real and virtual worlds increasingly intertwine. Not because they offer video screens or iPads for ordering (though they are on hand) but because of a more fundamental conceptual connectivity.\u201cIt\u2019s a core reality shift,\u201d said Scott Malkin, the founder and chairman of Value Retail. \u201cThe war is over. Alibaba won. That means physical retail is no longer about the distribution of goods but building brand equity.\u201dAnd brand equity is created via the subliminal communication of ephemeral values: service and touch \u2014 what Mr. Malkin calls \u201cthe software\u201d that surrounds the \u201chardware\u201d of bricks and mortar (and marble and sandstone) reality. Which then becomes the place, he said, \u201cwhere the interface behavior occurs.\u201d\u201cThe context for stores is more and more important,\u201d said Luca Solca, head of luxury goods research at Exane BNP Paribas, \u201cbecause you have to make people want to get out of their homes and away from their screens.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the store itself,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s retail counter-standardization.\u201dIf the old model \u2014 the merch emporium \u2014 gave way during the turn of the millennium to the flagship model, which saw stores become echoing and somewhat austere temples where consumers worshiped the handbag on the plinth, we are now entering a new stage. One embodied more by Apple or Starbucks than any previous fashion retail space.One that takes the rising principles of the experience economy and the growing belief that millennial consumers \u2014 who hate anything smacking of marketing or overt product pushing \u2014 are increasingly choosing to spend their money on the unique event rather than on the aspirational product, and applies them to shopping.One that says investing in a value system that surrounds the shopping experience will pay off in consumption. Because instead of taking home a postcard or a T-shirt to remember the visit, you take home a Prada shoe, or a Dior dress.Mr. Cheng first began exploring these principles in 2009 in his K-11 Art Mall developments in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Guangzhou, which originally combined art and shopping elements \u2014 a mix of high and consumer culture previously seen as heretical \u2014 and then expanded from there. The Shanghai Art Mall, for example, includes an urban farm where visitors can grow herbs that they eventually take home for their dinner. It\u2019s not an obvious sales driver but, Mr. Cheng said on stage at The New York Times International Luxury conference in Hong Kong last week, foot traffic went up dramatically after it was opened.Not that the point was \u201cabout traffic,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building a community. About grooming the audience and having access to their behavior, which then continues online.\u201d The farm is the bait, in a sense.Going to a store, Mr. Malkin said, \u201cshould feel like going to a hotel or resort, where you are taking away a memory because you are touched by an emotion you want to revisit.\u201d As a retailer, this means \u201cyou are not serving a person who needs an item,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are serving a person who needs an experience.\u201d And that changes how the retailer does things.Mr. Solca said he believed this kind of strategic approach would form a new model for global retail. Mr. Malkin agrees.\u201cThe reality is our experience in China will set the gold standard for what\u2019s possible in other international locations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s driving our thinking about the future.\u201dJust whatever you do, don\u2019t call it a \u201cshopping center.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As well as in autonomous vehicles and some consumer electronics products, A.I. will make its influence felt behind the scenes in production, R&D and supply-chain processes. The gains manufacturers make from A.I. use are unlikely to be headline-grabbing, says Michael Yost, president of the Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association International. But, in time, he says, A.I. will do much to enhance manufacturers\u2019 operating efficiency, product quality and capacity for innovation. These longer-term efficiencies could be significant. A 2018 report by the consultancy BCG, \u201cA.I. in the Factory of the Future: The Ghost in the Machine,\u201d found that A.I. can reduce manufacturing conversion costs \u2014 the combination of direct labor and overhead costs \u2014 by 20 percent, an attractive prospect for manufacturers. The same report found that 80 percent to 90 percent of automotive, consumer goods, process industries and engineered-product companies plan to implement A.I. in their processes in the next three years. A.I. stands to have considerable impact in a number of key manufacturing areas in the next five years. This is likely to be seen earliest in the automotive and semiconductor industries, where A.I. has already made inroads and where operations are already highly automated. But it will also come into use (albeit more gradually) by process, heavy equipment and FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) manufacturers, according to the BCG report. This is already evident in the rates of early A.I. adoption among industries. One-fifth of automotive companies are early A.I. adopters, according to the report, compared to 15 percent of engineered-products companies and 13 percent of process-industry firms. All have much to gain, but there are stiff challenges to address to ensure that A.I. delivers for them.\nImproving asset utilization \u2014 a key determinant of manufacturing performance \u2014 relies on maintaining production equipment in peak condition, keeping expensive downtime to a minimum and maximizing its working life. The combination of predictive analytics, advanced image recognition technology and, of course, voluminous performance data will enable algorithms to predict likely equipment failures. A defining attribute of such systems, says Bauer, is continuous learning \u2014 the algorithms\u2019 ability to train themselves, based on experience and more data, to generate more accurate predictions.Not only can preventive action be taken to avoid downtime, but maintenance operations themselves can be based on predicted conditions rather than a regular schedule. Both should generate substantial savings for manufacturers as well as improve asset productivity. According to McKinsey\u2019s 2017 report \u201cSmartening Up With Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) \u2013 What\u2019s in It for Germany and Its Industrial Sector?\u201d such use of A.I. could help Germany\u2019s industrial manufacturers boost asset productivity by as much as 20 percent and reduce maintenance costs by up to 10 percent. Several elements must be in place before manufacturers are able to scale A.I. and generate the desired returns from its use. First comes connectivity. Most A.I.-driven algorithms require a lot of computing power. That power, along with the software platforms and virtual hardware that A.I.-assisted applications run on, can be found in the cloud, and companies should be working with one or more cloud providers that offer such resources. The cloud is also the home of open-source platforms that companies in different sectors are using to innovate with A.I. Manufacturers must participate more widely in open forms of innovation in order to gain knowledge, expertise and good ideas for A.I. applications.The other major building block is ample, usable data. Manufacturers generally do not suffer from a shortage of it, but many point out that much of their data is unusable because of errors, incorrect or absent labels and insufficient standardization across data sets. Companies must do the hard work of cleaning and properly integrating the data sets they have and continue to amass. Their analytics tools will also need to be able to work with unstructured forms of data (such as images of equipment and products), the analysis of which greatly adds to A.I.\u2019s capabilities.  The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Justices Seem to Support Virginia\u2019s Uranium Mining Ban", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When the largest known deposit of uranium in the United States was discovered in the 1970s in Pittsylvania County, Va., state lawmakers were wary. After some investigation, they imposed an indefinite moratorium on uranium mining.On Monday, the Supreme Court considered whether that was lawful. A majority of the justices seemed inclined to say yes.The case, Virginia Uranium v. Warren, No. 16-1275, concerns a possible clash between a federal law, the Atomic Energy Act, and the state moratorium. The federal law regulates what can be done with uranium and the radioactive waste it generates after it is extracted from the earth. If the federal law applies, it would displace the moratorium and allow mining to proceed.But the federal law regulates only the second and third steps in uranium mining. The first step is extracting the raw ore from the ground. The second is separating the ore from waste rock, or tailings, and concentrating it into so-called yellowcake, which is sold. The third step is storing the tailings, which are radioactive.By its terms, the state moratorium addressed only extraction, which is beyond the reach of the federal law. State officials said the ban was justified by environmental and economic factors rather than safety concerns linked to radiation.But Charles J. Cooper, a lawyer for the owners of the land containing the uranium, said the real purpose of state lawmakers in enacting the ban was to address radioactive waste.Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said he was reluctant to try \u201cguessing what the motivations of a state legislature are\u201d and to grapple with \u201call the methodological, epistemological and federalism questions that that raises.\u201dJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked Mr. Cooper what should happen if the state\u2019s purpose in enacting the ban had nothing to do with fear of radiation. \u201cSuppose Virginia had said we think that the extraction is a dangerous activity, so we are justifying this ban on mining to protect the workers from the hazards associated with mining, not with milling or tailing, just mining,\u201d she asked.Mr. Cooper said, \u201cI would lose if that was the State of Virginia\u2019s genuine purpose.\u201dChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. liked that answer. \u201cI appreciate the candor,\u201d he told Mr. Cooper.Justice Elena Kagan said it would be odd if two identical state laws could be interpreted differently based on the intent of the lawmakers who voted for them.Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco, arguing in support of the landowners on behalf of the federal government, said there had to be \u201ca plausible nonsafety rationale\u201d for the moratorium to survive. He gave an example of one reason he said was insufficient.\u201cSuppose that Virginia put forward a rationale of we don\u2019t like big, huge, ugly holes dug into the Virginia countryside, which is a very plausible rationale,\u201d Mr. Francisco said. \u201cBut suppose that in a particular area of Virginia they actually have tons of big, ugly holes dug in the Virginia countryside by way of coal mines.\u201dChief Justice Roberts said the reason might still fly. The legislature might have had its fill of big, ugly holes, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got too many but don\u2019t want any more,\u201d he said.Toby J. Heytens, Virginia\u2019s solicitor general, said the moratorium was justified by many factors unrelated to radiation.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a fundamentally profoundly rural area of Virginia that\u2019s building its economy based on agriculture and tourism,\u201d he said.Also on Monday, the court declined to hear challenges to \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations adopted in 2015 by the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration and upheld by a federal appeals court the next year.The regulations barred broadband providers from blocking websites or charging for higher-quality service or content. It allowed the federal government to regulate high-speed internet delivery as a utility, like phone service.Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh recused themselves from consideration of the several petitions denied on Monday, which included Berninger v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 17-498.Advertisement"}

The last three of these have arrived with him in recent weeks.Tell us about the last great book you read. \u201cThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\u201d by C. S. Lewis, which we finished six weeks ago \u2014 see previous point about the enterprising 7-year-old. There are many themes and lines worth turning over in your mouth and head for a lifetime, but one that my children keep coming back to is the power of the white witch to keep it \u201calways winter and never Christmas\u201d in Narnia.What\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? Everyone should also read or reread Sherry Turkle\u2019s excellent \u201cAlone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other.\u201d Mary Aiken\u2019s \u201cThe Cyber Effect: An Expert in Cyberpsychology Explains How Technology Is Shaping Our Children, Our Behavior, and Our Values \u2014 And What We Can Do About It\u201d is well worth a read.What books do you think most accurately depict Washington?I\u2019m a fan of Joanne Freeman, but I hope that her new book \u2014 \u201cThe Field of Blood: Violence in Congress and the Road to the Civil War\u201d \u2014 doesn\u2019t end up feeling like an accurate depiction of present-day Washington.What books best capture your own political principles? Edmund Burke\u2019s \u201cReflections on the Revolution in France\u201d is the simplest answer. All governance east of Eden is imperfect. Democratic republicanism is the best form of government when it is functioning well, but instant, majoritarian mob rule is one of the most grotesque when it is moving fast. The conservatism with which I identify is humble about the dangers always around the next corner, and therefore it labors to be grateful for every spark of thick localistic community built on volunteerism and neighborly affection.I think the most important American book on political philosophy is \u201cThe Federalist Papers,\u201d by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay (and I am certain I will heartily recommend whatever project eventually flows from all of the commentary Harvey Mansfield has recently been offering on those founding federalist efforts). The most important book on America remains Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s \u201cDemocracy in America.\u201d And for teaching high school and college students, there\u2019s really not much better than the Declaration of Independence.What books would you recommend to somebody who wants to know more about Nebraska? Your children are home-schooled. What books do you have them read? I just checked in on our teenage daughters and one of them was reading \u201cDracula\u201d; the other is reading \u201cGreat Expectations.\u201dAre there books you feel all American children should read? I devoted a chapter of \u201cThe Vanishing American Adult\u201d to trying to build a \u201cfive-foot bookshelf\u201d \u2014 of 60 books \u2014 that we would regard as a kind of evolving \u201cfamily canon.\u201d I wrestled there with how I think the canon fights often devolve into an endless argument about what book or identity group is being excluded at the arbitrary line between book 60 and 61, or between book 200 and 201. So I want to be clear that I don\u2019t think our \u201cfamily canon\u201d is the only canon for every American family, but I do strongly believe that every American family should be developing their own canon of books they read together and repeatedly \u2014 and moreover that we should be comparing our lists with those of our neighbors and fellow citizens, so that we might enrich one another.As we considered a thousand-plus candidate books for our canon, we ultimately decided to segment that work by limiting ourselves to 12 categories with a maximum of five books each. Our categories include big themes like: God, Greek Roots, Shakespeare, the American Idea, Markets, American Fiction, a Humanistic Perspective on Science, etc. Our category on Tyrants and Totalitarianism, for example, includes Hannah Arendt\u2019s \u201cThe Origins of Totalitarianism,\u201d F. A. Hayek\u2019s \u201cThe Road to Serfdom,\u201d George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World,\u201d and \u201cThe Communist Manifesto,\u201d by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.Which books do you think capture the current social and political moment in America? A close second: Nicholas Eberstadt\u2019s \u201cMen Without Work: America\u2019s Invisible Crisis.\u201dWhich fiction or nonfiction writers inspired you most early your career? Which historians and biographers do you most admire? Why? As I\u2019ve taught more \u2014 and particularly, as I\u2019ve done more after-action evaluation on which books actually make a difference in the lives of students and friends \u2014 I\u2019ve come to value more books and writers that economize well. Many people know the old joke that \u201cI wrote a 500-page dissertation because I didn\u2019t have time to write a 200-page dissertation,\u201d but it remains true that there\u2019s a major difference between the \u201corder of discovery\u201d and the \u201corder of presentation.\u201d We authors need to realize that not everything we\u2019ve learned is really worth our readers\u2019 time. We should be doing some of the work of culling and prioritizing for them.Are there genres you avoid? I intentionally read no modern fiction. I wish it weren\u2019t so, but life is short, work is full and kids are under our roof only for a short time. When I read fiction, I want a community of discourse to vouch for the fact that it\u2019s already stood the test of a bit of time.How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night? I read articles in the gym in the morning on a tablet or phone. Then I print out a stack of them that I carry around with me throughout the workday. But when I\u2019m getting into bed, I prefer a book to articles \u2014 and I move to exclusively paper. I don\u2019t want any temptations to be drawn back into the immediacy of a phone with its demonic alerts.Another recent innovation in my life is when I\u2019m getting into a new book, I often download a few podcasts or book talks with the author and go on a long walk. Then I return to the printed words after having gotten more familiar with the author\u2019s spoken words. The back-and-forth between forms helps me get up to speed with his or her argument more quickly.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? For a Nebraska kid in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Nebraska football was a quasi-religion, so I ran out to get The Omaha World-Herald every morning, salivating for the sports page. My dad, however, required that I read one front page story and one editorial before I was allowed to turn to the sports. Soon after my newspaper addiction was firmly established, the habit of reading spilled over to many typical children\u2019s series: the Hardy Boys, Jack London, the Great Brain, the Boxcar Children. (I also spent an insane amount of time with the Guinness Book of World Records and various sports almanacs.)If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? There is a joke in here somewhere about 2 Corinthians, but I\u2019m going to pass. Perhaps Barry Schwartz\u2019s \u201cThe Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less,\u201d or James K. A. Smith\u2019s \u201cYou Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit.\u201dYou\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? (He doesn\u2019t seem to fit with this crowd, but I actually think Euclid would be pretty dang fun at a dinner party. And then I suspect making him respond to Lobachevsky would be mind-blowing.)Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? I think lots of 300-page books could (and should) have been 30-page articles, but neither magazines nor book publishers have much of a market for 30 pages. I don\u2019t need to gratuitously slap modern writers, but I\u2019d probably make this critique of three-quarters of the books I\u2019ve speed-read this year.Whom would you want to write your life story? There are far better things for folks to be reading and writing. My life is too mundane for anyone to write up.What do you plan to read next?My desk is stacked full of articles on cyber. As context for them, I\u2019m looking forward to both Annie Jacobsen\u2019s \u201cThe Pentagon\u2019s Brain: An Uncensored History of Darpa, America\u2019s Top Secret Military Research Agency\u201d and Franklin Foer\u2019s \u201cWorld Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Novelists Turned to TV: Everyone Was Suddenly Using \u2018Reveal\u2019 as a Noun", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPage to ScreenThe borders between television and prose fiction grow ever porous. At the University of Iowa\u2019s Writers\u2019 Workshop \u2014 a bastion of literary purity for aspiring novelists and poets, which, not coincidentally, has been featured on the TV show \u201cGirls\u201d \u2014 evidence of this porousness is sometimes subtle: \u201cIt happened a few years ago,\u201d said the workshop\u2019s director, Lan Samantha Chang. \u201cEveryone was suddenly using the word \u2018reveal\u2019 as a noun.\u201dBut such understated evidence of permeability between idioms has had a chance to swell in size on the university\u2019s campus this fall, when veteran TV writers Mitchell Burgess and Robin Green (\u201cNorthern Exposure,\u201d \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cBlue Bloods\u201d) launched a class called Writing for Television. \u201cMany of the applicants for the class that Mitch and Robin were most interested in are students coming out of fiction,\u201d said Alan MacVey, chairman of the university\u2019s theater arts department. \u201cThey thought that these students\u2019 particular skill set and artistic temperament was appropriate for the kind of writing being done on TV today.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re also mentoring two students. They pitch us ideas for TV shows,\u201d Green said.In a world in which some of our more successful or esteemed novelists \u2014 Margaret Atwood, Gillian Flynn, George R.R. Martin, Salman Rushdie, Kevin Kwan, Neil Gaiman, Tom Perrotta, Noah Hawley, A.M. Homes, Jonathan Ames, Megan Abbott and David Benioff, to name only a few \u2014 have written or are writing for the small screen, literary academia has less reason than ever to be sheepish about preparing its charges for the solaces of a healthy paycheck. Green, a Writer\u2019s Workshop graduate herself, said, \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t take away from writers practicing their art. There\u2019s quality work on TV now. It\u2019s not as shameful to write for it as it once was.\u201d The Writers\u2019 Workshop\u2019s Chang said, \u201cSeriously, I don\u2019t hear any grumbling and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to dilute our brand.\u201dIf, as William Faulkner once put it, \u201cHollywood is the place on earth where you can get stabbed in the back while you\u2019re climbing a ladder,\u201d what or who has made television palatable to Mr. Faulkner\u2019s spiritual offspring? Many would point to David Simon, the creator, show runner and head writer of \u201cThe Wire,\u201d a show that helped put longform, multistoried episodic television on the map.Simon was a former crime reporter for The Baltimore Sun who had written two doorstops of narrative nonfiction (\u201cHomicide\u201d and, with writer Edward Burns, \u201cThe Corner\u201d), both of which he turned into television series. In 2001, while Simon was in the throes of \u201cThe Wire\u201d\u2019s creation, his then-girlfriend, the crime novelist Laura Lippman, told Simon about her friend, novelist George Pelecanos. Simon recently recounted, \u201cShe said, \u2018This guy is writing in the same tonality and vernacular as you.\u2019\u201d Simon read some of Pelecanos\u2019s work and then hired him to write for \u201cThe Wire,\u201d telling him, in Pelecanos\u2019s words, that the show would be \u201ca novel for television\u201d and that \u201ceach episode would be like a chapter in a book.\u201dOnce on \u201cThe Wire\u201d\u2019s writing staff, Pelecanos introduced Simon to novelist Richard Price, who also came on board the show. Simon said, \u201cAfter that, I said, \u2018Who\u2019s next?\u2019 We decided Dennis Lehane.\u201dSimon maintains that novelists are particularly well-suited for longform television, where stories unspool over several episodes or a whole season: \u201cThey can see the whole.\u201d Currently, his writers on HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d which he created with Pelecanos, include Price as well as the crime novelists Megan Abbott and Lisa Lutz. The experience has \u201crequired us all to leave some authority and ego at the door and engage in a collective act of storytelling,\u201d Simon said. \u201cNothing defines selflessness more than telling Richard Price that a great scene he wrote for episode two is going in Megan\u2019s later script because it works better there. Or vice versa.\u201dIndeed, for many novelists who make the transition to TV writing, collaboration \u2014 and the threat it poses to a fiction writer\u2019s default setting of solitary, gauzy daydreaming \u2014 is chief among the challenges. \u201cHaving to sit at a conference table looking at other humans for many hours a day takes a kind of mental energy,\u201d said Charles Yu, the author of \u201cHow to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe\u201d and a five under 35 honoree by The National Book Foundation who has gone on to write for \u201cWestworld,\u201d \u201cHere and Now\u201d and \u201cLegion.\u201d \u201cIt also took me awhile to realize when my story pitches had been rejected by show runners in story meetings, because the pitches were turned down so nicely. I\u2019ll still be noodling on about some idea I think is fascinating, and the rest of the room is two or three pitches further on.\u201dAnother entity that novelists struggle with when writing for TV is economy. \u201cWith novels, I could write 15 pages on a piece of furniture if I wanted,\u201d said \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d author Kevin Kwan, who is working on an original series for Amazon. \u201cBut in TV, one page is one minute. You\u2019ve got sixty pages to tell a story and make people want to download the next episode.\u201d Novelist Ali Liebegott, who wrote for \u201cTransparent\u201d and now is a writer and co-executive producer of the \u201cRoseanne\u201d spinoff, \u201cThe Conners,\u201d said, \u201cThere\u2019s so much room in fiction just to be in a mood. But TV is all about the action. It\u2019s economical, whereas I\u2019m much more tangential by nature. I mean, all my favorite movies are about two alcoholics sitting across a table from one another.\u201dDo novelists worry that their participation in the time-consuming but highly lucrative world of television might cause them to squander their fiction careers, gradually transforming them from ink-stained wretches to Malibu caftan-wearers? \u201cThat is a favorite topic in my therapist\u2019s office,\u201d said Attica Locke, who has written for \u201cEmpire\u201d and Ava DuVernay\u2019s upcoming series \u201cCentral Park Five.\u201d \u201cBut I can\u2019t eat off books. I can\u2019t send my kid to private school off books.\u201dLocke offers a sterling example of how writing for TV can actually aid a writer\u2019s prose. \u201cI wrote my last book, \u2018Bluebird, Bluebird,\u2019 in between seasons of \u2018Empire,\u2019 and then during the third season. When I finally showed it to my agent, he couldn\u2019t believe how short it was! He said, \u2018The best thing you got out of \u2018Empire\u2019 is brevity!\u2019 All my other books were over 400 pages.\u201d\u201cBluebird, Bluebird\u201d went on to make 18 \u201cbest of the year\u201d lists, be a finalist for The Los Angeles Times Book Prize and win the 2018 Edgar Award for Best Novel. The book is \u2014 here\u2019s the reveal, folks \u2014 being developed as a TV series.Advertisement"}

The G.D.P. is growing at about 3.5 percent a year, which is about a point faster than many experts thought possible. We\u2019re in the middle of the second-longest recovery in American history, and if it lasts for another eight months it will be the longest ever. If you were born in 1975, you\u2019ve seen the U.S. economy triple in size over the course of your lifetime.And yet are we happy?So why the long faces?Part of the problem is Donald Trump. People can\u2019t feel good about things when they think the country is disastrously led. How many unpaid internships can you endure before you lose faith in the system?But the biggest factor is the crisis of connection. People, especially in the middle- and working-class slices of society, are less likely to volunteer in their community, less likely to go to church, less likely to know their neighbors, less likely to be married than they were at any time over the past several decades. In short, they have fewer resources to help them ride the creative destruction that is ever-present in a market economy.And they are dying. On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that life expectancy in the United States declined for the third straight year. This is an absolutely stunning trend. In affluent, well-connected societies, life expectancies rise almost as a matter of course. The last time the American mortality rate fell for three straight years was 1915-1918, during World War I and the flu pandemic, which took 675,000 American lives.And yet here we are \u2014 a straight-up social catastrophe.Economic anxiety is now downstream from and merged with sociological, psychological and spiritual decay. There are thousands of employers looking for workers and unable to find any. Many young people do not have the support structures they need to persevere in school and get skills. There\u2019s an interesting debate going on in conservative circles over whether we have overvalued total G.D.P. growth in our economic policy and undervalued programs that specifically foster dignity-enhancing work. The way I see it is this: It\u2019s nonsense to have an economic policy \u2014 or any policy \u2014 that doesn\u2019t account for and address the social catastrophe happening all around us. Every single other issue exists under the shadow of this one.Conservatives were wrong to think that economic growth would lead to healthy families and communities all by itself. Moderate Democrats were wrong to think it was sufficient to maximize growth and then address inequalities with transfer payments. The progressives are wrong to think life would be better if we just made our political economy look more like Denmark\u2019s. The Danes and the Swedes take for granted a cohesive social fabric that simply does not exist here.It\u2019s not jobs, jobs, jobs anymore.

{"Headline": "Wildfire Becomes Deadliest in California History", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe inferno that ravaged the wooded town of Paradise in northern California became the deadliest wildfire in the state\u2019s modern history on Monday when officials said they had discovered the remains of 13 more people, bringing the death toll to 42.The Butte County sheriff, Kory L. Honea, has said more than 200 people remain missing in and around the town, which sits in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and was popular with retirees.The fire, which continues to rage in the hills and ravines east of the city of Chico, is also the most destructive fire in California history, with more than 7,100 structures destroyed, most of them homes.The inferno that incinerated the northern town of Paradise has razed a staggering 6,453 homes. As of Sunday night, more than 200 people were unaccounted for in Paradise, and officials are bracing for the possibility that the death toll could continue to rise significantly.Here are the latest developments:\u2022 The authorities said Monday night that they had identified the remains of four people killed in the Camp Fire, and released the names of three of them.\u2022 See where the fires have burned in the graphic below.Wildfires have burned in California near the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Los Angeles shoreline, engulfing nearly 250,000 acres.The authorities on Monday night released the names of three people who were killed in the Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California history.They were identified as Ernest Foss, 65, from Paradise; Jesus Fernandez, 48, from Concow; and Carl Wiley, 77, from Magalia. Sheriff Honea said one other person had been identified, but officials were withholding the name pending notification of next of kin.The names were released as the authorities announced that 13 more bodies had been found, bringing the total dead in the Camp Fire up to 42. Ten of the 13 were found in Paradise, and the remaining three in Concow.\u201cThe numbers of losses of life are probably going to go much higher, I fear,\u201d said Jim Broshears, Paradise\u2019s emergency operations coordinator and the town\u2019s former fire chief.\u201cIt had no real economy,\u201d James Hana said of Paradise, where he has lived since 2002. The town was a haven for residents who were elderly or retired, many of them in mobile homes. A quarter of its residents were over 65, according to census data from 2017. Fourteen percent of the population was below the poverty line.\u201cWhat are they going to do?\u201d Mr. Hana said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to rebuild.\u201dResidents say Paradise began as a mining and lumber town but those industries dried up long ago. The few people employed in town mostly work at local businesses, like restaurants and auto body shops. He makes roughly $25,000 a year as a handyman, he said, enough to get by in Paradise. The median value of a house in Paradise was around $250,000, less than half the California median of $544,000, according to Zillow, the real estate data company.Mr. Hana sat outside the Neighborhood Church in Chico, a makeshift shelter for displaced residents, wearing donated pajama pants and running shoes. His long beard was segmented with black elastic bands. He lost his home, motorcycle and nearly all of his other belongings. He escaped with his truck, a few bags of tools and his two dogs: Roxy, a Doberman pinscher, and Winter, a German shepherd.\u201cIt\u2019s either God\u2019s way or nature\u2019s way of telling me I needed to downsize,\u201d he joked. \u201cI just didn\u2019t realize I needed to downsize to that extreme. Really, did we have to go that far?\u201dHe was worried about the state of his home\u2019s insurance because of a divorce, and he said he did not know when he would be able to get back to work or what he would do until then.\u201cBut I\u2019m really concerned about what\u2019s really going to happen with the town,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll never come back to what it was.\u201dGene McAnelly and Gary Brand, two 70-year-old friends in wheelchairs who said they both rely on Social Security checks to survive, both lost their homes in the fire. But they both are confident they will return, they\u2019re just not sure how yet. \u201cJust give me a tent,\u201d Mr. McAnelly said. \u201cI\u2019ll camp out.\u201dFirefighters in California can expect little help from the weather over the next few days.\u201cIt just seems to be a story about winds,\u201d said Bonnie Bartling, a weather specialist at the Los Angeles/Oxnard Weather Forecast Office.The strong winds propelled a new brush fire in Simi Valley on Monday morning, which quickly spread to cover about 105 acres before firefighters brought in under control.\u201cIt just hits home on the fact that we are still in significant fire weather and the existing fire is not our only concern,\u201d Chief Mark Lorenzen of the Ventura County Fire Department said.While winds are slowing over the Camp Fire in Northern California, the low humidity there means the trees, brush and foliage that can fuel the fire remain dry. No rain is expected this week and there\u2019s only a small chance of some early the following week.\u201cWe\u2019re keeping our fingers crossed for it,\u201d said Cory Mueller, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service\u2019s Sacramento office.Allyn Pierce got in his pickup truck and tried to race out of town when the fire swept through Paradise on Thursday. But he hit a wall of flames and was forced to turn around. Dozens of people are grateful that he did. Mr. Pierce helped lead what is being described by many as a heroic effort to treat the wounded in Paradise.Trapped in traffic as flames licked at the side of his truck, Mr. Pierce watched other cars catch fire and thought his was next. He held his coat against the window \u2014 a futile guard from the intense heat \u2014 and put on Peter Gabriel\u2019s \u201cIn Your Eyes\u201d to calm himself. He recorded a goodbye message to his family. \u201cJust in case this doesn\u2019t work out, I want you to know I really tried to make it out,\u201d he recalled.\u201cThen all of a sudden this bulldozer comes out of nowhere and knocks this burning truck out of the way,\u201d he said. Suddenly there was some room to maneuver. But instead of going forward toward safety, he turned around and headed back into the heart of Paradise, where the fire came from.Mr. Pierce ended up back at Paradise\u2019s main hospital, Adventist Health Feather River, where he manages the Intensive Care Unit. There he found other colleagues, who were also turned back by the fire, as well as injured Paradise residents looking for medical help.Adventist Health doctors and nurses, along with paramedics, firefighters and other emergency workers, set up a triage center in the hospital parking lot. They broke into the hospital for gurneys, oxygen tanks, intravenous bags and other gear and quickly went to work, treating about two dozen people while the fire raged around them. \u201cWe all worked together \u2014 no egos,\u201d Mr. Pierce said. \u201cIt was kind of joyful, and amazing to watch it all work.\u201dThen the hospital caught fire next to the triage center. As firefighters fought the flames, the rest of the staff relocated the patients and equipment about 100 yards away to the hospital\u2019s helipad, the only other area of asphalt somewhat safe from the fire. Eventually highway patrol officers said they had cleared a path toward safety, so the team loaded the victims into vehicles and drove in a caravan out of Paradise. Everyone made it out safely.\u201cThis is what we do,\u201d Mr. Pierce said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be brave, but any nurse, any health care worker, any cop, they were there and they all did their jobs and they all did it well.\u201dSeveral residents had stopped at a gas station in Calabasas on their way home, said Rashid Stevens, who said he saw cars packed to the brim come through early Monday morning.\u201cWe\u2019re all hoping it calms down here, finally,\u201d he said. \u201cThey deserve that at least.\u201dIt\u2019s still not certain what caused the most destructive wildfire in California history, but eyes are turning toward an all too familiar suspect \u2014 one of the state\u2019s investor-owned utilities.Southern California Edison also submitted a preliminary report to state regulators regarding the Woolsey Fire in Ventura County, citing an incident near its Chatsworth Substation minutes before the blaze was reported.Earlier this year, the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, determined that power lines and poles and other equipment owned by Pacific Gas and Electric was responsible for a dozen fires in Northern California in October 2017 that devastated wine country.Paul Doherty, a spokesman for PG&E, said the cause of the fire remains under investigation.And Edison advised its investors last month that its equipment may have been a source of the Thomas Fire last year in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. San Diego Gas and Electric Company has also been the subject of wildfire investigations.In September, California lawmakers passed a measure aimed at protecting against future fires. The legislation, Senate Bill 901, also protects PG&E from liability for such fires by enabling the utility to pass costs on to ratepayers.Consumer advocates called the bill a bailout and criticized lawmakers for failing to ensure that the power companies fulfilled their responsibilities in maintaining their equipment.After the bill passed, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded the ratings of the three power companies because concern about utilities\u2019 liability related to wildfires. On Monday, Moody\u2019s said the new wildfires highlighted \u201csevere credit risk for PG&E.\u201dJack Nicas reported from Paradise and Thomas Fuller from San Francisco.

When I was in middle school, she had a side hustle selling acrylic-rhinestone bug brooches. The jewelry was hard to move on its merits \u2014 even for the 1980s it was staggeringly ugly. But what she lacked in salable product, she made up for in sheer selling stamina. Every sleepover, school fair or birthday party, out would come the tray of bejeweled grasshoppers and stag beetles, glinting with Reagan-era menace. Presumably someone was making money from this venture \u2014 some proto-Trump barking orders from his tax haven \u2014 but it certainly didn\u2019t seem to be Rebecca\u2019s mother, whose sales pitches took on an ever more shrill note of desperation.Soon she had given up even the basic social pretense that we might actually want the brooches. The laws of supply and demand morphed seamlessly into the laws of guilt and obligation, and then into the laws of outright malice, mirroring the trajectory of capitalism itself.At that time, when naked hawking to your friends was still considered an etiquette blunder, the sales pitches by Rebecca\u2019s mother felt embarrassing \u2014 as gaudy and threatening to the social ecosystem as a purple rhinestone daddy longlegs. But 30 years later, at the height of the gig economy, when the foundation of working life has apparently become selling your friends things they don\u2019t want, I look back to that raw need in Rebecca\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes with something terrifyingly approaching recognition.The trick of doing this well, of course, is to act as if you aren\u2019t doing it at all \u2014 as if this is simply how you like to unwind in the evening, by sharing your views on pasta sauce with your 567,000 followers.

The sad truth is that many of us would probably make more money stacking shelves or working at the drive-through than selling our \u201cthing.\u201d The real prize is deeper, more existential.

{"Headline": "Trump Disparages Brexit Deal, Blindsiding May", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain continued her effort on Monday to sell her agreement to withdraw from the European Union to skeptics in Parliament, she was blindsided by President Trump, who called the agreement \u201ca great deal for the E.U.,\u201d and warned that, if it were adopted, it might obstruct a free trade deal between the United States and Britain.Mrs. May has long held out the prospects of a new trade deal between the United States and Britain as one of the payoffs of leaving the bloc, and negotiations were expected to begin as early as next spring, after Britain\u2019s March 29 exit, known as Brexit.According to Mrs. May\u2019s proposed withdrawal agreement, a bilateral trade deal could come into force at the end of a transition period in 2020.But Mr. Trump\u2019s comments suggested that Britain might never be able to conclude a bilateral trade deal with the United States, creating new difficulties for Mrs. May. She must overcome the resistance of around 90 lawmakers within her own party if she is to win parliamentary approval for the agreement next month.Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Mr. Trump offered a withering assessment of the deal, which was approved Sunday by the European Union\u2019s 27 member states.\u201cI think we have to take a look seriously at whether or not the U.K. is allowed to trade, because you know right now if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us and that wouldn\u2019t be a good thing,\u201d he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think that the prime minister meant that and hopefully she\u2019ll be able to do something about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, as the deal stands, she may not \u2014 they may not be able to trade with the U.S. and I don\u2019t think they want that at all, that would be a very big negative for the deal.\u201dIn response to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, a Downing Street spokesman said that under the proposed withdrawal agreement, it \u201cis very clear we will have an independent trade policy so that the U.K. can sign trade deals with countries around the world \u2014 including with the U.S.\u201dThe spokesman added that the government has \u201calready been laying the groundwork for an ambitious agreement with the U.S. through our joint working groups, which have met five times so far.\u201dThis was not the first time Mr. Trump has publicly undermined the British prime minister. He used a July visit to Britain to criticize her planned approach as too incremental, since the British economy would continue to be subject to many European regulations.\u201cI think he\u2019s got what it takes and I think he\u2019s got the right attitude to be a great prime minister,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump has regularly derided the European Union as an unfair trading partner to the United States.His comments on Monday were likely in reaction to headlines over the weekend announcing the approach of a new deal between Britain and the trading bloc, said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group. He added that Mr. Trump rarely gets involved in the details of trade agreements.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any linkage with trade negotiations,\u201d Mr. Bremmer said. \u201cHis knee-jerk reaction is that the E.U. is getting a better deal. He hates the E.U., the E.U. is always trying to take advantage, the U.K. is getting screwed.\u201dLast month, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, told the Senate that Mr. Trump \u201cintends to initiate negotiations on a trade agreement with the United Kingdom\u201d swiftly, \u201cas soon as it is ready after it exits from the European Union on March 29, 2019.\u201dBritain is the United States\u2019 seventh largest trading partner, with a total of $232 billion in goods and services flowing between the two countries every year. The United States is Britain\u2019s single biggest export market, followed by seven countries in the European Union.Under the proposed deal, Britain will continue to trade with the United States under existing bloc regulations until December 2020, when the transition period ends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Brazil\u2019s Far Right Leader Threatens the Amazon, One Tribe Pushes Back", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "\u201cWhere there is indigenous land,\u201d newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro has said, \u201cthere is wealth underneath it.\u201dSupported byThe Times traveled hundreds of miles into the Brazilian Amazon, staying with a tribe in the Munduruku Indigenous Territory as it struggled with the shrinking rain forest.The miners had to go.Their bulldozers, dredges and high-pressure hoses tore into miles of land along the river, polluting the water, poisoning the fish and threatening the way life had been lived in this stretch of the Amazon for thousands of years.So one morning in March, leaders of the Munduruku tribe readied their bows and arrows, stashed a bit of food into plastic bags and crammed inside four boats to drive the miners away.\u201cIt has been decided,\u201d said Maria Leusa Kab\u00e1, one of the women in the tribe who helped lead the revolt.The confrontation had begun.The showdown was a small part of an existential struggle indigenous communities are waging across Brazil. But the battle goes far beyond their individual survival, striking at the fate of the Amazon and its pivotal role in climate change.In recent years, the Brazilian government has sharply cut spending on indigenous communities, while lawmakers have pushed for regulatory changes championed by industries seeking unfettered access to parts of the Amazon that have been protected under the nation\u2019s constitution.Long before Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory, descendants of the original inhabitants of the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest tropical rain forest, had become increasingly vulnerable to bands of miners, loggers and farmers who have been clearing it at a rate environmentalists call unsustainable.Thousands of square miles of forest have already been razed in indigenous territories, where large-scale industrial activity is prohibited. With Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory, indigenous leaders are sounding more drastic warnings.\u201cHe represents an institutionalization of genocide in Brazil,\u201d said Dinam\u00e3 Tux\u00e1, the coordinator of Brazil\u2019s Association of Indigenous Peoples. A spokesman for Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s transition team said no one would comment on indigenous concerns, or respond to criticism of his views, because officials were focused on \u201cfar more important issues.\u201dExperts say the rate of deforestation in the Amazon, which soaks up enormous amounts of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide, makes it nearly certain that Brazil will miss some of the climate change mitigation goals it set in 2009, when it presented itself as an exemplar of sustainable development at a United Nations summit.The trendline has led federal prosecutors and environmentalists to say that the Amazon is on the brink of irreversible damage, potentially leading to the extinction of indigenous communities that have weathered centuries of calamities.Many indigenous leaders see the threats against their communities as a modern-day David-versus-Goliath struggle, with tribes facing violent bands of men who take advantage of the Amazon\u2019s lawlessness to turn a profit.Officially, the fight over the Amazon\u2019s future is playing out far away in the legislative chambers of the nation\u2019s capital. After Brazil\u2019s economy plunged into recession in 2014, politicians and industry leaders who favor loosening environmental protections gained the upper hand in a long-running contest over the rain forest.They have had some success in weakening protections enshrined in Brazil\u2019s 1988 Constitution. But in many instances, the legal battle lags far behind reality. As miners, loggers and farmers charge into the Amazon, legally or not, the landscape is being radically reshaped.\u201cThey haven\u2019t given up on changing the law, but they are prioritizing a strategy of creating facts on the ground,\u201d said Cleber Buzzatto, the executive secretary of the Indigenous Missionary Council, an indigenous rights group. \u201cBy creating an irreversible reality, they will then seek to change legislation.\u201dFrom the air, those facts on the ground look like bright orange gashes carved in the banks of lazy, zigzagging rivers that meander through the jungle.Few are as striking as the gold mine built around Posto de Vigil\u00e2ncia, or Lookout Point, one of the most remote Munduruku villages.Osvaldo Waru Munduruku, the rail-thin village chief, looked ashen as he explained how his tiny hamlet, home to about 15 families, became a hub of the illegal mining trade that has transformed the region in recent years.The National Indian Foundation, a federal agency that helps indigenous people, had its aid budget slashed in recent years, making it hard for remote villages to get food or basic services. Beyond that, many indigenous leaders like Mr. Waru long for much better living standards, education and opportunities than an isolated, arduous forest existence allows.So when the first \u201cwhite miners,\u201d as he calls them, dropped by in 2015 to suggest a partnership, Mr. Waru was tempted.He and other indigenous leaders knew there was little they could do to stop the miners. The brutal recession had driven large numbers of unemployed Brazilians into the jungle, hunting for gold. If a gold rush was about to break out in his part of Par\u00e1 state, he reasoned, the village might as well take a cut.This kind of co-optation has become common in remote areas of the jungle \u2014 and precisely what many indigenous leaders want to stop.\u201cDivide and conquer,\u201d said Fernanda Kaing\u00e1ng, an indigenous rights lawyer who belongs to the Kaingang tribe. \u201cThat is the strategy used to promote division with indigenous communities in order to secure access to wood, minerals and land.\u201dThe miners in Mr. Waru\u2019s village cleared a long strip for a runway and built a parallel settlement, with sleeping quarters and a small church. The miners rewarded him with 10 percent of the haul each month \u2014 worth a few hundred dollars, he said.\u201cWe would save it and save it until there was enough to buy things for the community,\u201d Mr. Waru said. It paid for a new boat motor, a generator and a radio.But then the bouts of diarrhea among children began. Erosion from the mines turned the river a sandy brown. Fish that had long been a staple of the community\u2019s diet now had high levels of mercury, which is used to extract gold.\u201cBefore, we had a lot of food here, but since the water became dirty, the fish vanished,\u201d he said. \u201cWe became concerned about the future of our children.\u201dMore than 896,000 indigenous people live in Brazil \u2014 less than 0.5 percent of the population. They belong to 300 tribes and speak more than 270 languages.Their ranks are small compared with the millions of indigenous people in countries like Bolivia and Peru. Yet half a century ago, they were nearly extinct.In 1500, when the first Portuguese settlers arrived, three to five million people lived in what would later become Brazil.Smallpox and other diseases brought by the Europeans wiped out hundreds of thousands. Enslavement followed, first in sugar plantations and later when the rubber boom drew profitseekers to the Amazon starting in the 1870s.By the 1960s, when Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship began, the indigenous population had fallen below 100,000. The generals regarded indigenous communities in the Amazon as impediments to development and drew them out of remote villages to assimilate them.That policy was formally abandoned in 1988, when Brazil\u2019s current Constitution was drafted. It sought to atone for past abuses, setting in motion a process to mark and protect indigenous territories. There are now more than 600 of them, encompassing more than 13 percent of the country \u2014 a fact that has long rankled Brazilian loggers, miners and farmers.But as the recession hit Brazil\u2019s impoverished northeast and Amazon states particularly hard, outsiders with families to feed ventured into Munduruku land. They revived gold mines that the government had shut down in the 1990s.When the miners showed up in indigenous villages along the Tapaj\u00f3s in 2015, they found communities in worse shape than their own.In one, Caro\u00e7al Rio das Tropas, families live in dilapidated wooden huts and sleep in hammocks. Skinny dogs with festering wounds sniff the ground for scraps of food. Poisonous snake bites are treated by using the body of the serpent as a makeshift tourniquet while the patient makes the six-hour boat ride to the nearest town.Some families fare better than others, with television sets, cellphones and appliances powered by rumbling old generators. That, said Ezildo Koro Munduruku, is the result of gold proceeds that have transformed the area \u2014 and the tribe.\u201cOur grandparents\u2019 generation, they had a strong organization,\u201d said Mr. Ezildo, 41. \u201cThey were all united. They had little contact with white people.\u201dAs mining camps multiplied, bringing processed foods, alcohol, drugs and prostitution to the area, several Munduruku men jumped at the chance to make money. Their diets changed and vices took hold. Many Munduruku worried that their way of life was being irreparably altered.\u201cWithin our families, this began pitting brother against brother,\u201d Mr. Ezildo said.Some indigenous leaders initially argued that mining could be a boon, without causing too much environmental damage. But the gold brought only modest and fleeting benefits, he said.\u201cWe are sick, physically and spiritually,\u201d Mr. Ezildo said. \u201cIf one earns 100 grams of gold, they will spend it on alcohol and prostitutes.\u201dAfter three days of tense debate, the women of the tribe gave the final word. Some pointed fingers defiantly at men in the room, while others cried as they took turns speaking into a scratchy microphone.When it was done, Ms. Kab\u00e1, the mother who helped lead the uprising, hung up a sign with bullet points to summarize the plan.\u201cParalyze illegal mining activity in the indigenous area; clean up the territory and expel all the invaders from Munduruku territory,\u201d it said.The miners knew a revolt was coming and had tried to head it off. They flew to the village by plane, bearing massive bags of rice, beans and pasta, along with packs of grape- and orange-flavored soda \u2014 a peace offering.Cleber da Silva Costa, the miner who brought the bounty, said he knew what he and his fellow miners were doing was illegal and harmful to the environment. Yet he argued that his crime was merely a symptom of more egregious wrong.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t have so many corrupt people in Congress, you might be able to consider preserving the environment,\u201d he said.Mr. da Silva, 47, a miner with three children, said the camp was doing more to preserve than destroy indigenous communities.\u201cThe little they have today is from miners,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t help. All the money gets stolen. We may be in the wrong. But out here, it\u2019s the law of survival.\u201dWeapons in hand, about 30 members of the tribe set out to evict the miners.But after trudging for more than six hours through rivers, mud and steep hills, they reached the first gold mining camp exhausted, hungry and thirsty.Amarildo Dias Nascimento, the camp supervisor, sensed that a confrontation was imminent. So, in a disarming gesture, he welcomed the Munduruku delegation effusively, instructing his cooks to put on a feast of grilled chicken, beans and rice for the guests.\u201cTonight, we\u2019ll just focus on joy,\u201d he said.Mr. Nascimento, 47, argued that the miners were merely trying to survive.\u201cMany have been left without options,\u201d he said, pointing at his men. \u201cDo you become a thief in Rio de Janeiro? Many are here because they don\u2019t want to resort to that. We\u2019re here fighting for our daily bread.\u201dThe next morning, Ms. Kab\u00e1 breast-fed her baby as she summoned the miners for the showdown.\u201cThis is our land,\u201d she said. \u201cThis territory is not yours. This is where we get sustenance for our children. We don\u2019t depend on gold, but rather the fruits and animals you are driving away.\u201dMr. Nascimento listened politely, his head bowed.\u201cThe moment you ask us to leave, we will do it immediately,\u201d he said.After the meeting broke up, several members of the Munduruku crammed into a bulldozer driven by one of the miners to avoid crossing a long, muddy patch of the trail on foot. But as they left, it was still unsettled when, or even if, the miners would leave.The Munduruku headed to the next mining camp, determined to deliver the same message. But the camp was larger, and they faced a far less welcoming group of miners. Several were drunk.\u201cWe had to turn back because they were armed,\u201d Ms. Kab\u00e1 said.Weeks later, dozens of heavily armed federal police officers and agents from Brazil\u2019s two environmental agencies descended on a mining camp in Munduruku land, sweeping in aboard four helicopters.While Brazilian lawmakers press to expand mining, logging and farming in the Amazon, some prosecutors and officials remain steadfastly against it, using their authority to enforce environmental laws for as long as they exist.But the raids do little. As usual, miners scattered into the forest as the aircraft approached, preventing investigators from making arrests or even asking many questions. Agents set fire to several machines and camp dwellings before taking off.\u201cIt was like something out of a war zone,\u201d said Valmir, a miner who used his first name because he feared prosecution. \u201cNone of us here are bandits. If the government offers some sort of employment for us outside of mining, no one would return to mining.\u201dDays later, federal prosecutors searched gold dealers in the nearest major urban areas \u2014 the second phase of the investigation. This one was called Midas Dilemma, a play on the tale of King Midas and his dangerous ability to turn everything he touched into gold.\u201cWe see a parallel with the exploitation of national riches,\u201d said Gecivaldo Vasconcelos Ferreira, a federal police officer who helped lead the investigation. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t exploited in a responsible way, they end up becoming a curse.\u201dLuis Cam\u00f5es Boaventura, a prosecutor on the case, says the authorities have only scratched the surface of an enormous industry backed by local and national politicians.There are hundreds, if not thousands, of gold mines along the Tapaj\u00f3s, and supply chains are deliberately opaque, making it hard to go after illegal mining bosses, he said.\u201cIt is a very serious problem,\u201d he said.In May, prosecutors issued a call to action, warning that the gold trade \u201ccould potentially lead to the extinction of indigenous communities and traditional cultures.\u201dFederal prosecutors have characterized the plight of some indigenous communities as \u201cgenocide.\u201dBut that stance is not widely shared by local, state or federal politicians. In Congress, a large coalition known as the ruralist bloc has championed scores of measures to ease access to minerals and potential farmland in protected areas.Mr. Bolsonaro, a veteran Congressman who easily won the presidential election last month, has long expressed the sentiment.\u201cIf it were up to me, we would not have any more indigenous areas in the country,\u201d he said after winning.Doing away with them would require changing the constitution. But Mr. Bolsonaro has threatened to take smaller steps on his own, like halting fines against companies and individuals who break the law.While campaigning for president, he called the system of protected lands obsolete, echoing the policy during the military dictatorship that such areas shackle economic growth and the individual prospects of indigenous people. The time had come, he said, to \u201creintegrate them into society\u201d and recognize that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to live in zoos.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro argues that Brazil can no longer tolerate having so much land set aside as indigenous territories, national parks and conservation zones.\u201cAll those reserves stymie our development,\u201d he said.Munduruku leaders opposed to mining were elated about the raids by federal agents. But soon, leaders like Ms. Kab\u00e1 received threats.\u201cThe expectation of the indigenous leaders when they denounced what was happening was that the state would go in and expel the white people,\u201d said Danicley de Aguiar, a Greenpeace activist who has counseled Munduruku leaders. That did not happen.And while protecting the environment and indigenous traditions is laudable, it\u2019s not realistic, argued Adonias Kab\u00e1 Munduruku, one of the tribe\u2019s leaders who does business with miners.\u201cIt\u2019s the only way for us, as indigenous miners, to send out children to study in the cities, to have them go to university,\u201d said Mr. Kab\u00e1, 40. \u201cParents want their children to learn, to be prepared, so they don\u2019t end up like their parents: working here in the mines.\u201dProsecutors have yet to charge anyone from the raids, and gold mining continues to flourish in the area.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that crime is paying off,\u201d said Paulo de Tarso Moreira Oliveira, a federal prosecutor.Lis Moriconi and Manuela Andreoni contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

In \u201cLatinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,\u201d Ed Morales fills in that blank as well as the long, painful, complex and intersectional struggle for identity that has shaped America\u2019s Latino community. As Morales notes, Latinx is just the latest in a series of terms, from Hispanic to Latino/a and even Latin@, employed to refer to individuals of Latin American heritage in an inclusive way.Morales, an adjunct faculty member at Columbia University who describes his own identity as that of a \u201cracialized person living in a U.S. megacity, who has a somewhat ambiguous phenotypical appearance,\u201d proves refreshingly introspective, weaving enough personal biography into the book to pull the work back from veering too far into inaccessible academic jargon. \u201cIn my own extended family, there is generally a disdain for blackness,\u201d he writes, and tells of his father, who \u201ctraded on Anglo-Americans\u2019 perceptions of his whiteness if it helped him in financial or social transactions, yet sought to avoid complete identification with whiteness when it came to his \u2018real\u2019 identity.\u201dAccording to the 2010 census, there were 55 million Latinos in the United States, and they made up 23 percent of Americans under the age of 18. Today, although Asian-Americans are now growing more quickly in percentage terms, Latinos are still growing fastest numerically. That means the destiny of the United States and the destiny of the Latino community are powerfully intertwined.\u201cThe American identity will never be fixed and final; it will always be in the making,\u201d Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote a quarter century ago in \u201cThe Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society.\u201d While Schlesinger\u2019s observation may be true, it is much easier asserted than accepted.With his boogeyman approach to electoral politics, Donald Trump has deftly exploited anxieties about the impact of America\u2019s changing demographics on our national identity, and no group has been more vilified by Trump for political purposes than Latinos. After declaring in his announcement speech that Mexico was sending rapists and drug runners to our country, months later Trump dismissed questions about the legitimacy of fraud claims against Trump University by insisting that the American-born judge of Mexican descent who was presiding over the case could not do his job right because \u201che\u2019s Mexican!\u201d His administration has been even worse, cruelly separating families apprehended at the Southern border, failing to adequately respond to Hurricane Maria and then dismissing the deaths of 3,000 Puerto Ricans as mere fantasy concocted by political opponents.It is no surprise, then, that the Latino community is widely misperceived and is especially in need today of voices to defend and humanize it. In this way, \u201cLatinx\u201d couldn\u2019t be timelier. For one thing, Morales shatters Americans\u2019 view of the community as monolithic. Although nearly two-thirds of Latinos claim Mexican heritage, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and a growing community of Latinos from Central and South America each have unique cultural and political experiences in the United States.Morales explores these to varying degrees, and, importantly, makes clear that Latinos have been integral to America\u2019s progress for generations, even as they have grappled with relative invisibility, outright rejection of their place in America and internal struggles about their own identity. He reminds us that it was Gonzalo and Fel\u00edcitas M\u00e9ndez, the Mexican-born father and Puerto Rican mother of daughter Sylvia Mendez, who challenged California\u2019s separate and unequal \u201cMexican schools,\u201d winning an appellate court victory in 1946 that paved the way for the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Brown v. Board of Education that struck down racial segregation in schools eight years later.Morales\u2019s writing can be hyperbolic at times. \u201cFor an American economy that has been largely stagnant, the opening of Cuba is a last-ditch opportunity to stave off looming worldwide economic disaster,\u201d he writes of President Obama\u2019s efforts to open up Cuba to American investment. Still, the book\u2019s deep dive into the crosscurrents of Latinx identity is a powerful reminder that, as Americans wrestle with questions about who is and who is not \u201cAmerican\u201d \u2014 and, indeed, questions about what it means to be an American in the 21st century \u2014 the nation can benefit immensely from the robust inclusion and understanding of a community that has spent generations grappling with nearly every facet of its own identity.Julian Castro was the mayor of San Antonio and the secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2017.Advertisement"}

The difference between the yields on five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, and the corresponding Treasuries hit 1.74 percentage points Wednesday, its lowest level of the year, according to Tradeweb. That spread is effectively the market\u2019s forecast of where inflation is heading, and it\u2019s down from 2.04 points at the start of October.Inflation is core to the Fed\u2019s mission. The central bank has a dual mandate of spurring full employment and keeping prices stable. This market\u2019s forecast for inflation is below the Fed\u2019s target for inflation of 2 percent.Critics of measures like the one above say it\u2019s too sensitive to short-term moves in markets such as oil (and, indeed, the most recent pullback in inflation expectations has corresponded with the tumble in oil prices over the past nine weeks).Still, the recent slide in the expectations is an indication that investors have grown more concerned about global growth and less worried that the United States\u2019 economy will overheat and cause a jump in inflation.The Fed has pressed ahead with rate increases this year as the economy has strengthened. Already, the central bank has raised its main policy rate three times and is expected to do so again next month.But in recent weeks, Fed officials also have appeared to soften their tone about future rate increases. On Wednesday, stocks surged after remarks by the central bank\u2019s chairman, Jerome H.

{"Headline": "Rural America\u2019s Own Private Flint: Polluted Water Too Dangerous to Drink", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byARMENIA, Wis. \u2014 The groundwater that once ran cool and clean from taps in this Midwestern farming town is now laced with contaminants and fear. People refuse to drink it. They won\u2019t brush their teeth with it. They dread taking showers.Rural communities call it their own, private Flint \u2014 a diffuse, creeping water crisis tied to industrial farms and slack regulations that for years has tainted thousands of residential wells across the Midwest and beyond.Now, fears and frustration over water quality and contamination have become a potent election-year issue, burbling up in races from the fissured bedrock here in Wisconsin to chemical-tainted wells in New Hampshire to dwindling water reserves in Arizona. President Trump\u2019s actions to loosen clean water rules have intensified a battle over regulations and environmental protections unfolding on the most intensely local level: in people\u2019s own kitchen faucets.In Wisconsin and other Midwestern states where Republicans run the government, environmental groups say that politicians have cut budgets for environmental enforcement and inspections and weakened pollution rules. In Iowa, for example, the Republican-led Legislature dismissed a package of bills that would have blocked any new large-scale hog operations until the state cleaned up its nitrogen-laden rivers and streams.\u201cThe regulations favor agriculture,\u201d said Gordon Gottbeheut, 77, whose nitrate-contaminated well near Armenia, Wis., sits next to a field that is injected with manure. \u201cWhen they keep cutting enforcement and people, there\u2019s nobody to keep track of what\u2019s happening.\u201dFew water-quality rules regulate those wells, meaning there is no water company to call, no backup system to turn to, and often no simple way to cure the contamination. In Flint, lead-tainted water prompted a public health emergency that led to a criminal investigation.Homeowners say they are forced to choose between installing expensive filtration systems, spending thousands to dig deeper wells, ignoring the problem or moving.One of those wells belongs to Carol Mount and Clark Elmore, whose home sits atop the sandy, permeable soil just down the road from a 3,000-cow dairy in the Armenia area. This spring, the nitrate levels in their well tested at 45 parts per million. The federal health limit is 10 parts.\u201cOur water is screwed,\u201d Ms. Mount said. Forty percent of her neighbors whose wells were tested this year also exceeded the federal standards for nitrates.MINN.MICH.35WISCONSINMinneapolis39Green Bay94ArmeniaLa Crosse43MadisonMilwaukeeIOWAChicagoILL.80 MILESBy The New York TimesSome voters who say they cannot drink from the taps or water their livestock without worrying about nitrates or E. coli bacteria say the state\u2019s deregulatory spree has gone too far.\u201cI blame the government,\u201d Jose Rangel said one afternoon as he sat in the living room of his trailer home, reviewing a letter confirming that his 27-foot-deep well had tested at double the federal safety limits for nitrates. \u201cWe can\u2019t do nothing about it. I\u2019ll vote. I want clean water.\u201dThe fight is echoing in state legislative races in New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina and Michigan, where candidates have put river contamination and chemical spills at the center of their campaigns.\u201cThey\u2019re hearing more about water than Donald Trump,\u201d said Daniel Squadron, executive director of Future Now, a group that supports liberal causes in statehouse races.The Walker administration has defended its environmental record, pointing to new restrictions on manure spreading in eastern Wisconsin, where contaminants can seep through the thin soil and into the cracked bedrock that supplies people\u2019s water.\u201cThe governor is committed to working to ensure that all families in Wisconsin are safe, and will continue to work with those who can help us achieve our shared goals,\u201d Austin Altenburg, a spokesman for Mr. Walker\u2019s campaign, said in an email.Jim Dick, a spokesman for the Department of Natural Resources, said its inspections of major livestock operations were higher than federal goals set by the Environmental Protection Agency for the past two years.Agriculture and dairy groups say that farmers drink the same water and also want it to be clean, and are trying to live up to state and federal environmental rules at a moment when low crop prices and President Trump\u2019s trade policies have rattled farmers across the country. In corners of Wisconsin, for example, farmers have set up state-supported nonprofits focused on improving water, air and soil health.But Kriss Marion, an organic farmer campaigning for State Senate through southern Wisconsin, said the state\u2019s wetlands, streams and groundwater were being stripped of protections as industrial farms were allowed to grow larger and larger. She said staff levels at the Department of Natural Resources had been \u201cgutted\u201d under Mr. Walker.\u201cThat\u2019s why I am running,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the fight of the decade.\u201dThe Republican incumbent in her district, Howard Marklein, supported a $3 billion incentive package championed by Mr. Walker to draw a huge new electronics factory to Wisconsin that also allowed the factory to bypass environmental and water rules. He has been endorsed by trade groups representing dairy, pork, cattle, potato and corn farmers.Water utilities that serve poor, rural areas fall far short of federal standards for drinking water, compared with urban water systems.\u201cIf it\u2019s your own private well, it\u2019s your own private problem,\u201d said Maureen Muldoon, a groundwater researcher and professor at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.In Armenia, it is now everyone\u2019s problem.Wells contaminated by bacteria or hazardous microorganisms can be blasted with chlorine and other disinfectants. But there is no easy fix for nitrates. The Armenia Growers Coalition, a group that represents three big farms in the area, including the 3,000-cow Central Sands Dairy, is delivering bottled water to people and has offered to pay for water-treatment systems.The group said it was working with homeowners, and blamed the contamination on \u201cfarming practices from decades ago.\u201d The owners of the Central Sands Dairy declined to comment beyond sending a statement through the Growers Coalition.For some, the water problems have tarnished the natural allure of an out-of-the way town whose nonfarm economy consists of two bars, one of them a strip club. Away from the noise and smell of the thousands of cows, houses are tucked into the red pines and pinned to the banks above the Wisconsin River.\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d said Ms. Mount, whose well tested at four times the safety limits for nitrates. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Civics Lessons a Constitutional Right? This Student Is Suing for Them", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "Many see the lack of civics in schools as a national crisis. A federal lawsuit says it also violates the law.Supported byAleita Cook, 17, has never taken a class in government, civics or economics. In the two social studies classes she took in her four years at a technical high school in Providence, R.I. \u2014 one in American history, the other in world history \u2014 she learned mostly about wars, she said.Left unanswered were many practical questions she had about modern citizenship, from how to vote to \u201cwhat the point of taxes are.\u201d As for politics, she said, \u201cWhat is a Democrat, a Republican, an independent? Those things I had to figure out myself.\u201dNow she and other Rhode Island public school students and parents are filing a federal lawsuit against the state on Thursday, arguing that failing to prepare children for citizenship violates their rights under the United States Constitution.They say the state has not equipped all of its students with the skills to \u201cfunction productively as civic participants\u201d capable of voting, serving on a jury and understanding the nation\u2019s political and economic life.The state allows local school districts to decide for themselves whether and how to teach civics, and the lawsuit says that leads to big discrepancies. Students in affluent towns often have access to a rich curriculum and a range of extracurricular activities, like debate teams and field trips to the State Legislature, that are beyond the reach of poorer schools.The lawyers for the plaintiffs hope the case will have implications far beyond Rhode Island, and potentially prompt the Supreme Court to reconsider its 45-year-old ruling that equal access to a quality education is not a constitutionally guaranteed right.\u201cOur real hope for reinvigorating our democratic institutions comes with the young people and the next generation,\u201d said Michael Rebell, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs and executive director of the Campaign for Educational Equity at Teachers College, Columbia University. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really seeking is for the courts, especially the Supreme Court, to take a strong stance on getting back to first principles on what the school system was established for in the United States.\u201dHorace Mann, an early advocate of compulsory public schooling, wrote in 1847 that education\u2019s purpose was to foster \u201cconscientious jurors, true witnesses, incorruptible voters.\u201dMore recently, the retired Supreme Court justices Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and David Souter have called for a revival of civic instruction. Since the election of President Trump, politicians from both parties have proposed civics lessons as a way to combat political ignorance and division.The case is riding a wave of bipartisan anxiety about a national lack of civic engagement and knowledge, from voter participation rates that are among the lowest in the developed world to pervasive disinformation on social media.Rhode Island does not require schools to offer courses in government or civics, does not require standardized tests in those subjects or in history, and does not provide training for teachers in civics, the lawsuit says.Beyond civics classes, the suit also argues that the state\u2019s neediest children, particularly Latino immigrants and students with special needs, are failing to acquire the basic academic skills they need to effectively exercise their rights to free speech and voter participation. Among eighth grade English-language learners in 39 states, those in Rhode Island ranked last in math and second to last in reading on the 2017 National Assessment of Educational Progress.The Rhode Island Department of Education declined to comment on the allegations in the suit.The argument Aleita\u2019s lawyers are making will be a heavy legal lift, as federal courts have, for four decades, been hostile to education inequality claims.The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the Rhode Island case believe that, by focusing on civics, they can take advantage of an opening in the Rodriguez ruling. Justice Lewis F. Powell, writing for the majority, agreed with a dissenter in the case, Justice Thurgood Marshall, that educational inequality might rise to the level of a constitutional violation if it prevented students from exercising their \u201cright to speak and to vote.\u201dNearly every state constitution guarantees the right to an adequate education. But \u201cthere is broad skepticism, even on the part of many legal liberals, that the Constitution of the United States gets involved in these sorts of matters,\u201d said Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Chicago and an expert on education litigation.Mr. Rebell, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, represented New York students for 13 years in a state-level case, which led to a landmark 2003 ruling in the students\u2019 favor over equitable school funding. But he said he continued to believe in the importance of a federal strategy. He said the civics case would make a novel, and nonpartisan, appeal to the nation\u2019s most prominent judges and justices.\u201cSchools are the place where students can, and should, learn about democratic institutions, their importance, their values and disposition,\u201d Mr. Rebell said. \u201cI\u2019m banking on the fact that what you might call establishment Republicans like John Roberts will really look at this on the merits, and will consider the broad implications.\u201dHistory and civics have become curricular \u201cstepchildren,\u201d said Luther Spoehr, a professor of history and education at Brown University in Providence, because of the pressure on schools to raise test scores in reading and math and prepare children for work in an unforgiving economy.Though he acknowledged that standardized tests are unpopular with many parents and teachers, Professor Spoehr said that without higher-stakes exams in government or history, schools would probably never give priority to those subjects.\u201cWhat\u2019s taught is what\u2019s tested,\u201d he said.Even if the Rhode Island lawsuit is not legally successful, he said he hoped it would create political pressure for better education in citizenship.Aleita Cook, the plaintiff, is finally getting a powerful civics lesson by participating in the case. Though she will soon graduate from the Providence Career & Technical Academy, with plans to study photography in college, she said she wanted Rhode Island public schools to improve for her siblings\u2019 sake.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping we win this lawsuit and change it to where my younger brothers can have a really good education, and go into adulthood knowing how to vote, how to do taxes, and learning basic things that you should know going into the real world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gun-Safety Issue Is Actually Helping Democrats", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMidterm election results suggest that the power of the N.R.A. may be diminishing.Mr. Spitzer has written five books on gun policy.It is an unsettling coincidence that mass shootings bookended the 2018 election, from a Pittsburgh synagogue on Oct. 27 to a bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Nov. 7. The election that took place in between, though, demonstrated that Democrats and even some Republicans found gun-safety advocacy a boon to their campaigns in a way not seen in a long time. In comparison with previous elections, the gun-rights forces\u2019 customary blaring megaphone seemed nowhere near as loud as usual \u2014 or as effective. This is borne out by an examination of public attitudes, candidate positions, money and exposure.Consider first the public environment. According to Pew Research Center analysis, more Americans now favor gun regulation (52 percent) over gun rights (44 percent), a reversal from 2016. And 57 percent say gun laws should be stricter, compared with 52 percent in 2017. A recent Kaiser Foundation poll found gun policy to be the third most important concern of voters, behind health care and the economy. Similarly, Election Day exit polling found the same rank order, except that gun policy was bumped to fourth by immigration \u2014 a position it probably would not have lost but for President Trump\u2019s strenuous efforts to exploit immigration anxiety. An NBC News exit poll reported that 60 percent of voters favored stronger gun laws, including 42 percent of gun owners.Candidates embraced the gun-safety agenda this cycle to a degree not seen since at least the 2000 elections, when Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, made it key to his campaign messaging. According to Mark Kelly, who founded the gun-safety organization Americans for Responsible Solutions with his wife, the former House member Gabrielle Giffords, only four of 36 candidates listed on the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cred to blue\u201d list in 2016 included the gun issue in their platforms. (The \u201cred to blue\u201d list refers to Republican-held seats Democrats hope to gain.) This year, 38 of 59 candidates on the list included the issue. Candidates for Congress and other offices around the country aggressively touted their support for stronger gun measures, in races in Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia and elsewhere. Consider it no coincidence that many of these states suffered recent mass shootings.Members of Congress, including ambitious ones like Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who ran against Nancy Pelosi to be party leader in 2016, and Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, both had A ratings from the National Rifle Association. But both reversed course, trading their A for an N.R.A. F after recent mass shootings. In Pennsylvania\u2019s First Congressional District, representing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, both the Democratic and Republican candidates for Congress advertised their support for stronger gun laws, leading gun-safety forces to split their endorsements between the two (Brian Fitzpatrick, the incumbent Republican, won narrowly).Part of the appeal of the gun-safety issue arises from its resonance with women, for whom gun violence is a top concern, and who constituted a key swing constituency. According to a survey conducted by the Y.W.C.A., a top tier of personal concerns among women includes \u201ckeeping their families safe from gun violence.\u201dIn the money race, gun-safety groups apparently topped the N.R.A., which has spent about $11 million in the midterms. Combined gun-safety group spending was about $12 million \u2014 a first at the national level. If the amount of N.R.A. spending seems low, it is: The organization spent twice that in 2014 and five times that amount in 2016. By its own admission, the N.R.A. has money problems. It has also suffered political black eyes from corporate boycotts, allegations of improper ties with Russian agents seeking to influence the 2016 elections and relentless political attacks by the student-led movement that arose from the Parkland school shooting.In five targeted congressional races \u2014 Colorado Sixth, Georgia Sixth, Minnesota Second, Texas Seventh and Virginia Seventh \u2014 gun-safety groups spent major money on behalf of gun-safety supporters, and all won. Especially notable is Georgia\u2019s Sixth District, where Lucy McBath, a Democrat whose son was killed in a racially motivated shooting, defeated a recently elected Republican in a district once represented by Newt Gingrich. Jason Crow, a Democratic military veteran, defeated an incumbent Republican in Colorado\u2019s Sixth District, which includes the site of a 2012 movie theater shooting. He also embraced the gun-safety issue, with a boost from Vote Vets (they allied themselves with the Giffords-Kelly group). In at least three House races \u2014 Florida Twenty-fifth, Minnesota Eighth and North Carolina Thirteenth \u2014 the N.R.A. spent significantly on pro-gun-rights candidates who won.The Senate tally was roughly a draw. N.RA. money helped bring down Democrats in Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee, but it fell short against Democrats re-elected in Montana and West Virginia. In the one Senate race where the opposing sides spent heavily, the Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, edged out her opponent in Arizona. And in Florida, the Republican Rick Scott left the N.R.A. with no one to back in this traditionally gun-friendly state after he broke with the organization to sign several new gun measures into law as governor. Among governor\u2019s races, N.R.A. efforts helped the vote leaders in Florida and Georgia (both are subject to recounts as of this writing) and the Oklahoma winner, but they fell short in Nevada, Oregon and Wisconsin.Even more telling has been the explosion of political ads supporting stronger gun laws. According to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal, pro-gun-law ads aired more than 100,000 times as of September 2018 \u2014 an increase by a factor of 22 over 2014. The ratio of gun-control to gun-rights ads this year also favors the control side much more. For example, the swing states of Florida and Nevada aired no pro-control ads four years ago. This year, they aired more than 45,000. For tossup races as defined by the Cook Political Report, gun ads were more likely to support stronger laws. In tossup House races, 93 percent of the gun-related ads supported stronger gun laws.So why the sea change in public attitudes and emboldened candidates running squarely on gun safety? The answer begins 18 years ago. After Al Gore\u2019s 2000 defeat, Democrats decided, rightly or wrongly, that the gun issue was a poison pill for them, so they all but abandoned it. This left the national gun debate mostly in the hands of the gun-friendly Bush administration and gun-rights supporters. That one-sided national debate turned public attitudes more strongly in favor of gun rights. Democratic silence ended with the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting and President Obama\u2019s decision to promote stronger gun measures in Congress. The effort failed, but it began a new kind of political momentum as new and well-funded gun-safety groups formed, grass-roots mobilization and fund-raising dedicated to gun safety increased, mass shootings continued and candidates began to speak about the issue.Robert Spitzer is a political scientist at SUNY Cortland and the author of five books on gun policy, including \u201cGuns Across America\u201d and \u201cThe Politics of Gun Control.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Gives the Logo Its Legs", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLogomania is an obsession with no end in sight. Here\u2019s why. At a party last month, Gabriela Silvarolli embraced the full Fendi. Ms. Silvarolli, a stylist and designer, was swathed from her chin to her calves in the company\u2019s signature double FF logo. Her turnout was excessive, she knew. \u201cAs recently as a year ago, you didn\u2019t wear logos,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had to be discreet.\"But a glance at the crowd at Fendi\u2019s Madison Avenue flagship \u2014 matrons, films stars and assorted style-world moguls tricked out in Fendi logo regalia \u2014 persuaded her otherwise. \u201cNowadays everything is allowed,\u201d Ms. Silvarolli said. \u201cNothing is too much.\u201dEven mass market chains are championing the movement, like Zara, whose stores and website are awash in logo coats, shawls and frocks. So pervasive is fashion\u2019s logo fixation that it vies with, and even outpaces, that of previous, more overtly ostentatious eras. Logomania\u2019s checkered past dates from the \u201960s and \u201970s, buoyed in those decades by an outpouring of licensed wares: Courr\u00e8ges double C\u2019s and Bill Blass back-to-back B\u2019s affixed to sunglasses, satchels and all manner of unlikely tchotchkes. Logos flourished again in the late \u201980s and \u201990s as strident, some say garish, symbols of wealth \u2014 and the brash insignia of the hip-hop generation \u2014 and then faded. They bounced back in the 2000s, only to make a shamefaced retreat in the wake of the 2008 stock market collapse, too showy to display on the streets. So it seems perverse that fashion\u2019s love affair with splashy status badges shows no signs of cooling. Logos raced like a contagion through the spring 2019 collections, breaking out on camp shirts and chain belts at Chanel, on hosiery and sneakers at Prada, on epaulets at Balenciaga and spreading over entire ensembles at Gucci, the luxury house that has been widely credited with lending this trend its impetus.\u201cRight now,\u201d said Anna Ross, the associate women\u2019s wear editor at WGSN, a trend forecasting service, \u201cthere seems to be no expiration date.\u201dSo what gives logos their staying power? For starters, the look is being reimagined in a way that speaks expressly to the young. \u201cChanel, Fendi and others have obviously seen a huge amount of social currency in appealing to a millennials and Generation Z,\u201d Ms. Ross said. Those bands of streetwise consumers flaunt initialed T-shirts, boots, sneakers, belts and totes with a dash of irony. \u201cFor a brand, this may not be the most subtle marketing strategy,\u201d she added, \u201cbut companies see that it\u2019s working.\u201dA similar wisdom impelled Burberry last month to introduce a monogram collection, fresh renditions of its T-shirts stamped with the interlocking TB\u2019s (the initials of Thomas Burberry, the company\u2019s founder), a move conceived to invoke the company\u2019s decades-long heritage. Variations of the monogram shirt will be released each month on the company\u2019s social media and mobile apps. For some brands, glutting the marketplace with highly visible logo products acts as a kind of safety net, helping sustain the bottom line, said Roma Cohen, an owner of Alchemist, an outpost of cutting-edge fashions in Miami Beach. Such signature wares, he noted, are often funneled into the gray market. Mr. Cohen was using an industry term for goods sold by luxury brands to retailers that resell them to other stores or agents not necessarily approved by the brand. Unlike counterfeit goods, these products are legitimate, proliferating in locales as far-flung as China, Italy, Turkey and Tunisia. Such hyper-saturation carries risks. \u201cThese rides are like a roller coaster,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cRelying on logos can take you to your peak right away. But it can also date you and leave you in the shadow of the next hot brand.\u201d For now, the trend retains its relevance, firmly rooted in its time. Social media is its driver, the logos resonating with those selfie addicts who like to flash their heavily monogrammed trophies on Snapchat and Instagram, their status readily identifiable on an image the size of a postage stamp. But status is not the only draw. Younger people are adopting logos to signal their allegiance to a tribe or cause, said Milton Pedraza, the founder and chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a consulting firm in New York. Flashing Gucci double G\u2019s can be read as a homage to the company, which has publicly championed gender fluidity and turned its back on fur. \u201cFor youthful fans, the Gucci logo is a tag, a way of stating, \u2018I am socially responsible,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pedraza said. \u201cIt gives you a very clear identity that goes beyond a fashion statement.\u201dMs. Chamblin\u2019s gear was by no means intended to signal \u201can in-your-face attitude,\u201d she said. It was instead a cheerful nod to upbeat times and a robust economy, she said, a visual statement announcing, \u201cI\u2019m happy to be where I\u2019m at.\u201dWhat sets logomania apart in this go-round is its function as a kind of social leveler, a trend accessible in one form or another to both Howard Street skateboarders and the Gucci-shod denizens of the Upper East Side. As ubiquitous on gilt chain belts and snakeskin bags as they are on hoodies, backpacks and their street-inflected kin, logos have a way of upending conventional notions of status, wealth and taste.There is humor in the trend and a piquant irony, said Sharon Graubard, a partner in Mint Moda, a trend forecasting firm in New York. Devotees often flaunt initials with a wink, embracing status logos as yet another coy expression of the \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u2019 zest for ugly chic that gave rise in recent months to designer crocs and scrunchies.One thing is certain: \u201cThis is not Melania with her perfect Gucci belt,\u201d Ms. Graubard said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s subversive, you know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To the Center or the Right? What 2 More Years of a Republican-Led House Might Look Like", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFighting for their political lives, they have given little thought to an agenda should they hold onto power. But a few items are clear: more tax cuts, less spending and a bull\u2019s-eye on Obamacare.WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans, fighting hard to retain their majority and uncertain about who will lead them after Tuesday\u2019s elections, have deferred the messy work of planning a legislative agenda until after the votes are tallied next week.And at the White House, where aides privately view House Republican chances as slim, postelection planning has revolved around imagining a world in which Democrats are in control.\u201cThis is inevitably a referendum on what the administration has done and on the state of the economy,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, a senior Republican from Oklahoma. \u201cYou can lay down an agenda, but I don\u2019t think it would make too much difference.\u201d Continued Republican control would defy historical odds and the expectations of both parties. But if they maintain their grip, Republicans would claim a conservative mandate to cut taxes, chip away at the Affordable Care Act and shrink federal spending. Further down the list: giving President Trump some bipartisan legislative accomplishments ahead of his 2020 re-election campaign. A Republican victory at this point would be \u201can affirmation of Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Andrew Roth, the top lobbyist for Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group.With the retirement of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and dozens of the chamber\u2019s most senior members, Republicans will have a dramatic makeover next year regardless of the electoral outcome. Who replaces Mr. Ryan and the size of the majority will shape what is possible.Mr. Ryan\u2019s most likely successor, his No. 2, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, has used the last year to position himself as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill and would most likely work hand in glove with the White House. If Republicans retain control with only the slimmest of majorities, Mr. McCarthy\u2019s highest-profile challenger within the party, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, could extract concessions for the members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, including important chairmanships and other committee posts. That would push the agenda to the right. But there could be a countervailing force: Republicans could hang on thanks to a handful of moderate lawmakers in districts where Mr. Trump is unpopular, and those lawmakers, scattered around suburban districts that will be competitive again in 2020, could try to move the party toward the center. In that case, the focus could be on bipartisan initiatives like infrastructure spending and an overhaul of the criminal justice system. They could at least complicate efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act or squeeze entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid.But the party quickly went to work trying to write fiction into reality. \u201cWe will continue to work with the White House and Treasury over the coming weeks\u201d to develop a plan, said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.More likely, Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration will serve as a blueprint for tax writers. Mr. Brady is intent on making permanent the individual tax cuts that passed last December but will now expire after 2025. Mr. Brady has said the party would use the same parliamentary legerdemain that ensured passage of the first tax cut to make sure the next one can escape a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.In 2017, Republicans fell short of repealing the Affordable Care Act. With a far narrower majority in the House and the bill\u2019s popularity on the rise, the party would be unlikely to take another run at outright repeal, officials said. But they could chip away at its remaining pillars.Others would push lawmakers to try to go further and cut at the heart of the law\u2019s popularity: its protections of those with pre-existing conditions.\u201cRepublicans need to grow a spine and confront that debate head-on,\u201d said Mr. Roth, who believes Democrats have scared Republicans into abandoning their position that the \u201cheavy federal mandate\u201d is driving up insurance costs.With a presidential election looming, Republicans also face a consequential choice: work with Democrats to achieve some policy victories and lift Mr. Trump, or take advantage of what could be a dwindling period of unified Republican control to press rightward.Lawmakers in both parties believe there is at least a chance that a Republican House and Senate could pass bipartisan legislation overhauling incarceration laws and prison sentencing, which would include changes to mandatory minimum sentences and programs meant to reduce recidivism. \u201cThe first thing you need to be is gracious,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cThank you very much to the American people for allowing us to stay in charge. You need to challenge the Democrats to find common ground.\u201dConservatives argue that an election victory would give Republicans their best chance to address the ballooning federal deficit without raising taxes; they should prioritize making long-sought adjustments to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and welfare programs. Leadership aides and outside policy advisers said programs for the poor may be the most politically palatable for the time being. Even Mr. Cole, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee who said he would like to see a serious attempt at entitlement changes, saw little appetite on Capitol Hill or at the White House for more politically painful adjustments to programs that primarily help older Americans.House Republicans have also pledged to fund Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall before the end of this Congress, and the president keeps pushing, most recently with a swipe at Mr. Ryan on Wednesday.The composition of the House would make a significant difference in any infrastructure package. If Republican moderates are able to maintain their seats, Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said he would push to invest political capital early in ambitious legislation that could incorporate some Democratic priorities and lower the temperature in the Capitol.\u201cIt\u2019s good for the country, it\u2019s good for the economy and it\u2019s one way we can get Schumer and Trump in the same room,\u201d he said, referring to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. But if moderates are wiped out, a conservative-dominated majority would most likely embrace a less-costly plan that relies heavily on private investment to build roads, bridges and broadband capacity, pairing it with welfare changes putting into place new work requirements to offset some of the cost. The resulting legislation would be unlikely to win Democratic support, but framed as a broad work bill, it could be pitched to disparate parts of Mr. Trump\u2019s coalition.\u201cYou need to try to figure out what these policies are that address the big governing coalition that we are trying to hold,\u201d said Tim Chapman, the executive director of Heritage Action for America, a conservative lobbying group.

And you may have even heard of microinfluencers, who do the same thing for a still sizable but somewhat smaller social media audience \u2014 from the tens to low hundreds of thousands.Now get ready for the nanoinfluencers.That is the term (\u201cnanos\u201d for short) used by companies to describe people who have as few as 1,000 followers and are willing to advertise products on social media.Their lack of fame is one of the qualities that make them approachable. When they recommend a shampoo or a lotion or a furniture brand on Instagram, their word seems as genuine as advice from a friend.Brands enjoy working with them partly because they are easy to deal with. In exchange for free products or a small commission, nanos typically say whatever companies tell them to.People who know Ms. Baker were surprised when the hashtags used to denote advertisements \u2014 #sponsored and #ad \u2014 started popping up on her account. They were also a little impressed that she was Instagramming like an influencer.\u201cMy friends were like: \u2018Wait a minute \u2014 you don\u2019t have tens of thousands of followers.

{"Headline": "Interest Rates Likely to Rise in December, Recap of Fed Meeting Shows", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates at its next policymaking meeting in mid-December and to continue raising rates next year, according to the minutes of the central bank\u2019s last meeting published on Thursday.The minutes said most Fed officials were confident about the economy when they met in early November.Some Fed officials at the meeting said they were less certain about the economic outlook and about the Fed\u2019s policy plans. But the account of the meeting provided no indication that the central bank is preparing to pause, notwithstanding the hopes of investors and frequent public attacks by President Trump.The Fed\u2019s policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, last raised its benchmark rate in September, to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, then left the rate unchanged at the November meeting. The central bank is widely expected to increase the rate by a quarter of a percentage point in December.Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said that the market had overreacted, and that the minutes \u201cdo not suggest that Fed officials anticipated an imminent pause in the tightening cycle.\u201d He said he expected a rate increase in December and two more during the first half of 2019.The market\u2019s reaction on Thursday was much more subdued, with the S&P 500 index closing down 0.2 percent.The Fed is seeking to wean markets from the expectation that it would continue to raise its benchmark rate every quarter. A rate increase in December would be the fifth straight quarterly increase.The account emphasized that the central bank\u2019s policy \u201cwas not on a preset course,\u201d a phrase Mr. Powell also has used in recent remarks. The minutes said the Fed might remove language that predicts \u201cfurther gradual increases\u201d from its next policy statement to underscore the point that officials will make decisions based on the latest data. But the central bank also said most officials expect \u201cfurther gradual increases.\u201dMr. Trump has loudly complained that the Fed is throttling growth by raising rates. He renewed his attacks earlier this week, insisting in a pair of interviews that the Fed\u2019s march toward higher rates posed a significant threat to the economy.Some economists agree with Mr. Trump that the Fed should take a break from raising rates, noting that there is little sign that the economy is in danger of overheating. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that a key measure of inflation rose by 1.78 percent over the 12 months ending in October, below the 2 percent annual pace that the central bank regards as optimal.Lawrence Summers, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, also has urged caution. In an interview with Fox Business Network scheduled to air on Friday, Mr. Summers said he disapproved of the way Mr. Trump was expressing his concerns, but he agreed with the substance. \u201cI do think that there are more risks of overtightening than there are of under-tightening right now,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell has said that the central bank is moving forward with rate increases because the economy is in good health, and that the Fed is trying to strike a balance between allowing the current expansion to continue and ensuring that inflation remains under control.The economy grew at a 3.5 percent annualized pace in the third quarter, job growth is strong and wages are rising, buttressing the intentions of Fed officials to continue raising rates.But the minutes noted \u201csome signs of slowing in interest-sensitive sectors\u201d like housing and car sales and said that \u201cconditions remain depressed\u201d in the agricultural sector because of trade tensions.Fed officials at the November meeting also reviewed a change in the mechanics of monetary policy that the central bank adopted after the 2008 financial crisis.Before the crisis, the Fed raised interest rates by draining reserves from the banking system. During the crisis, the Fed purchased trillions of dollars in Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it paid for by pumping reserves into the banking system. The Fed could have reversed the process before raising rates. Instead, it chose to raise rates in a new way, by paying banks to leave reserves untouched.The Fed is slowly reducing its bond holdings, and officials are debating whether to slash them to a level that would allow a return to the pre-crisis system. The account of the November meeting said officials were pleased with the new system, which has increased the Fed\u2019s control over financial and economic conditions, but made no final decision.Officials did approve a small tweak. Under the new approach, the Fed aims to keep its benchmark rate near the midpoint of a quarter-point range. Initially, the interest rate the Fed paid banks on reserves was set at the top of the range.But earlier this year, the Fed set the interest rate on reserves 0.05 percentage point below the top of the range, to help keep the benchmark rate closer to the middle of the range. That has been insufficient, and Fed officials approved a further reduction, if necessary before the December meeting, according to the minutes.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Promise of China", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWestern luxury money has been pouring into China at a rapid rate this fall.Next, Cond\u00e9 Nast International unveiled plans for Vogue Hong Kong, the 26th global version of the fashion title with a print edition published in the traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong and a bilingual website, in Chinese and English. Then, in its latest earnings call, Ralph Lauren said it had opened 10 additional stores in mainland China in the last quarter, putting it on track to open more than 50 by the end of 2019. And Coach said it would stage its first runway show in China on Dec. 8, a blockbuster spectacle and after-party titled \u201cCoach Lights Up Shanghai.\u201dChina\u2019s great luxury promise appears to have the sector\u2019s biggest power players well and truly in its thrall. But in the background, dark clouds have also been gathering.A brewing trade war with the United States, the weakening renminbi and the sputtering growth of China\u2019s economy in recent months all have executives on edge. During the fall Golden Week, a holiday period around the Oct. 1 National Day observance when many Chinese consumers splurge on travel and luxury goods, sales grew at the slowest pace since 2000, according to data from China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce.The painful luxury industry downturn that occurred worldwide between 2013 and 2016 in the wake of a Chinese government clampdown on corruption and a spate of terrorist attacks in Europe \u2014 ending years of soaring sales growth \u2014 is still fresh in the minds of many. Could a similar situation be about to unfold again?An inflection point came in early October, at the end of Golden Week, when social media posts showing emptied shopping bags, luggage searches and snaking lines at airport customs checks suggested that the state was cracking down on the practice known as daigou, when Chinese travelers buy high-end merchandise on trips abroad and sell the items at a profit after they return home. Spooked that the appetite for luxury goods in China could tip into a rapid slump, investor jitters prompted a global market sell-off, largely hitting European players such as LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Kering, Richemont, Burberry and Prada. Companies in the United States, like Tapestry and Tiffany & Co., also felt the strain.Some brands have sounded notes of caution about the current and future state of Chinese consumer confidence.\u201cIn the past few months I would say there has been a slowing down of consumption, and probably the Chinese consumer is becoming more careful in what he or she does,\u201d said Ermenegildo Zegna, chief executive of the Italian men\u2019s luxury house of the same name. \u201cI am more cautious than three months ago. For next year, we are going to plan a conservative budget because there are many uncertainties in the air and you have to be realistic.\u201dSo what will come next for a sector that Bain & Co. still predicts will grow by 6 to 8 percent, to \u20ac281 billion from \u20ac276 billion, this year? Given the money still being plowed into the region by brands and investors alike, could the stock market be overreacting?\u201cClearly stocks were hit dramatically in past weeks, with investors keen to avoid being stung as they were in the last downturn,\u201d said Erwan Rambourg, global co-head of consumer and retail research at HSBC. \u201cHowever, it is possible that these macro fears are overextended and we can expect more of a soft landing.\u201cWe believe the current \u2018slowdown\u2019 is more to do with being a period of normalization, after two years of phenomenal growth,\u201d he added. \u201cThe sector decline will not be on as steep a slope as the market seems to expect.\u201dThomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods equity research at Citigroup, concurred. He noted that many luxury brands had re-evaluated their expansion strategies in China in recent years, particularly around retail networks, targeted digital marketing and pricing, so their business \u2014 and bottom lines \u2014 are better protected in the event of another cyclical downturn.He also added that luxury\u2019s latest bull run had not been wholly dependent on Chinese spending: The American market has improved significantly in the last year, while many brands have posted double-digit sales growth in both Europe and Japan.\u201cClearly China has been the white-hot engine for luxury growth lately \u2014 but this is also a global story, and price harmonization across markets is better than it was a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Chauvet said. \u201cThe central question now should be whether international demand drivers are still in place to support a healthy level of sales and earnings growth over the next 12 months as China moderates.\u201dHowever, some market observers have highlighted positive consumer trends in China. As the country looks for ways to shore up its domestic economy, the government crackdown on daigou and the lowering of import duties this summer to encourage consumers to make purchases at home rather than chasing lower prices abroad are likely to make their mark, according to Angela Wang, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group and co-author, with the Chinese investment holding conglomerate Tencent, of a recently published study on China\u2019s luxury market. She said that, although Chinese customers now are responsible for 32 percent of luxury goods sales worldwide, that number is still expected to grow to 40 percent by 2024 and power 75 percent growth of the global market. Unsurprisingly, millennials \u2014 particularly educated women \u2014 will be the driving force.\u201cLuxury shoppers in China have an average age of 28, a majority have college degrees and are far better educated than their parents,\u201d Ms. Wang said, noting that more than 50 percent of luxury customers now lived in second- and third-tier cities like Tianjin and Dalian, bolstering the importance of online platforms as there are few premium malls in those locations.\u201cSocial shopping is now 11 percent of total luxury commerce in China and growing at a tremendous rate,\u201d she added. \u201cAll this momentum won\u2019t disappear in the wake of the recent slowdown.\u201dThe fact that many major players have continued to double down on their presence in China despite the recent uncertainty suggests that long-term opportunities will continue to trump short-term volatility. Richemont\u2019s deal with Alibaba will allow sites like Net-a-Porter to begin business on Luxury Pavilion, an invitation-only luxury platform on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall site \u2014 even as many Western brands are continuing to be cautious in their embrace of Chinese e-commerce and alliances with local internet platforms, primarily because of fears of counterfeiting and the risk of diluting the exclusivity of their products. Also, the action follows an investment last year by JD.com, Alibaba\u2019s rival, in the luxury online marketplace Farfetch.\u201cOur digital offering in China is in its infancy,\u201d said Johann Rupert, Richemont\u2019s chairman, \u201cand we believe that partnering with Alibaba will enable us to become a significant and sustainable online player in this market.\u201dWestern companies are not the only ones looking farther afield to secure growth prospects.Despite the vast market on their doorsteps, a handful of Chinese luxury investors have been exploring a new market of their own in search of greater returns: Europe. This year, Shandong Ruyi bought the Swiss leather brand Bally while Fosun acquired the French fashion house Lanvin, both moves devised to reap profits from their countrymen\u2019s appetite for luxury marques that otherwise would go into the pockets of Western companies.The day after the event, Michael Evans, president of Alibaba Group, talked about it at The New York Times International Luxury Conference, held in Hong Kong: \u201cPart of the reason we invest so much into the infrastructure of Singles Day \u2014 a day where we delivered over one billion packages in 24 hours this year \u2014 is because we believe a time will come when we will be operating at that scale every single day.\u201dNow, eyes are turned to see how consumer desire for high-ticket handbags, ready-to-wear and sneakers \u2014 as well as lower-priced items such as cosmetics and fragrances \u2014 will fare during the important fourth quarter of the retail calendar.\u201cTo say that the luxury sector is entering another perfect storm would be too aggressive,\u201d said Mr. Chauvet, of Citigroup. \u201cThen again, when consumers don\u2019t feel a sense of optimism or feel worried about the world around them, luxury purchases are often the first to go. For now, the industry mode has got to be \u2018wait and see.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trump-Fueled \u2018Wipeout\u2019 for House Republicans in Northeast", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn New Jersey, voters slashed the number of Republicans in Congress from five down to two, and possibly only one.In New York, Democrats declared victory in three congressional races in President Trump\u2019s home state, ejecting the last remaining Republican from New York City.And in the six other states in the Northeast, the lone remaining Republican congressman, Representative Bruce Poliquin of Maine, was clinging to his seat on Wednesday, his fate to be decided by the second choices of third-party voters through ranked-choice voting.If the country delivered a mixed verdict nationally on Mr. Trump and his brand of unrepentant nationalism and white-hot rhetoric on immigration in the 2018 midterms \u2014 Democrats seized the House and ceded ground in the Senate, and the two parties split key governorships \u2014 the results were far clearer in a region that once defined moderate Republicanism in America.\u201cThis was a wipeout for Republicans in the Northeast,\u201d declared Christopher H. Shays, a former moderate Republican congressman from Connecticut who lost his own re-election a decade ago.From a tax bill that penalized high-tax blue states to a message far more attuned to the ears of rural America than the cities and educated suburbs that dominate the Northeast, Mr. Trump accelerated and hardened a regional realignment that has been underway for years. Almost no Republicans appeared immune to the region\u2019s shifting political winds, no matter how they positioned themselves.Representative Claudia Tenney made appearances with no less than four members of the Trump family in an upstate New York district that the president carried in 2016. She was losing though has yet to concede. In northern New Jersey, Representative Leonard Lance voted against the final repeal effort of the Affordable Care Act, voted against the tax bill and was openly critical of the president\u2019s immigration policies. Mr. Lance even avoided mentioning Mr. Trump by name. He lost, too.Of the 60 congressional races on Tuesday in eight Northeastern states, including New York and New Jersey, not a single Republican is on pace to top 57 percent of the vote ballot. The party was poised to cede six seats \u2014 more than one-third of their overall total \u2014 and of the nine remaining Republican-held seats, two incumbents were leading with less than 50 percent of the vote.Not long ago, Republicans held half of New Jersey\u2019s 12 congressional seats; now they are possibly down to just one, with Republican Representative Tom MacArthur trailing his Democratic challenger, Andy Kim, by roughly 2,600 votes. Yet regardless of that race\u2019s outcome, Republicans in New Jersey are facing their smallest representation in Congress since President Woodrow Wilson.At the state level, New York Democrats celebrated historically large wins in the Legislature, where the party took complete control.\u201cThe question is whether it\u2019s a temporary alignment or a permanent alignment,\u201d said David Catalfamo, a Republican strategist who worked as an adviser to the losing Republican candidates for Senate and governor in New York, \u201cand my gut is it is a temporary alignment that is more reflective of a reaction to the president in Washington.\u201dSome Republicans did win re-election in suburban areas, including Representatives Lee Zeldin and Peter King on Long Island, though their shares of votes, 52.5 percent and 53.3 percent, respectively, were smaller than in the past.At a news conference, the president openly mocked those he deemed disloyal Republicans. \u201cMia Love gave me no love and she lost,\u201d he said of one Utah Republican. \u201cToo bad. Sorry about that Mia.\u201dMike Duhaime, a Republican strategist in New Jersey who has worked on national campaigns, said his fear is that \u201cwe\u2019re shrinking ideologically as a party \u2014 and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\u201cSome of the diversity of the party is leaving. If we\u2019re going to be competitive in these suburban areas, if we\u2019re going to take back Congress, it is going to have to be in these suburban areas,\u201d Mr. Duhaime said. \u201cAnd our brand is going to need to be more than just Trump.\u201dNowhere was the fracture with the Trump-led Republican Party more potent than in a swath of wealthy suburban enclaves in the northeastern part of New Jersey, where Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor, defeated her Republican opponent by more than 12 percentage points. It was a stunning margin in a seat that had been held for 24 years by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a genteel, moderate Republican deal maker who rose to become the powerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee. The district had not elected a Democrat since President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration.Ms. Sherrill\u2019s victory was one of seven for Democrats along the so-called Acela corridor between Washington and New York: one in Northern Virginia, three in the Philadelphia region, three in New Jersey and one in New York City. In New York, Max Rose, a 31-year-old military veteran, ousted Representative Dan Donovan in a district centered on Staten Island, long a Republican stronghold and where Mr. Trump had remained relatively popular.John McLaughlin, who served as a pollster for Mr. Trump in 2016 and who was involved in House races in 2018, blamed Republican congressional leaders more than the president for the losses in the region, citing the tax bill in particular as \u201ca policy mistake that hurt many Republicans in the Northeast and others in high-income suburbs.\u201dWhile the measure cut taxes across the board, it placed a cap on the popular state and local tax deduction that is heavily used in the wealthier parts of high-tax states like New York and New Jersey. \u201cThe tax cut was good policy to grow the economy and create jobs, but when Republican leadership refused to negotiate a higher cap or phase it out over time, it made many suburban Republicans vulnerable,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said.During the Trump era, Republicans have still succeeded in holding blue-state governorships \u2014 including G.O.P. re-election victories by incumbents in Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire and Vermont on Tuesday \u2014 but voters have long treated federal contests differently from state ones.Christine Todd Whitman, a former Republican governor in New Jersey, said the party\u2019s woes were trickling all the way down the ballot into local contests. \u201cWe even lost in a lot of the county and municipal races that were in solid Republican districts,\u201d she said.\u201cFor the Northeast,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard for Republicans to claw back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Recently, one of my students at Stanford told me a strange story. His parents, who live in Palo Alto, Calif., had been receiving mysterious packages at their house. The packages were all different shapes and sizes but each was addressed to \u201cReturns Department, Valley Fountain LLC.\u201dI looked into it and found that a company called Valley Fountain LLC was indeed listed at his parents\u2019 address. But it also appeared to be listed at 235 Montgomery Street, Suite 350, in downtown San Francisco.There was little pattern or theme to what these Amazon shops sold. They had everything from hemorrhoid cream to desk lamps, and there were varying levels of inventory. On sale at DeepOceanStoreuk (a storefront on Amazon.uk associated with Bropastures LLC), I found a book on industrial electricity, a set of fake facial wounds and a \u201cNo Stress Tech Guide to Microsoft Works 8 & 8.5.\u201d Another storefront called Kingdom Kber, this one on Amazon.de and associated with Agapao LLC, advertised a miniature whale, nail gel and a copy of \u201cUndocumented Immigrants and Higher Education.\u201d When I clicked on these items, though, none of them were currently available. A good number of the storefronts were completely empty.One thing these LLCs had in common was that their registered agent was named Jonathan Park.Even though the packages being sent to my student\u2019s parents\u2019 home were addressed to Valley Fountain LLC, one of the packages had a return label taped to it that indicated it came from an Amazon store called Sendai Book Store. I looked it up and found that it was on several cautionary lists of unauthorized resellers, and had more than 400,000 things for sale. But once again, the offerings seemed chosen at random.I decided to order something: L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick (3 pcs) for $25.63. (I pretended not to see that the same item was listed at $10.74 by another reseller.)  Amazon informed me that the lipstick would come in two weeks; there was no tracking information. In this case, it seemed that Valley Fountain LLC and other companies were posing as traditional retailers \u2014 usually by setting up Amazon storefronts like Sendai Book Store \u2014 and were just reselling items from other Amazon storefronts at inflated prices. It sounds confusing, but ultimately, it\u2019s pretty similar to scalping concert tickets: A middleman makes money by ratcheting up the price.The items in many of the storefronts associated with 235 Montgomery, Suite 350 had an unusually long shipping time and consistently low stock, so it made sense that items purchased from them might be coming from elsewhere.While I waited for my lipstick, I returned to the list of LLCs, and noticed that there was something else that the companies had in common. According to LinkedIn and Facebook, at least a handful of the listed agents were alumni of Olivet University, a Bible college based in California.If Olivet University sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it has been in the news lately. Earlier this year its offices were raided as part of a fraud investigation being conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. As it also happens, here is where the story converged with another of my interests. My boyfriend had worked at Newsweek as an editor for a year. He was let go in April 2017.Newsweek\u2019s journalists also found that their company had offered about $149,000 worth of free advertising in the print magazine to New York\u2019s Dutchess County, where Olivet was turning an abandoned psychiatric hospital into a satellite campus of Olivet University. The deal \u2014 which resulted in 10 full-page ads promoting local tourism and the Hudson Valley Regional Airport \u2014 was facilitated by Marian Rebro, the president of the company overseeing the construction.\u201cOlivet University was not the subject of the visit,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything from the campus.\u201dSeveral of the Newsweek journalists who had worked on the investigation of their company and its relationship with Olivet University were fired earlier this year. A spokesperson for Newsweek Media Group declined to comment. I went to 235 Montgomery Street to check it out, and found a set of locked double doors outfitted with a camera, a blinking light and a card reader. On the building\u2019s directory, Suite 350 was listed as IBPort, Inc.Who could this cosmopolitan shopper be? It\u2019s hard to say.Until recently, Marian Rebro, the president of the Olivet-affiliated management company that is developing the abandoned psychiatric facility in New York, was listed on business websites as the manager of Everymarket Inc. But Mr. Rebro said, in a statement: \u201cI am not the founder of Everymarket.com. I may have advised the company at one point many years ago, but have never been an employee there.\u201d He also said: \u201cI am not, nor have I ever been, a manager or employee of Everymarket.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to see the oddly overpriced Essy Beauty peel-off mask or Asavea hair straightener as a kind of product version of clickbait. After all, what is the experience of clickbait other than realizing we have vastly overpaid, even if only with our attention?News, information and products are simply someone\u2019s inventory.This is what I thought a countless number of times!This has gotten some of the companies listed at 235 Montgomery in trouble.In another legal dispute, from February of this year, Adult Printed Diapers LLC sued Faithfulness LLC, another one of Mr. Park\u2019s companies, for selling \u201cAww So Cute\u201d diapers, which are an Adult Printed Diapers trademark. It\u2019s not clear where Faithfulness LLC got the Adult Printed Diapers diapers, but the lawsuit alleges that Faithfulness LLC\u2019s co-defendant in the lawsuit, Rearz, Inc., made an unauthorized purchase of diaper inventory directly from Adult Printed Diapers\u2019 supplier in Shandong, China.  On a recent visit to Leez, recognizable brands were mixed in with disconcerting objects, like a $59 hat that said \u201cOslo Iceland\u201d on it and something called \u201cGranny Attic Bubble Foam.\u201d Both items appeared to be made by JNG Korea Co. Ltd.Products from Little Martin\u2019s Drawer and Asavea were prominently displayed.A sorry assortment of wooden furniture haunted the second floor, while the third floor remained dark, empty and forbidding; visitors were informed that it is now an event rental space.Business cards displayed at Leez named Chris Liu as the Chief Operation Officer there. Chris Liu\u2019s Linkedin profile lists a previous position in Business Development at IBTimes Australia.Amid all of this, my lipstick arrived! Inside the package was an invoice for $10.75 from \u201cCrispy Beauty,\u201d an unfortunately named Amazon seller that was decidedly not Sendai Book Store, the store on Amazon I paid $25.63 for the lipstick. When I went back to Amazon and generated a return label, the address was for Valley Fountain LLC. I was not prepared for the way a simple question about some mysterious packages would spiral into a dizzying network of Amazon storefronts, web domains and badly written \u201cAbout us\u201d pages. But the more I looked into it, the more it seemed they were being run by a handful of people, each operating in different capacities depending on the needs of the moment. More surreal was how these websites were linked to the physical world. Chris L. also made sure to throw in a plug for the third floor: \u201cThe 3rd floor of the store is open for rent. It\u2019s quite spacious and bright. Good for all kinds of event.\u201d I decided I had to go to the San Francisco store.In what sounds like a thick Eastern European accent, he says that \u201cStevens\u201d is the last name of a man who was in the bookstore business for 60 years. \u201cThis gentleman is actually my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to work a couple years together, and this is in memory of him.\u201d There\u2019s a cut in the video, and then: \u201cHe\u2019s still alive, but this is like a tribute to him. That\u2019s why it is called Stevens Books.\u201d\u201cDo you want to check out those books?\u201d the guy asked. No, I said. I wanted to buy them. \u201cOh!\u201d he said, and then laughed to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2026 we\u2019re not a library.\u201d In an email in response to request for comment, Mr. Volansky wrote \u201cP&J Health anti-snoring devices and Piero Lorenzo wallets are not sold in Stevens Books.\u201d He said he was not the owner, and that the store and the brand were owned by the Stevens Books Group. \u201cI go by my own name, Stevens is a nickname because of Stevens Books,\u201d he wrote.Trying to map the connections between all these entities opens a gaping wormhole. I couldn\u2019t get over the idea that a church might be behind a network of used business books, hair straighteners, and suspiciously priced compression stockings \u2014 sold on Amazon storefronts with names like GiGling EyE, ShopperDooperEU and DAMP store \u2014 all while running a once-venerable American news publication into the ground.Indeed, at some point I began to feel like I was in a dream. Or that I was half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real, the local from the global, a product from a Photoshop image, the sincere from the insincere.Still harder for me to grasp was the total interpenetration of e-commerce and physical space. Standing inside Stevens Books was like being on a stage set for Stevens Books, Stevens Book, Stevens Book Shop, and Stevensbook \u2014 all at the same time. It wasn\u2019t that the bookstore wasn\u2019t real, but rather that it felt reverse-engineered by an online business, or a series of them. Being a human who resides in physical space, my perceptual abilities were overwhelmed. But in some way, even if it was impossible to articulate, I knew that some kind of intersection of Olivet University, Gratia Community Church, IBPort, the Newsweek Media Group, and someone named Stevens was right there with me, among the fidget spinners, in an otherwise unremarkable store in San Francisco.Speaking with Jonathan Park, and reaching out to Olivet, provided some kind of clarification. Mr. Park said: \u201cI currently own and operate several businesses that I started while I was at Olivet,\u201d but added that he does not operate many of the entities that he helped incorporate, and that some entities have been spun off and are not related to him anymore.He said he mentored students, including interns and graduates of Olivet, and helped them set up businesses from time to time: \u201cMy collaboration with Olivet was one of my life\u2019s best experiences because the University and its students have an entrepreneurial spirit and great aspirations. It is truly a privilege to work together with these bright and gifted individuals.\u201d The school and students, he said, \u201cpartnered and envisioned an incubating program similar to those of the leading research universities; including Stanford and Cornell. While Olivet and my businesses are of a different scale than that of Stanford\u2019s and Google\u2019s, this type of collaboration is commonplace today and has proven to be very successful and rewarding for the economy at large. Our results and volumes are not odd, but, I believe, are rather impressive and something to be proud of.\u201dOlivet was more vague in its statement, made through its spokesperson Ronn Torossian. He wrote, in full:\u201cFollowing the legacy of our (late) Honorary Chairman Dr. Ralph D. Winter, Olivet University has always looked for ways to encourage growth in mission frontiers. This influence shaped the founding vision from Dr. Jang, who, as a devout Christian, believes a Biblical worldview can be applied across all varieties of fields. In that same spirit, the University has always been happy to help evangelical business owners, and we\u2019ve had a good working relationship with IBTimes over the years. We are also proud of our business-as-mission network with various entrepreneurs going into the marketplace as part of our ongoing exploration into models about how to best plant churches and expand mission frontiers. We will continue to explore this paradigm. These are challenging times for Christian and secular higher education institutions alike. Olivet is continually learning the best ways to provide high quality education to raise leaders while developing sound and diversified income sources. One model is Stanford University, which derives 85% of its revenues from non-tuition sources including sponsored research. Olivet similarly recognizes the importance of finding new models for supporting education, and therefore the school encourages innovation and entrepreneurship for its student and alumni base. Many of our alumni are successful entrepreneurs in the U.S. and other countries and contribute to and partner with the University by donating, partnering on research projects, providing internship/training opportunities, and in other ways. We will continue promoting these values that have made America into the great country it has become. And we are proud of all our successful alumni and are thankful to all the friends, benefactors and partners of Olivet University.\u201d In the end, I decided to return the lipstick.The alleged schemes include fictitious auditors (named \u201cKaren Smith\u201d and \u201cLynn Chen\u201d) who came complete with their own fictitious emails, phone numbers and websites; networks of corporate bank accounts; and the computer server company, Oikos Networks, that is listed at 22 Cortlandt Street, which also happens to be the address where Olivet Institute, Stevens Books and Christian Media Corporation are all registered.The indictments include charges against Etienne Uzac, a co-owner of IBT (and one of the original founders of International Business Times); William Anderson, an Olivet trustee, former chief executive of Christian Media Corporation (and husband of Yen-Yi Anderson); and John Xiao, Olivet\u2019s finance director and dean of Olivet Business School. The general manager of Oikos is named only as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator.\u201dI wondered about the fate of my overpriced L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick and who, at the New Jersey warehouse, would be there to receive it. I imagined a person sitting surrounded by rejected dinosaur costumes, butane fuel canisters and butt-enhancing creams. Soon they would receive my lipstick, neither a return nor quite a gift, purchased, at one point, from a faraway place called Crispy Beauty. I wondered if they knew their place in this vast and vertiginous network \u2014 if they knew that they were helping to achieve Everymarket\u2019s dream: A dream of being a marketplace \u201coffering practically everything from everywhere for everyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Both Parties, a Political Realignment Along Cultural Lines", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe midterm elections on Tuesday laid bare the growing chasm between urban and rural America, leaving Republicans deeply concerned about their declining fortunes in the metropolitan areas that extinguished their House majority and Democrats just as alarmed about their own struggles to win over voters in states that strengthened the G.O.P.\u2019s grip on the Senate.For both parties, the election represented an acceleration of dizzying realignment along cultural lines. Districts that once represented the beating heart of the Republican Party rejected President Trump\u2019s avowed nationalism as a form of bigotry, while Democrats further retrenched from the agricultural and industrial communities where they once dominated.Democrats took control of the House not merely by making gains in coastal states that supported Hillary Clinton, but also by penetrating deeply into suburban corners of traditionally conservative states in the South and across the Plains, like Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma. The House results made clear that the Trump-induced difficulties Republicans are suffering with once-reliable voters are hardly limited to blue states and could make it substantially harder for the president to remake his upscale-downscale coalition in 2020.\u201cThe party should be concerned when you look at what was once one of its bases and see how increasingly vulnerable we are with them,\u201d said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, an old-guard Republican who heads the Republican Governors Association, pointing to Democratic incursions into localities like Cobb County, Ga., that were once conservative bulwarks.Mr. Haslam, whose party lost seven governorships but held onto the major prizes of Ohio and Florida, added, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can come away from last night claiming victory.\u201dEric Cantor, the former House majority leader, said his fellow Republicans should be urgently concerned about the collapse of the longstanding political alliance between culturally conservative rural voters and high-income suburbanites who are focused on the economy and issues like education and child care.\u201cWe\u2019ve been on a steady trend losing suburbanites, losing college-educated women, and it\u2019s time for the Republican Party to adopt a suburban agenda,\u201d Mr. Cantor said.Mr. Cantor\u2019s home state, Virginia, offered a stark example of the quickening march of cul-de-sac-dwelling professionals toward the Democratic Party. Democrats gained three House seats in the state, including Mr. Cantor\u2019s old district, on the strength of these voters. Republicans faced a humiliating loss in Virginia\u2019s election for the Senate, after a Trump-style racial provocateur won the party\u2019s nomination.The most optimistic Democrats regarded the list of House victories as a road map to a grander national restoration in the 2020 presidential election. Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, in an interview, also held up Democratic wins for governorships in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin to argue that the party\u2019s path back to 270 Electoral College votes had come into focus on Tuesday.\u201cLook at the Southwest and Midwest \u2014 in a presidential, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to need,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said.Beyond the House, Democrats also notched major statehouse gains, capturing six new legislative chambers and securing supermajorities in six others.But not all Democrats were ebullient in Tuesday\u2019s aftermath. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration, complained bitterly about his party\u2019s worsening struggles with rural voters.\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d said Mr. Vilsack, who has been pleading with Democrats to aggressively court the Farm Belt. \u201cYou pick out the interest group that\u2019s part of our base and we always have a message for all of those folks, but we don\u2019t do the same thing for folks in rural places.\u201dMr. Trump insisted in a rollicking and often hostile news conference on Wednesday that he was not at all concerned about his new political fragility, claiming his party enjoyed a \u201cgreat victory\u201d on Tuesday. He boasted that in the races he cared about most \u2014 in the states he frequented most in the campaign\u2019s final days \u2014 Republicans largely won.And win they did. For Democrats like Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri moderate, the rightward shift of rural America coincided with her own party\u2019s tilt to the left, with fatal consequences. A political survivor who repeatedly escaped defeat over a decades-long career, Ms. McCaskill lost her bid for re-election on Tuesday to Josh Hawley, a Republican who happily parroted Mr. Trump and made the nomination of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh the centerpiece of his campaign.\u201cThe further you get from metropolitan areas, the more powerful Donald Trump is and the more allegiance there is to whatever he says and does,\u201d said Ms. McCaskill, who only 12 years ago won her seat in the Senate by carrying a number of rural counties.Ms. McCaskill was not the only Democrat felled by Mr. Trump\u2019s second-city barnstorming. Her Senate colleagues Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota were also swept out of office, and a number of their colleagues won by far closer margins than was expected.In every case, the results came about for the same reasons: Working-class white voters abandoned their ancestral party. For the Democrats, the power of incumbency and a fund-raising advantage meant little against the strength of this underlying cultural change.In states like hers, Ms. McCaskill said the president\u2019s inflammatory appeals to division and fear were ubiquitous, in large part because of Fox News. She recounted walking into restaurants in every corner of Missouri and invariably seeing the channel airing footage of the Central American caravans Mr. Trump demonized.\u201cIt\u2019s time we all quit dancing around what is now a state-owned news channel,\u201d she said.Mindful of her party\u2019s delicate position, Ms. McCaskill said she was also concerned about the implications of a divided capital.\u201cIf this turns into, \u2018the House investigates Trump and Trump turns the House into his foil,\u2019 nothing is going to get done and that\u2019s not going to help us,\u201d she said.Perhaps most ominous for Democrats on Tuesday were the election results in Florida \u2014 the only diverse and densely populated swing state in which Mr. Trump\u2019s party appeared to win election for both Senate and governor.To the shock of national Democratic leaders, Senator Bill Nelson was trailing Wednesday evening in a re-election battle against Gov. Rick Scott, while Andrew Gillum, the liberal mayor of Tallahassee, was defeated by Ron DeSantis in his bid for governor despite leading in most every poll during the general election.Just as Mr. Trump did two years ago there, Mr. Scott and Mr. DeSantis rolled up wide margins in the state\u2019s rural reaches and conservative-leaning retirement hubs, and won just enough Hispanic voters to offset their losses with African-Americans and suburbanites.Those results reinforced for Democrats that there is a limit to the inroads they can make in historically Republican communities. And some of the Democratic lawmakers who were most essential to securing the House majority warned that the party could not take its gains in the suburbs for granted.Representative Stephanie Murphy, a Democratic moderate from Florida, said the party would have to manage its House majority carefully in order to cement its emerging coalition. Having won a second term Tuesday in a purple district around Orlando, Ms. Murphy said the less-ideological voters who abound in districts like hers were open to electing Democrats they viewed as reasonable and public-minded.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.When the new Congress is sworn in, Ms. Murphy predicted, Democrats will not \u201cveer as far left as the Republicans wanted voters to believe.\u201d\u201cThe party still needs to be a big-tent party that allows members to deliver for their constituencies,\u201d Ms. Murphy said. \u201cWe now have a bunch of new members who are representing districts that are more purple and red than they are dark blue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Haven\u2019t Really Transformed Trade. Yet.", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewPresident Trump\u2019s protectionist impulses have upended the global debate about international trade.But so far, his policies have barely changed a fundamental reality: The United States is still less protectionist than it has been throughout most of its history or than most nations are today.Even if the tariffs currently in place inflict only limited damage on the economy, however, the consequences will be much more severe if Mr. Trump follows through on his threats to take much more aggressive action.But that figure only includes tariffs imposed in the administration\u2019s first year. A lot has happened since then.In March, the White House added a 25 percent tariff to about $31 billion worth of imported steel, and a 10 percent tariff to $17 billion of imported aluminum. (This does not apply to imports from Argentina, Australia and Brazil.) In July and August, Mr. Trump kicked off a trade war with China by imposing an extra 25 percent tariff on $50 billion worth of imports from the country. China retaliated, so Mr. Trump punched back, imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on $200 billion in Chinese goods.These numbers suggest the average tariff rate in 2018 will rise by about 1.8 percentage points, to about 3.2 percent. This means that Mr. Trump has already rolled tariffs back to roughly their level at the beginning of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. Even so, average tariffs remain lower \u2014 by quite a large margin \u2014 than they have been through most of United States history.This broader perspective suggests that the United States remains, at least in broad brush strokes, a low-tariff country.Furthermore, fighting a trade war when tariffs around the world are already pretty low is particularly pointless. That\u2019s because if you \u201cwin,\u201d you can force your trading partners to knock their tariff rate down from a few percentage points above zero to something a bit closer to zero. That\u2019s not a big deal.But the major weapon used to fight a trade war is the threat of substantially higher tariffs, and if negotiations become deadlocked, these higher tariffs can persist. The prize for winning a trade war is small, but the costs are potentially very large because of a troubling asymmetry that comes into play.Economic theory provides a rule of thumb that the cost of tariff-induced distortions rises in the square of the tariff rate. Put simply, the idea is this: Small tariffs do relatively little harm. A tariff rate of 1 percent, for instance, probably won\u2019t prevent you from buying something you really want.If, however, the tariff rate jumps to 10 percent, the cost of tariff-induced distortions won\u2019t just be 10 times as great. It will inflict 100 times the damage. That\u2019s what makes large tariff increases so bad. They don\u2019t just lead to fewer imports. They also persuade people to cut back even on stuff that they really value.Under this logic, even if relatively small tariff increases haven\u2019t imposed much pain, further escalation could have far more severe consequences.That would cause the average tariff rate to rise to about 7.2 percent. If the president follows through on his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on auto-sector imports from any country, the average tariff rate for the entire economy would rise into double digits.Even worse, Mr. Trump has recently mused about withdrawing the United States from the World Trade Organization. If he were to do so, the United States would no longer be bound by past multilateral trade agreements that together determine nearly all American tariff rates.Justin Wolfers is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.

{"Headline": "U.S. and China Square Off on Trade, and APEC Nations Duck for Cover", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The United States and China turned a Pacific Rim trade summit this weekend into a stage where the world could do little more than stand by and watch as two great powers aggravated their battle over trade.President Xi Jinping and Vice President Mike Pence both made their cases to the global leaders assembled in Papua New Guinea \u2014 then they dug in and refused to compromise. That left the group of 21 nations in disarray, unable to agree on even a routine joint statement like those that had closed every other Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit since 1989.Countries caught in the trade-war crossfire between China and the United States are becoming increasingly exasperated.\u201cThe entire world is worried,\u201d said Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill of Papua New Guinea.The disagreement over the final statement reflects a hardening of the conflict between China and the United States, with each side deploying aggressive, uncompromising rhetoric reminiscent of that heard during the Cold War.During a weekend of diplomacy in China\u2019s backyard that had been meant to defuse trade tensions, Mr. Xi and Mr. Pence instead chose escalation, attacking each other\u2019s positions and battling for loyalty within a trade group that represents 60 percent of the global economy.Experts said the stalemate at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, known as APEC, would set up a high-stakes showdown at the Group of 20 conference in Argentina this month, which Mr. Xi and President Trump are expected to attend.The core issues in the clash were familiar and have shaped the trade dispute between the United States and China for months.Mr. Trump has made a combative stance on trade a signature element of his administration\u2019s foreign policy. So draft versions of an APEC communiqu\u00e9 showed that the United States wanted strong language condemning Chinese trade practices it calls coercive and predatory. Among them: restricting market access and pushing foreign companies to hand over valuable technology.The Chinese delegation sought to reaffirm its opposition to what it says are protectionism and unilateralism by the United States, especially the tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods as part of an unprecedented effort to force China to change its policies.Mr. Trump\u2019s trade offensive has stoked fears of an economic Cold War between the world\u2019s two largest economies. While the president has sought to preserve cordial personal relations with Mr. Xi, the broader relationship between the United States and China has deteriorated steadily, not just in the commercial sphere but also in security issues like the South China Sea.Mr. Xi seemed eager to shore up ties with an important trading partner, North Korea. He told President Moon Jae-in of South Korea on the sidelines of the trade forum that he was considering accepting an invitation from the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit, a spokesman for Mr. Moon said.But at the APEC conference in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, the tensions centered on economics.For years, American foreign policy has sought to balance the economic benefits of cooperating with China with the risks of treating the country as an adversary.Now, the scales have tipped.From Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets to defense position papers and a major speech by Mr. Pence on Oct. 4, the United States has made clear that it sees China as a strategic threat.\u201cIt\u2019s a new level of Cold War rhetoric,\u201d said Hugh White, a prominent regional analyst at the Australian National University.Economic cooperation, he said, is being sidelined.\u201cThe Trump administration, for the first time since Nixon in 1972, has sought to distance America from China\u2019s economic opportunities,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge shift.\u201dMr. Pence has played an especially prominent role in the confrontation.He urged Asian nations to work with the United States. If they do, he said, they will not be saddled with debt, a problem some countries are facing as a result of their partnerships with Beijing.Mr. Xi, who spoke before Mr. Pence, insisted that such criticism was misguided. China\u2019s infrastructure plan, he said, is inclusive and beneficial.\u201cIt will not close a door and create a small circle,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cIt is not the so-called trap, as some people say. It is the sunshine avenue where China shares opportunities with the world to seek common development.\u201dExperts said the two countries\u2019 positions have become more entrenched.\u201cIt boils down to mutual intransigence between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University.Jonathan Pryke, a Pacific Rim expert at the Lowy Institute, agreed, describing the result as raw \u201cstubbornness.\u201dEarlier on Sunday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia tried to sound upbeat. \u201cI think there is a lot more progress being made here than I think is probably being acknowledged,\u201d he said.He and many other national leaders seemed eager to return to a time when the world\u2019s strongest powers got along, or at least worked together on building the world economy.What the leaders of many countries fear, especially in Asia, is a cleavage into two camps.No one \u201cwants to be forced to make a choice,\u201d said Mr. White, the analyst.For now, the world beyond the United States and China seems to have been given the task of maintaining calm \u2014 and of trying to steer the world away from economic divisions and greater clashes.By Sunday night, it was increasingly difficult to see the summit meeting as anything but a continuation of hostilities.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada was among the first to make that clear. The joint statement, he said, was a lost cause.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will come as a huge surprise that there are differing visions,\u201d he said.Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington, and Jamie Tarabay from Sydney.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Trump Overlooks an Investment Opportunity in Climate Change", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsFighting climate change could be America\u2019s new New Deal.The effects of global warming on virtually all aspects of American society could be devastating, according to a government report released on Friday. Rather than seize on its findings as a way to boost American innovation, economic output and jobs, President Trump\u2019s administration pushed the report out late on Friday after Thanksgiving \u2014 and then played down its devastating findings.That\u2019s a big missed opportunity.Unchecked, climate change could cut as much as a tenth off the nation\u2019s gross domestic product by the end of the century, according to the authors of the 1,656-page assessment. That overall figure probably underestimates regional variances. The overall cost of the wildfires that hit California in 2017, for example, amounted to 6.5 percent of the state\u2019s economic output, according to estimates by the weather forecasting company AccuWeather. Factor in everything from water scarcity to pollution to energy production to human health, and in some parts of the country the economic impact could be far worse.The cost in financial and human terms drops by up to 70 percent if greenhouse-gas emissions peak before the middle of the century and then drop, the report says. That requires investment, of course \u2014 which some Republicans, like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, deride as being harmful to the economy.Fully decarbonizing the world\u2019s cement, steel, plastics, trucking, shipping and aviation sectors by 2050 could require investing some 0.5 percent of global G.D.P. a year using mostly existing technology, according to the Energy Transitions Commission. But it would bring efficiencies, employment and advances in technology that could more than offset the costs.Similarly, modernizing aging infrastructure has multiple benefits. Investing the $800 billion or so that is needed to upgrade America\u2019s water systems could generate an almost 300 percent return, according to the U.S. Water Alliance \u2014 and generate 1.3 million jobs.Unlike when Franklin Roosevelt was seeking to revive the economy from the Great Depression, there\u2019s now plenty of private capital looking to play a big role. That stretches from the fast-growing green-bond market, to public and private-equity investors jumping on the bandwagon, to innovative funding tools set up by nonprofit groups like the World Resources Institute and the Nature Conservancy.Plenty of American cities and states see the need to work with such players to tackle climate risk. A White House that was more open to the opportunities that such action presents, though, would be ideal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil Backs Out of Hosting 2019 Climate Change Meeting", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil this week pulled out of hosting next year\u2019s United Nations global summit meeting on climate change, the latest signal that Latin America\u2019s largest nation no longer aspires to be an influential player in efforts to mitigate the effects of a warming planet.The decision leaves the United Nations scrambling to find a new venue for the conference, which was scheduled to take place next November. It comes about a month before the inauguration of president-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who has vowed to empower commercial ventures in the Amazon and other Brazilian biomes while weakening enforcement of environmental laws.In a statement, Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry said this week\u2019s decision was made to save money. It also cited the \u201ctransition process\u201d as Mr. Bolsonaro prepares to take office.Diplomats, environmentalists and others who follow the United Nations climate negotiations said the move threatens to mar Brazil\u2019s\u2019 reputation as a leading actor on environmental issues and sustainable development.Brazil hosted the Earth Summit in 1992 that gave rise to the United Nations climate convention, and the country has been actively engaged in brokering compromises between rich and poor nations grappling over how to take responsibility for lowering greenhouse gas emissions.In recent years, Brazil\u2019s standing as an environmental exemplar has eroded as farmers, miners and cattle ranchers have razed large areas of forest cover in the Amazon, with only occasional push back from the agencies tasked with enforcing environmental laws and regulations.Guy Edwards, a Latin America expert and co-director of the Climate and Development Lab at Brown University, said Brazil\u2019s decision to back out of hosting the summit is unwise in economic terms, since it would mean the country would forgo any investment, business deals and cooperation agreements to advance low carbon growth at the time when Brazil needs an economic boost.\u201cThe irony of the incoming Bolsonaro administration\u2019s decision to cancel the conference is that it will forgo the potentially hefty levels of investment and any number of business deals and cooperation agreements to advance low carbon growth just at the time that Brazil needs an economic boost,\u201d he said.Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the former environment minister of Peru, called Brazil\u2019s decision \u201ca bit sad,\u201d and added that it also creates a logistical hurdle for next year\u2019s climate change discussions.Under the United Nations system, a country from Latin America is supposed to host the summit in 2019. Brazil was the only country in the region to volunteer for the task, which can cost a country as much as $100 million.Other countries in the region still have time to step in, but it is unclear which might do so. Argentina has held climate summits in the past, but it is hosting this week\u2019s Group of 20 talks and may not want to incur another large expense. Mr. Pulgar-Vidal said it is unlikely that Peru, which spent $72 million to host a climate summit in 2014, would do it again.\u201cThis now puts Latin America in a difficult situation,\u201d Mr. Pulgar-Vidal said.Alexander Saier, the spokesman for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said in a statement that if no countries from Latin America offer to host in 2019, then the conference will be held at the seat of the climate secretariat in Bonn, Germany.That decision, he said, will be made by the end of next month.Brazil is the latest major influencer on climate change policy to take a radical shift on the issue.Australia\u2019s new prime minister, Scott Morrison, also threatened to pull out of the Paris Agreement. His conservative government has since said it will honor its pledges, but the country\u2019s energy policy contains no plans for curbing emissions.And Poland, which will host climate change talks next month, has invited coal companies to be partners in discussions on how to ratchet down fossil fuel emissions.Ernesto Londo\u00f1o reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Lisa Friedman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s New Neighbor: The Nation\u2019s Largest Housing Project", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil recently, the most important thing to know about Amazon for residents of the Queensbridge Houses, the country\u2019s largest public housing project, was that any packages left in a lobby would likely be stolen.But Amazon will soon be a far larger presence in their New York City neighborhood.Here, where livings are eked out on meager paychecks, or social service assistance, with nearly 60 percent of its households relying on food stamps, the new neighbor will be one of the world\u2019s most profitable high-tech companies, bringing what could be a work force of 25,000 people making salaries upward of $100,000.The stark contrast amplifies some of the social and economic tensions coursing through American society \u2014 a widening income gap, a lack of access to high-paying jobs for many minorities and a technology sector struggling to diversify.The planned location for the new headquarters is still unclear, as is whether Amazon will deliver any benefits to the roughly 6,000 people who live in the Queensbridge Houses and other disadvantaged parts of the neighborhood.\u201cWhat are they going to do for the community? Are they going to guarantee us employment opportunities?\u201d said April Simpson, the president of Queensbridge Tenants Association. \u201cI\u2019m worried about, when they come, they\u2019re not going to have opportunities for people. Not just people from Queensbridge \u2014 but other lower- and middle-income people in this area.\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re leery about them coming in.\u201dAs New York City seeks to challenge Silicon Valley\u2019s dominance as a tech hub \u2014 Google recently announced plans for a significant expansion in New York \u2014 the explosion of jobs has helped propel the local economy. But it has not mitigated the \u201ctale of two cities\u201d narrative of economic disparity that Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to address in a city where the poverty rate in 2016 was 19.5 percent, significantly higher than the national rate.That stratification is keenly felt in Queensbridge, a gritty complex just across the East River from the East Side of Manhattan and some of the wealthiest neighborhoods and real estate in the country.Hard by the Queensboro Bridge, the Queensbridge Houses have been plagued with crime and drugs. Those problems have eased in recent years, Ms. Simpson said, and community programs have improved the quality of life. Last year, the housing project did not record a single shooting, something that had not happened in more than a decade and was a source of pride.But the neglect that afflicts many public housing developments and has led to harsh criticism of the de Blasio administration, persists here, residents and other local leaders said. \u201cThere are still a lot of problems with the apartments \u2014 the lack of heat and hot water, non-working elevators, mold and broken front doors,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, the city councilman whose district includes the Queensbridge Houses.Tyshema Basnight, 42, said she had been trying to rejoin the work force after raising a family. She has an associate degree in computer science and a tech job at Amazon would be a dream job, she said.\u201cFor now, I\u2019m just looking for secretarial work,\u201d said Ms. Basnight, who was among several residents lined up for one of the few aging computers available in the tenants association office for residents who do not have computers of their own.The office is not on the cutting edge of the digital frontier. And all the buzz over the e-commerce behemoth transforming Long Island City into a gleaming new-economy tech hub was met with skepticism, if not outright hostility.Many businesses \u2014 including travel and financial companies and hotel chains \u2014 have opened in recent years in the area, but Ms. Simpson said they have not hired local residents.\u201cThey did not hire here \u2014 they brought in their own people,\u201d she said. \u201cMy thing is: If you build here, hire here.\u201dA spokesman for Amazon, Sam Kennedy, declined to comment on its plans in New York, but said that the company has a proven track record of funding and creating programs for the needy in Seattle, where Amazon has its main headquarters. This includes donating tens of millions of dollars, creating affordable housing, opening a shelter in its office complex for homeless families and creating a training program for the food service and culinary industries for less-advantaged residents.In Queens, the new companies that have come to Long Island City have helped transform the semi-industrial waterfront neighborhood into a haven for moneyed professionals. Since 2010 more apartment buildings have been built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in the city. Apartments in the more than 40 new buildings sell for an average of over $1 million.But past the gleaming skyline of high-rises, many residents fear that Amazon\u2019s arrival will only intensify the gentrification that is making the neighborhood less affordable for people of limited means.It is still unknown what financial incentives city and state officials may have offered Amazon or what, if any concessions, they have extracted from the company to help the neighborhood.Amazon\u2019s arrival, city officials insisted, would yield tangible gains for area residents.They said they were considering setting up programs similar to a city-funded employment center in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\u201cSecuring training and good jobs for local residents \u2014 especially those living in Nycha \u2014 is central to the way we craft major economic development initiatives,\u201d said Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, referring to the New York City Housing Authority.\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity to bring tens of thousands of good jobs to our city and open up good-paying careers in technology for New Yorkers.\u201dStill, Mr. Van Bramer questioned the city and state\u2019s eager courting of Amazon at a time when the housing complex is still in need of funding for basic repairs.\u201cIf we are helping a headquarters with 25,000 employees move in, a stone\u2019s throw from the largest housing development in the United States of America, we need more than lip service for the people of Queensbridge,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore we throw corporate welfare at the richest man in the world, we should think about the crisis in Nycha, and address the needs of the community, including training Queensbridge residents for tech jobs \u2014 or they will be looking through the glass from the outside.\u201dHe spoke of belonging to the Queensbridge \u201cfamily,\u201d and taking pride in its success stories. Mr. Jones said he trained on computers in high school and if his rap career fizzles, he would happily take a job at Amazon. \u201cIf Amazon doesn\u2019t hire from this community, we should boycott them,\u201d he said.\u201cNot everyone here has a Ph.D., but anyone eager to work should be able to get job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be nothing but a plus.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration\u2019s Strategy on Climate: Try to Bury Its Own Scientific Report", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnALYSISThat sets the stage for a remarkable split-screen political reality in coming years. The administration is widely expected to discount or ignore the report\u2019s detailed findings of the economic strain caused by climate change, even as it continues to cut environmental regulations, while opponents use it to mount legal attacks against the very administration that issued the report.\u201cThis report will be used in court in significant ways,\u201d said Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University. \u201cI can imagine a lawyer for the Trump administration being asked by a federal judge, \u2018How can the federal government acknowledge the seriousness of the problem, and then set aside the rules that protect the American people from the problem?\u2019 And they might squirm around coming up with an answer.\u201dHistorians and veterans of public service said it was notable that policymakers didn\u2019t try to soften the report\u2019s conclusions, because that indicated the strength of the administration\u2019s belief that it could ignore the findings in favor of policies driven by political ideology. \u201cThis is a new frontier of disavowance of science, of disdain for facts,\u201d said William K. Reilly, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency under the first President George Bush.A White House statement said the report, started under the Obama administration, was \u201clargely based on the most extreme scenario\u201d of global warming and that the next assessment would provide an opportunity for greater balance.Under a 1990 law, the federal government is required to issue the climate assessment every four years. The latest version introduces new complexity in the political fight over regulations designed to fight climate change. That\u2019s because, until the administration of President Barack Obama, no such regulations existed to be fought over. The rules are grounded in a 2009 legal finding, which has been upheld by federal courts, that planet-warming pollution harms human health and well-being, and therefore government policies are needed to reduce it.In publishing the assessment, White House officials made a calculation that Mr. Trump\u2019s core base of supporters most likely would not care that its findings are so at odds with the president\u2019s statements and policies. Mr. Milloy echoed a talking point used by other critics of the report, calling it the product of the \u201cdeep state,\u201d a term that refers to the conspiratorial notion of a secret alliance of bureaucrats and others who oppose the president. \u201cTrying to stop the deep state from doing this in the first place, or trying to alter the document, and then creating a whole new narrative \u2014 it\u2019s better to just have it come out and get it over with,\u201d said Mr. Milloy. \u201cBut do it on a day when nobody cares, and hope it gets swept away by the next day\u2019s news.\u201dWork on the climate assessment, which was performed by about 300 scientists, including career government scientists at 13 federal agencies, commenced shortly after the publication of the previous report, in 2014. The project was already well underway by the time Mr. Trump took office in 2017.\u201cThis moment tells you that there is a difference between the White House and the president,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. The White House has \u201clawyers and policy experts that don\u2019t want to go down in history as falsifying data.\u201d In light of Friday\u2019s report, Mr. Brinkley drew a parallel between Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on climate science and President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s false statements to the American public a half-century ago about the Vietnam War. \u201cJohnson used to tell people everything was going well in Vietnam, and then you\u2019d turn on the news and see the mayhem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was this giant disconnect.\u201dIn interviews with about a dozen authors of the climate assessment, all said that White House officials had not sought to soften or weaken its language.\u201cI will give credit where it\u2019s due: No one at the political level did any monkeying around with this,\u201d said Andrew Light, a co-author of the report and a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, a Washington research organization. \u201cFor all the criticism of the Trump administration quashing climate science, this is one case where they did not do that.\u201dNevertheless, despite the satisfaction at seeing their scientific work made public, many of the authors expressed disappointment that Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy appears to be to ignore the findings and move forward with plans to undo climate change policies.\u201cI\u2019m watching these arguments between politicians and scientists, but I\u2019m on the ground with public works officials who say that argument\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d Mr. Chinowsky said. \u201cPeople are going to get hurt and die if we don\u2019t change the policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Says, and Weighs Penalty", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWith what the Italian government has put on the table, we see a risk of the country sleepwalking into instability,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission vice president.The country, which is led by populist and anti-establishment forces, was a case of \u201cparticularly serious noncompliance,\u201d he added.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive branch, will now turn its negative assessment of the budget over to eurozone countries. In two weeks, they could give the commission the green light to start an \u201cexcessive deficit procedure\u201d against Italy, which could lead to steep fines.But both are happy to fight the European Union, and both have a history of skepticism when it comes to membership of the euro. Ahead of European Parliament elections in May, both parties need an enemy to run against, and with migrant landings down, bureaucrats in Brussels fit the bill nicely.Brussels had rejected a previous version of the budget, but the Italian government responded this month with only small amendments. The new round of budget rejection and Italian defiance on Wednesday, when the commission made its annual review of eurozone spending plans, was completely expected.\u201cWe are still committed to our budget,\u201d Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters, adding that the Italian government was sure of its position but that he would \u201cbe very willing\u201d to discuss it with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, when they met to discuss next steps at a dinner in Brussels on Saturday.\u201cA letter arrived from Brussels? I was expecting one from Santa Claus,\u201d said Mr. Salvini, the deputy prime minister and the most powerful force in the Italian government, who has suggested that Mr. Juncker has a drinking problem.He added that he would be polite in discussing the budget with European Union officials but would not be persuaded to reinstate the previous government\u2019s pension reductions. \u201cItaly has a need to grow,\u201d he told reporters.A report in the Turin-based newspaper La Stampa, citing anonymous sources, suggested that Mr. Salvini could be willing to significantly soften his position. That appeared to mute the market reaction, but a spokeswoman for Mr. Salvini disputed the report on Wednesday.\u201cTo the citizens we say have no fear because we will not retreat,\u201d said Francesco D\u2019Uva, a member of Parliament with the Five Star Movement. \u201cWe weren\u2019t elected to enact the same destructive policies of the old governments.\u201dThe Italians say that austerity measures imposed by Brussels and the powerful northern European countries that have sway there have suffocated the Italian economy.They argue that only through spending \u2014 on a citizens\u2019 income, generous pensions, and reduced taxes \u2014 can they stimulate the stuck Italian economy, and that they will then bring down their deficit \u2014 currently at 132 percent of output, more than twice the European Union limit \u2014 through growth.But the European Union, and other international institutions and ratings services, have deemed Italian growth projections to be fanciful and overly optimistic. The reality, critics and opponents of the government said, was that Wednesday marked a decline in the country\u2019s standing.\u201cToday a very sad thing happened to our country,\u201d said Pier Carlo Padoan, the finance minister in the previous Democratic Party administration.\u201cI am very worried,\u201d said Antonio Tajani, the president of European Parliament and a top official in Forza Italia, the center-right party of the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.He pointed to the risk premium on Italian government bonds that consistently hovers in dangerous territory, to the poor performance of the Italian stock market and to rising investor anxiety.\u201cThe Italian citizens don\u2019t deserve this disaster due to an irresponsible government that, instead of resolving the problems of Italians, everyday invents new enemies,\u201d Mr. Tajani said.Despite the posturing of both sides, the process leading to sanctions is lengthy, and leaves plenty of time for Brussels and Rome to find a compromise and avoid a confrontation that would further destabilize the European Union when it is already struggling with slower economic growth and Britain\u2019s planned departure.The Italian Parliament has to approve a budget by Dec. 31, which leaves time to change proposals. And some members of European Parliament have suggested that Brussels should bend.Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament from the Green Party, said that, while the excessive deficit procedure against Italy was unavoidable under European Union rules, the commission should be willing to compromise.\u201cMore spending could be sensible if it revives Italy\u2019s economy,\u201d Mr. Giegold said in a statement. \u201cBoth sides should give ground.\u201dThe question is whether Brussels will stand firm and whether there is any pressure \u2014 outside of crippling market reactions \u2014 large enough to change the political calculus that appears to be motivating Italy\u2019s coalition partners to refuse to budge. Both the League and Five Star are looking to increase their domestic popularity, and leverage, ahead of May\u2019s elections.\u201cWe are convinced of the numbers we put in our budget,\u201d Mr. Salvini said on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ll go forward.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the first name of Italy\u2019s prime minister.

{"Headline": "The World Needs to Quit Coal. Why Is It So Hard?", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 Coal, the fuel that powered the industrial age, has led the planet to the brink of catastrophic climate change.Central to that transformation: Getting out of coal, and fast.So, why is coal so hard to quit?Because coal is a powerful incumbent. It\u2019s there by the millions of tons under the ground. Powerful companies, backed by powerful governments, often in the form of subsidies, are in a rush to grow their markets before it is too late. Banks still profit from it. Big national electricity grids were designed for it. Coal plants can be a surefire way for politicians to deliver cheap electricity \u2014 and retain their own power. In some countries, it has been a glistening source of graft.\u201cThe main reason why coal sticks around is, we built it already,\u201d said Rohit Chandra, who earned a doctoral degree in energy policy at Harvard, specializing in coal in India. The battle over the future of coal is being waged in Asia. That contest is particularly stark in Southeast Asia, one of the world\u2019s last frontiers of coal expansion.Nguy Thi Khanh has seen the contest close-up in Vietnam. Born in 1976, a year after the end of the war, she remembers doing homework by the light of a kerosene lamp. In her northern village, the electricity failed several hours a day. When it rained, there was no power at all. When it came, it came from a coal plant not far away. When her mother hung laundry to dry, ash settled on the clothes.Today, pretty much every household in Vietnam, population 95 million, has electricity. Hanoi, the capital, where Ms. Nguy now lives, is in a frenzy of new construction, with soaring demand for cement and steel \u2014 both energy guzzlers. The economy is galloping. And, up and down the coast, 1,600 kilometers in length, foreign companies, mainly from Japan and China, are building coal plants.A second coal-fired power plant, far bigger, is under construction next door. Marubeni is building that too, along with a Korean company. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation, an export credit agency meant to lower financial risk for private lenders, is helping to fund it.In the shadow of the smokestack, Nguyen Thi Thu Thien was drying shrimp on the side of the road and complaining bitterly. She had moved out of her house after the power plant built an ash pond right in front. \u201cThe coal dust has blackened my house,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the trees are dying. We can\u2019t live there.\u201dShe and the others drying shrimp on the road were doubly angry that the new plant would need a new port, and that would displace their husbands, who tie up their fishing boats there.Trucks rumbled by, throwing up dust, as the women emptied their baskets of shrimp. They kept every bit of themselves covered: wide brimmed hats, face masks, gloves. Coal accounts for 36 percent of the country\u2019s power generation capacity now; it is projected to grow to 42 percent by 2030, according to the government. To feed those plants, Vietnam will need to import 90 million tons of coal by 2030.Vietnam says it is on track to meet its emissions reductions targets under the Paris accord. So, too, China and India, with far bigger carbon footprints. But those targets were set by the countries themselves, and they will not be enough to keep global temperatures from rising to calamitous levels. The United States has said it will exit the Paris climate pact.The economics, and the political calculus, are very different in the world\u2019s biggest democracy: India, population 1.3 billion. Ajay Mishra, the career civil servant in charge of energy in the central Indian state of Telangana, knows firsthand.Five years ago, he said, daily power cuts cursed his state. Ceiling fans cut out on stifling summer afternoons. Factories ran on diesel-guzzling generators. The people of Telangana were furious.State officials had to do something to fix the electricity problem. They harnessed the sun, briefly making Telangana a leading solar power producer in India. They also turned to what government officials have relied on for over a century: the vast vein of coal that sat underground, stretching across the hills and forests of central India. Telangana now has round-the-clock electricity. Its farmers get it free to pump water. It sweetens the re-election bid of Telangana\u2019s top elected official, K. Chandrashekar Rao, in state polls later this year. \u201cWe have coal,\u201d Mr. Mishra said. \u201cWe are producing more every year. For the next 100 years we have it.\u201d A simple pulley drew them in, a bit like a ski lift, except here, it took them deeper and deeper down a shaft. The creak of the pulley was all you could hear, and water, drip-dripping inside the earth. Here and there, off to the side, stood miners, their forms barely visible in the darkness, except for the belted flashlights that snaked across their bodies.So deeply is India invested in coal, this, like other mines, is state owned. So are most power plants. Coal subsidizes the country\u2019s vast rail network. That person at the top of that system, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has sought to cast himself as a champion of clean energy. In an interview in the capital, New Delhi, India\u2019s energy secretary, Ajay Bhalla, said some 50 gigawatts of additional coal capacity were under construction. That\u2019s a fraction of what was under development even a decade ago, when India\u2019s energy demand was projected to soar. Many of those plants are meant to replace older, more polluting ones. But coal would not sunset anytime soon, he predicted, not until there\u2019s a cheap and efficient way to store energy from solar and wind energy.For now, though, coal accounts for 58 percent of India\u2019s energy mix. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m using the coal very willingly,\u201d Mr. Bhalla said. \u201cBut I have to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Yemen, Lavish Meals for Few, Starvation for Many and a Dilemma for Reporters", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYemen DispatchSANA, Yemen \u2014 At a restaurant in the Yemeni capital, Sana, a waiter brought bowls of slow-cooked lamb served with mounds of rice. For dessert there was kunafa, the classic Arab dish of golden brown pastry filled with cheese.An hour later I was back at work, in a hushed hospital ward filled with malnourished children with skeletal faces, hanging between life and death for want of money and a good meal.If that juxtaposition strikes you as jarring, even distasteful, it felt that way to me, too.Crisis zones are often places of stark contrast, but in Yemen the gulf is particularly uncomfortable. The problem isn\u2019t a lack of food; it\u2019s that few people can afford to buy what food is available.Years of blockades, bombs and soaring inflation have crushed the economy. A crushed state means there is no safety net.As a result, beggars congregate outside supermarkets filled with goods; markets are filled with produce in towns where the hungry eat boiled leaves; and restaurants selling rich food are a few hundred yards from hunger wards filled with desperation, pain and death.For a reporter, that brings a dilemma. Journalists travel with bundles of hard currency, usually dollars, to pay for hotels, transport and translation. A small fraction of that cash might go a long way for a starving family. Should I pause, put down my notebook and offer to help?Many were touched by a powerful photograph by Tyler Hicks of Amal Hussain, an emaciated 7-year-old girl whose haunting stare brought the war\u2019s human cost into shocking focus.And many were devastated to learn that, soon after we left, Amal\u2019s mother brought her back to the shabby refugee camp they call home, where she died a few days later.Some, in their anguish, turned the focus back on us.Why didn\u2019t we do something to save Amal\u2019s life, they wanted to know. Did we just take the photo, conduct the interview and move on? Couldn\u2019t we have somehow ensured that her family would get help?\u201cYou can take the picture AND provide assistance,\u201d one woman said on Twitter. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t rule out the other.\u201dThe questions resonated. Reporters are trained to bear witness; aid workers and doctors have the job of helping people.Donating money, or other forms of assistance, can be fraught with ethical, moral and practical complications. Is it fair to single out one person or family for help? What if they embellish their story for the next foreigner who comes along, thinking they could get more money?Plus, we have a job to do.Doctors show us around, and sometimes we end up acting like them \u2014 examining stick-like limbs and flaccid skin with clinical detachment; tabulating figures about weight and age; listening as families recount their tragedies with amazing calm. The prospect of death is discussed. We nod sagely, make a note, move on.But while we may try to mimic a stone, we are not stones, and every day in Yemen someone told me something that made a lump rise in my throat.Usually it was a mundane detail, like the lack of a few dollars to take a dying child to the hospital. Yemen, you realize, is a country where people are dying for lack of a taxi fare.Yemenis have to navigate such terrain, too.While some are dying, others are getting on with living. One night we returned to our hotel in Hajjah, a town ringed by rocky ridges in a province that has been pummeled by Saudi airstrikes. Lying in bed, I was startled by a loud bang then a burst of light that filled the sky \u2014 not a bomb, but fireworks.Since the start of the war, the rate of marriage in Yemen has gone up. And so, in this town where malnourished infants were perishing at the city hospital, others were dancing and celebrating through the night.But the surge in weddings, it turned out, was a survival mechanism.Across the social spectrum, Yemenis are sliding down the poverty ladder. Where once a mother bought a sack of rice to feed her family, now she can afford only a small bag. The hand of a daughter in marriage brings a bride price, and so weddings can be a source of income for stretched families.As we crossed Yemen \u2014 from the battle-scarred port of Hudaydah to the Houthi-held mountains \u2014 on a bumpy 900-mile journey, we saw scenes of heartbreaking suffering that unfolded against a backdrop of spectacular mountains, and customs that stubbornly endure despite everything.Every day, town centers bustled with men buying khat, the narcotic leaf beloved by Yemenis. The khat bazaars are a social event. Men, some with guns over their shoulders, gather to trade news, meet friends and prepare for the afternoon chew.Women in black cloaks flitted between them; in one place, a loud argument erupted into fisticuffs. Even as starvation bites, some are reluctant to cut back on their habit.In one health clinic, Ibrahim Junaid, a worried father standing over his ailing 5-month-old son, was chewing a lump of khat that left a green stain on his teeth and lips.Mr. Junaid was 60; his wife, 25, stood silently by his side. The nurses wrapped the boy in a gold foil blanket to keep him warm.Mr. Junaid regretted that his son hadn\u2019t enough to eat, adding that he had a lot of mouths to feed; he had married twice, and fathered 13 children.The value of practices like chewing khat may be hard to understand in such turbulent times. But for men like Mr. Junaid, it is an integral part of their day. And it is a mark of the resilience of an ancient society, one of the oldest civilizations of the Middle East.\u201cPeople say Yemen is in a state of chaos, but it\u2019s not,\u201d said Thierry Durand, an aid worker who has worked in Yemen since the 1980s, and now runs a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Mocha. \u201cThere is still structure.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t put it in three lines in your paper or describe it in three minutes on TV,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis country is structured by family, tribe, traditions \u2014 and despite everything, those structures are still there, and they are strong.\u201dStill, Yemeni society is being ravaged by war. Airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition, aided by American bombs, have killed thousands of civilians, and displaced many more. But for most Yemenis, war strikes their lives in quieter, more insidious ways.Bombs blow up bridges or factories, killing jobs, causing the currency to crumble and prices to soar, and forcing families to abstain from meat, then vegetables. Soon, they are dependent on international food aid or, in the worst cases, resort to meals of boiled leaves.Small but vital things, like a cab fare, become unattainable.As we drove away from the small hospital in Aslam, where Amal Hussain was being treated, we passed a young couple hitching a ride on the side of the road. They were holding a small infant. We stopped and offered them a ride.They squeezed into the passenger seat \u2014 the father, Khalil Hadi, enveloped by the black cloak of his wife, Hanna, who held their fragile 9-month-old son, Wejdan, who had just been released from the malnutrition ward.Theirs was a typical story. Their home near the Saudi border had been bombed, so they rented a room in a house near Aslam. Mr. Hadi tried to earn money driving a motorbike taxi, and by foraging for wood to sell at the market.Mr. Hadi wasn\u2019t looking for pity; many people were in similar trouble, he said. \u201cI\u2019d do anything to make some money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation is so hard.\u201dAt a junction in the road, the couple stepped out, offered thanks and began to walk away. Fumbling in my pocket, I called them back.I pulled out a wad of Yemeni notes \u2014 about $15 worth \u2014 and pressed it into his hand. It seemed so futile, in the greater scheme of things. What could it buy them? A few days respite, if even that?Mr. Hadi accepted the money with a gracious smile. As we drove off I saw the couple amble down a dusty road, toward their shelter, their ailing son held tight.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at Businessweek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Gauge Concerns About Brexit, Look at British Bonds", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe British pound is the most sensitive barometer of Brexit fears. The currency slumps each time it looks more likely that Britain may crash out of the European Union without a deal. At the same time, however, British government bond prices strengthen because bleak economic prospects mean higher interest rates are less likely. The clearest sign that investors have had enough of the United Kingdom would be when both weaken at the same time.Britain\u2019s currency and its government bonds, known as gilts, have tended to react to political turmoil by moving in opposite directions. The pound fell nearly 2 percent against the dollar and euro on Thursday after a string of cabinet resignations cast doubt on the future of Prime Minister Theresa May and her draft Brexit deal. But even as the pound suffered its worst day since Oct. 2016, gilts rallied. The yield, which drops when prices rise, on 10-year UK government bonds fell more than 10 basis points, to as low as 1.35 percent.Even more telling was that British sovereign debt performed better than German and American alternatives. That would not have been the case if investors had become wary of Britain altogether. The gap between the yield on gilts and German bonds narrowed by roughly 10 basis points on Thursday. Meanwhile 10-year United States government bonds yielded as much as 174 basis points more than comparable gilts \u2014 the widest difference since 1984.Like currency traders, bond investors think that the British economy would be damaged by a chaotic no-deal Brexit. But they believe this would force the Bank of England governor Mark J. Carney to defer further interest rate rises, which is typically good for debt prices. That investors can still apply normal bond logic shows that they are not yet panicky.It would take a full-blown pound crisis for the British central bank to respond by raising rates, ignoring the temporary slump in the pound as it did after the 2016 Brexit referendum. If bond investors believed that was likely, they would be as keen to ditch gilts as currency traders are to sell pounds.For now, however, Britain\u2019s political crisis has yet to become a financial one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When MAGA Fantasy Meets Rust Belt Reality", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump can\u2019t run America by yelling at people. Who knew?Opinion ColumnistLet\u2019s face it: Make America Great Again was a brilliant political slogan. Why? Because it could mean different things to different people.For many supporters of Donald Trump, MAGA was basically a promise to return to the good old days of raw racism and sexism. And Trump is delivering on that promise.But for at least some Trump voters, it was a promise to restore the kind of economy we had 40 or 50 years ago \u2014 an economy that still offered lots of manly jobs in manufacturing and mining. Unfortunately for those who trusted Mr. Art of the Deal, Trump never had any idea how to deliver on that promise. And even if he had a clue about policymaking, he couldn\u2019t have changed the long-term trajectory of our economy, which is moving steadily away from making physical stuff and toward providing services.As a result, Trump, who cares above all about image, is now getting headlines that make a mockery of his campaign posturing \u2014 headlines about closing auto plants and lost jobs. Now, autos are a special case; overall manufacturing employment is still rising, although not especially fast. But relative to his grand promises, what\u2019s happening is an embarrassing bust.Why was the vision of revived manufacturing nonsense? Talking about what Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know is, of course, a vast task, since his ignorance is both broad and deep. But he seems to have misunderstood three specific things about manufacturing.First, he believes that trade deficits are the reason we\u2019ve shifted away from manufacturing. But they aren\u2019t.Still, even if trade deficits are a distinctly secondary cause of manufacturing decline, can\u2019t Trump help a little by getting tough on foreigners? That brings us to his second fallacy: No, trade deficits aren\u2019t caused by unfair foreign trade practices.The truth is that while tariffs and so on can affect trade in particular industries, the overall trade balance mainly reflects exchange rates, which in turn are mainly driven by capital flows: The dollar is strong because foreigners want to buy U.S. assets. And Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 tax cuts for corporations, big deficits that drive up interest rates \u2014 are so far making the dollar even stronger.Or to put it differently, running America isn\u2019t like running a family business. It has to be done by setting broad policies and sticking to them, not by browbeating a few people whenever you see a bad headline.So Trump\u2019s promise to restore U.S. manufacturing was doomed to fail. Why did he make it in the first place?For what it\u2019s worth, I suspect that in this case Trump wasn\u2019t actually trying to scam voters. My guess is that he genuinely believed that he could bring manufacturing, coal mining and so on roaring back, that others had failed to do so only because they weren\u2019t tough enough.But the real question isn\u2019t whether Trump will ever realize that he doesn\u2019t know how to MAGA. It\u2019s whether and when his supporters will figure it out. I guess we\u2019ll learn the answer in the months ahead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit, Borders, and the Bank of England (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow bad will it be when Britain leaves the European Union?Opinion ColumnistI personally think Brexit is a mistake, but was puzzled by how big some of the numbers were; I tweeted about that, and the BoE reached out to me to offer some explanation of what was going on in their analysis. What I want to do here is, first, to recount my understanding of their logic; then offer my own views on what a reasonable Brexit projection might assume for both the short and the long run.But where did these negative scenarios come from?When economists try to assess changes in trade policy, they normally use some kind of \u201ccomputable general equilibrium\u201d (CGE) model. These models attempt to take account of the impacts of trade policy on consumption, production, and the allocation of resources. And there has been quite a lot of CGE modeling of Brexit.But the BoE\u2019s worst-case scenario shows a cost exceeding 10% of GDP, around three times what a CGE would tell you. Where\u2019s that coming from?Part of the answer is that the BoE includes some nonstandard effects of trade: they assume that reduced trade (and foreign direct investment) will reduce productivity more than the direct impacts on resource allocation would predict. They cite some statistical evidence, but it\u2019s important to realize that this is black-box, reduced-form stuff: there\u2019s no explicit mechanism through which it\u2019s supposed to happen.However, these assumed nonstandard effects aren\u2019t what\u2019s driving the really bad scenarios; they only, as I understand it, contribute something like 1 percentage point of GDP to the predicted costs.What\u2019s key to the very bad results is, instead, the disruption that might come with a hard Brexit. Right now, goods flow into and out of Britain with minimal frictions. After Brexit, there would have to be customs inspections, and the UK doesn\u2019t have remotely enough customs infrastructure to do the job. The result would be huge delays at Dover and other ports, with queues of trucks backing up for many miles on motorways, just-in-time production massively disrupted, and more.That disruption is what\u2019s driving the terrible scenarios. Notice that this analysis says that the costs of leaving the EU are much higher than the GDP that would have been foregone if Britain had never entered the EU, and therefore had the customs infrastructure to deal with trade flows in place.OK, that\u2019s what I understand about the BoE analysis. What do I think about it?So, about the BoE\u2019s purpose in issuing this report: if it wasn\u2019t intended to scare people, the Bank was extraordinarily na\u00efve in not realizing how it would be reported and read. They really led with their chin here.On the substance: I\u2019m skeptical about the supposed effects of trade on productivity. I know that there\u2019s some evidence for such effects; trade seems to favor more productive firms. But relying a lot on effects we can\u2019t model seems dubious.In particular, I have strong memories of the openness-growth debacle of the 1990s. At the time, there were many statistical studies purporting to find that open, outward oriented developing countries had much higher growth rates than inward-looking economies. This was interpreted to mean that countries that had tried to industrialize by protecting domestic markets could achieve Asian-type growth rates if they liberalized trade.As it turned out, the supposed statistical evidence on openness and growth was quite suspect. And when massive trade liberalization happened in places like Mexico, the hoped-for growth miracles didn\u2019t materialize.So I would treat that channel of Brexit losses as questionable. But what I learned from the BoE is that it\u2019s not that central to the analysis.What about disruption at the borders? This could indeed be a huge problem.What\u2019s puzzling about the scenarios shown in Figure 1 is that they show these disruptions going on for multiple years, with barely any abatement. Really? Britain is an advanced country with high administrative capacity \u2014 the kind of country that history shows can cope well with huge natural disasters, and even wars. Would it really have that much trouble hiring customs inspectors and installing computers to recover from an 8 or 10 percent drop in GDP?And even in the short run, I wonder why Britain couldn\u2019t follow the old prescription, \u201cWhen all else fails, lower your standards.\u201d If laxer enforcement, special treatment for trusted shippers, whatever, could clear the bottlenecks at the ports, wouldn\u2019t that be worth it, despite the potential for fraud, as a temporary measure?That said, it\u2019s truly amazing that Britain finds itself in this position. If the downsides are anywhere close to what the BoE asserts, given the risk \u2014 which we\u2019ve known for a long time was substantial \u2014 of a hard Brexit, it was an act of utter folly not to have put in backup capacity at the borders. We can\u2019t possibly be talking about all that much money, and the Brexit vote was more than two years ago. What has the UK government been doing?All in all, it\u2019s quite a spectacle. Whether you\u2019re pro-Brexit or anti, you should be horrified and outraged at how the issue has been handled.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba Feels the Pinch From China\u2019s Slowing Economic Growth", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s biggest e-commerce company is expecting rockier times ahead, a troubling sign for a vast economy that is one of the world\u2019s most important engines of growth.The flagging pace of economic expansion in China and the country\u2019s trade war with the United States led the Alibaba Group to cut its estimate of revenue growth for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, by around 5 percent, the shopping giant said on Friday. For the quarter that ended in September, revenue came in at $12.4 billion, a 54 percent increase from a year earlier but less than analysts had expected.\u201cThe global economy is in a state of uncertainty,\u201d Daniel Zhang, Alibaba\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cThe U.S.-China trade tensions create increased risk of instability.\u201dThe decision to lower sales expectations was made only recently, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Maggie Wu, said. Economic conditions deteriorated noticeably in just the past month, she said. \u201cMerchants are facing challenging times,\u201d she said.There is mounting evidence that China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second-largest after the United States\u2019, is slowing. But Alibaba\u2019s trimming of its sales outlook suggests the downturn is starting to affect more parts of the economy, including China\u2019s growing middle class.Shawn Yang, 27, works in finance in Shanghai. He said that distress being felt in his industry had him thinking twice about buying nonessential items like gadgets and video games.This year? He plans to spend less than half that amount, on jeans from Zara, two shirts for work and a bottle of moisturizer.The other dark cloud hovering over the Chinese economy has drifted in from overseas.The quarter that ended in September was the first since the Trump administration began its trade war with China. Alibaba executives have sought to reassure investors by pointing out that even if tariffs on imports make American goods more expensive, Chinese customers can still use Alibaba\u2019s platforms to buy more products made domestically or in other countries.But the effects of the tariffs are only beginning to be felt across China\u2019s $12 trillion economy. Factory activity is slowing, which could eventually result in job losses and a drop in retail spending. Washington and Beijing seem to be hunkering down for a protracted conflict, one in which disagreements about trade seem inextricable from broader questions involving geopolitical and technological dominance.For Alibaba, the timing is inopportune.Alibaba has long enjoyed an unmatched grip on how Chinese consumers shop on their phones and computers. Lately, the company has said its future depends on extending its consumer empire into the wider, nondigital world.Expanding its operations offline has helped raise Alibaba\u2019s sales growth. Revenue from retail experiments like Hema jumped 151 percent in the latest quarter from a year earlier. Sales in the company\u2019s cloud-computing division, the market leader in China, soared 90 percent.But spending on developing the new ventures has squeezed the company\u2019s bottom line. Asked on Friday whether the more pessimistic outlook for this year might lead Alibaba to scale back on such projects, Ms. Wu, the chief financial officer, said the company evaluated them not on their financial return, but according to other metrics, such as the number of users they attract.Carolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Amazon Finally Makes an HQ2 Decision", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello from Seattle. I\u2019m Karen Weise, the new tech correspondent here. As you might imagine, the announcement of Amazon\u2019s decision in what it had billed as a search for a second headquarters, a.k.a. HQ2, has dominated news here this week.I\u2019ve found the HQ2 search and the obsession around it fascinating because of the blatant display of Amazon\u2019s power to promise jobs and lobby politicians, thanks to the company\u2019s market dominance and consumer adoration.The choice to enter New York is particularly interesting because Amazon will need to deal with a local political environment that is far more complex than its hometown\u2019s.Seattle has plenty of activism \u2014 from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests to becoming the first big city to pass a $15 minimum wage \u2014 and certainly there\u2019s some antagonism toward Amazon. But the labor, media and electoral politics of New York are a different breed.That\u2019s been evident in the blowback to the more than $2 billion in planned tax subsidies there. That the state promised to help Amazon get access to a helipad didn\u2019t help.The New York Post cover blared \u201cQueens Ransom\u201d next to a picture of the company founder, Jeff Bezos, laughing in a helicopter holding bags of cash. A hundred people protested at the Long Island City site, waving signs like one that read \u201cStay the Helipad Out.\u201dUntil recently, Amazon barely involved itself in Seattle\u2019s civic politics. Its growth was steady for more than a decade, only kicking into high gear the past few years. For a while, Amazon\u2019s main involvement with city hall was more about small things like approvals for street vacations than major politics.That began to change in 2015, when Amazon\u2019s real estate head, John Schoettler, who was deeply involved in the HQ2 search, led the local Chamber of Commerce. Earlier this year, Amazon publicly fought a new tax to pay for homeless services and affordable housing. But there was never a singular moment like this when Seattle got to ask: Do we want Amazon here? If so, do we want taxpayers to pay for it?When news of a split HQ2 broke, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said, \u201cI\u2019d call those branch offices.\u201d It\u2019s a good zinger, but while Seattle may want to call it a win, several experts pointed out to me that Amazon will now have three cities to pit against one another for decades to come. Talk about leverage.And Amazon is still calling the two new locations headquarters. \u201cWe know there will be leaders and teams in all three headquarters as we map out the growth,\u201d Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, told me. \u201cWe are already a company that spans the country, with employees in over 45 states. I\u2019m on the leadership team but live in D.C. and am in Seattle today. It reinforces what already exists for us.\u201dHow that division shakes out will be interesting to track. The New York office is already home to much of Amazon\u2019s growing advertising group, which has become almost an obsession among investors because of its high margins. That\u2019s a mix of the technical and creative work that\u2019s already thriving in the city.Many had suggested that a Washington-area choice could signal a growing dependence on government contracts, like a $10 billion cloud deal for the Defense Department that Amazon is favored to win.But Amazon\u2019s agreement with Virginia specifically states that the incentives Amazon gets will decrease if more than 10 percent of the work done at that location is for federal contracts, something that reflects the state\u2019s goal of diversifying its economy away from government work. So what\u2019s Amazon\u2019s vision there?Some other tech stories of note this week:Advertisement"}

Besides the North\u2019s nuclear weapons, such rockets are considered one of the greatest military threats against South Korea because the North deploys them near the inter-Korean border to target the South\u2019s capital, Seoul, a city of 10 million people.Many Western experts still doubt that North Korea has mastered all the technologies needed to deliver a small nuclear warhead on such missiles. Still, following the November test, Mr. Kim said his country no longer needed to conduct nuclear and long-range missile tests because it had achieved the capability to hit the United States with nuclear missiles.But the Singapore agreement was short on specifics, and subsequent negotiations on carrying it out have since stalled.North Korea has pledged to dismantle its Yongbyon nuclear complex, a center for producing nuclear bomb fuel, and take other actions, but will do so only if Washington takes \u201ccorresponding\u201d steps, like easing sanctions and signing a peace declaration.

It now has an ambitious plan to go even further, by trying to upend the traditional economic order and create a global powerhouse that can dictate the rules of trade.It\u2019s not just about powering growth. It\u2019s also about national security and self-sufficiency.China wants to build homegrown champions in cutting-edge industries that rival Western giants like Apple and Qualcomm. While China has a long way to go, the Communist Party is bringing the full financial weight of the state and forcing other countries to play defense.In doing so, China is staking out a new manufacturing model.Economic textbooks lay out a common trajectory for developing nations. First they make shoes, then steel. Next they move into cars, computers and cellphones. Eventually the most advanced economies tackle semiconductors and automation. As they climb up the manufacturing ladder, they abandon some cheaper goods along the way.That\u2019s what the United States, Japan and South Korea did. But China is defying the economic odds by trying to do all of them.Look at the evolution of what China sells to the rest of the world. As it ramped up its manufacturing engine in 2000, China was pretty good at making basic products like toys and umbrellas.By 2016, China had moved into more expensive goods like cellphones and computers, while making even more of the cheaper stuff.The next phase, which includes the most valuable products in the world, will be harder. China can\u2019t make chips as small and fast as the United States can. Its cars are mostly sold at home. Its manufacturing prowess is built on the back of engineering and expertise from the West.Both the Apple iPhone and Huawei Mate 10 are assembled in Chinese factories. Both rely on pieces from outside China.The most intricate and expensive technology in the Huawei phone, the motherboard, has a Chinese processor, but it is primarily composed of chips from American, South Korean and Japanese companies. The 2.8-inch board accounts for 52 percent of the cost of the phone, according to data from TechInsights.South KoreaMultichip memory, SK Hynix USATaiwanChinaNetherlandsUSB switchON SemiconductorLoad switchbattery charger, Richtek Battery charger, HiSiliconAudio Switch, NXP SemiconductorUSAPower amplifier,QorvoChinaProcessor, HiSiliconJapanRegulator,RenesasSIM card slotChinaAudio CODEC,HiSiliconNetherlandsController,NXP SemiconductorJapanElectronic Compass, AKM SemiconductorNetherlandsSouth KoreaMultichip memory by Samsung Audio Switch, NXPSemiconductors1 inchChinaSouth KoreaChinaProcessorMemoryAudio CODECJapanNetherlandsRegulatorAudio SwitchChinaBatteryChargerSouth KoreaMemoryUSAUSBswitchNetherlandsAudio SwitchTaiwanLoad switchbatterychargerChinaBattery chargerNetherlandsControllerSIM card slotUSAPower amplifier1 inchMany of these companies are so advanced that they don\u2019t even manufacture the chips.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Happening to the Price of Oil?", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOil prices have plummeted in recent days, months after surging to their highest point since 2014. After topping $75 a barrel in early October, the price of West Texas intermediate, the North American benchmark, has fallen by roughly one-quarter. Brent crude, the international standard, has had a comparable decline.A one-day drop of nearly 7 percent on Tuesday was among the sharpest in recent years, taking prices to the lowest levels of 2018.The abrupt retreat, which inevitably brings back memories of the industry-rattling crash in 2014, is a big worry for members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose economies are closely tied to oil revenues. Saudi Arabia, the most powerful OPEC member, said on Nov. 11 that it would cut output by half a million barrels a day to bolster prices.That announcement seemed to prompt a warning from President Trump, who said on Twitter a day later: \u201cHopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!\u201d Analysts say Mr. Trump\u2019s comment may have accentuated the price trend by creating doubt about whether OPEC would enact cuts.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump cheered the most recent drop on Twitter, with a call to \u201cgo lower.\u201dBut analysts say pressure is building on OPEC to shore up prices when the organization gathers in Vienna \u2014 along with Russia and other producers \u2014 in early December. Here\u2019s a look at the situation the group will face.Over the summer, the Saudis and other producers, who had been restraining output since 2017, opened up the taps, aiming to ease consumers\u2019 worries and placate Mr. Trump. They may have been overly proactive. Traders have shifted their focus from Iran to other factors, like whether Mr. Trump\u2019s trade battles with China and rising interest rates might dampen global economic growth and demand for oil.At the same time, production in the United States has been rising faster than expected. Output has also risen in Libya, despite continuing warfare, and it has held up better than expected in another troubled country, Venezuela. Volumes of oil held in storage tanks around the world are beginning to build again, raising fears of a renewed glut, analysts say.The sanctions have had less effect on Iranian output than some analysts had predicted, but expectations may have been too dire. The measures, which impose penalties on companies buying Iranian oil, came into effect on Nov. 5. Buyers had been expected to reduce purchases of Iranian crude oil before the sanctions, but that activity seems to have curbed Iran\u2019s output only modestly. For instance, OPEC reported that Iranian production in October was down 4.5 percent from the previous month, to about 3.3 million barrels a day.Some background on why the impact has been muted: The Trump administration granted temporary waivers to Iran\u2019s largest customers, including China, India and Japan. Oil traders took the administration\u2019s generosity to mean that the eventual cuts to Iranian exports might be less than expected. \u201cThe market was quite surprised to see that waivers were granted,\u201d said Homayoun Falakshahi, an Iran analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an energy research firm.When OPEC members meet in Vienna next month, analysts expect the group to announce production cuts of around one million barrels a day, about 1 percent of world supplies.There is little doubt that the Saudis can make cuts of this scale. After all, they have lifted production by almost 700,000 barrels a day compared with their average output in 2017.Saudi Arabia, which tries to avoid taking the pain on its own, may struggle to persuade producers like Russia and Iraq to join in making cuts, analysts said. The Saudis may also need to navigate a tricky path between the pressures from the Trump administration for lower oil prices and their economy\u2019s need for higher revenues.There is a good chance, analysts added, that producers such as Russia and Iraq may decide that going along with cuts is in their self-interest. \u201cIn the end we think Putin will make the same call as he did in November 2016 and opt to join the OPEC producers because of domestic fiscal considerations,\u201d Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients on Nov. 14.A few months ago the Saudis seemed to have steered the market back to what were, for their purposes, more comfortable price levels by orchestrating output cuts with Russia and other producers. Now the Saudis and their oil allies are again in the uncomfortable spot of being squeezed, mainly by shale-oil producers in the United States.\u201cThey are back having to stop the market from falling rather than having to worry about the market rising,\u201d said James Davis, an analyst at FGE, an energy consulting firm.Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Supported byMr. Evans grew up in Toronto with five siblings, including a twin brother, Mark. The twins would go on to join the Canadian Olympic team, which won a gold medal in rowing at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. When did you start rowing with your brother? There was a little bit too much competition when we were young. My parents sort of purposely kept us out of the same schools. But then we started rowing together in my junior year at Princeton to train for the world championships. This was two years before the \u201984 Olympics.How was that, rowing with the twin you\u2019d been so competitive with? When it came to race day, our heads were always aligned. Our real focus was to beat the other crew, not to beat ourselves. And we were in a boat of eight. The whole crew had to be aligned and focused on the mission.And then you had a good Olympic Games. Yeah, we won. It doesn't get better than that.What was your first job out of college? Keeping consistent with what my parents had done, my brother and I didn't want to join the same investment bank. He went to Goldman and I went to Salomon Brothers.You eventually got to Goldman, too. I was recruited by John Thornton (the former president of Goldman Sachs), who tried to recruit me many times to come over, then finally succeeded. Then I spent the next 21 years there.How was the Goldman you joined different than the Goldman you left?At the time I joined, there were probably 100 people with us in London. There were probably 20 people in Asia. Goldman Sachs at this time was really a U.S. investment bank with remote locations. By the time I left, they had 7,000 people in London, 3,000 or 4,000 people in Asia, and they built businesses all over the world.When did you first get to know Alibaba? I first met Jack in 1999, and we invested $5 million. We were one of the first. In your lifetime you might meet four or five true visionaries. Of those four or five, maybe one or two are actually able to convert it into something real. Jack was one of those guys.So how did you wind up joining the company? I left Goldman in 2013 and I started thinking about what I wanted to do. One day I got a call from Jack and he said, \u201cHey, we want you to come on the board.\u201d Then, right after the I.P.O., Jack said, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you join us as the Alibaba president?\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, O.K.\u201d My wife thought was terrible idea because she knew it was going to be a huge amount of travel.It was just Singles Day and Alibaba did almost $31 billion of sales in one day. Against the backdrop of a trade war and slowing economic growth in China, what do these numbers tell you about the Chinese economy? To sell $31 billion in a single day would not suggest that there\u2019s a lot of softening in the Chinese economy. When we're selling $31 billion of product in a day, we\u2019re processing about 325,000 payments a second. We sent out just over 1 billion packages, many of them delivered last night and this morning. Clearly, the economy has slowed down, but we see continued growth in consumption by consumers.There are still tensions between Alibaba and luxury good providers over the issue of counterfeits. What are you doing to address their concerns? Several years ago we decided that if we wanted to be the global leader in commerce and represent brands everywhere in the world, we were also going to have to be the global leader in brand protection. So we\u2019re working in partnership with brands, conducting 24/7 surveillance on our platform, and working offline with law enforcement to go after the counterfeiters. This is about protecting consumers and protecting brands but it\u2019s also about protecting our brand and reputation. If we can\u2019t lead in brand protection, we will not lead in global commerce.Consumers now expect goods delivered to them almost instantaneously, and you\u2019re investing heavily in your delivery and logistics capabilities. Why is this so important to you? When a package gets lost, when it\u2019s not delivered on time, when it comes broken, when it comes in a box that\u2019s already been opened, when it comes in a soft package that\u2019s torn or looks terrible, it\u2019s a bad consumer experience. Bad consumer experiences generally do not result in conversion to repeat customers. We are highly, highly focused on the logistics experience, and when you are delivering 70 million packages a day, every day, it\u2019s impossible to keep track of everything with humans. With need bots. We need technology, and we obviously need delivery people who are going to do a terrific job.What did you learn from Singles Day this year? One of the most interesting things that comes out of Singles Day is that we have the capacity to operate for one day a year at this scale and capacity, whether it\u2019s logistics, payments, cloud or all of our enabling infrastructure. We believe there will come a day in the future when we operate at that scale, and that capacity, every day. There are no winners in a trade battle, or other battles between China and the United States. President Trump once said that trade wars were easy to win. Either he mistook his adversary, or he hadn\u2019t done enough of them to know that they are actually prolonged and very difficult. The one thing we know is that there will be no winners if there\u2019s a trade war. And if the trade war between China and the U.S. continues, we know that the impact on the rest of the world, and particularly smaller economies, is going to be significant.Advertisement"}

When Mr. Trudeau ended his comments, the American president shook his hand with a brevity that contrasted with his usual vigorous greetings.Some in the Canadian news media presented the deal as a sign that, at least for now, a full-on trade skirmish had ended.\u201c \u2018Battle\u2019 over as Trudeau, Trump, Pe\u00f1a Nieto sign \u2018new Nafta,\u2019\u201d said a headline from the CBC, the national broadcaster.Yet the article noted that Canada had been \u201creluctant to have a celebratory signing of a free trade deal marred by tariffs that suggest anything but true free trade.\u201dIn negotiating what was once the North American Free Trade Agreement and is now known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Canada won concessions including a dispute resolution system for companies that feel unfairly targeted with taxes.It will also receive exemptions from any future American tariffs on 2.6 million imported passenger vehicles.In return, Canada agreed to, among other things, Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated demands that it crack open its long-protected dairy market.But the brinkmanship leading up to the agreement was bruising and the metals tariffs remain in place, severely testing the relationship between Canada and its biggest and most important trading partner.Canadians were irate. Mr. Trudeau, who has attracted adulation on the global stage, is a sometimes polarizing figure at home and he faces an election next year.Senior Canadian officials said privately that in the negotiations, Mr. Trudeau had not been swayed by Mr. Trump\u2019s insults, feeling confident that Canada\u2019s view of an open, multilateral world order was the right path forward.Across the country and in the corridors of Ottawa, there was quiet satisfaction that self-effacing Canada had stood up to Mr. Trump, and had not allowed itself to be pushed around.Internationally, Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Trump have become foils for one another.Mr. Trudeau is a telegenic figure who speaks carefully and espouses liberal internationalism, women\u2019s rights, the benefits of immigration and the fight against climate change.Even their contrasting reactions to bad weather have gained the world\u2019s attention.This month, Mr. Trump drew criticism after deciding not to visit a World War I cemetery because of poor weather during a trip to France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of the war.Soon, a video of Mr. Trudeau braving the pouring rain during an August 2017 commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Dieppe raid in World War II was shared widely on Twitter.Many Canadians regard Mr. Trump as a bully, a perception that intensified after the American leader imposed the steel and aluminum tariffs in May.Mr. Trump framed the move as necessary for national security, prompting Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, to retort that \u201cthe national security pretext is absurd and frankly insulting to Canadians.\u201dCanada retaliated with import duties on $12.6 billion of American products, including ballpoint pens and industrial pipes.Canadian officials said a team of lawyers had been \u201cscrubbing the deal\u201d assiduously to make sure that it matched what had been agreed to.But they emphasized that this was not surprising, given that it usually took a year for lawyers to go through hefty trade deals, and in this case, they had only had two months.Among the areas getting the most scrutiny were concessions over Canada\u2019s protection of its dairy market, including reducing barriers for American farmers to sell cheese, milk and other products to Canada.Peter Baker and Daniel Politi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K.\u2019s Homelessness Problem Is Growing, and Spreading, Report Finds", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The tents have become a familiar sight on the streets of London, popping up outside stores shuttered by a slowdown in trade or even below the plate-glass windows of high-end home improvement outlets.Small and flimsy, they offer some rudiment of shelter to the growing ranks of the homeless in a city that prides itself on the wealth of the banks and businesses that help make Britain\u2019s economy the fifth largest in the world.The figure includes people in temporary accommodation or hostels; Shelter puts the number of \u201crough sleepers,\u201d the British term for those forced to sleep in the streets, at 5,096.And the numbers indicate that, as poverty bites in poorer cities, the phenomenon is increasing more rapidly outside the capital, propelled by high rents, reduced welfare benefits and eight years of public spending cuts linked to policies of austerity.\u201cDue to the perfect storm of spiraling rents, welfare cuts and a total lack of social housing, record numbers of people are sleeping out on the streets or stuck in the cramped confines of a hostel room,\u201d Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said. Hundreds of thousands of lives \u201cwill be blighted by homelessness this winter,\u201d she added.\u201cThis is obvious to anyone who opens their eyes to see the immense growth in food banks and the queues waiting outside them, the people sleeping rough in the streets, the growth of homelessness, the sense of deep despair that leads even the government to appoint a minister for suicide prevention and civil society to report in depth on unheard-of levels of loneliness and isolation,\u201d Mr. Alston wrote.Amber Rudd, a former home secretary who is now the cabinet minister for work and pensions, responded tartly to Mr. Alston\u2019s conclusion that 14 million people lived in poverty and 1.5 million were destitute. The calculations in the study undercut the government\u2019s effort to replace Britain\u2019s myriad social benefits with a single payment called \u201cUniversal Credit.\u201d The new system has been criticized by its opponents as deepening poverty.\u201cI was disappointed, to say the least, by the extraordinary political nature of his language,\u201d Ms. Rudd told Parliament, referring to Mr. Alston\u2019s report.\u201cWe are not so proud that we don\u2019t think we can learn as we try to adjust Universal Credit for the benefit of everybody. But that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and discredited a lot of what he was saying.\u201dThe latest assessment by Shelter was its third annual summary and showed homelessness rising from 294,000 in 2016 and 307,000 in 2017. The greatest concentration of homelessness was in London, which had 170,000 homeless people, more than 5,000 of them in Kensington and Chelsea, its richest borough. But the sharpest increases were in the English Midlands and in Yorkshire in northern England, Shelter said.James Brokenshire, the government minister responsible for housing and communities, said, \u201cNo one should be left without a roof over their head, which is why we are determined to end rough sleeping and respond to the causes of homelessness.\u201dThe government was spending more than 1.2 billion pounds \u2014 about $1.5 billion \u2014 on dealing with homelessness, he said, and was also promoting the building of new homes.But, he added, \u201cWe know that there is more that we need to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think You Care About the Midterms? These People Upended Their Lives to Volunteer", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Election Day approaches, many Americans are fired up. This weekend, volunteers knocked on doors across the country in a final push to influence an election that could shift the balance of power in Washington.But in this election cycle, some Americans have gone to extraordinary lengths \u2014 quitting jobs, delaying school, moving across the country \u2014 to work without pay for a campaign. Their zeal speaks to the historic political moment, in which a dizzying array of House races across the country have begun to feel as consequential as a presidential election.For die-hard campaigners who have spent months working, unpaid, Election Day will mark the last leg of a marathon. Or the final steps in a personal odyssey. Or the bittersweet return to normal life.\u201cMy biggest issues are the money in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this money is coming in from corporations. It\u2019s not how this country was supposed to be governed.\u201dHe\u2019d never been involved in politics before. But he found his way to a campaign office in Ohio in June and offered his services for free. \u201cEvery day there was organized canvassing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cKnocking on doors. There was a place where you get your literature packet and a little pep talk.\u201dOnce, the pep talk came from Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston, who went around the room shaking hands. It gave Mr. Hill the feeling that he was a part of something special and important that was bigger than anything he had ever done. He eventually moved on to another swing district \u2014 Pennsylvania\u2019s Seventh \u2014 to campaign for Democrats.Canvasing can be a little awkward and frustrating, he said, especially when talking to people who don\u2019t plan to vote. But after five months of door-knocking, he had become the veteran responsible for training volunteers for the last weekend\u2019s final push. After Election Day, he\u2019s not sure what he will do. But he won\u2019t be returning to his old life in California.\u201cI had a job, but I did not have a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cI found my purpose.\u201dMrs. Rushin grilled him about everything from the national debt to abortion. His answers impressed her.\u201cHe stood there, with his back as straight as a ramrod and he said \u2018I believe in life at conception and I cannot compromise,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Rushin, a born-again Christian, recalled. \u201cThat really spoke to me.\u201dAfter Mr. Crenshaw, a retired Navy SEAL who lost an eye in Afghanistan, opened a satellite office near Mrs. Rushin\u2019s house, she and her husband signed up to volunteer. But then the office manager broke her foot. \u201cI said to my husband, \u2018I\u2019m a retiree. I\u2019ll go up and help them out.\u2019\u201dMrs. Rushin has been in charge ever since. She\u2019s worked, unpaid, between eight to 10 hours a day since March, her first foray into political campaigning.She\u2019s animated by the feeling that the country is hopelessly divided, and that conservatives can\u2019t express their values anymore without being shouted down. And although she didn\u2019t initially support Mr. Trump \u2014 she backed his primary rival from Texas, Ted Cruz \u2014 she feels that the economy has roared back since he took office. She wants to consolidate those gains.\u201cThis midterm election is critical,\u201d she said.\u201cWe wrote them in our own voice,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we have people coming up to the polls saying \u2018Hey we got your card.\u2019 It makes me feel like this work is worth it.\u201dHe still remembers the exact moment that the idea popped in his head: \u201cI was sitting at the Blind Tiger Ale House, in the Village, and everyone was complaining about Trump. I said, \u2018Stop complaining and do something about it.\u2019\u201dAs a young man in Oklahoma, he\u2019d signed up for the military when his country needed him. He felt that his country needed him again.He decided to spend the summer and fall volunteering for a midterm campaign, even though he\u2019d never worked on a congressional race before. He settled on Iowa, which has never elected a woman to the House of Representatives.Mr. Yust hadn\u2019t owned a car in 30 years, but he knew he had to have one to campaign in Iowa. He bought a Honda Fit, and drove it to Des Moines in June, in time for the state\u2019s Democratic Party convention.\u201cPeople thought I was a little bit nuts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re doing stuff for free, they are going to let you walk in the door.\u201dAfter three decades in New York City, Mr. Yust experienced a bit of culture shock. He\u2019s vegan, but ended up at the Polk County Steak Fry, a fund-raiser for Democrats. (\u201cI ate the steak,\u201d he said.) But volunteering reconnected him with the American heartland where he grew up. \u201cThese are very nice people,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2020, I\u2019m going to come back.\u201dGrace Hamilton, 24, from Sammamish, Wash., quit her job at a tech firm and embarked upon a 9,000-mile loop around the country, with the goal of volunteering for as many Democratic candidates as she could. She mapped out a route through the toughest battlegrounds, hoping to lend a hand to 34 candidates. In the end, she made it to 28.The trip gave her a unique glimpse of how Democratic voters are feeling on the eve of an election that she considers to be the most consequential in her lifetime.\u201cIf the stakes weren\u2019t so high, I wouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that way for everyone. When I am knocking on folks\u2019 doors, I hear people say \u2018We\u2019re not political, we don\u2019t vote\u2019 just as much as I hear people say \u2018Of course, I\u2019m supporting Democrats.\u2019\u201dHer schedule kept her constantly moving. At times, she drove through the night to spend a day canvassing in another state. Each afternoon, she walked into a campaign office in a place she\u2019d never been before, and asked for a packet. She knocked on doors all afternoon, returned the packet, and drove on. If her canvass ended early, she made calls from her cellphone for Democratic candidates.\u201cMy glove box is full of fliers,\u201d she said. \u201cHealth care is the first thing on almost all of them.\u201dThe hardest thing about the trip wasn\u2019t camping by the side of the road, or mastering the platforms of dozens of candidates well enough to persuade voters to support them. It was hearing from people who had given up on politics altogether.\u201cThere have been a couple of people who said \u2018I\u2019m not voting, I\u2019m so sick of this nonsense,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI feel really badly that our political institutions have failed people to that point.

{"Headline": "Needing Growth, Uber Returns to Germany. This Time on Best Behavior.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byD\u00dcSSELDORF, Germany \u2014 Guido Goebel stopped driving for Uber three years ago when the company abandoned his hometown, the German city of D\u00fcsseldorf, after a battle with regulators.Several weeks ago, the ride-hailing service reached out to him again. Uber told Mr. Goebel that it was returning to D\u00fcsseldorf and offered him a bonus of 500 euros, or about $560, if he hit certain driving targets.\u201cIt\u2019s good. I\u2019m busy,\u201d Mr. Goebel, who had taken work driving patients to medical appointments, said from behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz C-Class. \u201cPeople are happy Uber is here.\u201dThe old no-holds-barred strategy \u201cclearly didn\u2019t work,\u201d and the product is now \u201ctailor made for the market,\u201d said Christoph Weigler, Uber\u2019s general manager in Germany.But Mr. Khosrowshahi must also show growth ahead of taking Uber public next year, in what would likely be one of the biggest-ever technology offerings. As a result, he is refocusing on Europe, where the company can typically charge higher fares.\u201cThey have identified Continental Europe as one of their major growth areas, but they are realizing once again that going abroad isn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Nils Stieglitz, president and managing director of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, who has tracked Uber\u2019s business.Germany is a particular prize because it is the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy and the biggest in Europe, with several densely populated cities and an affluent, digitally savvy population.Yet the country has a tangle of licensing rules that make it hard to recruit independent drivers. Germany requires drivers to pass health and driving tests, as well as receive a business license that includes a bookkeeping exam. Another rule orders drivers to return to a home base between trips, limiting how many rides can be made. Car-pooling services are banned.Over the past year, Mr. Khosrowshahi has visited Germany twice to apologize for the company\u2019s past behavior and to lobby to change some of the transportation laws. In one encouraging sign for Uber, the government said in March that it would update its transportation policy, though the deliberations could take years.\u201cThere are still aspects of the regulation that we think could be tweaked to make our model slightly more scalable,\u201d said Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the head of Uber\u2019s operations in Europe.While Uber waits for rule changes, it has teamed up with private car services and some taxi operators who already have the required licenses and drivers. It plans to introduce electric bikes in Berlin, the first city outside the United States where the Uber bikes will be available, and to eventually debut its food-delivery service in Germany.Yet as Uber tries to muscle deeper into Germany after a three-year hiatus, it faces more competition. A service owned by BMW, DriveNow, lets people rent a car with an app for short trips around cities such as Berlin. Moia, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, is testing a ride-sharing bus service in Hamburg. MyTaxi, a taxi-dispatch app owned by Daimler, is also widely used. And there are fast-growing rivals such as Taxify, which provides rides in European cities.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for them to compete on so many fronts at once,\u201d Markus Villig, Taxify\u2019s chief executive, said of Uber. Unless Uber can win major changes to German regulations, he said, \u201cthey are in a very tight spot.\u201dUber said it had selected D\u00fcsseldorf as its re-entry point for expanding in Germany after seeing that customers there had logged into its app more than 150,000 times since January, even though no cars were on the road. D\u00fcsseldorf, about 350 miles west of Berlin, is a business hub and home to popular festivals that draw travelers. One boisterous area of town, called \u201cThe Longest Bar,\u201d has more than 260 bars and dance clubs.Uber knew it could not open in D\u00fcsseldorf as it had in 2014, when it first arrived. That year, Uber didn\u2019t bother warning local officials it was coming. One morning, the app simply went live, and anybody was free to transform his or her car into a taxi without a license.\u201cIt was against every rule we had,\u201d said Rainer Matheisen, a member of the City Council at the time and now a member of the state legislature.In July, Uber contacted Mr. Matheisen and other D\u00fcsseldorf officials about trying again. The company vowed to follow all regulations by working with licensed drivers and taxi companies, and to make electric cars part of its fleet as a sign of good will for government efforts to fight air pollution.\u201cI was very skeptical because of what they did do in the past, but I was surprised by the new way of communicating with us,\u201d Mr. Matheisen said.By August, Uber was making final preparations to put cars back on the road. It opened an office in a co-working space in a downtown high-rise, where curious visitors can pop in to speak with staff about starting to drive. It plans to enter another German city, which it hasn\u2019t identified, by the end of the year and several more in 2019.Even after returning to D\u00fcsseldorf, Uber has faced an obstacle: taxi drivers. While the company has tried to work with taxi operators, dozens protested outside Uber\u2019s office last month, blasting their horns and snarling traffic.Dennis Klusmeier, head of the city\u2019s largest taxi dispatch company, Taxi D\u00fcsseldorf, said Uber drivers didn\u2019t comply with the law that requires private-hire drivers to return to a garage between rides. Holding a large law book that outlined German transportation rules, Mr. Klusmeier said he was exploring a legal challenge.\u201cUs Germans like a law book,\u201d he joked.Ufuk Demirel, an Uber driver in D\u00fcsseldorf who has completed more than 300 rides over the past month, said a taxi driver had recently swerved to cut him off. The D\u00fcsseldorf police said six incidents between taxi and Uber drivers had been reported, including one in which an Uber driver was forced to stop by taxi drivers, then verbally abused and harassed.Beyond tensions with taxi drivers, Uber has to deal with customer awareness. About 100 Uber cars are on the road in D\u00fcsseldorf, and waits for a ride can be long. Ask people in the city whether they have ever used the app and you still get mostly shrugs.\u201cIt\u2019s not so popular,\u201d said Dennis Zimney, who works at a downtown hotel. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know Uber.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s New in the Latest U.S. Climate Assessment", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Global warming is now affecting the United States more than ever, and the risks of future disasters \u2014 from flooding along the coasts to crop failures in the Midwest \u2014 could pose a profound threat to Americans\u2019 well-being.More and more of the predicted impacts of global warming are now becoming a reality.For instance, the 2014 assessment forecast that coastal cities would see more flooding in the coming years as sea levels rose. That\u2019s no longer theoretical: Scientists have now documented a record number of \u201cnuisance flooding\u201d events during high tides in cities like Miami and Charleston, S.C.\u201cHigh tide flooding is now posing daily risks to businesses, neighborhoods, infrastructure, transportation, and ecosystems in the Southeast,\u201d the report says.As the oceans have warmed, disruptions in United States fisheries, long predicted, are now underway. In 2012, record ocean temperatures caused lobster catches in Maine to peak a month earlier than usual, and the distribution chain was unprepared.The report suggests a different approach to assessing the effects of climate change, by considering how various impacts \u2014 on food supplies, water and electricity generation, for example \u2014 interact with each other.\u201cIt is not possible to fully understand the implications of climate change on the United States without considering the interactions among sectors and their consequences,\u201d the report says.It gives several examples, including recent droughts in California and elsewhere that, in combination with population changes, affect demand for water and energy. The report also cites Superstorm Sandy, six years ago, which caused cascading impacts on interconnected systems in the New York area, some of which had not been anticipated. Flooding of subway and highway tunnels, for example, made it more difficult to repair the electrical system, which suffered widespread damage.The report cites these international concerns, but goes far beyond the military. Climate change is already affecting American companies\u2019 overseas operations and supply chains, it says, and as these impacts worsen it will take a toll on trade and the economy.Global warming and natural disasters are also affecting development in less affluent countries. That, the report says, puts additional burdens on the United States for humanitarian assistance and disaster aid.Since 2014, more detailed economic research has estimated that climate change could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damage, as deadly heat waves, coastal flooding, and an increase in extreme weather take their toll. To limit that harm, communities will need to take steps to prepare beforehand.The previous assessment warned that few states and cities were taking steps to adapt to the impacts of climate change. That\u2019s slowly changing, the new report finds. More and more communities are taking measures such as preserving wetlands along the coasts to act as buffers against storms.But outside of a few places in Louisiana and Alaska, few coastal communities are rethinking their development patterns in order to avoid the impacts from rising seas and severe weather that the report says are surely coming.The report warns that the country is particularly unprepared for the upheavals that will come as rising sea levels swamp coastal cities: \u201cThe potential need for millions of people and billions of dollars of coastal infrastructure to be relocated in the future creates challenging legal, financial, and equity issues that have not yet been addressed.\u201dWhile much of the discussion of climate change looks at the role of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in warming the planet, the report puts a renewed emphasis on the impacts of other atmospheric pollutants like ozone and smoke, which can cause respiratory problems and lead to premature death.The report notes with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that climate change will increase ozone levels, as rising temperatures and changes in atmospheric circulation affect local weather conditions. But the increases will not be uniform. By near the end of the century, the worst ozone levels will be found across a wide expanse of the Midwest and Northern Great Plains, while levels are expected to improve, at least somewhat, in parts of the Southeast.The report reiterates what residents of the West have learned from hard experience: that warmer springs, longer dry seasons in the summer and other impacts are lengthening the fire season. The smoke from fires affects not only health, the report says, but visibility.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Real vs. Artificial Christmas Trees: Which Is the Greener Choice?", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the centerpiece of the biggest holiday of the year for many American families: the Christmas tree, the focal point for parties and presents, replete with favorite ornaments and lights.Some cherish the scent of a real tree and the tradition of bringing it home, while others prefer the tidier and easier option of the plastic variety.But which is better for the environment? Here\u2019s a look at some of the central claims \u2014 and the common misconceptions \u2014 in that debate.Don\u2019t feel bad about cutting down a tree for the holiday. Christmas trees are crops grown on farms, like lettuce or corn. They are not cut down from wild forests on a large scale, said Bert Cregg, an expert in Christmas tree production and forestry at Michigan State University.A five- or six-foot tree takes just under a decade to grow, and once it\u2019s cut down, the farmer will generally plant at least one in its place. The trees provide many benefits to the environment as they grow, cleaning the air and providing watersheds and habitats for wildlife. They grow best on rolling hills that are often unsuitable for other crops and, of course, they are biodegradable.In western North Carolina, the farms tend to be smaller, like the one owned by Larry Smith, who has been growing trees for more than 40 years.\u201cTell the kids and grandkids to keep buying real trees so we keep the local economy strong and we don\u2019t have to sell the land to the rich people from New York City to make condos,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Tim O\u2019Connor, a spokesman for the organization, said the best way to ensure future supply was to buy a tree this year.Most of the artificial trees on the market are made of PVC and steel in China and shipped to the United States \u2014 and eventually sent to a landfill.Mr. O\u2019Connor of the N.C.T.A., the organization that represents sellers of real trees, said he rejected the study\u2019s findings, saying it was \u201cfall-off-your-horse simple that a tree made out of oil, turned into PVC plastic in China and shipped over on a boat, cannot be better than growing a real tree.\u201dMr. Cregg, the forestry expert at Michigan State, said the study\u2019s parameters were too narrow. What about the effect on wildlife and local water supplies, he asked, and the benefit of preserving farmland and jobs?\u201cAre you interested in supporting the local economy and keeping plastic out of landfills?\u201d he said. \u201cThose would be the questions I would focus on.\u201dIn the meantime, he encouraged people to reuse trees and to adorn them with LED lights, which save energy.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on making our trees reusable as long as possible,\u201d Mr. Harman said. \u201cI hope that our trees are in use 20 or 30 years later.\u201dThe preference for real trees is strongest in the Northeast and along the West Coast, data from the A.C.T.A. shows. Mr. O\u2019Connor said that younger, more environmentally conscious consumers \u2014 the same ones who buy organic produce at the grocery store \u2014 are increasingly embracing real trees. And some families enjoy visiting farms to choose and cut their own trees.\u201cThere\u2019s this wonderful family experience that\u2019s just not parallel to dragging a dusty box out of the attic,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor said.Bill Ulfelder, the executive director of the Nature Conservancy in New York, said real trees were \u201cunquestionably\u201d the better option. He added that there are ways shoppers can lessen the impact of using a real tree: Shop locally, minimize driving and recycle the tree.Brad McAllister, a managing director of WAP Sustainability Consulting, said he was surprised by how small the impact of either tree choice was compared with other central elements of the holidays, like air travel and shopping.\u201cIf a consumer wants to celebrate the holidays in a truly environmental fashion, they need to look beyond just the Christmas tree,\u201d he said.\u201cWe really do believe that there is no such thing as a bad Christmas tree,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Perversion of Fiscal Policy (Slightly Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAusterity in a slump, stimulus in a boom.Opinion ColumnistAs many people have pointed out, the Trump tax represented a total break with the normal principles of fiscal policy. Historically, we\u2019ve tended to run big deficits when the economy is weak, smaller deficits or surpluses when it\u2019s strong. But now the deficit is soaring even in the face of low unemployment. This is irresponsible, and shows that Republican handwringing over deficits was always phony \u2013 which some of us pointed out at the time.But something that has been pointed out less is that this is actually part of a broader story: fiscal policy has been off the rails since 2010, not because of what it has done to the national debt, but because of what it has done to the macroeconomy.Here\u2019s what fiscal policy should do: it should support demand when the economy is weak, and it should pull that support back when the economy is strong. As John Maynard Keynes said, \u201cThe boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity.\u201d And up until 2010 the U.S. more or less followed that prescription. Since then, however, fiscal policy has become perverse: first austerity despite high unemployment, now expansion despite low unemployment.What you can see in the chart is that during the first period (the blue line) high unemployment was met with fiscal expansion. This happened during the 2001 recession and aftermath, and again when the Great Recession struck. From this point of view the Obama stimulus was normal policy, applied in an exceptional situation.But then fiscal policy went off track, which you can see by the big red clockwise loop. The wrong turn actually, by this measure, began even before Republicans took the House of Representatives \u2013 mainly, I think, reflecting cutbacks at the state and local level. But it got much worse after the G.O.P. gained blockade power, forcing significant austerity even as unemployment remained extremely high.Meanwhile, the Fed couldn\u2019t cut interest rates any further, because they were already zero, and count me in the camp that\u2019s skeptical about the effectiveness of quantitative easing (which Republicans also fiercely opposed.) So this turn to fiscal austerity surely slowed growth and delayed the economy\u2019s recovery.And now, with unemployment very low but a Republican in the White House, we\u2019re getting the fiscal stimulus we desperately needed then \u2013 and don\u2019t need now. Fiscal policy, like so much of governance in America, has been perverted by right-wing partisanship.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All Brexit Deals Worse for Economy Than Staying, U.K. Government Says", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBritain\u2019s government on Wednesday abandoned any pretense that leaving the European Union would lift the economy, instead presenting its own plan to leave as the least destructive option.The government\u2019s switch in its argument followed publication of a bleak official economic analysis of life outside the European Union, which showed that under terms similar to those in Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plan for the withdrawal, known as Brexit, Britain\u2019s economy would be 3.9 percent smaller than it would have been if the country had stayed in.In the government\u2019s worst-case scenario of leaving the bloc with no deal, Britain\u2019s economy would lose 9.3 percent of the gross domestic product it could otherwise have expected.And that seemed relatively tame compared with a report from the Bank of England also released on Wednesday. In the event of Britain crashing out of the European Union without a deal, the bank\u2019s analysts said, the economy would shrink by 8 percent in a year, house prices would sink 30 percent and the pound would drop to $1.10 from the current $1.27.Within the British Parliament, there is significant opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s plan and the very real prospect that it could be rejected in a vote on Dec. 11, throwing the country\u2019s already addled political class into chaos.The government\u2019s document dispelled some of the wishful thinking expounded by Brexit supporters, debunking claims that withdrawal would lift the economy by permitting Britain to strike a new set of trade deals with fast-growing economies around the world.Under all scenarios the British economy would grow, the report said, but it would be smaller around 2035 than if Britain remained a European Union member country.Mrs. May\u2019s supporters now argue that an inevitable economic hit from Brexit would be limited under her scheme, and would be offset by the political advantage of regaining the right to restrict migration from the European Union and leaving its agricultural and fisheries policies.The government\u2019s analysis was met with derision by pro-Brexit lawmakers, who quickly reminded voters that Brexit opponents had issued similar prophecies of economic doom before the referendum, only to be proved wrong.\u201cThe reputation of government economics is in the gutter,\u201d said Steve Baker, a lawmaker and hard-line Brexit supporter. His colleague Priti Patel, a pro-Brexit former cabinet minister, added, \u201cWe\u2019ve all had about enough of Project Fear.\u201dThe report was attacked from the left as well, with the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, dismissing it as \u201cmeaningless.\u201dThose angling for a second referendum were encouraged on Wednesday when John McDonnell, the senior opposition lawmaker who is Labour\u2019s spokesman on economic policy, said that if Parliament rejected Mrs. May\u2019s deal and there was not then a general election, another plebiscite seemed inevitable.Despite widespread predictions that Mrs. May will fail to get her plan through Parliament, she has until the parliamentary vote on Dec. 11 to sell it to the public and is embarking on a barnstorming tour to do just that.Mrs. May is not known for her skills in retail politics. But she may be helped by predictions about the impact of a no-deal exit \u2014 something that she says is likely if lawmakers reject her deal.One striking feature of the report was its conclusion that the benefit of trade deals elsewhere in the world \u2014 seen by some Brexit supporters as a central justification for withdrawal \u2014 would be negligible. The document assumed that by 2035 Britain would benefit from successfully negotiated trade deals with the United States, Australia, New Zealand and a range of other countries including China, India, Malaysia, Brunei, Kuwait and Bahrain. Yet in total they yield only gains worth around 0.2 percent of gross domestic product.In Parliament on Wednesday, Mrs. May insisted that the analysis did not show that Britons would be poorer because of her Brexit plan. That is technically accurate, since the economy would continue to grow, but significantly less than it would if Britain remained a member of the European Union.But the analysis detailed how any form of Brexit would leave Britain worse off than it could and would have been otherwise, a fact acknowledged by Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the b\u00eate noire of the pro-Brexit faction.While acknowledging that remaining in the bloc was not politically acceptable, Mr. Hammond told the BBC that, in a \u201cpurely economic sense\u201d Britain would be worse off under any scenario, compared with staying in the European Union.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Rallies and a Race for Votes: Scenes From the Final Stage of the Campaigns", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York Times journalists are reporting from around the country this weekend as candidates make their final pitches to the voters who will help shape the United States for the next two years.President Trump may be crisscrossing the country in an intensive effort to keep Republicans in control of Congress, but he would like everyone to know that if that does not happen, it is not his fault.At rallies and in public remarks, Mr. Trump is engaging in a subtle effort meant to absolve him of blame if Republicans lose the House, which his advisers are privately telling him is likely to happen.On Sunday, as he left the White House for rallies in Macon, Ga., and Chattanooga, Tenn., Mr. Trump told reporters he cannot campaign for all Republican House members because there are too many, but boasted that his involvement has made a \u201cbig difference\u201d in as many as seven Senate campaigns.Mr. Trump predicted Republicans would do well in the House and \u201creally well\u201d in the Senate. He was similarly vague last week about his party\u2019s prospects of keeping the House, reminding reporters what a heavy lift campaigning for House candidates could be.He argued that his raucous campaign events were the most effective way to boost Republicans, comparing the level of enthusiasm to that of his crowds in 2016. \u201cThese rallies are the best thing we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said, a clear implication that if Republicans lose, it is not because he failed to make the effort to turn out his supporters.As for the rallies themselves, the president has been all over the map in his targets (which do include, usually, a few minutes talking up the actual candidates).Take the rally in Macon on Sunday afternoon, ostensibly held to support the Republican nominee for governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp. For one stretch, Mr. Trump veered into questioning why his own supporters, law enforcement officials and immigration officers were not doing more to curtail antifa protesters on the left.Mr. Trump first mocked members of antifa as having \u201clittle arms\u201d as he tried to entertain the crowd. He said they reach for weapons like clubs because of that.\u201cWhere are the Bikers for Trump? Where are the police? Where are the military? Where are ICE? Where are the Border Patrol?\u201dHe added, \u201cThese are bad people\u201d and said they were causing problems.Mr. Trump has been increasing his incendiary language, even as his White House aides insist he has never done anything to provoke violence by his supporters.The remarks came just over a week after pipe bombs were mailed to several of Mr. Trump\u2019s political targets. The man charged with sending the explosives has been described as a devoted Trump supporter who attended his rallies. Mr. Trump has said he does not have any responsibility for the man\u2019s actions, and he has declined to change his rhetoric.\u2014 By Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Maggie HabermanMIAMI \u2014 By the time Andrew Gillum arrived to the march bringing African-American voters to cast ballots early on Sunday, the Rev. Al Sharpton had already made his entrance. So had a parade of Miami elected officials and the local congresswoman, all jostling to be next to Mr. Gillum, or at least near him, at the front of the crowd.Such was the excitement for Mr. Gillum, a Democrat, on the last day of early voting in Liberty City, the predominantly African-American neighborhood where the Academy Award-winning film \u201cMoonlight\u201d was made. So many cameras and onlookers hovered in front of the gathering that marchers had trouble advancing down the street.The leaders of the \u201csouls to the polls\u201d march linked arms. A pastor offered a prayer \u2014 for voters, so that they would make their selections with \u201cconviction,\u201d and for Mr. Gillum, so that he would be blessed: \u201cWatch him.\u201dOff they went to the Joseph Caleb Center. Past a house where a little boy bounced up to watch the procession. Past a corner market where people walked out and cheered.\u201cWe went and voted the first day. We wasn\u2019t playing,\u201d said Perditha Bethel, 63. \u201cWe made everybody go.\u201dMr. Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee who could become Florida\u2019s first African-American governor, will need robust black turnout if he is to defeat his Republican opponent, the former Representative Ron DeSantis, who is white.Asked about the remark on Sunday, Mr. Gillum said, with a hint of sarcasm, that he was \u201cflattered\u201d the DeSantis camp \u201chad me top of mind.\u201d\u201cHe should go back to Georgia,\u201d Mr. Gillum said of Mr. Perdue, the former Georgia governor. \u201cWe\u2019re trying our very best to end this campaign on a high note.\u201dHe then took the stage and cast a vote for him as an explicit vote against President Trump.\u201cHe won\u2019t be able to tweet his way out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to insult his way out of it.\u201d\u2014 Patricia MazzeiCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 Eva Pfefferkorn sheepishly knocked on her first door.

His friendly response eased her nerves.Eva, who was going door to door with her mother on Saturday, is one of thousands of volunteers newly engaged in the political process this cycle. Their grass-roots movement was spurred on by the onslaught of liberal activism that occurred in the wake of President Trump\u2019s election, including high-profile mobilization efforts like the Women\u2019s March in 2017 and this year\u2019s March for Our Lives.Democrats are targeting three Republican-held House seats in Virginia, and dozens of volunteers from the group Swing Left descended on this city this weekend to supplement the campaigns\u2019 last stretch.In the Fifth Congressional District, where Ms. Cockburn is running against Denver Riggleman, a Republican, there were also people like Eva, who said she wanted to get involved partly because of the violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville last year.\u201cA lot of the students in my high school became activists,\u201d she said.\u2014 Astead W.

But for the final two days of the midterm elections, the Democrat returned home to stump for his fellow New Jersey senator, Robert Menendez, in a state that has not been considered a Senate battleground since Richard Nixon was president.\u201cEverywhere I go in the last days of this election, I\u2019m preaching the gospel of Bob,\u201d Mr. Booker said at a packed breakfast in Union County.For a race defined mostly by its nastiness \u2014 Mr. Menendez\u2019s Republican opponent, Bob Hugin, has spent millions on negative ads, and Mr. Menendez, with help from the national party, has responded in kind \u2014 the focus for the two senators was less about the opponent on the ballot than the man in the White House.\u201cWe have two days to stop Trump,\u201d Mr. Menendez bellowed to hundreds of supporters gathered along the waterfront Sinatra Park in Hoboken, adding, \u201cWe have no checks and balances on this administration and its worst proclivities.\u201dMr. Booker said, \u201cWe cannot allow this state to send someone to Washington who is going to fall into lockstep with a president who is attacking our state.\u201dThe senators were focused on getting out the vote in the Democratic strongholds in New Jersey \u2014 Hudson, Bergen, Essex, Union and Passaic Counties, all clustered in the northeast \u2014 where Mr. Menendez faces a challenge. The districts are so solidly Democratic, without any real challenge for the House seats, that turnout typically dips in midterms, and Mr. Menendez needs every vote from the area.So the local Democratic machines have turned into a full-on arm of the Menendez effort.Representative Donald Payne Jr. joked at the Union County breakfast, \u201cI\u2019ve been working so hard for Senator Menendez that I forget that I am on the ballot, too.\u201d\u2014 Nick Corasaniti\u201cWe have some role models out there, but we need to get them elected,\u201d said Misa Roach, a volunteer working with Senator Tammy Baldwin\u2019s re-election campaign in Wisconsin.SHEBOYGAN, Wis. \u2014 Two Republicans, at least, are closing the campaign with a focused message about the economy.In a rain-spattered Republican Party office, in a conservative-leaning county that hugs Lake Michigan, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Gov. Scott Walker made no mention of caravans or fake news or foreign invasions.Instead, they implored voters to validate the conservative economic policies that have prevailed here for most of a decade, and in Washington more recently.\u201cTwo hundred and fifty thousand jobs were created in America in October alone,\u201d Mr. Ryan proclaimed. \u201cThis is working!\u201dMr. Walker is in a close race for a third term against Tony Evers, a low-key Democrat who is Wisconsin\u2019s superintendent of education. A figure as tenacious as he is polarizing, Mr. Walker\u2019s greatest challenge may be persuading the state\u2019s few undecided voters to swing his way.Mr. Walker called his challenger a threat to Wisconsin\u2019s economic rebound, insisting, \u201cWe cannot afford to turn back now.\u201d\u2014 Alexander BurnsWhen she arrived at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections here on Sunday morning, she was told the polls would not open until 1 p.m. So here she was again, standing at the back of the line just as the doors opened.\u201cThis is more important right now than the presidential,\u201d said Ms. Gibson, 50.The line inched forward.When Democrats have done well in this bellwether state it is traditionally with a big turnout among nonwhite voters \u2014 like Ms. Gibson, who is black \u2014 in and around big cities like Cleveland. But while President Barack Obama was uniquely successful in energizing black voters, Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss here two years ago forced the party to examine whether it was doing enough to reach what had been such a crucial part of its coalition.Ahead of the midterm elections, Democrats have tried to do more. They have created an engagement program aimed at motivating minority voters. In September, Mr. Obama campaigned with Richard Cordray, the Democratic candidate for governor. On Sunday, the line of hundreds of mostly black voters wound its way around the block.Nonwhite voters \u201care responding to everything that\u2019s coming out of the White House,\u201d Kim Thomas, a minority engagement consultant for the state Democratic Party, said on Sunday afternoon, observing the line from across the street. \u201cWhat\u2019s different now is we have decided to band together and make ourselves heard through our vote.\u201dAmong those waiting in line was Agnes Igodan, 33. She said she felt the country was more divided than ever and cited the incendiary rhetoric emanating from Washington. She planned to vote for Democrats even if she did not agree with some of the party\u2019s positions.\u201cIt\u2019s a scary time in America,\u201d said Ms. Igodan, who is originally from Nigeria and is studying to be an immigration lawyer. \u201cThere\u2019s more and more hate \u2014 it\u2019s kind of scary.\u201d\u2014 Sydney EmberLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Rev. Al Washington stepped behind the pulpit at First A.M.E. Church in South Los Angeles on Sunday morning and urged everyone to vote, as a \u201ccheck on the madness\u201d of this moment in American life.Spirituality and politics have long intermingled in the black churches of Los Angeles, and in the final push before Election Day two pillars of California\u2019s Democratic opposition to President Trump were on hand for Sunday services: Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor, and Senator Kamala Harris.Ms. Harris, addressing worshipers, invoked the deep divisions in American society and said that one day, when God asks, \u201c\u2018What did you do?\u2019 What we\u2019re going to be able to say is we voted.\u201dMr. Newsom, who is well ahead in the polls against the Republican businessman John Cox, has become a popular figure in the black faith community since visiting earlier in the campaign, said Darren Dickerson, a church member.\u201cI was really close to Antonio Villaraigosa,\u201d said Mr. Dickerson, referring to the former Los Angeles mayor who ran for governor but failed to advance beyond the June primary. \u201cThen Gavin came here, to this church, and he got me.\u201dHe continued, \u201cThe dude is really charismatic, and he really seems to believe in what he is saying. I looked at him and I thought, \u2018This guy could be president.\u2019\u201d\u2014 Tim ArangoFERGUSON, Mo. \u2014 Sunday afternoon in a suburban Walmart parking lot in the misting rain. After the high-dollar fund-raisers, the celebrity endorsements, the debates \u2014 this is what the end of one of the tightest Senate campaigns in the country really looks like.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Claire,\u201d said Claire McCaskill, the embattled Democratic senator, with a hand outstretched to Sunday shoppers. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to vote on Tuesday. He\u2019s after me, can you tell?\u201dNever mind who he is \u2014 either her Republican opponent, Josh Hawley, or President Trump will do \u2014 there are more hands to shake. Four dozen or so in 15 minutes. Add a couple of dozen selfies, some hugs and call it a Get Out the Vote event.Most potential voters at this stop are black, and in this St. Louis County suburb put on the map four years ago by a lethal police shooting and the violent protests that followed, Ms. McCaskill need not recite her usual talking points. She just needs them to vote, to counter the rising Republican tide that has made Ms. McCaskill the last Democrat in a major statewide office here.\u201cI\u2019m so voting for you,\u201d sang one woman, jangling her keys in the air melodically. \u201cI\u2019m so voting, yes I am.\u201d Another, a younger black woman, came up to the senator in tears: \u201cI\u2019m a voter because of you,\u201d she said, folding into Ms. McCaskill\u2019s jacket for a long hug.Ms. McCaskill is pushing against steep odds, but she liked the way things are coming together.\u201cI think who I really am might be the right thing for this moment,\u201d said Ms. McCaskill, who has run as an endangered moderate. \u201cI\u2019m hoping so anyway.\u201d\u2014 Nicholas FandosSOUTH DAYTONA, Fla. \u2014 It did not take long for people to start shouting places at Rudy Giuliani.\u201cI\u2019m from Queens!\u201d\u201cWestchester!\u201d\u201cFahhh Rockaway!\u201d\u201cTel Aviv!\u201dThat one made him perk up a little, inside a local Republican headquarters overstuffed with National Rifle Association hats and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d casual wear.\u201cTel Aviv,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, noting his own city\u2019s Jewish population. \u201cThat\u2019s part of New York.\u201dMr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and current presidential lawyer, had come to campaign with Ron DeSantis, the Republican nominee for governor here. He had also come to brag a little, in a place with plenty of New York expats and other admirers.His city, he observed, saw tumbling crime rates on his watch. His mayoralty had made him the kind of figure Republicans called upon as a surrogate in faraway states.What, then, of Mr. DeSantis\u2019s Democratic opponent, Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee?Mr. Giuliani made a face that mayors are supposed to make, presumably, when they care.Mr. Gillum has framed the violence as a function, largely, of N.R.A. influence in the state.Mr. DeSantis would have none of that. Taking the microphone from Mr. Giuliani, he suggested that Mr. Gillum \u2014 who has chafed at his opponent\u2019s tendency to call him \u201cAndrew\u201d in debates \u2014 had not earned a fuller title.\u201cIn the military you\u2019re entitled to be called by the rank only if you served honorably in that position,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said. \u201cAnd the fact of the matter is, he has not served honorably as the mayor.\u201d\u2014 Matt FlegenheimerTim Arango reported from Los Angeles.

{"Headline": "Climate Change Insurance: Buy Land Somewhere Else", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn case global warming makes their homes uninhabitable, some millennials have a Plan B: investing in places like the Catskills, Oregon and Vermont.Mr. Dalski, 33, lives in Greenwich, Conn., but he can envision a time when his home there might be besieged by extreme weather and rising sea levels. So he bought four acres of land in the Catskill Mountains, in Roxbury, N.Y., where he is building a home that is as sustainable and self-sufficient as possible.To date, he has drilled a well, set up poles for power lines and designed a septic system that has been approved by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. (The property is in the city\u2019s watershed.)He is working on designing and then securing building permits for the house. He wants it to be no more than 1,200 square feet \u2014 \u201cit should be simple, small and sustainable,\u201d he said \u2014 and to have an open floor plan and a lofted master bedroom. The windows will look out over land where he can grow corn, collard greens and root vegetables.\u201cWill I need it 10 years from now, or 30 years?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d But if his part of Greenwich is ever in jeopardy, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll have a safe space.\u201dThis fall, the United Nations stunned the world when it released a report saying that if no action was taken, the catastrophic effects of climate change could be felt as early as 2040. It painted a bleak picture of a world plagued by fires, food shortages, extreme heat, droughts, floods and disease. Entire populations might have to migrate away from coastal or Southern cities. There would be a strain on resources and damage to the economy. Some believe that prices on Northern land will surge. There is one group, however, that is slightly less anxious than the rest of us about this news: a small number of young professionals who are preparing homes away from the places where climate change is expected to strike the hardest. They are following in the footsteps of billionaires like Peter Thiel, who is investing in real estate in New Zealand in case a climate apocalypse occurs. Although they are doing it on a far more affordable scale.Not quite survivalists, they are nonetheless teaching themselves essential life skills \u2014 like how to grow their own food and make their own electricity \u2014 just in case things spin out of control, and the government can\u2019t step in to help. They believe they are making sound real estate decisions by buying land on high ground that will appreciate in value, while at the same time developing a Plan B.\u201cWe are blatantly facing a catastrophe, and all we\u2019re doing is getting rid of straws,\u201d Mr. Dalski said. \u201cThere are things I\u2019m going to do for preservation.\u201d That includes buying land on a wooded, undeveloped part of Plattekill, a 3,500-foot mountain in the Catskills, because the area is filled with natural resources. The land is at a high elevation but it is also in a bowl, so it collects precipitation. Also, there are creeks that run through the area year-round, and he has family nearby.Michael Phelan, 26, a Ph.D. student in bioengineering in Philadelphia, is deeply concerned about life in a post-climate change world as well. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing people talk about moving north to places like Michigan or Maine,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing how recent government reports have detailed the threats of mass migration or economic loss, I wonder if it\u2019s even possible to move away from it.\u201dMr. Phelan has entertained the idea of going someplace less vulnerable to the effects of climate change. He is also more focused on preparing for the natural disasters that are projected to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a survivalist at this point, but I\u2019m trying to learn more about preparedness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives me a degree of confidence to know what to do in situations like that. At least in the very short term, if an emergency occurred, I would have enough of a plan to not panic.\u201dOthers his age have parents and grandparents who are buying shelters they can use if and when climate-related disasters occur.Dave Anderson lives in Houston, not far from his 27-year-old daughter, Casey Delperdang, her husband and their toddler. They all love being there; they are close to family and friends and get together often. But five years ago, Mr. Anderson decided that his family needed another place to congregate: a ranch in Oregon.He bought a 70-acre property with plenty of space for hiking and relaxing in nature. There are rivers where the family can fish for salmon and steelhead trout, and forests where they can hunt for elk. One of his new neighbors assured him that they would never go hungry in this part of the world. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll always like what you eat,\u201d the neighbor told Mr. Anderson, \u201cbut you\u2019ll eat.\u201dMr. Anderson said he was looking for more than a vacation home; he wanted his family to have a place to escape to if living conditions in Houston became unbearable. \u201cI\u2019m no doomsday prepper,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, we intentionally purchased a relatively remote property well above sea level, with ample water and wildlife, with the expectation that the property would survive for generations of family use.\u201dWhile Mrs. Delperdang said she would be hesitant to move there, she acknowledged that her Plan B home could become a primary residence in a worst-case scenario. \u201cDuring Hurricane Harvey, homes flooded that never had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of those people had looked at flood maps and thought they were in protected areas.\u201dIn the past year, Mr. Shandas, of the Sustaining Urban Places Research Lab, said he has seen an increase in parents worried about the next generation\u2019s safety. \u201cA few venture capital and investment bankers have taken me out to lunch or coffee to ask for a secret location, a place where their 18-year-old nephew or son or daughter should move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they want to find a secret fishing spot. I always have to say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a magic ball, I can only tell you the conditions we are likely to see in the future in each place.\u2019\u201dBut hedging against climate change with an isolated home or piece of land isn\u2019t a fail-safe strategy.Mastering surgery would certainly be a lot harder than learning to grow tomatoes. A better strategy, Mr. Riordan suggested, would be to find a community that is intelligently preparing for whatever climate change may bring. He equated the situation to what California has done about earthquakes: They can\u2019t be avoided, but we can build safer buildings, get better at predicting them and establish systems to care for vulnerable populations when they occur.Ms. Ferorelli is well aware that her city is at high risk for wildfires and heat waves. \u201cWe are not taking good care of Lake Michigan; it\u2019s possible we could have a Flint-type scenario,\u201d she said, referring to the water-quality issues in Flint, Mich. But she trusts her community, from the nonprofits to her neighbors, to handle whatever comes. \u201cThese are the people I want to depend on during hard times,\u201d she said.As Mr. Shandas said, \u201cThe most resilient have been those that have had communities of people working together to try to respond. Pulling away and isolating yourself is one of the most dangerous things you can do.\u201dThere is also the likelihood that no matter where you set up your Plan B home, it won\u2019t be immune to climate change.Montana, for example, with its ample land, cooler climate and natural bodies of water, is considered an appealing place to move in the future. But Bill Milner, the former owner of a real estate agency in Whitefish, Mont., said his state is under siege as well.\u201cOur glaciers are melting, our summers are hotter and longer, winters less severe, forest fires have become annual events,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change lives here, too.\u201dThen there is the reality that many younger people can\u2019t afford to buy any home \u2014 let alone one in a place with a better climate. But some of those who can afford to buy land \u2014 or have planned carefully to be able to do so eventually \u2014 are confident that they aren\u2019t just making an investment in their safety, they\u2019re also making a good financial move.If \u201cI can pick up a few acres, it is going to triple in value,\u201d Mr. Dalski said. \u201cIn 100 years\u2019 time, it will be worth something. People are going to have to move north at some point.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Jaipur, a Clothing Designer\u2019s Vibrant and Wonderfully Imperfect Home", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy DesignNothing quite matches but everything fits in Caroline Weller\u2019s airy family abode in India \u2014 including a giant unfinished mural.Rather than slink back to New York, though, the family headed to Jaipur, to which Weller still felt a strong connection from 15 years before. They didn\u2019t have a plan \u2014 \u201conly a plan for adventure,\u201d she says \u2014 but she quickly found work consulting for former colleagues in New York on projects involving Rajasthani crafts, as well as an airy 2,500-square-foot house located next to a nature preserve. (Weller goes for runs there, alongside the yogic breathers, the sari-and-sneaker power-walking women and the occasional leopard who also populate the park.)Here (much as in nature), nothing exactly matches, but everything fits: a Kashmiri silk bedspread embroidered with butterflies, a dresser inlaid with camel bone, lamps jerry-built from vases, chairs found decades ago at the Chelsea flea market in New York, their cracked Lucite seats replaced with weather-hardy rattan. Traditional chicks, blinds of woven bamboo, help battle the heat.The kitchen, once a near-empty shell, is now briskly functional, equipped with a stove top fueled by a gas canister and a reverse-osmosis filter through which drinking water is piped into an enormous clay pot called a matka. From every air conditioning unit, tubes run down to little pitchers \u2014 the runoff is used for watering plants and mopping floors. Weller strives for similar sustainability with Banjanan, transforming scraps and surplus into limited-edition pajamas and patchwork quilts.Allowance for error and imperfection is woven into the spirit of her line. Through Banjanan \u2014 the name is a tribute to Rajasthan\u2019s nomadic Banjara tribes \u2014 Weller has discovered that no two block-printed textiles can be the same. Every design is set using multiple blocks, with one color and outline per block, each carved out of teak and cured in mustard oil for two weeks, then dipped into a tray of dye and pressed to the cloth, with a swift knock on top to make sure the image takes hold. The fabric is pinned to 16-foot tables that the printers slowly work their way down, tapping block after block. Sometimes the patterns don\u2019t align or the dyes fail to dry and bloom beyond their borders (no printing is done during the monsoon for that reason). It\u2019s the tiny flaws, and the sense of a human hand, that give them depth.Jeanneret was Le Corbusier\u2019s man on the ground: He lived in India for years and came to understand the environment and people\u2019s daily lives. Weller respects his commitment to place. She\u2019s slightly uneasy when Western fashion executives, wanting to use Rajasthani crafts, swoop in for a few nights, all the while talking about \u201csaving\u201d and \u201cempowering\u201d local artisans, as if their companies weren\u2019t also benefiting from the exchange. Weller feels a bond to the patternmakers, color specialists, tailors, embroiderers and block printers she collaborates with, almost all of whom live within a few miles of the Banjanan studio. But she recognizes that, at the end of the day, there\u2019s a transaction. \u201cThey do good work, and I pay them for it,\u201d she said.Like her relationship to her adopted home, her relationship to color, pattern and narrative is ever-evolving; over the years, the house has gone through several coats of paint, or \u201cstates of mind,\u201d as Weller puts it. Engineering the living-room mural last November proved a somewhat unpredictable affair: The miniaturist whom she hired was initially flummoxed to be working on a grand scale. (\u201cHe was very good with eyes,\u201d she says.) He finished in February, then returned in April to work on the smaller adjacent dining room, where he detailed a pink wall of irises and lilies inspired by the City Palace in Udaipur.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Workers Reject Silicon Valley Individualism in Walkout", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is part of a growing movement,\u201d the organizers wrote in a news release, \u201cnot just in tech, but across the country, including teachers, fast-food workers and others who are using their strength in numbers to make real change.\u201dAt the beginning of their protest near the company\u2019s San Francisco offices, the organizers even expressed support for Marriott workers on strike in the city.For decades, Silicon Valley has been ground zero for a vaguely utopian form of individualism \u2014 the idea that a single engineer with a laptop and an internet connection could change the world, or at least a long-established industry. Class consciousness was pass\u00e9. Unions were the enemy of innovation, an anchor to the status quo.\u201cThe myth of Silicon Valley is that all the power you need is embodied in you as an individual \u2014 if you want more money, go somewhere else,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWhat they were saying here was that all the economic power they had as individuals wasn\u2019t enough.\u201dAnd the consequences of that dawning realization, Mr. Shaiken and other labor experts said, could reverberate across the entire tech sector.Google, for example, points to countless ways for workers to communicate with senior executives: Employees can raise a concern with the chief executive at a T.G.I.F. meeting that happens a few times each month. They can ask questions on an internal company platform before meetings, and management will respond to the ones that receive the most \u201cup-votes.\u201d Workers can even circulate petitions, and those that prove especially popular can earn their authors a sit-down with management.Underlying the back-and-forth is the belief that truth bubbles up from an unregulated exchange of ideas. But some employees complain that it rarely leads to lasting change.\u201cAs far as mechanisms for expressing feelings, there are plenty of them,\u201d said Meredith Whittaker, a 12-year Google veteran who oversees a research group at the company and helped organize the walkout. \u201cBut as far as opportunities for agency and power \u2014 for real power over decision-making \u2014 some of what you\u2019re seeing is a recognition that the former doesn\u2019t equal the latter.\u201dThough unusual, there is precedent for well-paid, in-demand workers who stand up to their employers.Two generations earlier, another group of affluent workers successfully faced down their employer: Major League Baseball players.\u201cFrom time immemorial, the baseball powers-that-be force-fed the players propaganda,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote in his autobiography, citing the claims that \u201cthe commissioner (although appointed and paid by the owners) represented the players\u201d and that \u201cplayers were privileged to be paid to play a kid\u2019s game.\u201dBut, according to Daniel A. Gilbert, an expert on the baseball union at the University of Illinois, the owners\u2019 demeaning posture helped galvanize members \u2014 including a famously counterproductive 1969 meeting in which the St. Louis Cardinals owner aired concerns that \u201cplayers are getting fat\u201d and that they \u201conly think of money.\u201d The players, many of whom were well compensated by this point, would within a few years overturn league rules that had prohibited them from accepting offers from rival teams.As in baseball, where African-American players were among the first to reject the owners\u2019 self-serving narrative, those on the margins of the tech world\u2019s largely white male establishment were quick to see the flaws in its meritocratic ethos, Ms. Whittaker said. They understood that just because anyone could offer an opinion didn\u2019t mean anyone\u2019s opinion would be taken seriously.The question is how far this sense of individual powerlessness has spread within Google. The walkout organizers argue that the feeling is quite widespread \u2014 extending from software developers to hardware engineers and from employees to contractors.Some observers agree. Michelle Miller, co-founder of CoWorker.org, which educates workers in tech and other industries on how to assert their labor rights, said that employees at Google \u201chad to start thinking of themselves as some kind of collective\u201d last year after a memo by an employee asserted that women tend to be innately less capable of certain technical work.Since Mr. Damore\u2019s ouster, Google workers have steadily received evidence that management will heed only collective action, Ms. Miller argued. That includes an ad hoc worker revolt that preceded the end of the company\u2019s controversial Pentagon contract.Google may have been uniquely vulnerable to a worker uprising given its ostensibly progressive values, including the company\u2019s longtime exhortation, \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d and the openness of its corporate systems. Organizers note that they executed the entire walkout using Google\u2019s internal platforms and other company resources.They say they\u2019re confident that the protests will only escalate if the chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and his team don\u2019t put forth a plan to act on some of their demands, among them a worker representative on the board of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and an end to employment contracts that prevent class-action lawsuits and require individual arbitration for discrimination and harassment cases.\u201cEmployees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,\u201d Mr. Pichai said in a statement. \u201cWe are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\u201dLabor experts said any changes precipitated by the walkout could spread through Silicon Valley.\u201cThese companies are competing for employees,\u201d said Matthew Bodie, a law professor at St. Louis University who is a former lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board.\u201cIf employees at Facebook are looking at this and saying, \u2018Wow, that was impressive,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bodie said, then Facebook may have to follow suit.Still, Bob Kocher, a partner at Venrock, a venture capital firm, expressed skepticism that Google would have to meet any of the organizers\u2019 demands. He pointed out that most employees appeared to enjoy working there and were satisfied with the way they were treated and compensated.\u201cIf I worked at Google, I\u2019d be upset and think, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they paid $90 million to a person who allegedly violated his employment agreement,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cThen I\u2019d go back inside and be glad I work at Google and keep working, and I would think my management would respond to that message and never do that again.\u201dBut Mr. Kocher added that Google did not have a limitless ability to straight-arm angry workers and postpone substantive changes. If there are more walkouts, \u201cproductivity is impacted, recruiting gets harder,\u201d he said.Follow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Stake When Xi and Trump Meet: The Possibility of a New Cold War", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 When President Trump sits down with President Xi Jinping for dinner here on Saturday, their meeting will be about more than salvaging a cordial personal relationship or trying to contain a trade dispute between the United States and China.Remarkably, given the stakes involved, the two sides plan no other formal meetings during this gathering of the Group of 20 industrialized nations that begins on Friday. Nor do they appear to have much of an agenda, beyond the trade grievances that Mr. Trump has complained about for months.That is a testament to how much trade and the personal chemistry between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi have come to dominate the relations between the United States and China. While these are only subplots in a larger drama that also includes a military contest in the Pacific and nuclear negotiations with North Korea, they could also define the next chapter in that relationship.In particular, the Saturday dinner \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s first face-to-face encounter with Mr. Xi in more than a year \u2014 will be the biggest test yet of whether the president\u2019s assiduous cultivation of the Chinese leader can survive his escalating tariffs against Chinese exports.Administration officials said they had briefed Mr. Trump on the full range of issues between the United States and China. Some inside the White House compare his relationship with Mr. Xi to a shock absorber. Even if the matters on the table are unpleasant, Mr. Trump is likely to avoid a bruising exchange with the Chinese president.\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be very respectful of each other,\u201d Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, told reporters on Tuesday. He expressed confidence in Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiating skills, noting that \u201cboth sides will arm their leaders with talking points.\u201d\u201cHow they play it,\u201d he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dLeaving for Buenos Aires on Thursday, Mr. Trump managed to sound hopeful and wary at the same time. \u201cI think we\u2019re very close to doing something with China,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know that I want to do it.\u201dMr. Xi has also voiced confidence about the meeting. But if Mr. Trump embarrasses him by pushing too hard \u2014 even after repeatedly calling him a good friend \u2014 such treatment could sour the Communist leader\u2019s view of the United States for years to come. Mr. Xi has already been criticized at home for what some see as his misjudgment of Mr. Trump.\u201cXi understands the meeting will be crucial in shaping the future,\u201d said Zhang Baohui, an international relations expert at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cA successful meeting will at least slow down the momentum of a new Cold War. A bad meeting will make that irreversible.\u201d\u201cThis is one of those rare moments in history where a geopolitical turning point is upon us, and it is clear to the entire world at the very moment,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a former China adviser to Mr. Obama who now teaches at Georgetown University.\u201cTrump has framed the relationship with China solely in terms of competition, with trade at the top of the agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they cannot find a way forward on trade, then the relationship may be imperiled, as the forces of acrimony and entropy take over.\u201dAdding to the uncertainty is the cacophony of voices surrounding Mr. Trump.His staff is divided between mainstream Republicans like Mr. Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who are counseling him to compromise with Mr. Xi; hard-liners like Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who is pushing for China to undertake sweeping changes; and nationalists like Peter Navarro, the director of the White House trade office, who would like to see Mr. Trump impose ever higher tariffs, even if it leads to a divorce between the world\u2019s two largest economies.Mr. Xi, who went to school with Mr. Liu, has shown little of his friend\u2019s inclinations; in fact, he has shown the opposite. A former American official who recently met with Mr. Liu said it was difficult to decipher whether Mr. Liu actually met with Mr. Xi frequently.\u201cIf you believe Liu is a real reformer, then the evidence suggests that Xi isn\u2019t listening to him,\u201d said another American, Matthew P. Goodman, an economist specializing in Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Instead, the stage is set for what one Chinese commentator calls a new bipolar world. Yan Xuetong, a professor at Tsinghua University, said in an essay in the coming issue of Foreign Affairs that Mr. Xi was already competing for new friends among America\u2019s allies, and that there were few common threats that could force the countries to cooperate.\u201cThe global fallout of Trumpism has already pushed some countries toward China in ways that would have seemed inconceivable a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Yan wrote.Though Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi come from very different systems, they bear similarities: both are strongmen, both are ardent nationalists, and both are taking their countries in different directions than their predecessors. With his tariffs, Mr. Trump has shown a willingness to upend decades of Republican Party allegiance to free trade.Equally, both leaders are facing economic headwinds, which could be exacerbated by a prolonged trade war. Mr. Trump repeatedly asks his aides about the state of the economy, officials said, and some are warning him that he could be blamed for market turbulence and job losses from tariffs.Mr. Trump has emerged from previous meetings with Mr. Xi, in Palm Beach, Fla., and Beijing, with fulsome praise for his \u201cgood friend.\u201d Most people expect to hear those sentiments again \u2014 and they may even be tied to some kind of compromise on trade. The question is, will that be enough to patch up all the other conflicts?\u201cThe president has quite artfully kept his friendship with Xi in public view,\u201d said Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cBut I doubt it will dissolve the myriad other forms of competitive, even adversarial, sentiment that have been arising in other sectors of the relationship.\u201dMark Landler reported from Buenos Aires, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}

Of several new columns that debuted last week, the one that takes that premise most literally is Meanwhile, illustrated by the graphic journalist Wendy MacNaughton. Each Sunday, she\u2019ll examine a seemingly insignificant object, an unfamiliar personality or a subtle trend in the economy. There\u2019s nothing else quite like it in the paper.Be honest: When you got my email out of the blue and saw the words \u201cBusiness section,\u201d what was your immediate reaction? Why did you want to work in our corner of the news?Also, if I recall correctly, when we met I kind of tried to explain that you were making a mistake. I think I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve seen my work, right?\u201d and you made a strong argument I had not considered before, and something that I\u2019m looking forward to exploring and learning from: Everything connects to business. I think that\u2019s right. I do think that there is an element of economics and policy in everything around us. I\u2019m excited to lean in to that a little and see what I find.You describe your pieces as a combination of journalism, illustration and social work. Can you elaborate?I draw from life when I can. It puts me in a place, in an experience and a moment, and creates opportunity for conversation: I meet people through drawing on site. That connects with my being trained as a social worker. Social work practice is centered on promoting self-actualization and empowerment, and in storytelling terms what that means is I\u2019m interested in elevating the voices of people whose stories don\u2019t usually get told.When you\u2019re out in the field, what\u2019s in your gear kit?A sketchbook, either Aquabee or New Soho; a handful of fresh waterproof pens, either Uni-Ball or Micron; and my phone, to record if I\u2019m drawing while interviewing or can\u2019t scribble fast enough. I also use it to take pictures for color reference to paint from later.You travel a lot. Where would you most like to go on a reporting trip?This column came at an exciting time. Over the past six-plus months, I\u2019ve been taking lengthy road trips around the United States, interviewing and drawing people I meet. My only destination is a rule: I ask the people I meet where I should go next.Despite working in a lot of places around the globe, it\u2019s these travels around my own country that I find most challenging and eye-opening in terms of the different ways we each experience the world. See you soon, Great Lakes.What is it about illustration that opens up a whole new range of story possibilities, versus the traditional written approach?I just think it can communicate a moment, a circumstance or an emotion in a different way than writing and photography can. It literally \u201cre-presents\u201d something and asks the reader to reconsider it, to read more into it. I also create charts and graphs \u2014 for example, I worked with The Times Magazine\u2019s Samin Nosrat to create illustrations and infographics for her cookbook, \u201cSalt Fat Acid Heat.\u201d They didn\u2019t just depict things literally, but provided information or an experience that text alone could not. I think when we start seeing illustration as more than just a complement to text, and in fact a storytelling device in itself, the possibilities open way up. I\u2019m excited to have this space to explore them here. Every. Darn. Week. Speaking of which \u2014 I really need to get back to work.Nick Summers is The Times\u2019s Sunday Business editor.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of us are more equal than others, and they like Trump.Opinion ColumnistEveryone is delivering post-mortems on Tuesday\u2019s elections, so for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s mine: Despite some bitter disappointments and lost ground in the Senate, Democrats won a huge victory. They broke the Republican monopoly on federal power, and that\u2019s a very big deal for an administration that has engaged in blatant corruption and abuse of power, in the belief that an impenetrable red wall would always protect it from accountability. They also made major gains at the state level, which will have a big impact on future elections.But given this overall success, how do we explain those Senate losses? Many people have pointed out that this year\u2019s Senate map was unusually bad for Democrats, consisting disproportionately of states Donald Trump won in 2016. But there was actually a deeper problem, one that will pose long-term problems, not just for Democrats, but for the legitimacy of our whole political system. For economic and demographic trends have interacted with political change to make the Senate deeply unrepresentative of American reality.But here\u2019s the thing: The Senate, which gives each state the same number of seats regardless of population \u2014 which gives fewer than 600,000 people in Wyoming the same representation as almost 40 million in California \u2014 drastically overweights those rural areas and underweights the places where most Americans live.I find it helpful to contrast the real America, the place we actually live, with what I think of as \u201cSenate America,\u201d the hypothetical nation implied by a simple average across states, which is what the Senate in effect represents.As I said, real America is mainly metropolitan; Senate America is still largely rural.Real America is racially and culturally diverse; Senate America is still very white.Real America includes large numbers of highly educated adults; Senate America, which underweights the dynamic metropolitan areas that attract highly educated workers, has a higher proportion of non-college people, and especially non-college whites.None of this is meant to denigrate rural, non-college, white voters. We\u2019re all Americans, and we all deserve an equal voice in shaping our national destiny. But as it is, some of us are more equal than others. And that poses a big problem in an era of deep partisan division.So what happened Tuesday, with Republicans getting shellacked in the House but gaining in the Senate, wasn\u2019t just an accident of this year\u2019s map or specific campaign issues. It reflected a deep division in culture, indeed values, between the American citizenry at large and the people who get to choose much of the Senate.This divergence will have profound implications, because the Senate has a lot of power, especially when the president \u2014 who, let us not forget, lost the popular vote \u2014 leads the party that controls it. In particular, Trump and his Senate friends will spend the next couple of years stuffing the courts with right-wing loyalists.We may, then, be looking at a growing crisis of legitimacy for the U.S. political system \u2014 even if we get through the constitutional crisis that seems to be looming over the next few months.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Prince Faces G-20 Leaders, Drawing a Laugh and a Confrontation", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia exchanged laughs and clasped hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in an incongruously celebratory moment as they took their seats among other world leaders for a meeting in Buenos Aires during an economic summit.It was the surest sign yet that the crown prince can still expect a warm welcome from at least some heads of state even after American intelligence agencies and many Western officials have concluded that he authorized the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist ambushed two months ago by Saudi agents in a consulate in Istanbul. The prince has denied advanced knowledge of the killing.The Group of 20 summit meeting, a gathering of the leaders of the world\u2019s largest economies, is a closely watched test for Crown Prince Mohammed, the 33-year-old favorite son of the aging King Salman and de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom.An Argentine prosecutor has begun an inquiry into potential criminal charges against the crown prince for human rights abuses, including allegations that he was responsible for the torture of Mr. Khashoggi and certain Saudi prisoners, as well as for war crimes committed by Saudi-led forces fighting in Yemen. Legal authorities said there was no chance of any action against Prince Mohammed during the two-day meeting, but some world leaders had said that they might seek to confront him over the killing.French President Emmanuel Macron appeared to do just that, as he had promised. When he met with Prince Mohammed on the sidelines of the summit, a microphone captured fragments of their dialogue. Mr. Macron stood in a gray suit with a stern face just inches from Prince Mohammed, nodding his head and smiling awkwardly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the crown prince told the French president.\u201cI do worry. I am worried,\u201d Mr. Marcon responded. \u201cI told you.\u201d\u201cYou told me. Thank you very much,\u201d Prince Mohammed said, bowing his head almost bashfully.\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d the French president continued, adding moments later, \u201cYou never listen to me,\u201d and \u201cI am a man of my word.\u201d\u201cI do listen to you,\u201d Prince Mohammed insisted, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s O.K., I can deal with it.\u201dThe crown prince also met Friday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, whose country sends many temporary migrant workers to Saudi Arabia. But a video clip of Prince Mohammed\u2019s encounter with Mr. Putin was the most talked about image of the day, in part because of the delight the two leaders appeared to take in their meeting.Mr. Putin also faced international criticism over a murder this year. Britain has concluded that Mr. Putin\u2019s government ordered the killing of a former Russian spy living near London, a charge the Kremlin denies.Approaching seats next to each other at a round-table at the summit meeting, they clapped their palms together in the air as though in a high-five. As their handshake continued, the prince patted Mr. Putin three times on the back of his hand, and they continued to laugh together as though enjoying a joke.The advocacy group Human Rights Watch had petitioned the Argentine courts this week for a criminal investigation into Prince Mohammed\u2019s potential responsibility for rights abuses, under a broad jurisdiction for such crimes in Argeninian law. Although it cited the Khashoggi killing, the petition focused primarily on the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen. The United Nations has called the war in Yemen the world\u2019s worst man-made humanitarian disaster, and United Nations experts have said both sides may have committed war crimes.Judge Ariel Lijo formally requested information on Wednesday from Argentina\u2019s foreign ministry about guarantees of legal immunity given to Prince Mohammed while he was attending. The judge also requested information from Turkey, Yemen, the International Criminal Court and elsewhere to begin evaluating the allegations.President Mauricio Macri of Argentina said Thursday that the crown prince\u2019s potential role in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi was a legitimate subject for discussion at the meeting of the Group of 20, an association of the leaders of the world\u2019s biggest economies.\u201cThis issue that has impacted the world is on the table and maybe it will come out in bilateral meetings or in the agenda of the G-20,\u201d Mr. Macri said at a news conference in the Argentine capital.\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m in favor of transparency and associating the international community in this affair, because the whole world is concerned,\u201d he said.A French official said Friday that Mr. Macron had sought to discuss the Khashoggi killing, the Yemen war and the oil markets with the prince during their one-on-one conversation.Prince Mohammed, who has denied ordering or having advance knowledge of the killing, kept a low profile Thursday. He arrived in Buenos Aires on Wednesday, after a weeklong tour of Arab capitals, and he was welcomed at the airport by the host country\u2019s foreign minister, Jorge Faurie.Officials of Human Rights Watch said Thursday that its petition to the Argentine courts had already shaped the atmosphere at the summit meeting for Prince Mohammed.\u201cNo world leader attending the G-20 summit today can ignore the fact that Mohammed bin Salman is under scrutiny for alleged war crimes in Yemen and torture,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch.Daniel Politi reported from Buenos Aires, and David D. Kirkpatrick from London. Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

Nearly every place I go, I hear some version of this question: \u201cAre we going to be O.K.?\u201d What the questioner means is, given the current leadership of our country and the ugly undercurrent on which it thrives, is America as we know it going to survive? Yes, is the answer I give, without hesitation. We will recover. How long that takes is up to us, but I am optimistic.History shows us that America\u2019s progress in fulfilling our aspirations is an upward sloping line. Yes, our present has always fallen short of our values. After all, we were born in original sin \u2014 our nation\u2019s founders held inspiring truths to be self-evident while keeping human beings as slaves. But our history is one of continuous progress.Unfortunately, that line marking our progress is not a solid one. We make progress, then we regress, then we make progress again. The upward jag is always larger than the retreat, which is why the line has a positive slope upward across 242 years. But our line is jagged.Our country has changed dramatically in recent years. We elected a black man president for two terms and a woman won the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. We legalized gay marriage, have an entirely new approach to work and technology and families, and we are on a path to the white majority becoming a minority. History shows us that with so much progress and change, a spasm of negativity and backlash was inevitable.We can\u2019t fully control the natural rhythms of human history. But what we can control is how long this period lasts before the line turns up again. The K.K.K. fever was broken in part because courageous leaders stood up to the Klan and brought millions of good people with them. And that pattern is also repeating itself.As I travel, I can feel something. If you imagine the ideology of Americans as a bell curve, our core values are secure in the middle with the giant lump of busy, normally disengaged, distracted people. They are voters and nonvoters on the center right and center left, which is a vast majority, in a country where the far-left and far-right wings usually do all the talking and shouting. Every so often in our history, that giant stirs. The murder of little girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963 stirred that giant, which led to bipartisan support in Congress to pass the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts that changed our country for the better.What the rest of us have to do is not become discouraged or complacent, or be provoked into reacting in ways that betray our values. It falls to all of us to awaken the giant so that we shorten the period before we resume our upward march. Every American should be speaking about our nation\u2019s values. Every American should be voting those values, which are far more important than even the most passionate policy differences. The history of America consoles us, but also calls us to action.James Comey is the former F.B.I. director and author of \u201cA Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pound Slides as Brexit Turmoil Hits Britain Again", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig declines in Britain\u2019s currency, the pound, often have signaled wrenching changes for the country. Could this be the case again as Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to win support for her plan to take Britain out of the European Union?The British pound on Thursday fell 2 percent against the dollar. That\u2019s a large decline for a currency belonging to a developed economy and is the biggest one-day drop since the weeks after Britain\u2019s vote in June 2016 to leave the European Union, a process known as Brexit.Though the pound is down 15 percent since that vote, it remains well above the lows it hit in January 2017, when it was becoming clear that Mrs. May\u2019s government favored a more drastic separation from important economic arrangements with the European Union.The plunging pound has in some ways absorbed the fallout of the Brexit decision. The currency\u2019s decline made British goods cheaper to foreign buyers, which supports the country\u2019s exports. A weaker pound may also encourage foreigners to invest in Britain because acquisitions look cheaper. Buyouts of British companies are up nearly 150 percent this year.But there are real disadvantages to a weak currency. Foreign goods cost more in Britain, which pushes up inflation. There also is the possibility that a further slide in the pound prompts investors to dump British stocks and government bonds, leading to the sort of crisis of confidence that can slam the wider economy.The likelihood of such a rout increases if the process of Britain leaving the European Union becomes disorderly. Under the current schedule, Britain would exit in March. Earlier this week, the British government reached an agreement with the European Union on Britain\u2019s withdrawal.On Thursday, however, two cabinet ministers who oppose aspects of the deal resigned from Mrs. May\u2019s government, and there are signs that Britain\u2019s parliament may vote against the deal. What might happen next will depend on whether Mrs. May can somehow drum up support for the deal, whether her government stays in power, and whether there is support in Parliament for a different type of deal or a second Brexit referendum.The fact that the pound has not fallen back to its lows suggests investors do not believe Britain will leave the European Union without some sort of deal. But time is running out, so this could just be the start of things.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Finally Control the Power in Albany. What Will They Do With It?", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s been years in the making, if not decades: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic Party seized complete control of the New York State government on Tuesday, decisively evicting Republicans from running the State Senate, which they have controlled for all but three years since World War II.Now Democrats have to figure out just what to do with that newfound power \u2014 and almost everyone has different ideas and priorities, some of which had already started to collide on Wednesday, even as Mr. Cuomo and his Democratic colleagues celebrated major wins.Democrats now hold 40 seats in the State Senate, as Republicans lost eight to the Democrats on Election Day. That count, however, includes Senator Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, who has previously caucused with Republicans.Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, won with 59 percent of the vote \u2014 some 3.4 million people chose him for a third term \u2014 a marked improvement from his 2014 victory, and one that left the governor sounding deeply satisfied.When asked on Wednesday what he would like to see passed in the coming legislative session, the governor laid out a veritable Christmas list of progressive baubles, including codifying Roe v. Wade\u2019s protections in state law; more gun control and ethics laws; the Dream Act, which would allow for financial aid for undocumented students; and the Child Victims Act, which would extend the statute of limitations for survivors of certain kinds of sexual abuse.Perhaps most notably, Mr. Cuomo said he would close the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows almost unlimited amounts of cash to flow to campaigns \u2014 including his own \u2014 through multiple limited liability companies.Mr. Cuomo had worked closely with Republicans and a breakaway group of Democrats during his seven-plus years in office, much to the chagrin of more left-leaning members of his party, who blamed those relationships for bottling up the very legislation he now wants to pass.And in describing his feelings on Wednesday, the governor sounded relieved that he would stop being blamed.\u201cMy great frustration has been the inability to pass progressive measures that would have made a significant positive difference for the state and, as governor, bearing the burden of the failure of their passage,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThe Democratic Senate will liberate me from that frustration.\u201dStill there will most be a push for even more: There is already chatter about legalizing recreational marijuana; investing more in the crumbling subways; addressing climate change; and installing an early voting system for the first time, all ideas that the governor has previously offered differing degrees of support for.And after a tumultuous primary season in which liberal challengers ousted seven more moderate Democratic state senators, the virtual Holy Grail of current progressive thought seems within reach: a state-run universal health care system. Mr. Cuomo stopped short of fully embracing the proposal, saying it \u201chas merit.\u201dAndrea Stewart-Cousins, who is slated to become the first woman and first female African-American to lead the New York State Senate, also struck a note of caution about the Democratic agenda. \u201cYou eat the elephant one issue at a time,\u201d she said on Tuesday, as votes began to roll in for her party.There also will likely be, of course, intraparty differences. The Senate that Ms. Stewart-Cousins will lead is very likely to contain several factions, including New York City liberals and more moderate members from the city\u2019s suburbs. Fifteen of her members will be new to Albany, and its vagaries, with many of that cohort never before having held public office \u2014 or, in some cases, even having an office.Gustavo Rivera, a Democratic state senator from the Bronx, said that Democrats had failed to keep the trust of voters during their brief time in charge nearly a decade ago and know they must do better this time.\u201cGoverning is a very complicated matter,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just giving raises to your staff and getting nicer offices.\u201dMr. Cuomo won in 2010, in part, on a promise to restore sanity and stability to the statehouse. And he did so by occupying the political center between a liberal State Assembly and a Republican-controlled State Senate. For years, he has blamed any number of stalled liberal goals on recalcitrant Republicans. That catchall excuse dissolved Tuesday evening.Alessandra Biaggi, who defeated Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the breakaway Democrats, said of Mr. Cuomo, \u201cNow it\u2019s up to us to actually hold him accountable and to make sure that the things that he says are not just campaign promises.\u201dMuch of the to-do list that Mr. Cuomo discussed after the election involved social or legal changes. But the governor has generally been more leery of raising taxes and other measures that would negatively affect the business community; real estate interests pour millions of dollars into his campaigns and drive a large segment of the city\u2019s and state\u2019s economy. Mayor Bill de Blasio has repeatedly called for a new millionaire\u2019s tax to fund various programs; Mr. Cuomo has steadfastly opposed it.The last time Democrats controlled the full Legislature, they raised taxes only to see themselves lose back the Senate within two years. \u201cThis scary narrative about tax-and-spend-Democrats will not pertain to us,\u201d said Ms. Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester Democrat. \u201cIt does not pertain to us.\u201dOne big issue sure to come up in 2019 is expanding rent control, as the current rules are set to expire.State Senator Brian P. Kavanagh, a Democrat from Manhattan elected in 2017, predicted \u201ca fundamentally different debate about the relationship between landlords and tenants\u201d than in the past.The governor has also signaled he wants to push a congestion-pricing plan to boost funding for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway system.\u201cHow are we going to fix the M.T.A.? We have got to do this,\u201d Ms. Biaggi said. \u201cThis is insane. Enough now. I don\u2019t think anyone wants to hear any more excuses.\u201dMr. Cuomo has previously feuded with state Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, who runs the political operation of Senate Democrats. Even some of the governor\u2019s allies were perplexed by an October news release from the state party, which Mr. Cuomo controls, that contrasted his efforts with those of Mr. Gianaris.\u201cFund-raising Effort Follows News That D.S.C.C. is Losing Money Race,\u201d the release blared. (Mr. Gianaris runs the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.)Ms. Stewart-Cousins said, \u201cI thought that was an unfortunate press release, frankly, and I made sure that the state party chair was aware of that.\u201dAnd on Wednesday, there were hints of friction there again as Mr. Gianaris said he had been kept in the dark about a possible deal to place a satellite headquarters of Amazon in Long Island City, which is the heart of his district. Mr. Cuomo has openly lobbied for Amazon to come to New York, joking he would even change his name to \u201cAmazon Cuomo\u201d to land the company.Mr. Gianaris, however, has expressed deep concerns about infrastructure, overcrowding and the wisdom of using subsidies to lure \u201cone of the richest companies in the world.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of red flags,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have any answers.\u201dStill, Mr. Gianaris, who helped orchestrate the Democrats\u2019 big night on Tuesday, also seemed eager to keep the peace. \u201cThis is a not a complaint that I wasn\u2019t briefed properly,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Happened? Decoding Election Night", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylettersReaders offer different assessments of what messages the voters were sending, and how both parties should proceed.To the Editor:When I fell asleep the night before the 2016 election, I was certain that I would be watching Hillary Clinton win the next evening. However, like millions of other Americans, I had this strange two-year nightmare: Donald Trump was actually elected president. I think that we are all about to wake up from the Trump nightmare, as the recent election has made certain that at least one house of Congress will check his power and that the principles of our democracy and the values of our country remain strong. We are still one step away from ridding our nation of its greatest political mistake, but it was a very important step to put us back on track.To the Editor:While some may take solace that we now have a divided government that will somehow act as a check against the worst impulses of the president, it is hard to see how this new political dynamic will lead to the cooperation necessary to pass legislation on the matters that are most important to all of us, like getting better access to health care, modernizing our aging infrastructure, protecting Medicare and Social Security, and dealing with the scourge of income inequality.To the Editor:Democrats saved this democracy \u2014 a democracy for which so many have given their sweat and their tears and their lives. We are in for a very difficult two years. I pray for all of us, in this beautiful broken country that I love, and hope.To the Editor:Make it hard for Mr. Trump in ways that change lives for the better. Concentrate on protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. On improving the health care system. On rebuilding this nation, literally as well as figuratively. On tearing down the imaginary immigration wall. We are so desperate in this country to feel encouraged by our political system, not buffeted by it. Even those who are saddened by Tuesday night\u2019s results in the House are sick and tired of our internal wars. Show us what this nation is capable of accomplishing. Make us proud.To the Editor:The American people do not want higher taxes, or unprotected borders and illegal immigration, and they are tired of the identity politics and divisiveness of the left and the incivility its members have shown the past two years. Many do not like President Trump\u2019s tweets or his abrasive manner but see that he delivers what he promises and that his policies have helped revive a stagnant economy. Voters want results more than political correctness. Until the left understands this and comes up with something other than bashing Mr. Trump and trying to obstruct everything the Republicans try to do for our country, it will remain out of touch with the American people.To the Editor:Is it so difficult to acknowledge that the pace of change in society today causes great anxiety? And that perhaps it\u2019s quite normal for people to seek some sense of continuity and control? President Trump gets this, and he exploits it to the hilt by fearmongering. But the left-brained, indignant Democrats just keep preaching lofty ideals with judgmental labels for those who disagree \u2014 and so are failing to communicate with people worried about their future.To the Editor:Put this together with the Supreme Court\u2019s gutting of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which has yielded a passel of draconian limitations, and African-American voters could certainly be forgiven for feeling that, once again, their voices have been silenced. My heart aches for them, and for a nation that so doggedly resists a genuine reckoning with its original sin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cut Was Supposed to Change Corporate Behavior. Here\u2019s What Happened.", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a year after the tax cut, economic growth has accelerated. Wage growth has not. Companies are buying back stock and business investment is a mixed bag. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law late last year has already given the American economy a jolt, at least temporarily. It has fattened the paychecks of most American workers, padded the profits of large corporations and sped economic growth. Those results weren\u2019t a surprise. Economists across the ideological spectrum predicted the new law would fuel consumer spending, in classic fashion: When the government borrows money and dumps it into the economy, growth tends to accelerate. But Republicans did not sell the law as a sugar-high stimulus. They sold it as a refashioning of the incentives in the American economy \u2014 one that would unleash more investment, better efficiency and higher wages, along with enough growth to offset any revenue lost to the government from lower tax rates.Ten months after the law took effect, that promised \u201csupply-side\u201d bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus. It\u2019s still early, but here\u2019s what the numbers tell us so far: Proponents of the tax overhaul said it would supercharge the recent lackluster pace of business spending on long-term investments like buildings, factories, equipment and technology. Such spending is crucial to keeping economic growth strong. And strong growth is central to Republican claims that the tax cuts would ultimately pay for themselves.Capital spending did pick up steam earlier this year. For companies in the S&P 500, capital expenditures rose roughly 20 percent in the first half of 2018. Much of that was concentrated: The spending of just five companies \u2014 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, and Facebook, Intel, Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs \u2014 accounted for roughly a third of the entire rise. Much of that spending went toward technology, including increased investment in data centers and computing, server and networking capacity. For the full year, Goldman Sachs analysts expect that capital expenditures for companies in the S&P 500 will be up about 14 percent, to $715 billion. Research and development spending, another component of business investment, was expected to be up 12 percent, to $340 billion.For the economy as a whole, the surge in business investment was a bit less impressive. It\u2019s true that business spending on fixed investment \u2014 such as machinery, buildings and equipment \u2014 rose, jumping 11.5 percent and 8.7 percent during the first and second quarters. The first-quarter jump was the fastest for investment since 2011. But that pace fizzled during the third quarter. Recently data showed third-quarter business investment rose at an annual pace of 0.8 percent. The last quarter of the year \u2014 traditionally a big one for capital spending \u2014 will fill out the picture, but that data won\u2019t be released until early 2019. It will likely take years to get a better sense of whether the law fundamentally reshaped American corporate investment. But there\u2019s little clear evidence that it is drastically reshaping the way in which most companies invest and spend.The results of a survey published in late October by the National Association for Business Economics showed that 81 percent of the 116 companies surveyed said they had not changed plans for investment or hiring because of the tax bill. Cheerleaders for the tax cut argued that the heart of the law \u2014 cutting and restructuring taxes for corporations \u2014 would give the economy a positive bump, giving companies incentives to invest more, hire more workers and pay higher wages. Skeptics said that the money companies saved through tax cuts would merely increase corporate profits, rather than trickling down to workers. JPMorgan Chase analysts estimate that in the first half of 2018, about $270 billion in corporate profits previously held overseas were repatriated to the United States and spent as a result of changes to the tax code. Some 46 percent of that, JPMorgan Chase analysts said, was spent on $124 billion in stock buybacks. Supporters of the tax cuts repeatedly claimed the bill would increase economic growth enough to offset the decline in tax receipts. \u201cI'm totally convinced this is a revenue-neutral bill,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, when a preliminary version of the bill was approved in the Senate in December 2017. It\u2019s highly unusual for deficits and borrowing needs to grow this much during periods of prosperity. A broad variety of analysts attribute the widening deficit to the tax cuts (along with increased military and other domestic spending ushered in through a bill Mr. Trump signed earlier this year). The growing budget gap means the Treasury must borrow more to keep the government running. The Treasury expects to borrow a total of $1.338 trillion from global investors this calendar year. That would be 145 percent higher than the $546 billion the federal government borrowed last year. That would be the highest level of borrowing since 2010, when the American economy was struggling to recover from the great recession. Data from large public companies, however, suggest that most workers received relatively small shares of their employers\u2019 corporate tax savings. Workers for those companies were more likely to see their wages rise if they lived in states where the minimum wage was relatively low \u2014 and where companies do not have to pay workers more to compensate for high housing costs. California workers at those companies saw an average benefit of about $160 each, which is less than half the average benefit for workers in Kentucky.Many companies also said they would use tax savings to create jobs. But the Just Capital research finds that, since the tax cuts were passed, the 1,000 largest public companies have actually reduced employment, on balance. They have announced the elimination of nearly 140,000 jobs \u2014 which is almost double the 73,000 jobs they say they have created in that time. About half of those net losses came from companies in the restaurant and leisure industries, the analysis found. By Republicans\u2019 own economic theories, it should take a while for corporate tax cuts to translate into higher worker pay. First, the cuts need to stimulate increased capital investments, which in turn raise worker productivity. More productive workers would then see their wages rise accordingly. Productivity grew 3 percent in the second quarter of this year and 2.2 percent in the third \u2014 healthy numbers, which will need to continue apace to deliver the sort of long-term economic jolt Republicans promised.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Special: China Means Business", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Sunday morning, and welcome to a special edition of the DealBook Briefing. Today, we\u2019re taking a look at how China wrote its own playbook to beat the West at its own game of economic growth.The Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, and how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation.China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Not so long ago, three-quarters of its population endured extreme poverty: Now it\u2019s less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished nation has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.In matters of commerce and national security, China is competing with the United States, even in traditional American spheres of influence. From a Chinese perspective, this reordering is merely an overdue reversion to historical reality as Beijing demands consideration commensurate with its stature.China\u2019s challenge to the Western-dominated order is amplified now that order\u2019s primary architect, the United States, is now led by an avowed nationalist.Now, China is using its funds to make foreign investments, particularly in overseas infrastructure, with different terms from those offered by other nations:China is using its power and money to build a vast global network of investments and infrastructure that will reshape global finance and geopolitics.China has financed infrastructure projects in at least 112 countries. Many of those initiatives have focused on neighbors \u2014 Pakistan in particular \u2014 to strengthen geopolitical relationships. Others, in volatile countries like Nigeria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, involve risks that many other nations try to avoid.Some of those countries could become important allies.But its approach has been unconventional:It borrowed some Western ideas while rejecting others. It opened itself to the world when necessary, and put on the brakes when it chose to. It set goals and backed them with government money. It freed its people to make and spend money, but it forbade them to ask for a better deal. Entrepreneurs built modern China, and the Communist Party kept them in line.A prime example is the country\u2019s membership of the World Trade Organization:Now, amid an escalating trade war, tensions are ratcheting up:\u2022 Others, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and the director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, have tried to put the brakes on Mr. Trump\u2019s most belligerent trade moves.How likely is it that trade war turns into real war?\u2022 Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who worked in the Defense Department to reshape relations with former Soviet nations after the end of the Cold War, argues that a rising power like China is likely to come to blows with an established one like the United States.\u2022 But some China experts note that other areas of dispute, like Taiwan, have not become more fraught in recent years. And whatever the issue, they argue, a disastrous miscalculation is more likely without persistent engagement.Thanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Saudis Want a U.S. Nuclear Deal. Can They Be Trusted Not to Build a Bomb?", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 33-year-old heir to the Saudi throne had been overseeing a negotiation with the Energy Department and the State Department to get the United States to sell designs for nuclear power plants to the kingdom. The deal was worth upward of $80 billion, depending on how many plants Saudi Arabia decided to build.But there is a hitch: Saudi Arabia insists on producing its own nuclear fuel, even though it could buy it more cheaply abroad, according to American and Saudi officials familiar with the negotiations. That raised concerns in Washington that the Saudis could divert their fuel into a covert weapons project \u2014 exactly what the United States and its allies feared Iran was doing before it reached the 2015 nuclear accord, which President Trump has since abandoned.Prince Mohammed set off alarms when he declared earlier this year, in the midst of the negotiation, that if Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s fiercest rival, \u201cdeveloped a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.\u201d His negotiators stirred more worries by telling the Trump administration that Saudi Arabia would refuse to sign an agreement that would allow United Nations inspectors to look anywhere in the country for signs that the Saudis might be working on a bomb, American officials said.Asked in Congress last March about his secret negotiations with the Saudis, Energy Secretary Rick Perry dodged a question about whether the Trump administration would insist that the kingdom be banned from producing nuclear fuel.Privately, administration officials argue that if the United States does not sell the nuclear equipment to Saudi Arabia someone else will \u2014 maybe Russia, China or South Korea.They stress that assuring that the Saudis use a reactor designed by Westinghouse, the only American competitor for the deal, fits with Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that jobs, oil and the strategic relationship between Riyadh and Washington are all far more important than the death of a Saudi dissident who was living, and writing newspaper columns, in the United States.Under the rules that govern nuclear accords of this kind, Congress would have the opportunity to reject any agreement with Saudi Arabia, though the House and Senate would each need a veto-proof majority to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s plans.\u201cIt is one thing to sell them planes, but another to sell them nukes, or the capacity to build them,\u2019\u2019 said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Following Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, Mr. Sherman has led the charge to change the law and make it harder for the Trump administration to reach a nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia. He described it as one of the most effective ways to punish Prince Mohammed.Nuclear experts said Prince Mohammed should have been disqualified from receiving nuclear help as soon as he raised the prospect of acquiring atomic weapons to counter Iran.\u201cWe have never before contemplated, let alone concluded, a nuclear cooperation agreement with a country that was threatening to leave the nonproliferation treaty, even provisionally,\u201d said William Tobey, a senior official in the Energy Department during the Bush administration who has testified about the risks of the agreement with Saudi Arabia.He was referring to the crown prince\u2019s threat to match any Iranian nuclear weapon \u2014 a step that would require the Saudis to either publicly abandon their commitments under the nonproliferation treaty or secretly race for the bomb.The Trump administration declined to provide an update on the negotiations, which were intense enough that Mr. Perry went to Riyadh in late 2017. Within the last several months, a senior State Department official engaged in further discussions over the deal in Europe.The Saudi energy ministry said in a statement: \u201cThe Saudi government has repeatedly confirmed that every component of the Saudi atomic energy program is strictly for civil and peaceful uses. The Saudi government has decided to move with this project not only to diversify energy sources but also to contribute to our economy. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly called for a Middle East free from all forms of nuclear weapons.\u201dSaudi Arabia has long displayed interest in acquiring, or helping allies acquire, the building blocks of a program that could make nuclear weapons and protect the kingdom from potential threats from its neighbors \u2014 first Israel, then Iraq and Iran.The Saudi government provided the financing for Pakistan to secretly build its own nuclear arms, the first \u201cSunni bomb,\u201d as the Pakistani creators of the program called it. That financial link has long left American intelligence officials wondering if there was a quid pro quo: that if Saudi Arabia ever needed its own small arsenal, Pakistan could provide it \u2014 perhaps by moving Pakistani troops to Saudi territory.That insistence is what set off the Iranian nuclear crisis. Over the years, several nations have demonstrated that it is possible to turn ostensibly civilian programs into sources of bomb fuel, and thus atomic warheads and military power. Israel recently released an archive of material, stolen from Tehran in January, to prove that the Iranian government deceived the world for years.The Saudis, meanwhile, had no equivalent facilities. They promised to get them.\u201cWhatever the Iranians build, we will also build,\u201d Prince Turki al-Faisal, a former Saudi intelligence chief, warned as the Obama administration sought to negotiate what became the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran.Under that pact, Iran is currently spinning a small number of nuclear centrifuges, though it had to ship 97 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country. The Saudis believe they need to be positioned to match Iran\u2019s every move, though experts say it would take a while. \u201cNo one thinks the Saudis would be able to do this anytime soon,\u201d said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t plausibly build a weapon without outside help.\u201dThe core challenge for the Trump administration is that it has declared that Iran can never be trusted with any weapons-making technology. Now, it must decide whether to draw the same line for the Saudis.The United States\u2019 own actions may be helping to drive the Saudis\u2019 nuclear thinking. Now that the Iran agreement, brokered with world powers, is on the edge of collapse after Mr. Trump withdrew the United States, analysts are worried that the Saudis may be positioning themselves to create their own nuclear program in response.Saudi leaders saw a political opening when Mr. Trump was elected.In late 2017, Mr. Perry, the energy secretary, picked up the nuclear cooperation issue. Excluding Russia, he began negotiating with Riyadh over the terms. Whether the Saudis would be banned from fuel production quickly became a flash point in Congress.The Saudi delegation was led by the energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, who resisted the proposal.The crown prince made headlines in March by shifting the public discussion over Riyadh\u2019s intentions from reactors to atomic bombs. In a CBS News interview, he said that if Iran acquired nuclear arms, Saudi Arabia would quickly follow suit.A few days later, Mr. Falih, the energy minister, raised concerns about the outcome of negotiations with Washington by insisting publicly that Riyadh would make its own atomic fuel.\u201cIt will be natural,\u201d he said, \u201cfor the United States to be with us and to provide us not only with technology, but to help us with the fuel cycle and the monitoring, and make sure we do it to the highest standard.\u201dBut Mr. Falih emphasized that the kingdom had its own uranium deposits and wanted to develop them rather than relying on an overseas supplier.\u201cIt\u2019s not natural,\u201d he said, \u201cfor us to bring enriched uranium from a foreign country.\u201dMark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, and David Kirkpatrick from London.Advertisement"}

In constructing a central piece of the futuristic capital, China is ingratiating itself with the canal\u2019s ultimate gatekeeper, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while rendering his grandest visions dependent on friendly relations with Beijing.How China became a superpowerChina\u2019s reach for commercial expansion along with diplomatic influence guides an array of Chinese undertakings, from rail networks and highways taking shape across Africa and Latin America to ports and power stations being constructed in Eastern Europe and South Asia. In Southeast Asia, Chinese entrepreneurs are engineering a crop of web companies just as China projects growing military power in the South China Sea.Little more than a decade ago, China\u2019s forays beyond its borders were mainly about bringing home energy, minerals and other resources, often from countries forsaken by the West as pariah states like Iran, Sudan and Myanmar. In foreign policy, China pursued a sole obsession \u2014 peeling off diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory. Even as China skirmished with neighbors over contested islands, it accepted the dominance of the United States Navy.Those days are over.Under the muscular leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has cast off previous restraints, rejecting deference to an American-dominated global order as an impediment to national revival. In matters of commerce and national security, China is competing with the United States, even in traditional American spheres of influence.From a Chinese perspective, this reordering is merely an overdue reversion to historical reality as Beijing demands consideration commensurate with its stature.In the telling of the ruling Communist Party, China\u2019s modern history is the story of Chinese mastery degraded by colonial depravity. China is the land that invented the compass, gunpowder, paper and printing, amassing stupendous wealth while Europe was still backward. Then came centuries of humiliation \u2014 Britain\u2019s profiting from forcing opium on the populace, Japanese brutality, demeaning lectures about human rights from hypocritical Americans. Now, China is intent on securing its own fate.\u201cChina wants to be a great power in the world,\u201d says Paul Heer, a former chief national intelligence officer in East Asia for the United States, who now teaches at George Washington University. \u201cThey think the rest of the world owes them recognition, and a return to what the Chinese see as their rightful place.\u201dNowhere are China\u2019s designs clearer than in Asia. China has overtaken the United States as the leading trading partner with Asian nations while pushing back against American naval primacy in the South China Sea. China is disrupting American alliances in the region, from Japan to Singapore to Australia.Beyond its backyard, China\u2019s ambitions are boundless. It celebrates its Belt and Road Initiative, a vast collection of infrastructure projects around the world, as the means of recreating the Silk Road, the trails navigated in ancient times by merchants carrying goods between Asia and Europe.\u201cXi Jinping is leading a China that has influences in all corners of the globe,\u201d says Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cThe 2008 financial crisis in the West was the turning point for China. Beijing started to embrace a triumphal mind-set, and pursued global leadership with new confidence on the back of the West\u2019s perceived flaws.\u201dChina\u2019s assertive role in world affairs is grounded in its domestic needs. It is at once spreading into new markets, generating fresh demand for its factory wares just as growth slows at home. It is projecting military strength and influence when the legitimacy of the Communist Party rests on bolstering economic fortunes and international esteem.Among its neighbors, China\u2019s rise provokes fears that an unwanted piece of history is being resurrected \u2014 the old tribute system that cemented China\u2019s status as the Middle Kingdom. For centuries, other nations bowed in recognition of China\u2019s imperial might, bestowing gifts on the emperor and accepting vassal status to secure trade and peace.For the Western powers whose order has prevailed since the end of World War II, China poses a foundational challenge. The United States and its victorious allies erected institutions that were \u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014 designed to keep the peace by promoting trade and fair competition. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have dispensed aid with conditions, though frequently drawing accusations that they have failed to comply with their standards on protecting human rights and the rule of law.China\u2019s investments come with no such strictures. China bankrolls autocrats who control geopolitically valuable real estate. China demands only that its companies gain a piece of the action while recipients eschew criticizing Beijing.China\u2019s challenge to the Western-dominated order is amplified by the reality that its primary architect, the United States, is now led by an avowed nationalist. As President Trump wages a trade war and derides international cooperation, he has generated doubts about the perseverance of the liberal democratic philosophy the United States has long championed.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the United States gives China this golden opportunity to portray itself as the defender of the international order,\u201d says Jessica Chen Weiss, a China expert at Cornell University.If the new Silk Road is in part about moving goods from Chinese factories to customers in the rest of the world, the trail seems certain to pass through Central and Eastern Europe.This reality frames the proceedings of the \u201c16-plus-1\u201d group, an economic bloc that China has forged with 16 Central and Eastern European nations. Its latest summit meeting convenes on a drizzly day in July in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Officials from the 16 governments \u2014 among them the newest, least-affluent members of the European Union \u2014 pose for photos with the delegation from China, the one nation wealthy and ambitious enough to finance their visions.Leaders in the rest of the European Union construe the group as a stealth assault on the rules and cohesion of their bloc. In offering financing for infrastructure projects, China has positioned itself as an alternative to European Union development funds.Europe\u2019s money comes with rules protecting labor and the environment, while requiring that projects be awarded to companies on the basis of competitive bidding to ensure fair competition. China tends to distribute its funds with far simpler demands: Chinese companies must gain work, free of competition, while Beijing secures an international ally.European Union officials are especially worried that Chinese money could weaken the pressure Europe is applying on members that have been breaching democratic norms. Europe has threatened to withhold development funds from Poland and Hungary as punishment for their turns toward authoritarianism. Both have packed courts with government-friendly judges and menaced the press.\u201cIt\u2019s a mutually beneficial cooperation based on mutual trust without any kind of attempts to interfere into domestic issues,\u201d Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, says in an interview before the summit meeting in Sofia.\u201cWe are talking about different conversations, concrete conversations related to infrastructure, and other conversations related to the level of democracy and human rights in China,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev of Bulgaria says in an interview the day before the event. \u201cIt would not be polite and constructive if we try to merge them into one.\u201dThe summit meeting convenes in a hulking convention center that harks back to era of Soviet domination. At a news conference, the Chinese and Bulgarian prime ministers offer assurances that the 16-plus-1 bloc does not aim to divide Europe.Mr. Li seeks to allay European worries that China poses a challenge to its rules. He promises that Chinese-financed projects will be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding.\u201cThere needs to be open and transparent tendering,\u201d the Chinese premier declares.But the Serbian prime minister, Ana Brnabic, has just undercut that assertion. Asked moments earlier about the high-speed rail from Belgrade to Budapest, she says Chinese companies have been promised construction work.\u201cChina is a strategic partner,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not putting out tenders.\u201dAs a currency crisis ravaged Indonesia two decades ago, angry mobs tore through West Jakarta, killing hundreds of ethnically Chinese merchants. Yet Cheng Tao, a Chinese software engineer turned venture capitalist, can look down from his high-rise office on the same neighborhood and see a tranquil center of Chinese life \u2014 grocery shops, restaurants and his own son\u2019s school.Mr. Cheng, 34, is part of an influx of young Chinese financiers, engineers and web designers who rent space in an area full of technology companies. He first came to Indonesia a decade ago with the Chinese telecom company Huawei. He and other veterans of large Chinese conglomerates are increasingly unleashing their own start-ups.\u201cTen years ago, there were no mainland Chinese here,\u201d Mr. Cheng says as he sips tea imported from China. \u201cWe see opportunities here that no longer exist in China.\u201dThe thriving Chinese start-up scene in a neighborhood once devastated by anti-Chinese terrorism illustrates China\u2019s deepening engagement in Southeast Asia. Only a few years ago, Chinese companies in the region were mainly focused on purchasing natural resources. Today, China is investing for the future, seeding innovative industries with money and brainpower.Last year, Chinese investors participated in funding rounds for Indonesian start-ups that accounted for 95 percent of the value of those companies, according to a survey by Google and A. T. Kearney, a global management company.\u201cChina is Indonesia\u2019s Silicon Valley,\u201d says Adrian Li, a venture capitalist who has a Stanford M.B.A. and moved to Jakarta from Beijing in 2014.China\u2019s place in Southeast Asia has proceeded deliberately, and just as the United States has ceded ground.While heads of state forge ties amid pageantry, Chinese businesses have been quietly yet persistently making inroads in Indonesia, guided by bottom-line concerns. At home, Chinese web companies are running out of new customers. Indonesia, a land of 260 million people, is adding more internet users than anywhere else on Earth.Jack Ma, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, was early to appreciate this reality, pouring major investments into local shopping start-ups, including $1.1 billion last year into Tokopedia, a thriving online marketplace. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this spring, the Tokopedia site drew 78 million people, a 70 percent increase from the previous month.Such potential fortifies Mr. Ma\u2019s determination to stay ahead of his biggest global competitor \u2014 Amazon. The American e-commerce company operates in Singapore but has yet to significantly penetrate Southeast Asia.Alibaba has put more than $3 billion into a former regional competitor, Lazada. Its Alipay digital payment system operates across Southeast Asia. Mr. Ma sits on advisory boards in the region that will help set standards and shape consumer perceptions, expanding China\u2019s traditional reach.Beyond money and clicks, China projects its power through a more traditional display of strength \u2014 military might.Alex Pama has watched it unfold from uncomfortable proximity. In the 1990s, when he was a junior officer in the Philippine Navy, he saw Chinese boats landing on Mischief Reef, a glorified collection of rocks claimed by the Philippines in the South China Sea. Chinese crews erected shelters to mark the territory, then began pouring concrete for larger buildings.The Philippines sought help from its former colonial overseer, the United States. But the Clinton administration demurred. The American Navy was still smarting over losing access to Subic Bay, its longtime base in the Philippines.That decision was a historic turning point, says Mr. Pama, who would rise to become admiral of the Philippine Navy. From then on, the United States shrank from the region, relinquishing the seas to China.\u201cThat\u2019s when the appeasement started,\u201d Mr. Pama says.Two decades later, President Xi ordered the buildup of Mischief Reef and other outcroppings in the Spratly archipelago into islands bristling with reconnaissance gear, aircraft hangars, runways, deepwater harbors and, most recently, short-range missiles. Those bases and China\u2019s maritime buildup have given Beijing effective control over one of the most heavily trafficked waterways on the planet.\u201cThe U.S. should have been more assertive back then and now,\u201d says Mr. Pama, now retired.Dominating the South China Sea and unseating the United States have become central objectives in Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to return China to glory. Last year, China for the first time staged aircraft carrier drills using advanced fighter jets in the South China Sea.China has presented these moves as defensive. But the United States and its Asian allies warn that Beijing has positioned itself to hold global trade hostage while diminishing the American presence. China\u2019s emergence as the region\u2019s dominant commercial power combined with its moves toward maritime supremacy has heightened the sense that a changing of the guard is underway.\u201cOver the long term, China\u2019s power and influence will undoubtedly weaken and ultimately abolish U.S. dominance in the region,\u201d says Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, who advises the government.The perspective gained momentum during the 2012 standoff at Scarborough Shoal, a horseshoe-shaped chain of reefs that is much closer to the Philippines than to China.As the Philippine Navy challenged Chinese fishing boats, the Obama administration brokered a deal in which both sides would withdraw. The Philippine vessels departed, but some of the Chinese boats stayed.China has controlled the shoal ever since. Emboldened, China began construction of seven artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago.China appears reluctant to build a full-fledged military base on the shoal, lest it stoke nationalist anger in the Philippines, damaging relations with its pro-China president, Rodrigo Duterte.\u201cAny reclamation will outrage the Duterte government,\u201d says Zhu Feng, the executive director of the Center for the South China Sea at Nanjing University. \u201cChina can\u2019t afford to lose a good friend like that.\u201dBut many Philippine officials fear that this is merely a pause before an inevitable Chinese expansion.Two large maps of the South China Sea cover the walls of the office of Gary Alejano, a Philippine congressman and former marine. He shows visitors how the Scarborough Shoal sits on the edge of the Bashi Channel, the Chinese Navy\u2019s entryway into the western Pacific. He points out the artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago. He notes Mischief Reef, where Chinese fighter jets have landed.Unless someone confronts them, those jets will remain there, using the hangars China built, Mr. Alejano says. Philippine Navy vessels rarely patrol the area, he laments.\u201cRight now, you can feel that China controls the South China Sea,\u201d Mr. Alejano says. \u201cAnd the U.S. comes in and out.\u201dAs China charts its global reach, six zones demand special attention: the maritime choke points.The entryway to the Black Sea from the Mediterranean. The passageway from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean via the Strait of Malacca. The corridor separating Europe from Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar. Bab el Mandeb, off Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. The Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Access to the Mediterranean from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal.At any one, an outbreak of hostilities could imperil China\u2019s free movement around the globe, jeopardizing its exports and access to resources.These zones have historically been policed by American naval power, which has made China\u2019s access dependent on peaceful relations with the United States. To liberate itself, China has been lavishing investment on governments that control the choke points.Which is how China became financier and developer for the grandiose capital being constructed by President Sisi in the reddish-brown desert east of Cairo. Mr. Sisi craves investment and allies at a time when much of the world has recoiled from his brutal crackdown on dissent.In an interview, Gen. Ahmed Zaki Abdeen, who heads the Egyptian state-owned company overseeing the new capital, railed against American reluctance to invest in his country.\u201cStop talking to us about human rights,\u201d he says. \u201cCome and do business with us. The Chinese are coming \u2014 they are seeking win-win situations. Welcome to the Chinese.\u201dIn backing the new capital, China has furthered an age-old aspiration for the Egyptian powers that be: taming the desert. The project aims to construct a city of 6.5 million people, replacing crumbling Cairo with a technological metropolis engineered to rival Dubai. Construction is expected to take 15 years while costing 200 billion Egyptian pounds, more than $11 billion.Under a master agreement signed in October 2017, China Construction is building the capital\u2019s central business district. A consortium of Chinese state-owned banks is lending $3 billion to finance a first phase expected to be completed in three years. Egypt is obligated to spend the money by hiring the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. A second phase is expected to run $3.2 billion.Yu Wenchuan dons a yellow safety vest as he works security at the China Construction site. Born and raised in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, Mr. Yu, 24, complains about the 100-degree heat and the conspicuous absence of spicy noodles. But he is resigned to spending the next eight years in Egypt.\u201cThis is a good way to get experience,\u201d he says.Under the contract, 35 percent of construction materials can be brought from China. Even some of the 65 percent procured from domestic sources stands to enrich China, given the presence of entrepreneurs like Xin Zhu.Seventeen years have passed since Mr. Xin landed in Cairo from his native Hubei Province. There, he oversaw a factory that processed slabs of granite and marble into flooring and countertops. He had heard that Egypt was rich with quarries full of high-quality, low-priced rock.He took control of a lot in an industrial area outside Cairo. He endured terrible roads and power failures. \u201cI was like a pioneer,\u201d he says.Today, Mr. Xin\u2019s company employs more than 100 people, mostly migrants from China. He ships most of his production to China. But he aims to sell into the new capital, profiting as Beijing erects a veritable Pharaonic monument for Egypt\u2019s authoritarian leader.\u201cI was looking for new opportunities outside China,\u201d Mr. Xin says. \u201cMore development is good for our business.\u201dDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaMore China RulesDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bonhomie? C\u2019est Fini as Trump and Macron Seek to Defuse Tension", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 They shook hands politely and patted each other on the arm stiffly. Their tight-lipped smiles appeared strained and forced. No cheeks were kissed, no friendly rubs were given, none of the bonhomie of their earlier meetings was on display.So much for the bromance.After a promising start, the relationship between President Trump and President Emmanuel Macron of France has soured. By the time they met in Paris on Saturday, the trans-Atlantic alliance that was to be showcased by this weekend\u2019s commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I appeared to be fraying instead.\u201cThe honeymoon is well and truly over,\u201d said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cTrump\u2019s visible contempt for allies over trade and the Iran nuclear deal are humiliating for Macron. There were high hopes of Macron\u2019s charm offensive, but Trump\u2019s actions have shown that it had no policy impact and that it is dangerous for any political leader to tie his reputation to the mercurial mood swings of the American president.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s absence from the Peace forum tomorrow, apparently alone among the 72 heads of state and government, will have a negative impact \u2014 the man who did not even pretend to work for peace, as it were,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a research organization.World War I demolished empires and destroyed kings, kaisers and sultans. It introduced chemical weapons and aerial bombing. It brought women into the work force and hastened their legal right to vote.\u201cI do share President Trump\u2019s views that we need much better burden-sharing within NATO, and that\u2019s why I do believe my proposals for European defense are utterly consistent with that,\u201d Mr. Macron said with Mr. Trump at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.The flap may have resulted from misleading accounts of Mr. Macron\u2019s comments, which came in an interview in French with Europe 1 radio this week. In the interview, Mr. Macron said that Europe needed to defend itself against the United States as well as Russia and China, but he was referring to cyberthreats, not the American government. The discussion of a European army actually came up later in the interview, and he characterized it as lightening America\u2019s burden, not defending against it.\u201cWhen I see President Trump announcing that he\u2019s quitting a major disarmament treaty, which was formed after the 1980s euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim?\u201d Mr. Macron said in the interview. \u201cEurope and its security.\u201dThe tense meeting with Mr. Trump contrasted with Mr. Macron\u2019s joint appearance with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany later in the day. At a solemn ceremony in the woods outside the northern town of Compi\u00e8gne where the armistice was signed on Nov. 11, 1918, the two leaders stood in front of a plaque celebrating peace and Franco-German friendship.It was the first time a German leader had returned to the spot where both World War I and World War II armistices were concluded. After conquering France in 1940, Adolf Hitler forced the defeated French to return the same railway car used in 1918 to consecrate Germany\u2019s defeat, a way of humiliating his vanquished foe.On Saturday, Mr. Macron and Ms. Merkel entered a similar car that now sits inside a museum at the site and sat glumly side by side for a few moments. The original car was destroyed during the second war and much at the site razed on Hitler\u2019s orders. The ceremony, simple yet symbolic, was over in 45 minutes, after the French and German national anthems were sung.\u201cThe symbolism of it is, it\u2019s not just a question of military victory, or military defeat, but of friendship between France and Germany, and also that both sides have overcome this defeat,\u201d said Sylvain Fort, a top aide to Mr. Macron. \u201cWe\u2019ve overcome this defeat to build a friendship that\u2019s lasted 70 years.\u201d\u201cWe have become very good friends over the last couple of years,\u201d Mr. Trump said, with none of the enthusiasm of last spring. \u201cWe have much in common in many ways \u2014 perhaps more ways than people would understand. But we are \u2014 we\u2019re very much similar in our views.\u201dMr. Macron referred to Mr. Trump as \u201cmy good friend\u201d and said they had \u201cworked very closely together\u201d in countering Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons. \u201cOur people are very proud to have you here,\u2019\u2019 he said.A major point of contention is Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran following his withdrawal from the multinational accord intended to curb the country\u2019s nuclear program. The French want to continue doing business with Iran and resent pressure by the Americans.The two sides remain at odds over broader trade issues as well. Mr. Trump has slapped steel and aluminum tariffs on Europe and other trading partners, and has threatened tariffs on cars manufactured in Europe.Mr. Trump said negotiations to ease the tariff war have been promising. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can get it over the line, as they say.\u201dMr. Trump remains deeply unpopular in Europe, especially in France, where just 9 percent think he will do the right thing in international relations, according to the Pew Research Center. The president\u2019s seeming indifference to European sensibilities was reinforced by a report in Le Monde, the French newspaper, that in a meeting with the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania earlier this year, Mr. Trump confused the Baltic states for Balkan states and blamed them for the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s.Mr. Macron understands the importance of maintaining the relationship, said Karen Donfried, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. But \u201cdomestically,\u201d she said, \u201cit may be better for him if the bromance has cooled visibly.\u201dCharles A. Kupchan, a former Europe adviser to Mr. Obama, said that Europe has all but given up on Mr. Trump and is focused instead on developing its own \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d to make it less dependent on the United States.\u201cTrump might be able to retain decent working relationships with populist governments in Italy, Poland, and Hungary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the rest of Europe is resigned to running out the clock, hoping and praying that Trump is a one-term president.\u201dPeter Baker reported from Paris, and Adam Nossiter from Compi\u00e8gne, France.

{"Headline": "China Seeks Allies as Trump\u2019s Trade War Mounts. It Won\u2019t Be Easy.", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Faced with mounting American tariffs that could slow China\u2019s already weakened economy, President Xi Jinping is pressing the case to the rest of the world that China can be a positive force for global trade.The challenge will be convincing the world he means it.Mr. Xi, the country\u2019s top leader, on Monday kicked off a six-day expo intended to show China as a big buyer of foreign goods. He extolled China\u2019s appetite for what the rest of the world makes, and he reiterated promises that Beijing would lower import tariffs and improve intellectual property protection to help make that happen.\u201cOpenness has become a trademark of China,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cChina has grown by embracing the world, and the world has also benefited by China\u2019s opening up.\u201d\u201cToday, as economic globalization deepens and develops,\u201d he added, \u201cthe ideas of the law of the jungle and winner take all increasingly lead to a dead end.\u201dMr. Xi\u2019s import expo is expected to bring 150,000 Chinese buyers to Shanghai this week to a vast exhibition center with more than five times the exhibition space of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York to peruse imports offered by businesses from 130 countries. It was intended to show that China offers more to the world than its vast manufacturing sector, which has flooded the world with goods and prompted leaders in the United States and elsewhere to worry about their own domestic industries.China\u2019s challenge was on display, as well, particularly when you consider who skipped the event. Despite months of energetic efforts by China to persuade foreign leaders to attend, only about a dozen presidents and prime ministers \u2014 from Hungary, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, among others \u2014 showed up Monday morning. Many were leaders of countries, like Kenya and Laos, that have borrowed heavily from Beijing as part of Mr. Xi\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, which is lending money for infrastructure projects across Asia, Eastern Europe and East Africa.Notably absent were the leaders of major trading nations like Germany, Britain, South Korea and Japan. The United States did not send an official delegation at all.Even some who attended struck a discordant note. Speaking on Monday morning in Shanghai, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya said that his country\u2019s trade with China has grown eightfold in the past decade. \u201cThis trade, however, was heavily skewed in favor of China,\u201d he said.Governments in Europe and East Asia have found themselves increasingly caught in the middle of the trade war between Washington and Beijing. Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular among the public in many countries, particularly in Western Europe, making it politically difficult for leaders there to support him in the trade dispute.But many European and East Asian leaders have complaints similar to Mr. Trump\u2019s. They say China discriminates against foreign companies doing business here and unfairly supports local companies. Some have begun to favor taking a similarly aggressive stance against China.Adam Dunnett, the secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said that in the past few months some European companies had begun to favor a tougher, American-style position. They want restrictions on Chinese exports to Europe unless Beijing provides the same access to its markets for European companies that Europe has long provided for Chinese companies.\u201cThis is a fundamental change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve got members talking that way is a real concern.\u201dMr. Dunnett declined to identify the companies, and added that the chamber of commerce had not shifted its own position. The chamber has long called for greater openness of China\u2019s markets without endorsing threats of tariffs or other measures on Chinese exports to Europe.Some European business leaders have begun echoing American complaints that China was allowed into the World Trade Organization in 2001 without enough rules to force it to become more of a market-based economy.\u201cWe decided to open the door to China probably in a little bit na\u00efve way,\u201d said Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, the chairman and chief executive of Total, the French energy giant.The shift in business attitudes has coincided with a shift in Trump administration policies in recent months toward rallying other countries to oppose Chinese trade policies, and away from unilateralism.China is looking to resolve the trade war before it further damages the country\u2019s slowing economy. Growth has been hurt by debt worries and declining business and consumer confidence.Mr. Xi on Monday emphasized that China had opened up more sectors this year to foreign investment. Big companies like BASF, the German chemical giant, and Exxon Mobil, the oil and gas company, have made use of the opportunity to rush in and sign deals in recent months. In a nod to one major concern among foreign companies, he also said China would strengthen intellectual property protections so that firms would worry less about theft and copycats.China will \u201cput in place a punitive, comprehensive system to significantly raise the cost for offenders,\u201d Mr. Xi said Monday, without providing a timetable or details.China\u2019s imports have indeed been climbing in recent months. Its trade surplus with the rest of the world has shrunk when compared with the size of the country\u2019s economy, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, noted in a brief speech on Monday. But much of that comes from importing commodities, not importing the kinds of manufactured goods that can lead to factory jobs abroad.That is not to say the world is on the side of the United States. American trading partners continue to warn that Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateral moves to impose tariffs and rip up trade agreements could upset the global economic order.

{"Headline": "In Pardoning Saudi Arabia, Trump Gives Guidance to Autocrats", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisTuesday\u2019s message could become something of a blueprint for foreign leaders \u2014 a guide to how they might increase their standing in the eyes of the American president as well as how far they can go in crushing domestic critics without raising American ire.Mr. Trump\u2019s words dealt a blow to Turkey, an American ally and fellow member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that has demanded that Saudi Arabia be punished for killing Mr. Khashoggi last month inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. But Mr. Trump\u2019s message was warmly welcomed by other American allies in the Middle East who value close ties with Washington but want to be left to rule as they wish.\u201cTrump will be viewed as a very courageous president who stuck to his guns and went against the Washington consensus,\u201d said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political scientist from the United Arab Emirates. \u201cBig thank you, Mr. President, from this part of the world. This firm stance will never be forgotten by Riyadh and the other Arab Gulf capitals, and will be reciprocated handsomely on many issues.\u201dTuesday\u2019s statement also echoed the president\u2019s past attempts to draw an equivalence between nations that use murder as a tool of power. During an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News weeks after taking office, Mr. Trump played down President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s history of ordering extrajudicial killings \u2014 comparing it to American history and saying that the United States was better off in the long run being Russia\u2019s friend rather than foe.Similarly, Mr. Trump largely absolved Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for civilian casualties and the humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen by pinning the blame for the war there on Iran. \u201cThe world is a very dangerous place!\u201d the statement began.\u201cThe United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In some parts of the statement, Mr. Trump went further than Saudi officials have in describing the relationship and the killing. Saudi Arabia still has no formal relations with Israel, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s praise of Saudi Arabia as serving Israel\u2019s interests. And Mr. Trump said that Saudi representatives had called Mr. Khashoggi \u201can \u2018enemy of the state\u2019 and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d an accusation that no Saudi official has leveled publicly. Prince Khalid bin Salman, Prince Mohammed\u2019s younger brother and the Saudi ambassador to the United States, even called Mr. Khashoggi a \u201cfriend\u201d after the dissident disappeared but before he was confirmed dead.Hours after the White House released Mr. Trump\u2019s statement, he added during a lengthy news conference on the South Lawn that Saudi Arabia\u2019s stranglehold on global oil prices gave the kingdom enormous leverage over his decisions. Push Prince Mohammed too far, he suggested, and Saudi Arabia could cut oil production \u2014 leading to oil prices of $150 a barrel.The president\u2019s critics on Capitol Hill reacted angrily, saying that Mr. Trump ceded American authority on human rights issues to get more arms deals for defense companies.The Khashoggi statement could further strain American relations with Turkey, a NATO ally, which had already soured over trade issues, Turkey\u2019s detention of an American pastor and the United States\u2019 support for a Kurdish militia in Syria that Turkey considers a terrorist organization.In his statement, Mr. Trump clearly took the prince\u2019s side in that rivalry, risking further isolating Mr. Erdogan.Around the world, reactions largely broke down between those who wish that the United States and its Western allies would stay out of how they run their countries and those who believe that the United States should show moral leadership and stand up for international norms.\u201cIt is a terrible reminder of how precarious the leadership situation in the United States and Saudi Arabia is in terms of adhering to the rule of law and to common decency and ethics,\u201d said Rami G. Khouri, a journalist in residence at the American University of Beirut and a senior fellow at the Kennedy School at Harvard University. \u201cThe message is that we are now in the era of strongmen or mafia rule that is gradually dominating the region.\u201dIndeed, some in the Middle East twisted Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the world is a dangerous place to implicate him in the dangers.\u201cThey lie, they know they are lying, & they know that we know they are lying.\u201dMark Mazzetti reported from Washington, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "In the dark of night on June 5, 2015, convicted murderers David Sweat and Richard Matt clambered out of a manhole and dashed to freedom on a quiet street near Clinton Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Dannemora, N.Y.For the three weeks that followed, America remained captivated by the manhunt and unfolding of the Kafkaesque plot, which included a love triangle and a jailhouse art ring. Yet the news coverage revealed only a sliver of a story that was more elaborate and bizarre than anyone imagined.On Nov. 18, the SHOWTIME Limited Event Series \u201cEscape at Dannemora\u201d will take viewers inside the stranger-than-fiction escape, detailing for the first time how the convicts spent years exploiting prison employees. Many were residents of Dannemora, a town of just a few thousand nestled in the Adirondacks, where the line between freedom and confinement blurred.The New York Times wrote five days after the escape: \u201cThe prison provides jobs; the community provides labor. And that intertwining of work and life has created a tighter-than-normal bond.\u201d These six events demonstrate how Sweat and Matt pitted Dannemora against itself and set in motion one of the nation\u2019s most infamous prison breaks. Indeed, legislators voted in 1844 to build Clinton so inmates could mine iron in the hills nearby. They named the geographically isolated site Dannemora, after a Swedish iron-mining town. Guards had limited options for getting to the jail quickly, in case of emergency, so many moved nearby and formed the village Dannemora.The remote Clinton facility acquired the nickname \u201cLittle Siberia\u201d and would grow to become New York\u2019s largest prison. It \u201cdominated local politics, the economy, the lives and attitudes of the people,\u201d The Times wrote in 1988.Traffic on Dannemora\u2019s streets and visitors to its few stores and eateries ebb and flow with changing shifts at Clinton, which housed 2,653 inmates and employed 1,283 staff members at the time of the escape.Life at Clinton can be generational on both sides of its bars. Multiple members of local families have worked there since its inception, and it\u2019s not uncommon for guards to monitor the sons of former inmates.Luis Garrastegue, who served time in Clinton in the \u201980s and \u201990s, told The Times that he and other inmates discussed escape \u201call the time.\u201d Yet more than a century went by after a prison break in 1912 before any other prisoner would prevail.Matt loved creating art and became one of the prison\u2019s most lauded painters. Sweat admired his work and began studying under his tutelage. He received not only art lessons but also guidance on how to use art to manipulate prison staff. Soon Sweat joined Matt in commissioning portraits of guards and their relatives, receiving favors in return.  About a year later, their budding friendship deepened. In 2011, guards caught Matt smuggling sewing needles from the prison tailor\u2019s shop in the battery compartment of a handheld radio. Guards searched his cell and found a tattoo machine \u2014 a contraband item \u2014 and expelled Matt from the honor block. Feeling the loss of an ally and mentor, Sweat sent Matt tobacco and food. \u201cThat really strengthened our friendship,\u201d Sweat told investigators after the escape. An investigation never determined the author of the letter, nor was Matt\u2019s involvement ever proved, but he was nevertheless expelled from the shop. Six months later, the corrections officer Eugene Palmer intervened on Matt\u2019s behalf, helping him return to the shop. It was one of many times Palmer would bend the rules for Matt.It didn\u2019t take long for the two to cross personal and professional boundaries. Mitchell and Sweat regularly discussed their personal lives, and Mitchell began giving him cookies and hamburgers, a sign of her affection for Sweat and a rule violation. Mitchell ignored repeated requests for tighter supervision, and instead she grew closer to Sweat, often draping her arm over his shoulders, a coworker testified. Over time, their relationship became more intimate, inmates said. At the time, one inmate wrote a letter to Clinton administrators alleging that Mitchell frequently went into a spare-parts room with an inmate for stretches before returning empty-handed. Another prisoner told officials Sweat was the inmate in question. Like the letter extorting the supervisor, the note detailing Mitchell\u2019s dalliances was never formally investigated. After the escape, Sweat denied having sexual relations with Mitchell, but he said she had feelings for him.Because he escorted inmates from the tailor shop and monitored the honor block on weekends, Palmer regularly interacted with Sweat and Matt. The two were \u201cPalmer\u2019s boys,\u201d another inmate testified after the escape.Over several years, Sweat and Matt created about 20 paintings and drawings for Palmer, as a form of prison currency. \u201cWe give it to you exceptionally cheap because we know that at some point we\u2019re going to be in a bind, or we might need help with something,\u201d Sweat told investigators after the escape.That \u201csomething\u201d ranged from smaller favors like smuggling art supplies and distributing confiscated TVs to serious violations. Among the major infractions: letting Matt bypass metal detectors; giving him advance notice of cell checks; concealing his contraband; and giving him access to forbidden areas of the prison, all of which contributed to the escape.  Over time, Matt and Mitchell\u2019s relationship became sexual and more manipulative. Mitchell admitted to engaging in numerous sexual acts with Matt in the spare-parts room and on the shop floor. As the psychosexual relationship deepened, Matt convinced her to smuggle in lighted reading glasses so that he could paint at night. In exchange, Matt created a painting of Mitchell\u2019s son and had Palmer deliver it. Sweat and Matt were \u201cmaster manipulators,\u201d an inmate told investigators.The SHOWTIME Limited Event Series \u201cESCAPE AT DANNEMORA\u201d transports you inside the cutthroat Clinton Correctional Facility, where Matt and Sweat\u2019s calculated actions and relationships led to a daring escape. Mitchell and Palmer eventually risked everything \u2014 including breaking the law \u2014 to help them.Directed by Ben Stiller and starring Benicio Del Toro (Matt), Patricia Arquette (Mitchell), and Paul Dano (Sweat), \u201cESCAPE AT DANNEMORA\u201d starts streaming Sunday, Nov. 18, at 10 p.m. \u2014 only on SHOWTIME.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "The Trump Legions", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite their sudden rise, they didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.\u201cNot at all, no. There is no blame. There is no anything.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ll probably pass, thank you very much.\u201dThese exchanges raise the same two questions that have been posed repeatedly during the Trump presidency:How could this man have been elected to the highest office in the land? And how can Trump not only remain in office but, for the moment at least, appear to stand a reasonable chance of being renominated and even re-elected?To get some answers to these questions, I turned to a 2018 paper by Ronald Inglehart and two fellow political scientists at the University of Michigan, as well as to a new book by Marc Hetherington and Jonathan Weiler, who are political scientists at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.The core of the Inglehart thesis is that scarce resources lead to \u201cmaterialist\u201d values, while abundant resources are conducive to \u201cpost-materialist\u201d values. Inglehart argues that before the Second World War.the unprecedentedly high levels of existential security experienced in developed democracies during the postwar decades were bringing an intergenerational shift from Materialist values that emphasized economic and physical security above all, to Postmaterialist values that gave priority to individual autonomy and self-expression. Rising emphasis on Postmaterialist values eventually brought massive social and political changes, from stronger environmental protection policies and antiwar movements, to higher levels of gender equality in government, business and academic life, greater tolerance of gays, handicapped people and foreigners and the spread of democracy. Postwar prosperity brought these changes with a substantial time lag, since they moved at the pace of intergenerational population replacement.Beginning in the 1970s, Inglehart writes, while economies continued to grow, in high-income countries virtually all of the gains have gone to those at the top. During the past three decades, a large share of the population has experienced declining real income and job security, in context with a massive influx of immigrants and refugees. This has fueled support for xenophobic populist authoritarian movements such as British exit from the European Union, France\u2019s National Front and Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the Republican Party. Cultural backlash explains why given individuals support xenophobic populist authoritarian movements \u2014 but declining existential security explains why support for these movements is greater now than it was thirty years ago.The term \u201cfixed\u201d describes people who are warier of social and cultural change and hence more set in their ways, more suspicious of outsiders, and more comfortable with the familiar and predictable. People we call \u201cfluid,\u201d on the other hand, support changing social and cultural norms, are excited by things that are new and novel, and are open to, and welcoming of, people who look and sound different.Just over four in 10 voters, 42 percent, fall into the fixed worldview category. Just under a third (32 percent) of the electorate falls into the fluid category. The remaining 26 percent are categorized as being in the middle.Those with fixed worldviews voted 3 to 1 for Trump over Hillary Clinton, and those with fluid world views backed Clinton by the same 3-to-1 margin.As recently as 1992, Democratic and Republican voters included roughly equal numbers of those with fluid and fixed worldviews. By 2016, however, as the accompanying chart shows, those with a so-called fluid orientation showed a decisive Democratic partisan preference, while those with a relatively fixed orientation identified overwhelmingly as Republican.Two largely opposite views of society \u2014 one open to change, one resistant \u2014 used to be home to people of both major parties in close to equal proportions. Now they are more lopsidedly partisan.1992IndependentsPercent DemocratsRepublicans\u201cFluid\u201d views:open to diversity,changing norms113652\u201cFixed\u201d views: waryof cultural change,suspicious of outsiders 114049201671821Fluid views166025Fixed views1992Percent who were DemocratsIndependentsRepublicansPeople with \u201cfluid\u201d views:open to diversity,changing norms521136\u201cFixed\u201d views: waryof cultural change,suspicious of outsiders 491140201671821Fluid views251660Fixed viewsBy The New York Times | Source: Marc Hetherington and Jonathan Weiler, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill; because of rounding, not all figures add up to 100 percent.The fixed-fluid divide has strong links to a wide range of views on public policy. \u201cWhen asked whether they thought China was a military threat, 54 percent of the fixed said the threat was \u2018major\u2019 while only 29 percent of the fluid saw it that way,\u201d the authors write.Along similar lines, \u201cfewer than 10 percent of people with a fluid worldview believe in the biblical account of creation\u201d compared with \u201c60 percent of those with a fixed worldview.\u201dFor those with more fixed worldviews, especially, threats to safety and security are omnipresent. If certain aspects of the Bill of Rights \u2014 such as related Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections against unwarranted search and seizure and in favor of due process \u2014 are just tools for terrorists to hide behind, then those who invoke them aren\u2019t just na\u00efve. They\u2019re acting in bad faith in order to hurt America.In other words, for a substantial percentage of voters, Trump\u2019s disregard for constitutional niceties is not a violation of a critically important democratic norm. Instead, from this particular conservative perspective, it is viewed as a safeguard, designed to prevent terrorist attacks and to save American lives.The 2016 election, in the authors\u2019 view, forced voters to choose between two extremes: \u201cTrump embodied the fixed worldview and Hillary Clinton the fluid one.\u201dEven more important, when it comes to taking liberal or conservative positions on issues of race, immigration, Islam and so forth, voters whose worldviews are midway between the fixed and fluid \u201care more like the fixed than they are the fluid.\u201dPut another way, the authors write, while many voters \u201cmay not have relished\u201d Trump\u2019s attacks on racial and ethnic minorities,neither were they completely turned off by his comments. Indeed, they probably found them more palatable than the tendency of liberals to bend over backwards seemingly at every turn to defend groups of people who aren\u2019t exactly angels in the eyes of many Americans.Most voters may say that they prefer politicians who take moderate stands on these divisive issues, the authors argue, but when polarized nomination processes offer voters a choice between two extremes, the American electorate is more wary of the liberal extreme than of the conservative one.\u201cMembers of Trump\u2019s base,\u201d Hetherington and Weiler caution,are much more like the average American than are his staunchest opponents. A lot of Americans are susceptible to the kinds of rhetoric that won Trump the presidency: especially his appeals to people\u2019s innate xenophobia and fears of threats both internal and external. The liberals, people of color, and traditional conservatives who are outraged by Trump\u2019s comportment and who have avowed to oppose his every move \u2014 these are the real outliers.Hetherington and Weiler demonstrate in chart after chart that the views of those in the middle \u2014 comprising 71 percent of the electorate, including the evenly divided, the leaning fluid and the leaning fixed \u2014 view Trump\u2019s hard-line views more favorably than they do the liberal views of fluid voters.Take a look at the accompanying graphic on racial resentment, which, while not exactly surprising, is nonetheless revealing.Americans with \u201cfixed\u201d (and mixed) views of society have higher levels of racial antagonism than those with \u201cfluid\u201d views. The latter became markedly more tolerant in 2016.SCALE OF RACIAL RESENTMENT:MostresentmentFixed worldview(resistant to change)Mixed worldviewNeutralFluid worldview(open to change)20002004200820122016LeastresentmentSCALE OF RACIALRESENTMENT:MostresentmentFixed worldview(resistant to change)Mixed worldviewNeutralFluid worldview(open to change)20002004200820122016LeastresentmentBy The New York Times | Source: Marc Hetherington and Jonathan Weiler, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill\u201cPeople with fluid worldviews are now in a completely different world when it comes to race than other whites,\u201d according to the authors, who repeat: \u201cThey\u2019re the outliers.\u201dOr take the case of immigration:As out of bounds as Trump\u2019s constant pillorying of immigrants, especially the way in which he demonized \u201cMexicans\u201d to create an image of immigrants more generally as dangerous, might have seemed to the fluid, it didn\u2019t turn out to be disqualifying.These divisions have significant implications, especially for those who worry that Trump has undermined important American norms and traditions:This yawning gap between the country\u2019s fluid citizens and the rest of its population is very real, and it has put the country in a serious predicament. Trump\u2019s seemingly antidemocratic propensities have already led to attacks on cornerstones of American democracy, including the free press, the judiciary, and other political institutions. These propensities were obvious when he was a candidate for president, and they have only become more so since his election.Inglehart and his University of Michigan colleagues raise similarly pessimistic conclusions based on a division of the electorate between materialists and postmaterialists \u2014 analogous to the fixed-fluid division. They argue that the postmaterialist left \u2014 those most supportive of the civil, women\u2019s and gay rights revolutions, backers of environmental regulation and proponents of personal autonomy \u2014 have, in many respects, abandoned what had been the working class core of the New Deal era left:Traditionally, the left parties were based on a working class constituency, and advocated redistribution of income. In striking contrast, the postmaterialist left appeals mainly to a middle class constituency and is only faintly interested in the classic program of the left.Of critical importance to the rise of Trump and other right-wing populist leaders abroad, Inglehart writes, is that Postmaterialists are intensely favorable to major political and cultural changes that frequently repel the left\u2019s traditional working class constituency, stimulating the rise of authoritarian populist parties.Inglehart places strong emphasis on economic trends as a major factor in the emergence of authoritarian populism. He and his co-authors argue that as inequality has increased \u2014 and as parties of the left have shifted from economic to postmaterialist agendas \u2014 the populist right has filled the vacuum:For decades, the real income of the developed world\u2019s working class has been declining, while the material basis of what counts as an acceptable standard of living has been rising. They go on: Inequality and insecurity are likely to become even more severe as these societies move into a mature phase of the Knowledge Society \u2014 that of Artificial Intelligence Society.A theme common to both \u201cPrius or Pickup\u201d and of \u201cThe Silent Revolution in Reverse\u201d is that fear \u2014 fear of loss, fear of scarcity, fear of terrorism, fear of cultural challenge, fear of immigrants \u2014 is driving the least secure in society to the right, with significant support from those caught in the middle.And this insecurity is not limited to those with stagnant or diminishing economic resources. It also includes those who are doing well individually but who live in declining areas, those who fear the loss of white hegemony, and those who think they see a morally alien culture taking hold around them \u2014 on television, movies and the internet \u2014 and those who feel that their status is threatened by the rise of racial, ethnic and cultural minorities.On her way to work one morningDown the path alongside the lakeA tenderhearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snakeHis pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew\u201cOh well,\u201d she cried, \u201cI\u2019ll take you in and I\u2019ll take care of you\u201d\u201cTake me in oh tender womanTake me in, for heaven\u2019s sakeTake me in oh tender woman,\u201d sighed the snakeShe wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silkAnd then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milkNow she hurried home from work that night as soon as she arrivedShe found that pretty snake she\u2019d taken in had been revived\u201cTake me in, oh tender womanTake me in, for heaven\u2019s sakeTake me in oh tender woman,\u201d sighed the snakeNow she clutched him to her bosom, \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d she cried\u201cBut if I hadn\u2019t brought you in by now you might have died\u201dNow she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tightBut instead of saying thanks, that snake gave her a vicious bite\u201cTake me in, oh tender womanTake me in, for heaven\u2019s sakeTake me in oh tender woman,\u201d sighed the vicious snake\u201cI saved you,\u201d cried that woman\u201cAnd you\u2019ve bit me even, why?You know your bite is poisonous and now I\u2019m going to die\u201d\u201cOh shut up, silly woman,\u201d said the reptile with a grin\u201cYou knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Hell Happened to Brazil? (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did an up-and-coming economy suffer such a severe slump?Opinion ColumnistI think I can now take some time off from the U.S. political crisis to talk about events elsewhere. So, as the headline says, what the hell happened to Brazil?So what happened? There has been surprisingly little international discussion of the Brazilian experience, even though it was very severe and Brazil is a pretty big economy (G.D.P. at purchasing power parity about 10 times as large as Greece.) Maybe we\u2019re all too distracted by the political crisis in the West \u2014 Trump, Brexit, etc. Anyway, I\u2019ve been trying to put together a story of the Brazilian crisis, well aware that I may well be missing important aspects.Here\u2019s what it looks like to me: Brazil appears to have been hit by a perfect storm of bad luck and bad policy, with three main aspects. First, the global environment deteriorated sharply, with plunging prices for the commodity exports still crucial to the Brazilian economy. Second, domestic private spending also plunged, maybe because of an excessive buildup of debt. Third, policy, instead of fighting the slump, exacerbated it, with fiscal austerity and monetary tightening even as the economy was headed down.Maybe the first thing to say about Brazil\u2019s crisis is what it wasn\u2019t. Over the past few decades those who follow international macroeconomics have grown more or less accustomed to \u201csudden stop\u201d crises in which investors abruptly turn on a country they\u2019ve loved not wisely but too well. That was the story of the Mexican crisis of 1994-5, the Asian crises of 1997-9, and, in important ways, the crisis of southern Europe after 2009. It\u2019s also what we seem to be seeing in Turkey and Argentina now.We know how this story goes: the afflicted country sees its currency depreciate (or, in the case of the euro countries, its interest rates soar). Ordinarily currency depreciation boosts an economy, by making its products more competitive on world markets. But sudden-stop countries have large debts in foreign currency, so the currency depreciation savages balance sheets, causing a severe drop in domestic demand. And policymakers have few good options: raising interest rates to prop up the currency would just hit demand from another direction.But while you might have assumed that Brazil was a similar case \u2014 its 9 percent decline in real G.D.P. per capita is comparable to that of sudden-stop crises of the past \u2014 it turns out that it isn\u2019t. Brazil does not, it turns out, have a lot of debt in foreign currency, and currency effects on balance sheets don\u2019t seem to be an important part of the story. What happened instead?First of all, the global economic environment took a big turn for the worse. Brazil has diversified somewhat into manufactures, but it\u2019s still heavily dependent on commodity exports, whose prices have plunged. As Figure 1 shows, Brazil\u2019s terms of trade \u2014 the ratio of export to import prices \u2014 took a major hit.What really did Brazil\u2019s economy in, however, was the way it responded to these shocks: with fiscal and monetary policy that made things much worse.And on top of that, monetary policy also turned sharply contractionary, with a big rise in interest rates (Figure 3). What was that about?It\u2019s a remarkable and depressing story. And this combination of bad luck and bad policy surely played a role in the political disaster that followed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Depravity of Climate-Change Denial", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRisking civilization for profit, ideology and ego.Opinion ColumnistTrue, the report was released on Black Friday, clearly in the hope that it would get lost in the shuffle. The good news is that the ploy didn\u2019t work.Wait, isn\u2019t depravity too strong a term? Aren\u2019t people allowed to disagree with conventional wisdom, even if that wisdom is supported by overwhelming scientific consensus? Yes, they are \u2014 as long as their arguments are made in good faith. But there are almost no good-faith climate-change deniers. And denying science for profit, political advantage or ego satisfaction is not O.K.; when failure to act on the science may have terrible consequences, denial is, as I said, depraved.But climate denial has sunk deeper political roots than cancer denial ever did. In practice, you can\u2019t be a modern Republican in good standing unless you deny the reality of global warming, assert that it has natural causes or insist that nothing can be done about it without destroying the economy. You also have to either accept or acquiesce in wild claims that the overwhelming evidence for climate change is a hoax, that it has been fabricated by a vast global conspiracy of scientists.Finally, I have the impression that there\u2019s an element of tough-guy posturing involved \u2014 real men don\u2019t use renewable energy, or something.Indeed, it\u2019s depravity, on a scale that makes cancer denial seem trivial. Smoking kills people, and tobacco companies that tried to confuse the public about that reality were being evil. But climate change isn\u2019t just killing people; it may well kill civilization. Trying to confuse the public about that is evil on a whole different level. Don\u2019t some of these people have children?And let\u2019s be clear: While Donald Trump is a prime example of the depravity of climate denial, this is an issue on which his whole party went over to the dark side years ago. Republicans don\u2019t just have bad ideas; at this point, they are, necessarily, bad people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Democratic Senate May Hinge on Arizona and Nevada. Could They Flip?", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 The Southwest has emerged as a key battleground for control of the United States Senate in the final days of the turbulent midterm election, with off-the-charts early voting numbers giving Democrats hope that they can win tight races in Arizona, Nevada and maybe, just maybe, the bank shot of them all, Texas.The mere fact that the Republican Senate candidates haven\u2019t put away the race in those two states has been enough to lead some Democrats to think that Tuesday's election could lead to a very late night, with the East Coast waiting for the results out West to see who controls the Senate. Republicans now have a single-seat majority.Republican officials remain optimistic about keeping control of the Senate, while Democratic officials acknowledge that their best-case scenario for winning the chamber relies on Arizona and Nevada, which would involve a major shift in the political tectonic plates of the West.Democratic victory in those states plus Texas would be enough to win the party control of the Senate, assuming it keeps its losses to North Dakota, a state most strategists believe is likely to fall into Republican hands. (Democrats are in tough races in Indiana and Missouri as well.) A trifecta of wins, or even victories in Nevada and Arizona with a narrow loss in Texas, would have a significant impact on the party\u2019s strategy and message in 2020 and beyond, shifting emphasis away from white Midwestern voters and toward the fast-growing, more diverse West.\u201cIf you look at the electoral map of 2020, you can\u2019t rely on the blue firewall anymore,\u201d said Ruben Gallego, a Democratic congressman who represents a Phoenix-area district. \u201cThe way you put more states on the map is essentially by adding places like Arizona.\u201d\u201cDemocrats really just two weeks ago activated some sort of turnout machine,\u201d said Garrett Archer, a senior analyst at the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office.But what remains to be seen is how Election Day turnout will shake out. Jon Ralston, a prominent political analyst in Nevada, said the Democrats had a roughly 50,000-vote firewall thanks to early voting.\u201cIs that predictive? Sometimes. Most of the time,\u201d Mr. Ralston said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not so large as it is during a presidential year that you can say for sure what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dMr. Heller and Ms. McSally, in turn, have run on the strong economy and an embrace of President Trump, who has held rallies in both states.But the two female Democratic candidates are also running campaigns tailor-made to their states.Ms. Rosen, who was recruited by the former Nevada Senator Harry Reid to run for the seat, has thoroughly aligned herself with the state\u2019s robust party machine and labor groups like the Culinary Workers Union that are helping fuel turnout. Former President Barack Obama campaigned on her behalf in Las Vegas several weeks ago and Senator Kamala Harris of California and the comedian Jimmy Kimmel were with her over the weekend.\u201cArizonans are very independent people. They care less about party titles and labels and ideology and more about who\u2019s going to stand up for them,\u201d Ms. Sinema said in an interview. \u201cThe two political parties have not served their constituents very well.\u201dDemocratic organizers in Nevada are hoping that expansive canvassing efforts, bread-and-butter messaging and antipathy toward Mr. Trump will appeal to their coalition after disastrous turnout in the 2014 midterms. On television in the Las Vegas area, Spanish-language ads run constantly accusing Mr. Heller of turning his back on his constituents.The efforts in Nevada have been bolstered by the state\u2019s labor unions, which have thrown their considerable weight and grass-roots organizing power behind Democrats down the ticket. The Culinary Workers Union, which has 57,000 members, estimates it will have knocked on nearly 400,000 doors by the time polls close Tuesday, according to a spokeswoman. The union, which is majority minority and 54 percent Latino, has registered more than 10,000 people to vote since the 2016 election.\u201cI think they\u2019re in triage mode. We\u2019re in don\u2019t-step-off-the-gas mode,\u201d said Megan Jones, a Democratic political strategist in the state.Mr. Heller\u2019s campaign declined repeatedly to provide The New York Times with a public campaign schedule, and one did not appear to be available online.\u201cWe are confident going into Election Day,\u201d a spokesman, Keith Schipper, said in an emailed statement.Nevada Republicans see turnout in rural areas and absentee ballots as important counterbalances to any \u201cDemocratic firewall.\u201dThe Upshot has partnered with Siena College to poll dozens of the most competitive House and Senate races across the country.\u201cBut it\u2019s going to be a very long night,\u201d he added.In Arizona, Ms. McSally has sought to unify her party around her candidacy after a divisive primary. She has hit every corner of the Republican base, bringing in a swath of surrogates including Mitt Romney, the former presidential nominee turned Utah Senate candidate, and Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son.Standing on a small podium set up in a shopping mall food court in the Republican stronghold of Prescott on Sunday morning, Ms. McSally cast Ms. Sinema as \u201cout of the mainstream and out of touch with Arizona and American values.\u201dMs. Sinema spent part of Sunday hugging her way through the crowd at the St. Mary\u2019s Basilica Dia de los Muertos festival. \u201cYou know what we\u2019re going to do on Tuesday? Win,\u201d she whispered to a young boy, before turning her attention to a family done up in matching skeleton face paint.A day earlier, in Scottsdale, Ariz., a steady stream of voters came to cast ballots at a civic center, walking past shirtless volleyball players and picnicking families enjoying the sunny afternoon.Sandy Kenger, 59, who was dropping off an absentee ballot for her 91-year-old mother, said she\u2019d recently switched her voter registration from independent to Democrat. Both Ms. Kenger and her mother voted for Ms. Sinema.\u201cI\u2019ve lived here since I was 8 and it feels like there\u2019s a political shift,\u201d Ms. Kenger said. \u201cFor me, I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to align with any party\u2019 but then it was like, I will never align with the Republican Party the way it is right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nissan\u2019s Board Removes Carlos Ghosn as Chairman After His Arrest", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe board met for four hours and issued a short statement that sought to telegraph stability even amid the sudden leadership upheaval. It emphasized that its alliance with Renault, Nissan\u2019s largest shareholder, was a priority, and that it would consider having an outside adviser review its corporate governance and its director compensation system.The board said it acted to confirm \u201cthat the longstanding Alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged and that the mission is to minimize the potential impact and confusion on the day-to-day cooperation\u201d with alliance partners.Greg Kelly, a onetime Nissan human resources manager and a member of the company\u2019s board, was also removed as a representative director, along with Mr. Ghosn.In a separate statement, Nissan said it had uncovered misconduct committed by Mr. Ghosn that included underreporting his compensation and using company funds for personal expenses. It added that Mr. Kelly \u201chas been determined to be the mastermind of this matter, together with Carlos Ghosn.\u201dMr. Ghosn was the architect of the alliance with Renault \u2014 Mitsubishi joined in 2016 \u2014 and he is credited with the growth and expansion of what is effectively the world\u2019s largest carmaker. Renault, which owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, has been the dominant partner in the three-company alliance. This week, there have been signs of strain as the saga of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest has played out.Nissan was swift \u2014 followed by Mitsubishi \u2014 to call for the ouster of Mr. Ghosn after the car company this week announced its investigation of financial misconduct. Mitsubishi\u2019s board will meet on Monday.Renault, which employs 47,000 people in France, has been more cautious than its allies.The French carmaker said that Mr. Ghosn remained its chairman and chief executive, even as prosecutors have questioned him in a Tokyo detention center. The company named an interim leadership team to handle his duties as that investigation continues.Bruno LeMaire, the French economy minister, and his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshige Seko, met Thursday in Paris and \u201cexchanged views and shared information about the latest situation,\u201d the French ministry said. They reaffirmed the support of the French and Japanese governments for the Renault-Nissan alliance and said they wanted to maintain it.Neither Mr. Ghosn nor Mr. Kelly has been charged with a crime. Japanese prosecutors boarded Mr. Ghosn\u2019s corporate jet shortly after it landed Monday night at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. That night, both Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly were facing prosecutors asking about Nissan\u2019s internal probe and whether they had hidden a large amount of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation from Japanese authorities.According to the Tokyo prosecutors\u2019 office, Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly underreported Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation from 2011 to 2015 by more than 5 billion yen ($44.5 million) \u2014 understating his true earnings by half \u2014 in filings with a bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance.On Wednesday, a Tokyo court approved the prosecutors\u2019 request to hold Mr. Ghosn at a detention center in east Tokyo for another 10 days. Under Japanese law, prosecutors can detain suspects for up to 22 days without filing charges, and can legally question them without a lawyer present.\u201cDoctoring a securities report is a grave violation,\u201d Mr. Kukimoto said. \u201cIt is also important to maintain corporate governance and that is the point investors should pay attention to.\u201dMr. Kukimoto gave no further details about the investigation, which could go on for weeks, and could expand to include other allegations of wrongdoing so that prosecutors could detain the suspects even longer.Suspects are not permitted to have lawyers present while being questioned by prosecutors in Japan. Prosecutors also have wide latitude to question suspects without charging them.NHK, the public broadcaster, reported that Jo\u00e3o de Mendonca Lima Neto, Brazil\u2019s consul general to Japan, visited Mr. Ghosn in detention on Thursday afternoon. Mr. Ghosn, now a French citizen, was born in Brazil. Mr. Lima told reporters that Mr. Ghosn \u201clooks in good health, and I felt he is treated respectfully.\u201dThe directors\u2019 statement on Thursday indicated that board members had reviewed \u201ca detailed report of the internal investigation\u201d and were even considering their own role in the scandal. The statement offered a carefully-worded promise: They had voted unanimously \u201cto study the creation of a special committee to take advice from an independent third party regarding the governance management system and better governance of director compensation.\u201dThree independent directors were named \u201cto lead on the matter.\u201dCorporate governance experts noted that Nissan\u2019s board had few independent members. Of Nissan\u2019s seven board members other than Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly, three have worked at Nissan for at least four decades and two are longtime veterans of Renault.The remaining board members are a racecar driver and a retired economic and trade ministry bureaucrat.\u201cI have always found it interesting that Nissan\u2019s board has always been stacked with insiders,\u201d said Christina Ahmadjian, a professor of business at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo.\u201cThe auto companies in general have been slower in governance reform,\u201d she said. \u201cNissan was a company run by a non-Japanese so it\u2019s always puzzled me why their governance was not more independent.\u201dAnalysts said that Japan\u2019s corporate culture is still quite hierarchical and that clubby boards often have trouble questioning leaders, especially someone as charismatic and forceful as Mr. Ghosn.\u201cA powerful management should want people who would challenge them,\u201d said Jun Okamura, visiting researcher at Musashino University Institute of Global Affairs. \u201cThe board should not be afraid of these disagreements.\u201dMr. Ghosn won\u2019t yet be gone from Nissan completely. Although he is no longer chairman, under Japanese corporate law, a full shareholder vote still must be held to eliminate him from the board.Makiko Inoue, Liz Alderman and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Robots Ring the Bell", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis clever, eye-catching gesture was aimed to show the world how easy \u2014 and increasingly common \u2014 it is for humans to work alongside robots.\u201cIt was symbolic,\u201d said Travis Briggs, chief executive of Robo Global\u2019s operations in the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re in the first inning of this transition to automation and artificial intelligence, and there is a massive amount of growth potential.\u201dIndeed, robotics and automation are no longer viewed as a passing fad or a cool technology for geeks to gush over. Instead, more companies are turning to artificial intelligence to boost productivity and stay relevant in a fiercely competitive market. Experts call it the fourth industrial revolution and compare today\u2019s robotics in the workplace to the early days of the internet.At a recent conference hosted by Robo Global, experts showed photos and videos of robotic prototypes of all shapes and sizes: Robots that climb stairs and around corners to find an object and A.I.-laced pills that can retrieve foreign objects from a person\u2019s stomach. They even included a video of a woman, with electrodes attached to her head, using thoughts to tell a robot where to place an object.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see robots and automated systems penetrate every sector of the economy,\u201d said Jeremie Capron, director of research at Robo Global. \u201cThe pace of change is really accelerating, so, yes, it\u2019s a revolution.\u201dRobo Global, which researches, advises and invests in robotics, automation and A.I. companies, knows all about the sector\u2019s growth. Since setting up its Robo Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF (Robo), which tracks more than 80 companies, the corporation reports that its assets have soared to $3.46 billion from $43 million its first year.\u201c\u2018Terminator\u2019 and those kinds of images have a significant impact on the way people perceive technology,\u201d said Raffaello D\u2019Andrea, professor of dynamic systems and control at ETH Zurich University, and a co-founder of Kiva Systems, a robotics company that was sold to Amazon.The retail giant Amazon was one of the earliest to embrace this technology, with its $775 million acquisition of Kiva \u2014 now called Amazon Robotics \u2014 in 2012. Amazon had been under pressure to deliver orders to its Amazon Prime customers within the promised 48-hour window without losing money, Mr. Capron said. Amazon immediately deployed 3,000 robots into its fulfillment centers.\u201cWe need advanced technology and automation to meet customer demand \u2014 it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics.The robots wander up and down the aisles, bringing shelves of items directly to associates to package and ship, significantly slashing costs and shortening the time to process and deliver an order. Today, Amazon has more than 100,000 robots navigating 26 fulfillment centers around the world.\u201cAmazon delivered more than five billion items under two business days in 2017 to their Prime program members, based on our research, including discussions with Amazon Robotics,\u201d Mr. Capron said. All of this bolstered customer loyalty and demand, resulting in more orders, sales revenue and jobs.Mr. Brady said it was a myth that automation always destroys jobs.\u201cSince the acquisition of Kiva, we\u2019ve added 300,000 full-time jobs globally,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year alone, we added 130,000.\u201dAll Axls Machining, a business in Dallas, was struggling to find enough workers to operate its metal-fabrication equipment and to sand and inspect metal parts manually for the medical, aerospace, defense and industrial sectors.Without workers to run the machines and the assembly lines, production lagged. \u201cAfter 5 p.m., we\u2019d have a skeleton shift, with only half the machines running,\u201d said Gary Kuzmin, the company\u2019s owner. \u201cIt was costing me orders that I couldn\u2019t get to my customers on time.\u201dBut then Mr. Kuzmin discovered Universal Robots, which makes collaborative robots, or cobots, which are small, affordable and designed to operate safely side by side with workers. They are easy to program to do multiple tasks and allow the company to crank out parts around the clock.After introducing the robots, one job that was expected to take six months to complete was finished in less than half that time, Mr. Kuzmin said. \u201cWe saw a 60 percent profit increase on that job alone.\u201dMr. Kuzmin said the increased productivity allowed him to hire \u2014 rather than fire \u2014 more workers, boosting his work force to 22 from 16.\u201cWe had a lot of people who would come in, work for maybe a week, and then leave because they didn\u2019t like the repetitive work environment,\u201d said Tim Mead, operations manager at Zippertubing. It brought in Universal Robots\u2019 cobots and immediately saw productivity surge.\u201cIt used to take three people to do all of the operations that the robot now does,\u201d Mr. Mead saidThe robots have also increased the company\u2019s accuracy in spotting faulty manufactured parts. When operators look at thousands of parts a day, they sometimes become \u201csnow-blind\u201d to defects, Mr. Mead said. But that never happens to robots.In certain sectors \u2014 consumer electronics, automobile manufacturing and logistics \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re moving into an era where automation has really gone from a competitive advantage right now to absolutely necessary,\u201d Mr. Briggs said. \u201cAutomate or fail.\u201dAll of this has stoked fears, especially among Americans, that robots, automation and A.I. will throw millions of people onto the unemployment line.Some industry experts play down these concerns, saying that in any industrial revolution, jobs are lost and new ones created.\u201cFifty years ago, or even 15 years ago, who knew what an app developer was, or the amount of programming that we\u2019d need,\u201d Mr. Briggs said.Over the next decade, the biggest job losses will most likely affect low-skilled workers performing repetitive tasks, like machine operators, assembly line workers, dishwashers, drivers and preparers of fast food. Certain white-collar areas, like data entry, accounting and payroll, will suffer as well.Demand, however, will probably surge for data analysts, software developers, web designers, IT experts, e-commerce specialists, health care providers, entrepreneurs and social media experts, according to the World Economic Forum report. Sectors that involve human skills, like sales, marketing, customer service and even art and entertainment, will also be in high demand, the report said.While new jobs will offset losses, retraining and education will be critical. As many as 375 million workers globally will need to change job categories and learn new skills to survive the transition, according to the McKinsey Global Institute report.\u201cThe days are gone where somebody learns to do a task, and that\u2019s what they do for the rest of their life,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Andrea said.How quickly and how deeply A.I. and robotics penetrate the job market will ultimately dictate how rapidly people need to be retrained.\u201cHistory tells me that every prior technological revolution has resulted in more wealth and more jobs,\u201d Mr. Capron said. \u201cSo it would have to be very different this time around for history not to repeat itself.\u201dBut A.I. has its critics. The visionary billionaire Elon Musk has described it as humanity\u2019s \u201cbiggest existential threat,\u201d while the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who died this year, predicted that \u201cthe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\u201d Mr. Musk is particularly concerned about the use of A.I. to develop autonomous lethal weapons that could select targets without human intervention \u2014 a development with potentially apocalyptic repercussions.Mr. D\u2019Andrea said A.I. was a long way off from being a real threat. He does believe, however, that regulations will be needed to safeguard its use in autonomous weapons.Mr. Briggs was less concerned. \u201cI think Elon Musk is being overly dramatic,\u201d he said, noting that he did not believe that A.I. should be regulated. \u201cI think regulation is a slippery slope \u2014 it certainly stifles creativity.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the company that owns a robot that rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange. It is owned by Universal Robots, not by Robo Global.In an earlier version of this article, the second reference to a professor at ETH Zurich University and co-founder of Kiva Systems, a robotics company, was incorrect. It was Mr. D\u2019Andrea, not Mr. Raffaella.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stay or Go? For This Californian, That\u2019s an Easy Choice", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "The long-fading myth of California as Eden has been scorched but John Branch, a California-based correspondent, remains a defender of his native state.Supported byNOVATO, Calif. \u2014 It was 90 degrees that afternoon, but at a rest stop along Interstate 5 in the mountains of Northern California, it snowed flakes of ash on my pickup. The wildfire raging nearby was about as bad as anyone could imagine, but our imaginations hadn\u2019t reached November yet.This was August, long before we lost Paradise and much of Malibu, before the fiery hellscapes at opposite ends of a state under siege lit up screens around the world. This was before the long-fading myth of California as Eden was scorched into some sort of Mad Max dystopia, before teams of forensic examiners were sent to sift through the ashes to find the dozens, maybe hundreds, of missing dead.It was when there was still hope that the latest big fire would be the last one to worry about for a while.The hot, smoky summer air smelled like campfire. A worried asthmatic woman headed to San Diego asked me when it would end.Other side of Redding, I said. I wasn\u2019t sure. Maybe Sacramento. Just keep going.The Carr Fire burned for six weeks and scorched about 230,000 acres \u2014 a bigger area than the five boroughs of New York City combined. It destroyed about 1,600 buildings and killed at least three people. Its smoke carried halfway across the country, proving that California\u2019s influence spreads in peculiar ways.I followed the woman south through the mountains and soon spotted something moving under a long bridge, below the choking haze. Down on Lake Shasta, there were boaters and water skiers.I laughed. That\u2019s so California, I thought. Heavenly and hellish, sometimes simultaneously.It\u2019s after Election Day now. The Camp Fire in Butte County is now California\u2019s deadliest ever, and the Woolsey Fire in and around Malibu chased out a quarter-million evacuees in its first days.I live in the Bay Area, nowhere near the fires but persistently reminded of them. My neighborhood slinks through the rugged hills of dry grass and trees, terrain not unlike what we\u2019ve seen burning on television. It hasn\u2019t rained in six weeks; before that, not since spring. The toxic drift from the Camp Fire has made our air so murky that schools closed. Ash falls again on my truck, parked in the driveway.Twitter delivered the first message from President Trump about the fires.\u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\u201d Trump wrote, finding little use for empathy or truth. \u201cBillions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201dIt was the latest in a series of perplexing verbal missives aimed at California. Californians know all about outsider ambivalence toward the Golden State. It has been going on for generations. Love it or hate it.Now those feelings have spread wide and deep into the national political discourse. All across the country, California represents a foil for people who worry that it foreshadows the future of the country, as it always has.\u201cAre we going to turn into California?\u201d one candidate for governor in Nevada said in October, a derisive echo of campaign talk across the West.California, we were told, was an overpriced and overregulated land of marauding immigrants and straw-less restaurants. And now, post-election, look at it \u2014 burning at both ends, the recent setting of another unexplained mass shooting, a place with both abject poverty and astronomical housing costs, everyone waiting for the big earthquake.Funny, I think, every time I hear California insulted. I choose to live here. There is no other place I\u2019d rather raise my children. I\u2019m always proud to say I\u2019m from California, a beautiful and messy place unlike any other, in a moment unlike any other.One in eight Americans live here. If California were a country, it would represent the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy. It is the most diverse state in the country, by measures of geography, economy, culture and demographics.Always a trendsetter, California today is the United States of tomorrow. That scares plenty of people. It relieves others. California has a unique combination of influence and ambition, an assuredness that rubs some people the wrong way, and now it feels ready to use its power to blunt the forces from the White House, 3,000 miles away.California already has sued the Trump administration 44 times, on issues involving immigration status, health care, the border wall and fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles. The administration has sued California three times, including over net neutrality and sanctuary status.Pick a side: California represents a threat; California represents an ideal. It is the enemy or the answer, a roadblock or the resistance.It\u2019s much more complex for the 40 million of us who live here. It is more paradox than paradise. Life would be simpler someplace else, if I thought that was the point. I bemoan the ever-worsening traffic. I\u2019m aghast at the levels of homelessness. I\u2019m disappointed in the public schools.I bought my house six years ago, and there is no chance I could afford it at its supposed value today. I worry that I\u2019m raising children in a place they will never afford for themselves. I hope they don\u2019t have to leave to find the life they want.Most of us are digging in. It\u2019s exciting to be on the front lines to many of this country\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 climate change and energy, economic disparity and infrastructure, race and immigration among them.Ingrained with a wanderlust that I try to foist on my children, I probably see more of California than most. If I plotted my in-state movements over the last three months on a California map, it would look like someone confused, looking for an exit, circling like a caged cat.On one Saturday afternoon, I crossed the northern border from Oregon and drove more than 1,000 miles, all in California, by Sunday evening. (It\u2019s a long story.) I have made trips to Crescent City on the northern coast and San Diego on the southern one. I have been to Sacramento, Fresno, Bakersfield and Tehachapi, all on separate trips. I have been to two national parks (Yosemite and Redwoods), 500 miles apart.Here might be the most California sentence of all: The only reason we canceled our weekend camping reservations at Lassen Volcanic National Park in October was that my son had an appointment at the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the earliest it could be rescheduled was December.All those excursions came as California-bashing boiled over. It changed my perspective as I looked around. What will California represent once the smoke clears?The grapes were plump on the vine, and there was little sign of the swath of death and destruction that began here a year ago, off tiny Bennett Lane, just a few miles north of Calistoga in the Napa Valley. Just a few charred trees on a hillside and more on the hill after that.They named it the Tubbs Fire, because it was initially thought to have started off Tubbs Lane, not nearby Bennett Lane. It was, at the time, the most destructive fire in California\u2019s history. Like a nightmare, it started after dark and did most of its damage by dawn. It killed 22 people and destroyed about 4,000 homes, fueled by 80-mile-an-hour gusts and the element of surprise.The inferno mowed through miles of rugged, dark mountains and through a seemingly random sample of golf-course homes of the Fountaingrove area. A year later, most of the lots now are clear and dormant. Many are for sale \u2014 this scorched one for $270,000, that one for $395,000 \u2014 their former occupants presumably paid off by insurance or chased out by the ghosts. The course is still green, though.The fire reached Santa Rosa in just a few overnight hours. It burned down a Hilton, just missed a hospital, jumped the freeway and took out a Kmart and a mobile-home park. And it roared through 1,300 homes of Coffey Park, a compact and quiet little city neighborhood, far from the hills.Now the neighborhood is a hive of construction, a resurrection of cut lumber and framed walls amid a few scorched tree trunks. The clear air is punctuated from dawn to dusk by saws and nail guns, Mexican music and chatter in Spanish. Trucks \u2014 electricians, plumbers, window installers, taco sellers \u2014 clog the streets.Fire represents both destruction and restoration. California knows the cycle.I was reminded of that again this month, when someone gunned down 12 people at a bar in Thousand Oaks. My family has been to Thousand Oaks too many times to count, because my best friend used to live there. The night after the shooting, he was awakened in Florida by text messages telling him to evacuate because of a rapidly growing blaze soon to be known as the Woolsey Fire. It\u2019s sad and strange to think that if the fire had come a couple of days earlier, nobody would have been at the bar to be shot.The day I returned from covering the Las Vegas shooting, my home phone rang around midnight \u2014 late enough that you knew there was no good news on the other end.It was my father-in-law. He and his wife, both in their 80s, lived in a seniors-only neighborhood near Santa Rosa and were awakened by a ferocious wind rattling the windows. Fearing shattered glass, they rushed to the spare bedroom. It glowed orange from the light outside.A nearby ridge was aflame. Neighbors gathered in the street, in the howling wind and smoke, trying to make sense of it. There had been no fires when they went to bed. The blazes not only seem to be getting bigger, but faster.My in-laws called to say that they were taking their dog and heading to the safety of a grocery store parking lot a few miles away. Ninety minutes later, they called again. At 3-something in the morning, they showed up at our door, certain that they would never see their home again.The Camp Fire, which has killed dozens, quickly devastated the town of Paradise within hours of starting.For 10 days, they stayed at our house as fires burned in uncontrolled blotches around theirs.Their house survived. The hills are still scarred black. They recently couldn\u2019t see the hills at all, because thick smoke from the faraway Camp Fire had settled into the valley.My wife and I hiked in those burned hills a few weeks ago. The coastal redwoods deep in the shady canyons were among the few trees to survive. They almost always do. Redwoods are naturally resistant to fire, which partly explains how some have lived 2,000 years and grown nearly 400 feet tall. It\u2019s the state tree, which feels appropriate.It rained at my house in early October, for the first time since May, and the brown hills where I run in my free time soon flashed a hint of undergrowth. In California, the grass is greenest in winter. I\u2019ve always found it a fitting metaphor, now more than ever.Advertisement"}

Now it\u2019s the West that\u2019s taking notes.Milton Friedman had a message for China: To get rich, it must be free.It was 1988. The Soviet Union was tottering. Across Eastern Europe, the communist order was on the verge of collapsing. Trying to avoid its own demise, the Chinese Communist Party had taken small steps toward unshackling its economy from the state. But prices for food and other necessities were surging as a result, and the party\u2019s reformers wanted advice.\u201cI hope the Chinese people can become strong and prosperous,\u201d he told Mr. Zhao. \u201cI wish to see China\u2019s reform succeed so that she can contribute more to the progress of mankind.\u201dChina made a different choice. Mr. Zhao and other reformists were ousted a year later. Tanks were sent to Tiananmen Square to teach the people a bloody lesson about challenging the party\u2019s power.China would instead reform on its terms. It would free entrepreneurs to seek their fortunes, while still keeping a tight grip on essential economic levers. It would set national goals, then persuade or force people and companies to meet them. It would open up to the world at its own pace \u2014 and the Communist Party would run the show.How China became a superpowerTo Mr. Friedman and other top economists, the strategy should have failed. Centrally planned economies breed waste and corruption. Big government ambitions cripple future generations with debt. Price controls lead to hunger and want. Official prognosticators invariably blow it. The Soviet Union proved that.Those experts were wrong. China prospered.China\u2019s economy now stands as an alternate narrative to Western ideals. And yet the decisions the Communist Party made to secure its economic future have led Beijing to its biggest test since Tiananmen Square.Milton Friedman might have been right after all.Or China may still find its way.By 1990, foreign investors were fleeing and some Communist Party cadres were again suppressing entrepreneurs. Growth had fallen to one-third that of the boom years. Deng feared that, without a spark, the Communist Party would lose its control over China. Reform, he decided, had to be on the agenda again.Finding the right balance would prove the economic foundation of modern China. Loosen the grip too much, and the Communist Party begins to face a real threat to its hold on power. Tighten too much, and it threatens to squelch the country\u2019s growth.\u201cIf China does not practice socialism, does not carry on with \u2018reform and opening\u2019 and economic development, does not improve the people\u2019s standard of living, then no matter what direction we go,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be a dead end.\u201dHe championed the lessons of people in Shenzhen like Shao Chunyou. Mr. Shao, now a successful entrepreneur who owns an electronics manufacturing company, was one of the hundreds of millions of Chinese who struck a silent pact with his country to pursue riches while staying out of the state\u2019s business.The crackdown in Tiananmen Square was far from Mr. Shao\u2019s mind when he arrived that summer in Shenzhen. A penniless carpenter from a city in China\u2019s interior, he struggled to find work among the electronics factories and garment mills. He wasn\u2019t allowed to live in Shenzhen without a government permit, so when the police came looking for illegal workers he would hide in a cemetery. Once, he lived off discounted mooncakes after China\u2019s Mid-Autumn festival holiday.\u201cI still can\u2019t bear looking at mooncakes,\u201d he said.Three years later, in 1992, Mr. Shao was earning more money at a factory making hardware parts for electronics than he had ever made before. Such successes would cement the country\u2019s path.The approach worried free-market economists. While they widely acknowledged that China couldn\u2019t change overnight, they argued that state control hobbled the economy by pouring money into wasteful targets.Mr. Friedman was shocked at the scale of a government-led project to build what was in effect a new city, Pudong, across the Huangpu River from Shanghai. \u201cA Potemkin village built for a reigning emperor,\u201d Mr. Friedman wrote, predicting disaster.A decade later, Pudong was one of Asia\u2019s hottest real estate markets.In the bargain, China got what it wanted, paving the way for a global trading colossus.\u201cWhen China joined the W.T.O., I was so excited that I cried,\u201d said Zhu Dingding, the general manager of Hangzhou Jinyuan, which makes baby shoes and other crafts.By 2011, orders were 10 times what they had been in 2001. He made enough money to buy a car, a Volkswagen. Three apartments followed, all purchased without mortgages.\u201cThe W.T.O. pushed my business to develop rapidly,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. \u201cWithout the W.T.O., it would be impossible.\u201dBut China didn\u2019t change that much.As the global financial system tottered in 2008, an influential Chinese leader chastised Henry M. Paulson, then the United States Treasury secretary and a former Goldman Sachs executive.The leader, Wang Qishan, was among the first Chinese officials to soak in the lessons of the free market evangelists. But he told Mr. Paulson that China had perhaps listened to the West long enough.Nobody was unscathed by the global financial crisis. Washington bailed out Wall Street and Detroit, then its efforts slowed to a crawl as a new president, Barack Obama, clashed with Congress over the size of a stimulus package. Europe also fell into squabbling as individual countries fell into crisis, creating cracks in the union.What followed was perhaps the greatest show of financial firepower the world has ever seen \u2014 and it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without government controls that would have made Milton Friedman blanch.China also kept money from leaving the country. It put limits on how much people could move overseas and kept a tight grip on the value of its currency, the renminbi.The contrast between China and the rest of the world was stark. Beijing moved swiftly \u2014 and its growth was the rare bright spot in the global economy. Washington didn\u2019t complete a $787 billion stimulus package until the next year, filled with political compromises. The American economy couldn\u2019t avoid recession.More than a quarter-century after Deng Xiaoping used his southern tour to get Chinese reform back on track, Xi Jinping followed on a mission of his own.\u201cChina\u2019s reform and opening up will never stop,\u201d Mr. Xi told a group at an exhibition center celebrating decades of reform. \u201cThe next 40 years of China will bring new achievements that will make the world take notice.\u201dSo far, Mr. Xi\u2019s rhetoric hasn\u2019t matched reality. While Deng dragged the Chinese economy further out of the clutches of state control, Mr. Xi has been pulling it back.But the pendulum has markedly swung toward the state at a time when the cumulative weight of four decades of choices has left the Chinese economy vulnerable. Growth is slowing \u2014 and juicing it won\u2019t be as easy.The lending-and-spending binge that powered its economy, and arguably the world\u2019s, after the financial crisis has saddled the country with a huge debt load. While calculating what China owes is difficult since much is off the books, debt could total $41 trillion \u2014 or three years\u2019 worth of the country\u2019s economic output. That\u2019s roughly equal to developed countries like the United States, Britain and Japan. But whereas their debt built up over decades, China\u2019s accumulated in nine years.Moving the needle has become harder. China\u2019s economy is roughly three times the size it was in 2008. Those airport and highway projects it still uses to spur growth are expensive and deliver less economic bang.China may also have become complacent. Its four decades of success under the China model may have persuaded the country\u2019s leaders that the Communist Party, rather than the country\u2019s entrepreneurs, drove its success, and it has little reason to let go.\u201cThe China model concept misleads China,\u201d said Zhang Weiying, a prominent pro-market economist, \u201cso we\u2019re going backward.\u201dChina, of course, has changed course in the past. Pragmatism has often won out.China\u2019s leaders received a subtle reminder of that in September \u2014 from a son of Deng, the architect of reform. In a speech to top leaders, Deng Pufang praised their work but cautioned that once China\u2019s opening had begun, it could never go back.\u201cReform and opening up is the liberation of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt encourages the recognition of people\u2019s desire and pursuit of a happy life, it stimulates the wisdom and strength of the masses, and it provides opportunities and platforms for every ordinary person to improve their lives and change their destiny.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Design: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaMore China RulesDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $2 Billion Question: Did New York and Virginia Overpay for Amazon?", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon built a retail empire on low prices and free shipping. But for taxpayers, its new headquarters didn\u2019t come cheap.New York and Virginia collectively offered more than $2 billion in tax credits, rebates and other incentives to attract the company. That figure doesn\u2019t include what could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure spending, worker training and other government assistance.Economists have long criticized tax incentives as inefficient and unnecessary, arguing that they pit cities or states against each other and leave less money for education and public works that ultimately do more to lift local economies and improve livelihoods. Research has shown that incentives play at most a small role in corporate decisions, meaning governments often end up paying businesses to do what they would have done anyway.Indeed, in selecting New York and Virginia for its new locations, Amazon turned down seemingly richer offers just next door. Maryland and New Jersey each offered multibillion-dollar incentive packages that dwarfed the ones Amazon accepted.\u201cAn additional $7.5 billion in subsidies wasn\u2019t enough to get Amazon to move across the river,\u201d said Michael Farren, an economist at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank, referring to the difference between Maryland\u2019s offer of $8.5 billion and Virginia\u2019s of less than $1 billion. \u201cThat just says that subsidies were never what mattered in the first place.\u201d[Do you live or work near Amazon\u2019s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]New York\u2019s incentive package is much larger than Virginia\u2019s. Amazon promised to create about 25,000 jobs at each location, but New York offered twice as much as Virginia did.\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing we said,\u201d said Maria Doulis, vice president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, which has offices in New York City and Albany. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Wait, you\u2019re splitting this down the middle \u2014 why does it look like we\u2019re paying so much?\u2019 \u201dVirginia promised Amazon an incentive package worth $573 million, including $550 million in cash grants \u2014 $22,000 per job. The state also pledged $250 million to help Virginia Tech build a campus in Alexandria, near the Amazon site in Arlington, offering degrees in computer science and software engineering. (Virginia, too, offered to help the company get a helipad.)On a per-job basis, New York\u2019s offer to Amazon is about typical for the state but well above the national average for such deals, said Timothy J. Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has studied tax incentives.\u201cNew York\u2019s following its usual practices,\u201d Mr. Bartik said. \u201cIt hands out a lot of hefty incentives, a lot of long-term incentives.\u201dGov. Andrew Cuomo defended the deal, arguing that New York has to offer incentives because of its comparatively high taxes. At 6.5 percent, New York\u2019s corporate income-tax rate is only modestly higher than Virginia\u2019s 6 percent, according to the Tax Foundation. But other business and individual taxes are higher in New York.\u201cIt\u2019s not a level playing field to begin with,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cAll things being equal, if we do nothing, they\u2019re going to Texas.\u201dNew York City did not offer any special tax breaks to Amazon as part of the deal. But the company will be able to take advantage of existing city tax credits, including a program designed to encourage companies to create jobs outside the busiest parts of Manhattan. The program, open to all companies, could be worth as much as $900 million to Amazon over 12 years, on top of the state incentives.Ms. Doulis, of the Citizens Budget Commission, said that credit and similar ones might have outlived their usefulness. In the 1980s and \u201990s, she said, companies were taking a risk by expanding in Queens or Brooklyn, and tax breaks provided an important inducement. But today, Long Island City is a rapidly developing neighborhood full of hip bars and luxury apartment complexes.\u201cThat neighborhood was very different 25 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very different world now.\u201dStill, Ms. Doulis said Amazon\u2019s arrival was a major coup for the city, which has been trying to establish itself as a tech hub to rival Boston, Seattle and even Silicon Valley. Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday said Amazon\u2019s decision was a vindication of that strategy, which the mayor said would benefit all New Yorkers.Tom Stringer, who advises companies on site-selection decisions for the consulting firm BDO, said high-cost places like New York and Virginia needed to offer incentives to compete with cheaper areas. And he said the deals would pay off in the long run in jobs and tax revenues.\u201cIncentives are not subsidies,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cThey are investments.\u201dThat could be a particularly bitter pill for local retailers, many already struggling to compete with Amazon, said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy group long critical of Amazon.\u201cIf you\u2019re a local retailer or small manufacturer or artist or writer or publisher, you\u2019re watching as your city and state hands your tax dollars to your most ferocious antagonist,\u201d she said.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who will represent parts of Queens in the House of Representatives starting in January, was one of several elected officials to criticize the deal. In a series of posts on Twitter, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said a company of Amazon\u2019s size shouldn\u2019t \u201creceive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment.\u201dBut even many critics of tax incentives said the packages offered to Amazon were less egregious than some past examples. The New York and Virginia tax credits are tied to the number of jobs the company actually creates.On a per-job basis, the packages offered to Amazon are smaller than some previous megadeals. For example, Wisconsin last year offered the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn $3 billion in incentives for a project meant to employ 13,000 workers, at wages far lower than those promised by Amazon. The Foxconn deal, which has since grown even more expensive, has produced a public backlash in Wisconsin.There are signs that Amazon may have been concerned about a similar reaction. The company didn\u2019t choose the biggest incentive packages on offer, and in an unusual move, it included details of the tax breaks in its news release. And Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, noted that Amazon conducted the final stages of its search behind closed doors after a much more public search earlier in the process.\u201cThey would have had another whole wave of blowback if they\u2019d had another hunger games,\u201d Mr. LeRoy said.J.

{"Headline": "Trump Could Seek a China Trade Truce at G-20, Despite Tough Talk", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is projecting a steely facade as he prepares for a critical meeting on trade this weekend with President Xi Jinping of China. But behind his tough talk and threats of higher tariffs is a creeping anxiety about the costs of a prolonged trade war on the financial markets and the broader economy.That could set the stage for a truce between the United States and China, several American officials said, in the form of an agreement that would delay new tariffs for several months while the world\u2019s two largest economies try to work out the issues dividing them.Such an outcome is not certain. Administration officials have expressed deep disappointment with China\u2019s response to Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure so far, characterizing it as a list of proposals, transmitted in Chinese, which they say would do little to curb China\u2019s theft of American technology or address its other predatory trade practices.But Mr. Trump has signaled a new willingness to make a deal with Mr. Xi, a leader he has treated solicitously and will meet over dinner on Saturday in Buenos Aires, after a summit meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 industrialized nations.\u201cThere\u2019s a good possibility that we can make a deal, and he is open to it,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said Tuesday. But if the meeting failed to produce a breakthrough, he said, Mr. Trump was \u201cperfectly happy to stand on his tariff policies.\u201dAt the moment, the administration plans to raise existing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 25 percent from 10 percent, on Jan. 1. Mr. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $267 billion of Chinese goods \u2014 a step many fear would plunge the two giants into a full-fledged economic Cold War.If the two leaders agree to talks, however, officials said Mr. Trump would most likely postpone the increase to 25 percent and hold off on any new tariffs. That would be similar to a deal he struck last July with the European Union, in which he agreed to delay auto tariffs in return for a pledge by Europe to buy American soybeans and natural gas.The divisions inside the West Wing over trade remain fierce, as they have since the beginning of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, and the contest for Mr. Trump\u2019s ear will most likely continue until the moment he sits down with Mr. Xi in Argentina.More mainstream advisers like Mr. Kudlow and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, are urging him to compromise, while hard-liners like Peter Navarro, the director of the White House trade office, argue that he should keep ramping up the pressure on China until it folds.Mr. Navarro, a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s, had initially been excluded from the trip to Argentina, which led some to conclude that the hard-liners had lost ground. Mr. Trump also sided against Mr. Navarro after Mr. Kudlow took a shot at him on television. But the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has since authorized Mr. Navarro\u2019s travel, raising the prospect that he will be on hand to encourage Mr. Trump to play hardball.For Mr. Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer who has sued China for flooding the American market with cheap steel, the negotiations present an opportunity to drive a hard bargain.But he also sees the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi as a potential danger, especially if Mr. Trump opts for a quick handshake deal that would delay or scrap the new tariffs in hopes of buoying jittery markets, according to people familiar with his thinking.Mr. Lighthizer also faces a challenge from Mr. Mnuchin, who has made it clear that he views himself as the nation\u2019s chief negotiator, according to administration officials. Mr. Navarro, people who know him say, regards Mr. Mnuchin as one of the circle of \u201cglobalists\u201d pressuring Mr. Trump to abandon his promise to crack down on China.Another American official said the major internal debate now was over the scope of a compromise Mr. Trump could offer Mr. Xi: postponing the increase in tariffs to 25 percent, plus the $267 billion in new tariffs \u2014 or only the new tariffs.That underscores how much Mr. Trump\u2019s position has changed from a few months ago, when he announced sweeping tariffs on China, asserted the Chinese were not yet ready to negotiate an agreement and declared that trade wars were \u201ceasy to win.\u201d Only two weeks ago, disagreements between China and the United States over trade scuttled attempts to produce a joint communiqu\u00e9 after an Asian economic meeting.Mr. Trump is acutely aware of the threat an economic downturn poses to the foundation of his presidency. That has made him receptive to the counsel of moderates like Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Kudlow, as well as outsiders like the Wall Street financier Stephen A. Schwarzman who have been warning him he will be blamed for job losses, market losses and other economic damage from a prolonged trade war with China.On Tuesday, Mr. Kudlow deflected questions about the depressing effect of trade tensions on the markets. He argued that the tariffs affected only a fraction of the American economy, which is still showing robust growth in jobs and incomes. And he said the negative effect had been much greater in China.\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that there aren\u2019t winners and losers in that game,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cBut on the other hand, I think we are in far better shape to weather this than the Chinese are.\u201dIn China, where growth is slowing and the stock market has swooned, the government is mulling a broad cut in import tariffs that would lower trade barriers for companies around the world, including those in the United States, people briefed on Beijing\u2019s thinking said.But the American demands could be a major sticking point. Chinese leaders are reluctant to accept any permanent American tariffs on Chinese goods, fearing that such a compromise would be seen at home as a sign of weakness.Until now, the two sides have been mostly talking past each other. Chinese officials have expressed puzzlement to visiting Americans about why the administration has not responded to the 142-point list of proposals they sent to the United States. Mr. Kudlow said that once his colleagues translated it into English, they discovered there was little new there.\u201cWe can\u2019t find much change in their approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the timetable? What\u2019s the enforcement mechanism?\u201dFor all the turbulence, Mr. Lighthizer is resolved to make the best of the situation, according to people who have spoken to him in recent days. That is in part because Mr. Trump is still pleased he was able to secure a new North American Free Trade Agreement deal before the summit meeting.But even that deal has hit a pothole. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada remains in a standoff with Mr. Trump over Canada\u2019s demand that the United States remove steel and aluminum tariffs as part of the new treaty.Mr. Trudeau has yet to confirm to American officials that he will attend the ceremonial signing of the agreement in Buenos Aires with Mr. Trump and Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the outgoing president of Mexico. Mr. Trudeau could end up delegating that task to a subordinate, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, a snub that could aggravate tensions with Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump will also have to mollify another bruised ally, Britain, after he told reporters on Monday that the departure agreement Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the European Union might bar Britain from trading with the United States. Mr. Kudlow said Mr. Trump was referring to a provision in the deal that he said could prohibit Britain from negotiating a separate free-trade agreement with the United States.British officials said there was nothing in the agreement that prohibits Britain from negotiating a bilateral trade deal with the United States \u2014 or anybody else. They expressed bafflement that Mr. Trump, an avowed supporter of Brexit, would seek to sabotage the most realistic path of negotiating Britain\u2019s departure.Mr. Trump\u2019s outburst on Brexit underscored his unpredictability \u2014 the same quality he will take into his meeting with Mr. Xi. Chinese and American officials both recognize the value he places on grand bargains, reached after direct leader-to-leader negotiations.Aside from the dinner, Mr. Kudlow said there were no plans for any other meetings between Chinese and American officials. But Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have tried, in different ways, to prepare the ground for the meeting with Mr. Xi.Mr. Mnuchin, who has generally been loath to challenge Mr. Trump directly, views the negotiations with China as critical and sees the fallout from the trade war as a threat to his legacy, according to a person familiar with his thinking.At times, several officials said, the Chinese have sought to avoid Mr. Lighthizer in favor of Mr. Mnuchin, who communicates regularly with Mr. Xi\u2019s top trade official, Liu He. While Mr. Mnuchin shares Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s view that the tariffs are driving China to the bargaining table, he has told Mr. Trump that he thinks the time has come to reduce exposure to the \u201cvolatility\u201d of markets reacting to the tensions, according to several officials.Mark Landler and Glenn Thrush reported from Washington, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Statement on Saudi Arabia, Explained!", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president makes the case for the crown prince: Iran, arms sales and oil.WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump released an exclamation-point-filled statement on Tuesday about the assassination of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. It took him some time to get to Mr. Khashoggi. But bear with it. The statement is a fascinating journey into the mind of the president. Mr. Trump, when he is not obfuscating, is sometimes startlingly transparent about why he makes decisions.Here is the president\u2019s statement, as released by the White House, with additional context. Statement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia America First! The world is a very dangerous place!The country of Iran, as an example, is responsible for a bloody proxy war against Saudi Arabia in Yemen, trying to destabilize Iraq\u2019s fragile attempt at democracy, supporting the terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon, propping up dictator Bashar Assad in Syria (who has killed millions of his own citizens), and much more. Mr. Trump, here, is trying to remind the public who the United States\u2019 real enemy is. Hint: It is not Saudi Arabia. Riyadh\u2019s strong support for the Trump administration\u2019s hard line on Iran is a prime reason that the White House has maintained support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler.Likewise, the Iranians have killed many Americans and other innocent people throughout the Middle East. Iran states openly, and with great force, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Iran is considered \u201cthe world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror.\u201dThe Iranian government has been prone to shout the equivalent of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel.\u201d But officials say Iranian terrorist activity is down recently. Tehran is seeking to keep Europe on board with the 2015 nuclear deal, from which the Trump administration withdrew.On the other hand, Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance. Additionally, Saudi Arabia has agreed to spend billions of dollars in leading the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States. This is a record amount of money. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries \u2014 and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business. It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States!Baloney! The Saudis cannot hang a Russian or Chinese bomb on American-built F-15s or Apache gunships. They don\u2019t fit. Won\u2019t work. Saudi Arabia has heavily invested in American-made and NATO-standard weapons. Where do you get munitions and spare parts for those planes and helicopters? The United States.The crime against Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible one, and one that our country does not condone. Indeed, we have taken strong action against those already known to have participated in the murder. After great independent research, we now know many details of this horrible crime. We have already sanctioned 17 Saudis known to have been involved in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, and the disposal of his body.Here, at last, we get to Mr. Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident who was assassinated last month in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. The Trump administration\u2019s sanctions have mostly targeted the members of the Saudi kill team who traveled to Turkey to kill Mr. Khashoggi. Interestingly, the administration\u2019s list included Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to Prince Mohammed, but it did not include Ahmed al-Assiri, a former deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service, who Saudi officials said masterminded the plot to confront Mr. Khashoggi in the consulate on Oct. 2.Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, but my decision is in no way based on that \u2014 this is an unacceptable and horrible crime. Mr. Trump is repeating some of the phrases that the Saudi government has used to discredit Mr. Khashoggi. The president is pointedly not rebutting those claims, just saying his decision is not based on them. Arguably, he is being a bit backhanded.King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran. The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region. It is our paramount goal to fully eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!Remember who the bad guy is here! Another hint: It is not Prince Mohammed.I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction \u2014 and they are free to do so. I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America. After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels \u2014 so important for the world. As President of the United States I intend to ensure that, in a very dangerous world, America is pursuing its national interests and vigorously contesting countries that wish to do us harm. Very simply it is called America First!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shandong Ruyi and Fosun Vie for a Spot in Luxury\u2019s Inner Circle", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Attention, European independent fashion brands: Shandong Ruyi, the Chinese conglomerate, is open for acquisitions.That\u2019s according to Qui Yafu, the textile giant\u2019s chairman. Speaking at The New York Times International Luxury Conference last week in Hong Kong, Mr. Qiu encouraged the audience of luxury insiders to get in touch if they had any good opportunities.It was the latest indication of a new stage in the consolidation of the industry, as two of China\u2019s biggest conglomerates have been on a shopping spree for fashion brands that has drawn the kind of attention normally reserved for the three global luxury giants: LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Kering and Richemont.Spurred by demand from shoppers at home, Shandong Ruyi, China\u2019s largest textile producer by revenue, and Fosun International, a steel-to-real-estate conglomerate, have picked up a dizzying array of brands that include Lanvin, the oldest surviving couture house in France, and St. John, the American classic knitwear label.The companies say they have expertise, and knowledge of the industry\u2019s fastest-growing segment: Chinese buyers, who now account for a third of all consumption of luxury goods globally.But as Chinese companies vie for a coveted place at the top of the luxury sector, they face headwinds \u2014 both at home and overseas.Years of stagnating growth across the fashion industry has left many of the newly acquired brands in need of new ideas, money and time to pull off business turnarounds. And while Shandong Ruyi and Fosun have signaled ambitions to become the LVMH or Richemont of China, they have yet, with the exception of Lanvin, to acquire a truly high-profile house, a name like Gucci or Chanel.But, so far, Fosun and Shandong Ruyi have been untouched and appear undeterred.In February, when Shandong Ruyi bought a controlling stake in the Swiss fashion brand Bally, Mr. Qiu, hailed the acquisition as a \u201cmilestone\u201d toward becoming a \u201cglobal leader in the fashion apparel sector.\u201d\u201cThese Chinese companies think that they can help these luxury groups to understand the Chinese consumer,\u201d said Bruno Lannes, a China consumer expert and partner at Bain & Co. \u201cWhether this is true or possible, the jury is out.\u201dWhat is clear is that European luxury brands have faced an uphill battle in recent years and could use some help.After acquiring the house this spring, Fosun did not waste much time. In March, Mr. Lapidus announced that he was stepping down.Bally, meanwhile, has been in turnaround mode after several years of stagnant sales.\u201cBoth Bally and Lanvin are not in the best shape and are more in a turnaround situation,\u201d Mr. Lannes said. \u201cTypically what you need is a creative team and a designer that can turn the brand around in line with what consumers want.\u201dThis will require time, patience and investment from both parent companies, even as they juggle dozens of recently acquired brands and continue to scoop up others.Just a few months before Shandong Ruyi made its approach for Bally, it snapped up the Lycra brand from Invista, an American producer of polymers and fibers, for $2 billion. Two years before that, it spent nearly $1 billion for SMCP, a company that owns the fashion brands Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot.Shandong Ruyi has built up a portfolio of British heritage brands, too. It owns Aquascutum, a British outerwear brand, and paid $285 million for a controlling stake in the men\u2019s wear group Trinity, which owns the 200-year-old British suit maker Gieves & Hawkes. As part of that deal it also controls Kent & Curwen, the nearly 100-year-old men\u2019s wear brand co-owned by David Beckham, the British soccer celebrity.Fosun, meanwhile, owns Folli Follie, a fashion watch and jewelry company; St. John; Wolford and the Italian men\u2019s wear brand Caruso. Its rapacious buying spree hit the brakes \u2014 albeit briefly \u2014 when it lost out in February to a Dutch rival in a bid for the Italian lingerie brand La Perla.Fueled by cheap loans at home, these two companies together have spent billions in the past three years on fashion brands. In 2017 alone, Fosun, spent more than $2.1 billion on 32 overseas deals, many of those fashion related, according to the data firm Dealogic.For these brands and others, China\u2019s consumption power in the past year has helped to buoy the luxury fashion industry.China\u2019s contribution to global luxury sales was largely the result of a booming economy, a rising stock market and hot property market, according to analysts. But that could change as China\u2019s own growth sputters, debt soars and a trade war with the United States starts to pinch.\u201cThe whole sector is exposed to the consumption power of Chinese buyers and as the demand is struggling, globally the sector will be affected,\u201d said Mariana Kou, a consumer analyst at the brokerage firm CLSA in Hong Kong.A worsening economic picture could also put Chinese giants like Fosun and Shandong Ruyi in peril, Ms. Kou added. These companies have loaded up on debt to purchase trophy companies overseas, a model that has come under scrutiny by the Chinese government.If Fosun and Shandong Ruyi are pressured to pay back some debt, they may have less money to invest in the brands.\u201cEven as growth slows,\u201d analysts at McKinsey recently wrote, \u201cthere\u2019s a sizable, and sophisticated, pool of luxury shoppers in China.\u201dCao Li contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The laughter that followed from the chamber, customary for the House of Commons, was soon reflected on social media in posts that mixed ridicule and frustration with the country\u2019s latest political crisis. Mrs. May had received grudging support for the deal from most of her cabinet, followed by high-profile resignations in protest.By the time Mrs. May finished answering questions from lawmakers on Thursday, the mood online was clear: #brexitchaos and #brexitshambles were top trends on Twitter in the afternoon. Social media users in Britain wrote of their disillusionment with the government\u2019s efforts, and their confusion about the Brexit deal.The most high-profile resignation was that of Dominic Raab, the Brexit minister. Reaction to his departure mostly pointed to the fact that he resigned to protest a deal he had helped negotiate, just as it was being presented to the country.The British pound fell sharply after the resignation of Mr. Raab, a prominent Conservative lawmaker, prompting Twitter users to worry about the state of the British economy after Brexit. Fears of recession, job losses and food shortages, already percolating for months, spiked on Thursday.By late afternoon, the question was not just whether Mrs. May could secure backing for the draft deal in Parliament, but also whether she would remain in power. She announced she was holding a news conference at 5 p.m.Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent supporter of Brexit and a conservative critic of Mrs. May\u2019s government, said he would support a vote among Conservative lawmakers to remove her as prime minister.Before sending a letter of no confidence in her, he asked on Twitter if it was time. The response from his supporters was predictably positive, but others said they did not welcome the uncertainty that a leadership challenge would bring.

{"Headline": "Brexit Deal Gets Backing From Theresa May\u2019s Cabinet", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain faced down hard-line critics Wednesday and won the support of a jittery and divided cabinet for a plan to quit the European Union, preserving her push to avert an economically damaging rupture with the bloc in March.For Mrs. May, frequently criticized as wooden and lacking in strategic thinking, the victory represented a rare validation of her leadership. It also provided a glimmer of light at the end of the Brexit tunnel.\u201cThe choices before us were difficult,\u201d Mrs. May said in a brief statement in front of her offices at 10 Downing Street. \u201cBut the collective decision of the cabinet was that the government should agree to the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration.\u201dDespite fears that cabinet ministers might resign in protest, possibly threatening her government, none did so immediately. Nevertheless, Mrs. May acknowledged publicly that around five hours of talks had produced \u201cimpassioned\u201d debate. That description seemed to corroborate media reports that as many as 10 cabinet ministers had expressed reservations before the plan was agreed upon without a vote.There also was growing speculation that hard-line pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers, angry at what they viewed as a flawed deal, could force a vote of no confidence in Mrs. May. Such a process would require 48 Conservatives to submit letters of request.The cabinet vote was a culmination of months of often tedious and difficult negotiations with the European Union, which always held the upper hand and was determined that Britain should not gain any advantage in leaving the bloc. Mrs. May was also handcuffed by her devastating failure to win a parliamentary majority in an election she called needlessly last year.Defying many predictions of her demise, she nevertheless pressed ahead, determined as she said many times to deliver the Brexit the British people voted for. Whether she accomplished that will be the subject of much debate in the coming weeks.The 585-page draft agreement creates a standstill transition period. During that time very little would change until the end of 2020, but negotiators would aim to draw up a trade deal.The withdrawal pact covers three main areas: the financial settlement for the divorce; the rights of British citizens on the Continent and of European Union citizens in Britain; and a mechanism to assure there is no hard border between Ireland, in the bloc, and Northern Ireland, in the United Kingdom.Of the three, the Irish border will present the greatest trouble for Mrs. May, as it has from the outset of the Brexit process.If things go to plan, the agreement will be approved this month at a summit meeting of the bloc\u2019s leaders. Soon after, it will go before the European Parliament, which is expected to follow suit.But, as always with Brexit, it seems, the topping of one hurdle only points the way to the next, in this case an all-out political war in Parliament, which must still approve a draft agreement that has already provoked widespread criticism even before publication. Mrs. May lacks a majority there, and has enemies of several ideological persuasions lying in wait to stymie her.Since Britons decided in a 2016 referendum to quit the bloc, Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party has been bitterly divided between those who want to preserve close economic ties with the Continent, to protect the economy, and others who want a cleaner break. Many of those issues are unlikely to be addressed until the future trade deal is negotiated.Most of the current debate promises to focus on proposals for a \u201cbackstop\u201d plan to prevent physical checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.Until other trade plans are in place, complete with technology to negate the need for border checks in Ireland, the whole of the United Kingdom would remain in a customs union with the European Union. That is a concession from the European side, which had been insisting on a backstop to the backstop, something relating to Northern Ireland only, and a proposal Mrs. May and her partners did not believe they could sell to her party or Parliament.What the negotiators came up with was a mechanism they called the \u201cswimming pool,\u201d a strange one with only a deep end and a shallow end. In the deep end is Northern Ireland, which would remain part of a European customs union and subject to many of the European Union\u2019s regulatory rules for goods for an extended period. In the shallow part is the rest of the United Kingdom, which will remain in the bloc\u2019s customs union on trade in goods, also for an undetermined time.An arbitration mechanism would ultimately decide when the border problem had been resolved.British critics of the deal argue that it represents the worst of all worlds, leaving Britain tied, perhaps in perpetuity, to many European Union rules over which it would have no influence \u2014 the direct opposite of the Brexit slogan of the 2016 referendum, which promised to \u201ctake back control.\u201dBut Mrs. May will argue that this is the only chance of leaving the bloc without risking economic dislocation from a chaotic exit not accompanied by an agreement with Britain\u2019s biggest trade partner.Some analysts believe that the deal she has struck was about as good as she could get, given the parameters Mrs. May had set.\u201cOnce we were in a position where we wanted to avoid economic damage, avoid checks at the border in Ireland and had decided on a very close economic relationship, like Norway, this was the ballpark,\u201d said Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThis was always where we were going to land.\u201dMrs. May and her allies are busily rounding up business endorsements of her proposals, and betting that the fear of a disorderly no-deal Brexit will persuade many reluctant lawmakers to swallow hard and support her plan as the lesser of two evils.The government whips, who control parliamentary discipline, are likely to use whatever inducements they can to bring wobbling Conservative critics into line. They also hope some opposition Labour lawmakers will defy their leadership, which is almost certain to oppose Mrs. May\u2019s plans in hopes of profiting from the resulting chaos.All that could allow Mrs. May to \u201cbuild up momentum,\u201d for her plan, said Mr. Menon, adding that the outcome was \u201ctoo close to call.\u201dFor instance, she relies in Parliament on the support of 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party. But they are angry at the possibility of regulatory barriers being created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom \u2014 the deep versus shallow end of the pool.In addition to the opposition Labour Party, the Scottish National Party\u2019s lawmakers and centrist Liberal Democrats are expected to vote against the plan.According to Steve Baker, a prominent pro-Brexit Conservative, more than 50 of his like-minded colleagues could oppose the plan, believing it to be worse than European Union membership.On Wednesday in Parliament, one Conservative pro-Brexit lawmaker, Peter Bone, accused Mrs. May of \u201cnot delivering the Brexit people voted for,\u201d predicting she would lose the support of many of her party colleagues and \u201cmillions of voters.\u201dOther Brexiteers who condemned the deal included the former Brexit secretary, David Davis, who quit his cabinet position in the summer, and who described the plan as a capitulation.A small group of pro-European Conservative lawmakers are likely to try to block the deal, too, hoping that in doing so they might secure a referendum on the terms of the deal, and a route to reversing Brexit.They have been emboldened by the resignation last week of the rail minister, Jo Johnson, who accused Mrs. May of presenting Parliament with a choice between \u201cvassalage and chaos,\u201d and called for another vote. He campaigned in the 2016 referendum to remain in the European Union but is the brother of the pro-Brexit, former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.And there was more trouble for Mrs. May from her 13 lawmakers from Scotland, who worry that Britain will remain tied to European fisheries policy, dashing hopes of a better deal for their fishing communities. As staunch defenders of the unity of the United Kingdom, they are also concerned in principle about different economic treatment for Northern Ireland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Saw G-20 Summit as a Chance to Shine. Bad News Got in the Way.", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 When plans were first made for Argentina to play host to the heads of state of the world\u2019s top economies at this week\u2019s Group of 20 summit meeting, the government saw the gathering as a golden opportunity to portray Argentina as a prosperous, stable nation.But when the world leaders arrive in Buenos Aires on Friday, they will find a country reeling from a severe recession and rattled by a recent string of security incidents.Among them are an attack on soccer players by a pack of unruly fans just last weekend, a suspected bombing plot by vegan activists and the recent arrest of a pair of brothers in Buenos Aires suspected of ties to the Lebanese militant movement Hezbollah.Meanwhile, public worker strikes have led to the cancellation of scores of flights this week and snarled commutes in much of the country.So as government officials set out to lock down much of the capital before the summit meeting, Patricia Bullrich, the top security official, had a blunt piece of advice to residents of the city of nearly 2.9 million: Consider hitting the road.\u201cOur recommendation is to use the long weekend to get out, to leave on Thursday because the city will be complicated,\u201d Ms. Bullrich said.That advice was incongruous with the high hopes Argentina\u2019s government expressed just a year ago when it assumed the G-20 presidency.During a 12-year era of leftist rule by Presidents N\u00e9stor Kirchner and his wife, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Argentina defaulted on its foreign debt, which drove investors away, and cultivated close ties with China and Russia as it drifted away from the United States.Since his election in 2015, Mr. Macri, a center-right politician, has sought to restore the confidence of investors by reining in public spending. He has also realigned Argentina\u2019s foreign policy by cultivating closer ties with the Trump administration.And he has pushed to position Argentina as a prominent actor in global debates on issues like climate change, migration and trade policy.Instead, leaders from the world\u2019s largest economies will arrive to a country that is facing many difficulties, particularly with its economy, that have contributed to a plunge in Mr. Macri\u2019s approval ratings.Still, without much good news to show, Argentine officials are going to great lengths to pull out an orderly summit meeting.The government is deploying 22,000 security forces and closing off large sections of the capital to protect the visiting heads of state and their delegations. The city of Buenos Aires declared Friday a holiday to ease traffic and encourage people to leave town.This year\u2019s meeting comes at a period of considerable social unrest in Buenos Aires, where protests and street blockades have become a near daily occurrence. And December has historically been a month when these types of demonstrations turn violent, particularly at times of economic upheaval.The suggestion that residents of the capital leave town during the event was met with outrage by Argentines, who have been struggling to make ends meet amid soaring inflation.\u201cI barely have enough money for food and she wants me to leave the city?\u201d said Paula Valladares, 46, a caregiver to the elderly. \u201cI need to work. If I don\u2019t work, I don\u2019t eat.\u201dAnyone who tried to get an early start to the recommendation faced some trouble on Monday as all flights by the state-owned airline Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas were canceled because of a workers\u2019 strike.Early Tuesday morning, all public transport came to a halt for three hours in another strike.Those all proved to be false alarms.But earlier in the month, a group of vegan anarchists were accused of leaving an explosive device in Recoleta Cemetery, the place of rest of several important figures in Argentine history, including the former first lady Eva Duarte de Per\u00f3n.One of the people implicated in the plot was injured after the device apparently detonated prematurely.The government also blamed an anarchist group for a homemade bomb that was thrown at a judge\u2019s home.Another unusual episode that made headlines was the arrest in mid-November of two Argentine citizens accused of having links to Hezbollah. Their family vehemently denied that the two men, ages 23 and 25, were terrorists.The Center for Legal and Social Studies, a human rights group in Argentina, charges that the country\u2019s government has used the G-20 as an \u201cexcuse to further harden its speech against social protest and street demonstrations and exaggerate its war against terrorism.\u201dOrganizations planning the main anti-G-20 protest, taking place on Friday, say they are sure the city lockdown will affect participation. But they still expect a large turnout for a march that will end in Congress \u2014 about three miles from where the world\u2019s most powerful leaders will be gathered.Some in the city can\u2019t wait for the whole thing to be over and done with.\u201cWe have such a huge country, why did they have to come here?\u201d wondered Esteban Torres, a 31-year-old retail worker. \u201cAs if life in this city weren\u2019t difficult enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Today, Origo is one of the prime minister\u2019s most dutiful media boosters, parroting his attacks on migrants and on George Soros, the Hungarian-American philanthropist demonized by the far right on both sides of the Atlantic.And if Origo once dug into Mr. Orban\u2019s government, it now pounces on his political opponents.\u201cLet\u2019s look at the affairs of Laszlo Botka!\u201d a headline blared this month in a salacious take on the only mayor of a major Hungarian city not aligned with Mr. Orban\u2019s party, Fidesz. \u201cSerious scandals, mysteries surround the socialist mayor of Szeged.\u201dIf little known outside Hungary, Origo is now a cautionary tale for an age in which democratic norms and freedom of expression are being challenged globally \u2014 and President Trump and other leaders have intensified attacks on the free press.The story of Origo\u2019s transformation from independent news source to government cheerleader offers a blueprint of how Mr. Orban and his allies pulled this off. Rather than a sudden and blatant power grab, the effort was subtle but determined, using a quiet pressure campaign.Origo\u2019s editors were never imprisoned and its reporters were never beaten up. But in secret meetings \u2014 including a pivotal one in Vienna \u2014 the website\u2019s original owner, a German-owned telecommunications company, relented. The company, Magyar Telekom, first tried self-censorship. Then it sought a nonpartisan buyer.But, ultimately, Origo went to the family of Mr. Orban\u2019s former finance minister.\u201cWhen Orban came to power in 2010, his aim was to eliminate the media\u2019s role as a check on government,\u201d said Attila Mong, a former public radio anchor and a critic of Mr. Orban. \u201cOrban wanted to introduce a regime which keeps the facade of democratic institutions but is not operated in a democratic manner \u2014 and a free press doesn\u2019t fit into that picture.\u201dOn the surface, Hungary\u2019s democratic institutions seem to be operating normally. The judiciary is nominally independent. Elections are held. Newsstands are stacked with dozens of private publications.But below the surface, the system has been degraded. The Constitutional Court is stacked with judges appointed by Fidesz. The judiciary and the prosecution service are headed by two of Mr. Orban\u2019s oldest supporters. Both the electoral system and the electoral map have been altered to favor Mr. Orban\u2019s party.Other than a handful of mainly online outlets, the Hungarian media has been either silent about or supportive of these moves.The index now labels Hungarian media as only \u201cpartly free,\u201d while Hungary\u2019s wider political system, once classified as a \u201cconsolidated democracy,\u201d has been downgraded to \u201csemi-consolidated democracy.\u201dAnd the fate of Origo, Mr. Mong said, is \u201cvery symbolic\u201d of that transition.In 2013, Origo was Hungary\u2019s most-read news website, renowned for its hard-nosed investigations into the likes of Lajos Simicska, a friend of Mr. Orban who had long financed his party.By then, Mr. Orban\u2019s appointees controlled the state media, as well as Hungary\u2019s two main media regulators. He had given regulators more power to fine and punish independent news outlets, or to drive them off air, yet Origo did not seem cowed.The site had been created in the late 1990s by Magyar Telekom, the country\u2019s leading telecoms company, to lure subscribers to its fledgling internet service. Over time, though, Origo evolved into a journalistic force with its own identity.But as Origo thrived, its parent company faced challenges.Since the start of the cellphone era, Magyar Telekom had been Hungary\u2019s leading telecommunications company. When Deutsche Telekom, the German telecoms giant that also owns T-Mobile, bought a majority stake in the company in 2005, Magyar Telekom was considered a marquee purchase.But things changed with Mr. Orban\u2019s election in 2010. He levied an \u201cemergency\u201d tax on the telecoms sector, in a bid to reduce government debt after the global financial crisis. The tax was also seen as part of a wider backlash against foreign firms that had bought up large sections of the Hungarian economy after the fall of communism.For Magyar Telekom, it meant an additional $100 million tax bill. Company executives feared more bad news in 2013, when Mr. Orban\u2019s government was due to renew its frequency licenses. Ahead of a September deadline, negotiations would determine how much of the market would be assigned to Telekom, and at what price.The talks were not going well. Months before the deadline, Ren\u00e9 Obermann, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s chief executive, became embroiled in a shouting match with Mr. Orban at a private meeting in Germany, two people briefed on the exchange said.Throughout the year, Magyar Telekom executives met with Janos Lazar, Mr. Orban\u2019s second-in-command, to negotiate the license renewal and a multimillion-dollar contract to install broadband internet throughout rural Hungary. Initially, Origo was not a topic of discussion.But that changed in the early summer at a secret meeting in Vienna between Mr. Lazar and two senior company executives, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. Mr. Lazar said that Origo\u2019s journalists had historically struggled to grasp the government\u2019s perspective on certain matters and proposed a remedy: a secret line of communication between Origo\u2019s editors and the highest levels of government.Mr. Lazar was careful not to frame the request as a quid pro quo for new licenses, or as a form of censorship. But the Magyar Telekom executives took it seriously.By autumn, Origo had signed a contract with a media consultancy run by Attila Varhegyi, the former director of Mr. Orban\u2019s party. As a consultant, Mr. Varhegyi had played a major role in turning Hungarian state media into a mouthpiece for Mr. Orban and now his attention had pivoted to the private sector.Under the deal, Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm could call Origo\u2019s editor with suggestions about coverage.That same month, the government extended its license agreements with the country\u2019s three mobile telephone operators.Magyar Telekom was awarded the biggest share.Both Magyar Telekom and its parent company declined to comment on the Vienna meeting and Mr. Varhegyi. But in a general statement, Magyar Telekom said: \u201cDialogue between the government in office and the management of Magyar Telekom is a matter of fact, but its aim has never been to limit publicity or the freedom of press.\u201dMr. Varhegyi and Mr. Lazar turned down several interview requests and ignored requests for comment.Outraged, Origo\u2019s editor in chief resigned, refusing to participate in the deal. But his replacement, Gergo Saling, appeared undaunted.By January 2014, one member of Mr. Saling\u2019s team had even begun an investigation into Mr. Lazar\u2019s foreign travel expenses. Requests by Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm to slow the project down were ignored.But Mr. Saling was living on borrowed time.The investigation was embarrassing to Magyar Telekom: Mr. Lazar had overseen the company\u2019s license renewal and discussions were still underway over the contract to install broadband in the countryside.Mr. Lazar complained about the story in a meeting with two Magyar Telekom executives in February 2014, according to two people with knowledge of the discussion, and his disapproval was quickly relayed to Origo\u2019s management. It was one of several attempts by Magyar Telekom management, and Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm, to sway the investigation, both before and after the broadband deal was announced later that month, according to four people familiar with the controversy.Undeterred, Origo continued to scrutinize Mr. Lazar\u2019s travel. Origo eventually began court proceedings to request specific travel records, and published several embarrassing stories about the minister\u2019s movements.But by the start of summer, Mr. Saling\u2019s superiors had run out of patience. Mr. Orban had won re-election in April. Mr. Saling was fired in early June, nominally by mutual agreement.The decision was ultimately made by Miklos Vaszily, Origo\u2019s chief executive. But it came only after months of pressure on Mr. Vaszily from Magyar Telekom\u2019s management and Mr. Varhegyi\u2019s firm, according to three people at the company.In protest, several of Origo\u2019s best reporters resigned.For Magyar Telekom, Origo had become a public relations liability and a political hindrance, and executives wanted to sell.Throughout 2014, Magyar Telekom held talks with prospective buyers but decided against a private sale. The Lazar scandal had caused a public outcry, as critics accused the company of bending to political pressure. Executives wanted the deal to be beyond reproach, so an open bidding process was announced in June 2015 and overseen by Ernst and Young, an international accountancy firm.The winner was named in November 2015: a firm called New Wave Media, which outbid two rival companies.New Wave\u2019s profile immediately raised eyebrows. Their bid was financed by funds controlled by two banks, one owned by Mr. Orban\u2019s government, and another owned by Tamas Szemerey, a cousin of one of Mr. Orban\u2019s former ministers. In addition, New Wave was part-owned by Mr. Szemerey\u2019s longtime business partner, company records show.Mr. Szemerey had made earlier attempts to buy Origo directly. But by his own telling, Magyar Telekom executives had discouraged such a direct attempt, on the grounds that he would be perceived as too close to the government.Yet Mr. Szemerey ended up helping to pay for Origo all the same.There was no evidence of favoritism: New Wave had simply made the highest bid. But bolstered by money from the state, New Wave could afford to pay whatever it took to avoid the outlet being sold to businesses not aligned with the government.\u201cWe did not want it in the hands of Soros, or in the hands of people outside Hungary, or people who wanted to influence Hungarian politics against the Hungarian government,\u201d Mr. Szemerey said in an interview.Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment on Mr. Szemerey\u2019s contacts with Telekom officials, but said the deal had been conducted transparently.Though nominally still private, Origo now became a vessel for the government. Bought in part with government money, Origo now published news that echoed the government\u2019s stance \u2014 in particular on migration, Mr. Soros and the European Union, whose officials have frequently criticized Mr. Orban.Before, Origo had struggled financially. Now it was flush with government advertising revenue, which more than tripled after the sale. In 2017, the son of Mr. Orban\u2019s former finance minister became New Wave\u2019s chief executive, and government advertising revenues kept rising, even as Origo\u2019s coverage became even more aggressively pro-Orban.Today, there are more than 500.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Midterms Recap: The Good, the Bad and the Beto", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats have cause to rejoice and regret. I told my editors that I\u2019d deliver a column about the midterm election results by 11 p.m. Tuesday. Then I said midnight. Then 12:30 a.m. I finally pressed send shortly before 1 a.m.It wasn\u2019t me being slow. It was America. As the results came in, not only were many of the races tight, but many of the signals they sent were mixed and confusing. Democrats were on a trajectory to pick up dozens of House seats and win control of the chamber \u2014 which they did, by a margin that remains unclear at this writing. But they were also on a path to slip further into the Senate minority \u2014 which happened as well. They lost key Senate races (Joe Donnelly in Indiana, for example, and Phil Bredesen in Tennessee) by big margins. They won some major governor\u2019s races (Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and Tony Evers in Wisconsin, to name two) but lost other important ones (Andrew Gillum in Florida, for example, and Richard Cordray in Ohio).So precisely what kind of referendum on President Trump did this amount to? And how exactly should the country\u2019s mood be described?So here I\u2019ll expand on it with the benefit of more information and a few additional hours of reflection.Is the Democratic House Victory Half Full or Half Empty?For Democrats desperate to send Trump a stern message, the results were a tug-of-war between optimism and pessimism, contentment and disappointment.As you figure out how you feel and where you fall, here are some numbers, details and dynamics to mull:In 2010, two years into Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Democrats lost 63. Obviously, Republicans under Trump didn\u2019t do nearly that badly.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]America the DividedAllen noted that the \u201cDemocratic strategy of targeting women, minorities and the young was vindicated with the new House majority. We saw record liberal turnout in many suburbs.\u201d Meanwhile, he added, \u201cThe Republican strategy of targeting men, whites and rural voters was vindicated with the larger Senate majority. We saw record conservative turnout in Trump country. The net result: Two parties with two wildly different bases and philosophies are pulling farther and farther apart \u2014 and are certain to double down on divisiveness heading into 2020.\u201dHe said he received an email from a Republican lobbyist with this message: \u201cPoisonous gridlock. Hemlock?\u201dSpeaking of EmailsI got one from my friend Bob Kerrey, the former senator and former Nebraska governor, who is one of the most thoughtful Democrats I know. It had some terrific points, which he permitted me to share:\u201cIt could have been worse. My (free) advice to congressional Democrats (they define what the party stands for more than the governors) is to:\u201cAsk the Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin delegation to set the House agenda . . . What do we need to do to win the electoral college votes of these four states? If Dems get this right, they will celebrate a very satisfying victory over Trump in 2020. They do not need to impeach him; they need to defeat him!\u201cPush the immigration compromise front and center. Let Americans know that Trump is lying on this. We want a secure border. \u2018Build the wall\u2019 will not work.\u201cBe much stronger on national security.\u201cPush our women into the spotlight to highlight the differences between what female G.O.P. members of Congress want and what female Democrats want.\u201cHelp Americans understand how conservative judges will shift power from individuals to corporations.\u201cAnd a question: Will Fox News and their President talk about the \u2018caravan crisis\u2019 any more? I seriously doubt it. The leftists in Honduras who set the caravan in motion cost us Senate seats in Missouri, Indiana, Arizona, Nevada and perhaps Texas. Trump-Hannity lied about this to bring out the fear vote BUT it was a very effective lie.\u201dA Gay Day in AmericaThe overarching question of whether Democrats would seize control of at least one chamber of Congress eclipsed many other story lines during this election season, including the likelihood that Representative Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, would become the first politician to be elected a governor in America as an openly gay person. That likelihood became a reality on Tuesday, and it\u2019s a significant mile marker on the long road toward equality for \u2014 and full acceptance of \u2014 L.G.B.T. people.I\u2019ve worded his distinction carefully, stressing \u201copenly\u201d and the fact that he campaigned that way. The obvious contrast is Jim McGreevey, the former New Jersey governor, who was pressured into acknowledging his homosexuality during his first and only term \u2014 and who resigned in the process.\u201cGay\u201d is key, too. Oregon just awarded another term as governor to Kate Brown, a Democrat; she\u2019s married to a man but has long identified as bisexual, from well before she won a special election for governor three years ago. So America will now have two openly L.G.B.T. governors.Polis\u2019s sexual orientation remained on the sidelines of his race in Colorado, though he makes no secret of it. (He frequently appears in public with his husband; they have two children.) The Republicans working against him didn\u2019t make a big issue of it. That bolsters my conviction that outside the most conservative states, a politician\u2019s sexual orientation is almost a non-issue for voters.To that end, several openly L.G.B.T. candidates will be among the newcomers to the House when the next Congress is sworn in. Sharice Davids in Kansas and Angie Craig in Minnesota, both lesbian and both Democrats, defeated Republican incumbents. And in New Hampshire, Chris Pappas, a gay Democrat, won a House race for an open seat.All of the L.G.B.T. progress that I just mentioned \u2014 and virtually all of the L.G.B.T. progress in American politics, period \u2014 has happened on the Democratic side. I still wish for the day when the Republican Party as a whole gets to where many Republicans are individually and privately and treats L.G.B.T. Americans with the respect we deserve. We march forward regardless. And we took a big step on Tuesday.What Happens to a Beto Deferred?Perhaps no Democratic candidate in 2018 attracted as much national attention \u2014 and became as much an object of political romance \u2014 as Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texas Democrat who tried to unseat Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican incumbent. For his legions of fans, his loss on Tuesday stung.Such was his appeal that many Democrats and political prognosticators suggested that he should, regardless of victory or defeat in his Senate race, run for the party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2020. When I caught up with him in Fort Worth two and a half weeks ago, I asked him point blank if that were a possibility.\u201cNo,\u201d he told me, with the recorder on my iPhone running. \u201cThat is a firm no.\u201d He mentioned his three young kids, his wife, how much time he had spent away from them while campaigning in 2018 \u2014 Texas is a gruelingly large state \u2014 and the toll it had taken on the family. He said that he and his wife had decided that there was \u201cno way that we could do this to ourselves and especially to my kids again.\u201dBut we haven\u2019t heard the last from O\u2019Rourke. He\u2019s now a full-fledged celebrity with many millions of admirers and real political clout. Fellow Democrats will want his blessing. They\u2019ll want his input.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Missing From Top Colleges: Veterans", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut several universities are now promising to do better.Opinion ColumnistCornell, which now has about 40 veterans among its undergraduates, plans to raise that number to 100 by 2020, for example. Indiana University, the University of Michigan and Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania also said they would increase their numbers. And the College Board announced it would make it easier for colleges to identify veterans with solid standardized-test scores.The good news is that the veterans who do enroll in strong four-year colleges tend to do very well. They have higher grades and graduation rates than average. Recruiting more veterans to these colleges, as Hill says, will help the veterans, the colleges and ultimately the country.For now, our corporate giants face few real threats to their size and power.

But that doesn\u2019t mean we can ignore the veterans who fought in it.Mr. Sides is the author, most recently, of \u201cOn Desperate Ground: The Marines at the Reservoir, the Korean War\u2019s Greatest Battle.\u201dSANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 Although more than 1.8 million Americans served in the Korean War \u2014 and more than 33,000 were killed in action \u2014 it is still our Forgotten War, a kind of also-ran in our historical consciousness.The South Koreans lavished them with free flights, five-star hotels, air-conditioned coaches, bullet train excursions. At the DMZ, across snarls of concertina wire, we gazed upon the police state that South Korea might have become. We were dazzled by the coruscating metropolis of Seoul, which, the last time these men saw it, lay smoldering in ruins. The veterans seemed tremendously moved to learn firsthand: They aren\u2019t forgotten after all.By and large, though, these stoic, thick-skinned men have come to accept that their achievements will probably always play second fiddle to those of World War II, the marquee event their uncles and older brothers and cousins \u2014 the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d \u2014 fought.Climbing aboard the truck, Private Chapman could see hundreds of Chinese pressing in, with bugles blaring and bullets sputtering across the snow. He swiveled the big gun and fired. Manning a weapon as lethal as this, Private Chapman knew it was only a matter of time before the Chinese found him. They shot him in the left arm, then the right leg, then the right arm. A medic treated his wounds, and Private Chapman climbed back on the truck. This time he was hit in the hip, then took numerous pieces of shrapnel. He had just finished reloading when a bullet struck his forehead, embedding itself in his skull. It knocked him off the truck, rendering him unconscious. The Chinese overran his unit and cut it to pieces. The engagement, known as the Battle of Hellfire Valley, had ended. Hours later, Private Chapman awoke to find himself with 10 other captives, hunched on the dirt floor of a farmhouse. Chinese guards marched them on mountain trails for 19 days until they reached a place called Kanggye, near the Manchurian border. Private Chapman languished there for nearly three years.When he returned from the war, no parades or celebrations greeted him. His heroics weren\u2019t written up in newspapers or magazines. He quietly went about his life. He joined the Air Force and served for nearly 16 years. When he kept having debilitating headaches, a surgeon removed the bullet lodged in his skull. He keeps it as a relic.Mr. Chapman, who is 85 and mostly homebound, suffers from neuropathy in his feet from frostbite, a common malady among Korean War veterans. His body is a miscellany of aches from his war wounds and his years in the prison camps. He has also experienced PTSD, although through most of his life the condition wasn\u2019t dignified with a name. It seems somehow apt, for a Korean veteran, that he now suffers from severe memory loss. Sometimes he can\u2019t recognize his own daughter. But his recollections of his war experiences are stark and vivid. Men like Jack Chapman are gradually exiting our stage. They\u2019re unassuming, uncomplaining men who answered the call and fought for a principle, long ago and far from home, in a war that was not \u201cofficially\u201d a war \u2014 a war that curiously became a dormant account in our public memory bank. Stalwart and humble old soldiers like Jack Chapman are the reason, on this Veterans Day, we should make the Korean War the Remembered War.Hampton Sides is the author, most recently, of \u201cOn Desperate Ground: The Marines at the Reservoir, the Korean War\u2019s Greatest Battle.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of Americans who served in the Korean War.

{"Headline": "Intellectual Property to Take Center Stage as Trump and Xi Meet", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China sit down to talk trade this week at the Group of 20 summit meeting, their negotiations are likely to be framed by a highly charged topic: the White House\u2019s insistence that China routinely steals American technology and intellectual property.The Trump administration has repeatedly levied accusations of theft at China, invoking a term that offends the Chinese. Mr. Trump regularly says that China has \u201cripped off\u201d the United States. Last month, Vice President Mike Pence said China\u2019s security agencies had \u201cmasterminded the wholesale theft of American technology,\u201d and this week, Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said in a G-20 preview that \u201cissues of intellectual property theft must be solved.\u201dThe language employed by the Trump administration sometimes lumps together distinct but related issues, such as the trade deficit the United States runs with China, technology transfer deals negotiated by American companies and espionage intended to advance China\u2019s economic rise.But it reflects a deep, substantive rift, and the ability of the two countries to deal with it could be the key to whether a trade deal gets done in Buenos Aires. Mr. Trump has already imposed tariffs on more than $200 billion of Chinese goods, largely in response to their approach to appropriating technology, and the rate on those levies could jump to 25 percent next year from the current rate of 10 percent.While analysts estimate that the United States loses anywhere from $30 billion to $500 billion a year in pilfered intellectual property, many trade experts caution that the situation is much more nuanced than what White House officials portray.One of the biggest complaints from the Trump administration is that China forces American companies to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies if they want to do business in China. As a result of these required mergers, the administration argues, valuable technology and intellectual property is transferred to Chinese state-owned enterprises and essentially is handed over to the government.The United States has also complained about a compulsory certification program that requires foreign products to undergo rigorous testing. This can expose source codes and algorithms for products such as medical devices and machinery that can make them more easily replicated.American companies are often shy about complaining about these practices, for fear of being banned from China, but the China hawks in the Trump administration has made them a priority for an agreement that would offer the Chinese relief from tariffs.The analysis pointed to China\u2019s cyberintrusions of American companies, its evasion of American export-control laws and its extensive efforts to reverse-engineer and counterfeit American products. It pointed to a study that found the annual cost to the United States economy of pirated software and counterfeit goods could be as high as $600 billion.Beyond tariffs, the United States has using more proactive means to protect intellectual property.In October, the United States blocked a Chinese state-owned technology company \u2014 Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a manufacturer of semiconductors \u2014 from buying American components because it posed a national security threat. Then, three days later, the Justice Department charged the company, its Taiwanese partner and three individuals on Thursday with stealing trade secrets from an American technology company.The Trump administration is increasingly invoking national security to block Chinese deals, most recently expanding the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, to more rigorously scrutinize a broader range of transactions.These accusations of \u201ctheft\u201d have offended the Chinese, who view them as a suggestion that the country lacks the ability to innovate. Cui Tiankai, China\u2019s ambassador to the United States, has argued that American companies are voluntarily merging with Chinese businesses because nobody is forcing them to expand their operations into China.Some China experts such as Derek Scissors, the American Enterprise Institute scholar who advised the Trump administration on its report on China\u2019s intellectual property practices last year, contend that China has gone so far to keep out foreign competition that it has stunted its ability to innovate.\u201cThey\u2019re not relying on innovation,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. \u201cStructurally, China is set up to coerce more as time goes on.\u201dChina experts suggest that Mr. Xi is unlikely to admit that China has stolen anything, but that he will point to areas where his government has been working to comply with requests from the United States.China has been easing its joint venture requirements for some sectors. It is also putting in place a new intellectual property appeals court system, which some analysts have said is, in part, an effort to assuage concerns from foreign investors that trade secrets are not safe in China.Craig Allen, the president of the US-China Business Council, said that the Chinese will be reluctant to make rapid or drastic changes accommodate Mr. Trump\u2019s demands. They often note that the United States borrowed technological expertise from Britain in its infancy and that technology transfer is a natural part of a globalized economy.Mr. Allen suggested that Mr. Trump must press Mr. Xi on specific changes to Chinese law that he wants that would help American businesses, but that name-calling will be counterproductive.\u201cWhen it becomes ideological and is phrased as the starting bid is \u2018you guys are thieves and you need to change,\u2019 then the discussion doesn\u2019t go very far,\u201d Mr. Allen said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Fires Only Add to Acute Housing Crisis", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICO, Calif. \u2014 Within hours of the flames igniting in Northern California last week, an instant new homeless crisis was born. In a state already suffering an acute housing shortage, the fire that swept through the town of Paradise and neighboring hamlets has once again laid bare one of California\u2019s biggest vulnerabilities: With each disaster \u2014 wildfire, mudslide or earthquake \u2014 there are thousands of people who cannot find homes in a market that for years has had very little vacancy.Over the past several days, the thousands of people who lost homes in fires at both ends of the state have scattered across California and beyond, to motels, government shelters and places like the East Avenue Church, where Patty Saunders, 89, ended up after barely escaping the mobile home community where for years she has subsisted on a $900 monthly Social Security check.Ms. Saunders said she had hoped to go to her daughter\u2019s house outside Los Angeles. But her daughter had been forced to evacuate her home as the Woolsey Fire, which still rages west of Los Angeles, approached. So Ms. Saunders ended up at the church.\u201cWhat is happening with California, dear?\u201d Ms. Saunders said, covered in blankets in the church gymnasium. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough.\u201dA small city\u2019s worth of housing has been incinerated in California over the last week \u2014 9,700 homes destroyed in Butte County alone, north of Sacramento, and 432 more in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. The death toll statewide rose to at least 66 on Thursday, including 63 in the Camp Fire. More than 600 people were missing in Butte County, a number that had jumped from about 130 on Wednesday.Sheriff Kory Honea of Butte County said the number of missing people spiked as call takers went back and reviewed reports that had been taken days ago.\u201cAfter they gave me the 130 number, which I reported to you, they didn\u2019t stop working \u2013 they continued to work into the night,\u201d he said at a news conference.More than 81,000 people across the state have been evacuated from their homes. And temporary shelters, state and local officials said, are only meant to last through the emergency.On Thursday, President Trump announced plans to travel to California Saturday, to tour the damage and meet with those affected by the wildfires that have ravaged the state.Most hotels within 40 miles of the so-called Camp Fire are full. Families evacuated from the fire are taking extreme measures; some have pitched tents in a field next to a Walmart parking lot in Chico. One man near the fire zone in Chico, about 100 miles north of Sacramento, opened his land to people who lost their homes and need a place to park a trailer or R.V.Michael Cannon, a 69-year-old caregiver and musician, created an impromptu shelter, with 11 or more people sleeping over in his four-bedroom house in Chico every night since the fire began, including an ex-wife, a son and three grandchildren \u2014 all displaced from their homes.\u201cWe\u2019re just taking it one day at a time,\u201d Mr. Cannon said when asked how long his homemade home shelter might go on. He added: \u201cAll we know is that we\u2019ve got this big house and people in need.\u201dWildfires have burned in California near the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Los Angeles shoreline, engulfing nearly 250,000 acres.Housing experts said wildfires have transformed a housing problem that was already vast and deep into something sharp and local.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge increase in population and a huge increase in jobs, and we do not have anywhere close to the supply of housing to put people,\u201d said Carol Galante, faculty director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at University of California Berkeley. \u201cThere is no margin when there is a disaster; there is no cushion at all.\u201dUp and down the state, from the ports to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, California\u2019s economy has boomed since the Great Recession. But the state hasn\u2019t come close to keeping up with housing demand and population growth, consistently building thousands fewer homes than are needed each year.For disaster-prone California, the housing shortage creates instant refugees.\u201cThere is no way that the current housing stock can accommodate the people displaced by the fire,\u201d Casey Hatcher, the spokeswoman for Butte County, where Paradise and surrounding towns ravaged by the fire are located. \u201cWe recognize that it\u2019s going to be some time before people rebuild, and there is an extremely large housing need.\u201dOne possible solution, she said, would be for FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide trailers that people could live in while their homes were being rebuilt.For now, though, authorities are focused on providing immediate relief.\u201cWe are working right now to get people out of shelters and into more permanent sheltering options such as hotels, or even bed-and-breakfast inns \u2014 people have offered up rentals, people have been amazing,\u201d said Shawn Boyd, a spokesman for the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services. A joint care and shelter task force has been established between the state and FEMA, Mr. Boyd said, and task force workers have been deployed in Butte County. But with housing already tight, there are no easy answers.\u201cThis is a tremendous strain in an already difficult situation,\u201d Mr. Boyd said.Ron Zimmer, 50, the lead pastor at East Avenue Church, says congregants were in a Bible study when the fire broke out last Thursday and made the instant decision to open the church to those who fled the fire.\u201cPaul when he\u2019s leaving Ephesus says give grace to people who need it, and give to those in need,\u201d Pastor Zimmer said. \u201cThe people who are here don\u2019t have options,\u201d he said of the 250 people who have sought shelter at the church. Some sleep in the gymnasium, others in tents pitched in the yard behind the church.At the East Avenue Church, volunteers and evacuees navigated waist-high stacks of water bottles in the church courtyard, piles of donated clothing and a visiting team from FEMA. An announcement crackled over the loudspeaker: \u201cIf anyone needs a free government phone, come talk to me.\u201dMr. Zimmer, who has been on many Christian missions overseas, says he has been reminded in recent days of being in Ukraine and meeting refugees from Crimea and Christians fleeing Syria.\u201cIt was a similar feeling of people who have lost everything,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are seeing people starting over.\u201dAnd building anew.Mr. Cannon, the improvising house-host in Chico, said he hopes within the next few weeks to have a new space in a previously unfinished outbuilding in the backyard ready for habitation by even more of those who need it. One of his daughters chipped in to help with the costs, he said, and a construction company was hired to do the work.Paul Levin, 54, who has been working on the shelter-in-progress since shortly after the fire began, knows already that his house in Paradise was burned to the ground. He lost everything he owned, he said. Building a new living space is therapeutic, he said, a distraction from the troubles of the moment.\u201cI\u2019m glad I can do something to keep my mind off it,\u201d Mr. Levin said, a hammer in one hand, prybar in the other.Matt Stevens and Andrew R.

Laborers from China have repaired roads and installed bus stop shelters with signs saying \u201cChina Aid.\u201d Three cruise ships will serve as temporary hotels.The Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea is in the global spotlight as some of the world\u2019s most powerful leaders gather here this week for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting.Some say hosting the annual Asia-Pacific leaders forum will be Papua New Guinea\u2019s biggest event since it gained independence in 1975. For the country\u2019s scandal-ridden government, it is an opportunity to spend aid money on favored projects in the capital and import luxury vehicles that can be sold later to wealthy cronies.Government leaders, most of them heads of state, will be arriving this weekend from 20 fellow member economies that ring the Pacific Ocean.Vice President Mike Pence and Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia will attend in place of President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who are skipping the meeting.But President Xi Jinping of China, who is seeking to expand his country\u2019s influence in the South Pacific, is expected to arrive two days early and attend a state dinner, meet with leaders of island nations and attend the opening of a school built with Chinese aid.400 milesPacific OceanPapuanew guineaIndonesiaPort MoresbyArafura SeaCoral SeaAustraliaBy The New York TimesPapua New Guinea, a country of more than eight million located north of Australia and east of Indonesia, is by far the poorest of the 21 economies that make up the Asia-Pacific conference, known as APEC.The country is rich in minerals, timber, oil and gas but lacks the roads and ports to extract and export them. It also faces a national health crisis that includes the return of polio.Papua New Guinea is the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse nation, with more than 800 languages and 600 islands. Tribal rivalry is common, and some clans have existed in a state of low-level conflict for generations.\u201cThe political situation is quite complex,\u201d said Alan Bollard, the executive director of APEC. \u201cIt has a fluid party system, and it is very tribal.\u201dThe capital, Port Moresby, is free from any actual war, but still somehow feels like a war zone.Reports of visitors being robbed in broad daylight are common. Wealthy Papua New Guineans live behind high, spiked fences. Many foreigners live in guarded compounds where units rent for $6,000 a month or more.The security firm Black Swan International is one of the country\u2019s largest companies, with 2,500 employees.About 7,000 people are expected for the leaders\u2019 meeting. With a shortage of hotels, most will stay on the three docked cruise ships provided by Carnival Australia.The country\u2019s wealth disparity is evident. About 85 percent of the country survives through subsistence farming, and less than a fifth of the population has electricity. In Port Moresby, many settlers live in shacks made of scrap wood and plastic tarps.But in the downtown area, new high-rise residential buildings have sprung up on hillsides overlooking the harbor and a stunning new waterfront conference center, APEC Haus, where the world leaders will meet.The country\u2019s largest oil and gas exploration company, Oil Search, built APEC Haus in exchange for future tax credits.Allegations of corruption have long shadowed the prime minister, Peter O\u2019Neill, who took power in 2011. He appointed an anticorruption task force but disbanded it after it accused him of fraud.In July and August, the government spent $7 million to purchase 40 Maserati sedans and three Bentley Flying Spurs for the APEC meeting, invoices for the transactions show. That includes more than $1.3 million to deliver the Maseratis by air.Officials said the cars would be used to transport world leaders to meeting events and that the government would recoup its money by selling the cars afterward.The invoices identify the Maserati dealer as a spare parts shop in Sri Lanka and the Bentley vendor as a medical supply firm in Malaysia. Neither company could be reached for comment.Even by APEC standards, the car deal was unusual. Mr. Bollard said that no other member economy had ever bought Maseratis to chauffeur world leaders.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not something we were proposing,\u201d he said.Top officials did not respond to interview requests from The Times, including Mr. O\u2019Neill; the deputy prime minister, Charles Abel; the minister for APEC, Justin Tkatchenko; and the government\u2019s APEC coordinator, Christopher Hawkins, whose name is on the invoices.Bryan Kramer, an opposition member of Parliament, said that importing luxury vehicles was ludicrous since the country has few paved roads and no national road network.He asserted that officials planned to sell the cars to wealthy friends without charging the requisite taxes for luxury vehicles, saving them more than half the normal cost.\u201cIt\u2019s a scheme to bring the cars into the country using government funds,\u201d Mr. Kramer said.On the eve of the APEC meeting, an outbreak of polio highlighted the country\u2019s mismanagement.The first case, a 6-year-old boy, was announced in June. Since then, health officials have confirmed 20 more cases, including one in the capital. Young children are most susceptible to the disease, which can cause paralysis or death.The country eradicated polio in 2000, but the low vaccination rate in recent years, combined with poor sanitation, has allowed the disease to spread once more.The health secretary, Pascoe Kase, said polio vaccinations had declined because local officials diverted health funds for other purposes. With assistance from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, health workers have vaccinated more than three million people since the outbreak began.During World War II, when it was an Australian colony, Papua New Guinea was a key battleground for control of the South Pacific. Japan invaded in 1942, but its forces were overextended and the Allies halted their advance, turning the tide of the war in the Pacific.Today, sunken warships and the Kokoda Trail, the site of heavy jungle fighting, are attractions for divers and intrepid hikers.But Papua New Guinea remains a geopolitical battleground as Australia, China, Japan and the United States vie for influence.Australia, the largest donor in the South Pacific, is also helping to bankroll the APEC meeting, including providing security.The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in Port Moresby last month that his government\u2019s assistance came without restrictions.\u201cChina is committed to friendship and common interests, and we put the greater good before our own interests,\u201d he told reporters.During Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, he will see many signs of China\u2019s growing influence.China also brought in workers to repave the main highway, which links downtown and the government district.Mr. Kramer said that road was better than most and that the only reason to improve it was for the Maseratis.\u201cWhy are you digging up a perfectly good road and repaving it when there are so many bad roads in the country?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe only thing it wasn\u2019t suited for was high-performance vehicles.\u201dThe flags of both China and Papua New Guinea fly over the Butuka Academy, the \u201cPNG and China Friendship School\u201d in Port Moresby that Mr. Xi is expected to visit.Rachel Russell, 20, who lives across the street from the school, said she was angry that more than half a dozen huge rain trees had been cut down by Chinese workers when they repaved the road.\u201cThey chopped down the big trees and made it look like a desert,\u201d she said as she sat in a new bus shelter with \u201cChina Aid\u201d signs.She said that she and her neighbors had blocked the workers from cutting down two large mango trees outside her house and making a parking lot.\u201cI was fighting with the Chinese people,\u201d she said. \u201cI was telling them not to chop the trees down. All the people came out. I was really, really mad.\u201dMs. Russell, who works at a hotel where APEC visitors are among the guests, said she disliked seeing foreigners provide aid that she considers harmful.\u201cWhy do we have to help these people when they are coming here to spoil our country?\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t like it.

It must be Black Friday.Shoppers won\u2019t want for time this year: The gap between Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 32 days if you don\u2019t count the holidays themselves \u2014 is long (next year it will be just 26 days). That means procrastinators get more time to put things off and retailers get one more shot at luring you in. But beware: Hanukkah is coming on the early side this year.We\u2019ll be covering it all here, with reporters weighing in from near and far.Just before 11 a.m. at the Fashion Island mall in Orange County, Calif., the line to see Santa Claus was about 15-people deep, including parents and grandparents. Laura Natale, who lives nearby, brought her three-year-old son Christopher to see Santa. Asked if the crowds were any larger than a typical Friday, she said: \u201cNot really.\u201dOthers had anticipated more bustle at this palm-and-Christmas-tree-laden outdoor mall near Newport Beach, saying they remembered a bigger post-Thanksgiving rush last year. \u201cIt\u2019s more empty than I expected,\u201d said Michelle Gorczyza, who also lives in the area. She did encounter a long line at Anthropologie, so she skipped the store, deciding she could just as easily buy online.Her husband Danny said that nowadays people come to the mall more for the food and the experience than the shopping. \u201cYou don\u2019t see people running around with 10 bags,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to spend $50 on lunch and just soak in the atmosphere.\u201dThat\u2019s what 28-year old Mitch Williams did on this sunny morning, sitting beneath one of the palm trees. \u201cMy grandpa is visiting from Ohio, so we\u2019re having coffee and omelets.\u201dWas he doing any shopping? He shook his head no: \u201cI do that online.\u201d\u2014 Cade MetzRetailers start marketing it months in advance. Hordes of shoppers turn out in person and online.

There\u2019s a day for them, too.\u2014 Tiffany HsuRetailers and analysts said Black Friday 2018 got off to a strong start \u2014 and all indications were that it finished strong, too.Though the cold weather in the eastern United States may have kept some shoppers home, Mastercard SpendingPulse said that generally \u201conline sales appear to be filling in any weather related soft spots in brick and mortar sales.\u201d The clothing, electronics and interior furnishing sectors were seeing especially good traction, the analysis said.\u201cStores are busy, there\u2019s good traffic, the queues are manageable and well-staffed, and inventory levels appear to be good for the time of day too,\u201d said Frank Layo, managing director of Kurt Salmon, which is part of Accenture Strategy. \u201cRetailers helped themselves by starting promotions much earlier this year to spread out the holiday shopping traffic and mitigate chaos.

French retail brands like Darty, Fnac and Monoprix joined Apple, Sephora and Uniqlo in efforts to attract bargain hunters on Friday.In Britain, where sales used to take place after Christmas, shops have added Black Friday to their promotional calendars. Offers have been trickling in for at least a week. Amazon started its sales on Nov. 16.Most other stores have joined the fray with even discount supermarkets offering money off everything from vintage turntables to legs of ham.\u2014 Amie TsangYes, Black Friday is everywhere \u2014 even Canada.The \u201choliday\u201d \u2014 in French-speaking Montreal, they call it \u201cVendredi Fou\u201d \u2014 has reportedly become Canada\u2019s busiest shopping day of the year, eclipsing Boxing Day (or Dec. 26), when the traditional post-Christmas Day sales would bring out hordes of shoppers.This Black Friday, the stores in Montreal were packed, especially in the underground, labyrinth-like malls such as Eaton Center, which was crowded with people seeking shelter from the subfreezing weather. Athletic wear, women\u2019s shoes and men\u2019s suits were marked off at 50 percent or more in the Eaton Center mall. Outside one electronics store, velvet ropes were set up to keep the queues under control.It\u2019s said that Black Friday first migrated to Canada in the early 2000s, when the American and Canadian dollars were roughly on par. These days the greenback is worth 1.32 Canadian dollars, making these discounts even greater. \u2014 Stuart EmmrichThe Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said it sold $30.8 billion worth of goods on Nov. 11, the annual online bonanza known as Singles Day. The company rang up $1 billion in sales in the first 85 seconds of this year\u2019s frenzy. It took an hour to reach $10 billion. All in all, the company says it generated more than a billion delivery orders that day.For some context: In the United States last year, online shopping from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday totaled about $19.62 billion, according to Adobe Analytics. (Yes, it\u2019s true, that doesn\u2019t include all the in-store shopping that took place on Black Friday.)In addition to inundating phone owners with coupons and deals for weeks in advance, Alibaba deploys subtler methods to gin up sales on Singles Day. This year, users of the company\u2019s Taobao shopping app could see how their spending on Nov. 11 compared to that of other people in their area.\u2014 Raymond ZhongFor many shoppers, Black Friday actually begins right in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner.\u2014 Nellie BowlesOnline shoppers, too, were busy on Thanksgiving Day. They shelled out $3.7 billion on Thursday, an increase of about 28 percent compared to last year, according to a report from Adobe Analytics, which tracks transactions from 80 of the country\u2019s top 100 online retailers.And many of those online shoppers aren\u2019t heading to their desks or even grabbing their laptops. Thanksgiving marked the first day during which $1 billion in sales came from smartphones, Adobe said. And consumers spent more on their phones, with average order values up 8 percent compared with Thanksgiving Day last year.\u2014 Zach WichterIt could help retailers offset some of the deep discounts that consumers expect on Black Friday.\u201cIf you can grab people in the inspirational moment, they\u2019re not going to be as price-sensitive and maybe they won\u2019t shop around,\u201d said Jill Standish, Accenture\u2019s global lead for retail.Another advantage? Online, Ms. Standish said, it can be easy \u201cfor a small brand to look big\u201d if they know how to present themselves, and know how to attract the right influencer profiles to promote their products. A strong social media presence can make a company seem instantly reputable.\u2014 Zach WichterThere are three reasons that Black Friday is so popular, and two of them are the deals, according to Tulin Erdem, a marketing professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.\u201cThe economic savings, feeling good about yourself having found a good deal, being a shrewd consumer,\u201d she said, all add up to one key factor. Plus, because so many stores offer Black Friday sales, it\u2019s easier to find discounts without having to search as hard as you might during the rest of the year.But, Dr. Erdem said, another reason Black Friday remains so popular is tradition.\u201cIt still has its appeal because of this ritualistic aspect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a big important baseball game or Super Bowl as an American family.\u201dConsider that the National Retail Federation surveyed 7,516 consumers about their shopping plans this year, and 26 percent of those who planned to shop on Black Friday said it was because of tradition. An additional 23 percent said they would shop because it\u2019s just something to do. (As far as we know, nobody was asked whether they\u2019re shopping just to get away from family members.)Of course Black Friday is just the start of things. If retailers don\u2019t start discounting before Thanksgiving \u2014 and most seem to \u2014 they are certainly using the holiday shopping season to push merchandise at every turn. The biggest discounts tend to come on \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d \u2014 the last Saturday before Christmas, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail analysis firm.But Black Friday does matter. Consumers surveyed by the retail federation said they planned to shop more on Black Friday than on any other day of the Thanksgiving weekend.And Black Friday maintains cultural cache, especially for \u201cnew Americans,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, as recent immigrants are more likely to take part. \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn to be an American consumer, by showing up and shopping on Black Friday.\u201d\u2014 Zach WichterAdvertisement"}

Google\u2019s top leaders were skeptical, but they told him that he could go ahead if he could find 15 \u201cGoogle-worthy\u201d software developers in the city.\u201cThe attitude was that pretty much all the good software engineers were in Silicon Valley,\u201d Mr. Nevill-Manning recalled. \u201cIt seems crazy in retrospect.\u201dMr. Nevill-Manning found his developers and opened the engineering office in New York. Today, Google employs 7,000 people in the city, and more than half are engineers and technical staff.[Do you live or work near Amazon\u2019s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]\u201cThis solidifies New York\u2019s importance and significance in tech,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the dean of New York\u2019s venture capital community and co-founder of Union Square Ventures.Amazon, like most big tech companies, is no stranger to New York. It already has over 2,000 workers in New York, from e-commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers.Facebook has over 2,000 New York employees, including Yann LeCun, its chief artificial intelligence scientist and a pioneer in the field. Salesforce employs more than 1,000 at its new offices in New York. And tech stalwart IBM chose the city as the headquarters for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Most technology work in New York has traditionally been in service of other industries. That market, too, is growing briskly as banks, retailers, advertising and consulting firms \u2014 major employers in New York \u2014 are all getting digital makeovers and hiring. Goldman Sachs, for example, employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including data analysts, app developers, digital security and blockchain experts. Manuela Veloso, head of the machine-learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, joined JPMorgan Chase this year to lead its A.I. research team.The five companies with the most tech-related job listings in New York over the last three months on Indeed.com, the jobs listing site, are Amazon, BNY Mellon, Capgemini, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.Measurements of tech sector jobs vary, depending on definitions. But the broad picture is a growing labor market for well-paying jobs. From 2010 to 2017, according to government statistics, tech sector employment grew by 53,000 in the city, or 65 percent, to an estimated 134,700. And the average salary of $147,300 in 2016, the most recent estimate available, was far higher than the citywide average of $89,100 for all private employers.Types of tech jobs in New York City, 2016Manufacturing15%TelecommunicationsIncludes internet serviceproviders like Verizon22Internet-relatedIncludes Google andsimilar companies48Computer systems design12OtherTypes of tech jobs in New York City, 2016Manufacturing15%TelecommunicationsIncludes internet serviceproviders like Verizon22Internet-relatedIncludes Google andsimilar companies48Computer systems design12OtherSource: Office of the New York State ComptrollerBy The New York TimesThe Bay Area, to be sure, remains the nation\u2019s high-tech epicenter. New York is growing impressively, but its tech work force, according to most analyses, is less than half and perhaps one-third that of the Bay Area.But the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Silicon Valley, took in $12.8 billion. Start-ups in the Washington, D.C. region, where Amazon plans to put another large headquarters, received $575 million in the third quarter.In the past, New York start-ups typically sold out to larger tech companies. That, too, is changing. Mr. Wilson, the venture capitalist, pointed to MongoDB, a database supplier, and Etsy, an e-commerce seller, as examples of start-ups that held out and went public in recent years.MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share.\u201cNew York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.The rise of New York\u2019s tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education \u2014 a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city\u2019s work force, whose progress enhanced New York\u2019s appeal to Amazon.After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition.The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazon\u2019s board.For technologists who have recently come to New York, part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked: New York\u2019s huge and diverse economy, and its culture.\u201cEverything is tech-driven on the West Coast,\u201d said Jeannette Wing, who left Microsoft Research last year to become the director of Columbia\u2019s Data Science Institute. \u201cBut the East Coast is more well rounded. It is about technology, but not just technology for its own sake.\u201dKeith Collins contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Words From Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Sent Markets Soaring", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith just two words on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve\u2019s chairman sent stocks surging by raising hopes that the central bank might be closer to ending its push to drive up interest rates.The chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate was \u201cjust below\u201d the neutral level, meaning the central bank was close to the point where it would not be tapping on the brakes or pressing on the gas. Only last month, Mr. Powell had said it was \u201ca long way\u201d from neutral, leaving investors worried that the rate increases would crimp growth.The small change sent stocks soaring 2.3 percent, erasing the losses from a rocky November. To investors, the new wording meant that the Fed might leave rates closer to their current level, keeping in place the steady fuel that low rates have provided to a 10-year-long bull market.Analysts quickly warned that investors were overreacting. There was little evidence in the rest of Mr. Powell\u2019s speech that he intended to signal a change in plans.But the market\u2019s euphoria underscored the chairman\u2019s struggles to strike the right pitch in an increasingly challenging economic and political environment, as President Trump attacks the Fed and the country\u2019s growth comes under pressure. The market has been jittery over concerns that further rate increases could undermine the economy at a time when the prospects for companies and consumers may be softening.\u201cWe\u2019re in the 10th year of the expansion, and there are some soft points,\u201d said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, a former chief economist at the Ford Motor Company and the Commerce Department who is now the associate director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Energy Institute. \u201cThe auto sales cycle has peaked, and the housing cycle also has peaked.\u201dMs. Hughes-Cromwick said that she did not foresee an imminent end to growth, but that higher interest rates, combined with rising inflation and faltering corporate confidence, could set the stage for a recession. If those things happen, \u201cI don\u2019t really see how the economy can keep powering ahead,\u201d she said.Most economic forecasters, including at various government agencies and big Wall Street banks, expect the American economy to continue growing in 2019. But there is a broad consensus that the pace will slow as the sugar high provided by the Trump administration\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut and spending increases begins to wear off. Some forecasters see a small, but growing, chance of a recession.\u201cThis is a geriatric expansion,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management.He noted that if growth continued through next summer, this would become the longest expansion of the American economy since at least the Civil War. Economists have long argued that expansions do not die of old age. But the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s stimulus is likely to drop growth back toward a 2 percent annual rate, leaving little margin for error.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take much to go wrong to put us into a recession,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, tried to play down such concerns on Tuesday.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of pessimism I\u2019m reading about. Maybe it has to do with a mild stock market correction,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, before saying such fears were misplaced. He rattled off recent economic data \u2014 including the latest jobs report, which he described as \u201cvery spiffy\u201d \u2014 before concluding, \u201cWe\u2019re in very good shape.\u201dMr. Powell also reiterated Wednesday that the economy was doing well, that inflation was under control and that no glaring risks were on the horizon. Against that backdrop, the Fed is still expected to raise its benchmark rate in December. Mr. Powell emphasized that the Fed would make decisions about future increases by keeping a close eye on the economy.In the view of many analysts, Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell themselves pose the greatest threats to continued growth.The Fed\u2019s interest rate increases are also weighing on some parts of the economy, including home building. Sales of new and existing homes have fallen in recent months as interest rates on mortgage loans have risen.\u201cI\u2019m not being accommodated by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Post. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the Fed. They\u2019re making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else\u2019s brain can ever tell me.\u201dIn publicly berating the Fed, Mr. Trump is breaking sharply with the practice of recent administrations, which maintained a studied silence about monetary policy.One reason is that urging the Fed to move can be counterproductive. The Fed likes to present itself as a technocratic institution that floats above the political fray. While some policymakers and economic analysts argue that the Fed should suspend rate increases, such a pause would now expose the Fed to criticism that it is acceding to Mr. Trump.Mr. Powell has insisted that the Fed will act without regard to Mr. Trump\u2019s statements. In a recent speech, he emphasized that the central bank is overseen by Congress, not the president.But Mr. Powell added to his own challenges in October, in an unscripted answer to a question about how high the Fed might need to raise rates.\u201cWe may go past neutral,\u201d Mr. Powell said during an interview at the Atlantic Festival, \u201cbut we\u2019re a long way from neutral at this point, probably.\u201dMr. Powell\u2019s subsequent remarks on the subject strongly suggest that he would have liked to have chosen his words more carefully. Mr. Powell and other Fed officials also have emphasized that the exact level of the neutral rate is not important to the central bank\u2019s plans.Some Fed officials, however, have said they want to pause at that point to consider whether further increases are warranted. Others have said they want to raise rates more, judging that the economy will need a little restraint.Richard H. Clarida, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said on Tuesday that deciding how high to go would require \u201cjudgment and humility.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Behind the G.M. Cutbacks, and Why Trump Is Angry ", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House signaled that the automaker could suffer for planning thousands of layoffs, but the company says the course is essential to its future.When General Motors announced that it would idle five North American plants and eliminate thousands of jobs, it said the move would ease the burden of spending billions of dollars to develop the battery-powered vehicles of the future.But the White House put a question mark over those plans on Tuesday when President Trump \u2014 irate over the cutbacks \u2014 threatened to punish G.M. by ending federal tax credits that have helped underwrite that automaker\u2019s electric-vehicle fleet.Apparently referring to G.M.\u2019s federal rescue from bankruptcy in 2009, the president added: \u201cThe U.S. saved General Motors, and this is the THANKS we get! We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies, including for electric cars.\u201dSo a day after announcing a plan meant to put it on firmer financial ground by shedding money-losing operations and refocusing its resources, the biggest of Detroit\u2019s automakers found itself on the defensive.At a White House news briefing, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of disappointment, even anger\u201d in the administration over G.M.\u2019s decision \u2014 a sentiment he said he had shared in a \u201clengthy conversation\u201d with Ms. Barra. He cited the recent renegotiation of a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico on terms that he said were \u201ca great help to the automobile industry, and to autoworkers.\u201dG.M.\u2019s shares rose almost 5 percent on Monday, but they gave back about half of those gains on Tuesday in the face of the administration\u2019s unhappiness and its threat over the tax credits.A bright future for electric vehicles is one of G.M.\u2019s goals. Here are some of the calculations, and the uncertainties, behind the course it has chosen.Tesla is the only carmaker to have sold more than 200,000 electric cars in the United States. At the end of this year, the tax credit on Tesla vehicles falls to $3,750.G.M. says it has sold about 190,000 \u2014 mostly hybrid Volts, a model it said Monday it was discontinuing, and fully electric Bolts \u2014 and will pass 200,000 early next year. There are proposals in Congress that would extend or expand the credit, but the Trump administration\u2019s opposition could dim or kill those prospects. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and others and whether they should apply or not,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said Tuesday. \u201cCan\u2019t say anything final about that, but we are looking into it.\u201dOf the five factories that G.M. is mothballing, three are assembly plants: Lordstown, Ohio; Oshawa, Ontario; and the Detroit-Hamtramck plant in Michigan. All are almost certainly losing money, and make cars whose sales have plunged. As a result, the plants are operating well below capacity. Production in Lordstown fell by more than half last year from 2016. This year it has operated just a single, eight-hour shift each day. Typically, car plants must operate two shifts to generate profits.Moreover, the outlook for each plant is grim. With gas prices low, American consumers have flocked to S.U.V.s and all but abandoned small cars, like the Cruze, which is made in Lordstown, and the Impala, the Buick LaCrosse, and the Cadillac CT6, made at Detroit-Hamtramck. The plant in Oshawa also produces the Impala.Not necessarily. G.M. specifically announced that the plants were now \u201cunassigned\u201d \u2014 that is, they have not yet been assigned new vehicles to make after they stop production in 2019. Next year the company and the United Auto Workers union will negotiate a new labor contract. In past negotiations, the union has given concessions on wages and other cost-saving measures in exchange for the company\u2019s keeping plants open. Idling the plants now gives G.M. a powerful bargaining chip in the contract talks.In addition, G.M. is working on a dozen or more electric vehicles that it plans to roll out in two to four years. Those models will have to be made somewhere, and some could end up in one or more of the three idled plants.It\u2019s not clear. Tesla has proved that tens of thousands of people are willing to buy upscale electric cars. It has not yet proved definitively that it can make money doing so. That\u2019s also a big hurdle for G.M., as well as Ford and most other major automakers. G.M. and others have produced electric vehicles, but sales for each model have usually amounted to a few thousand cars a month \u2014 far too few to turn a profit. G.M. produces the Chevrolet Bolt, an electric car that is supposed to go up to 238 miles before needing a recharge. But so far this year, it has sold only about 13,000 Bolts.As for the huge investments in self-driving technologies, their profit potential is even less certain. G.M. has poured billions of dollars into its autonomous-driving unit, G.M. Cruise, and has recruited Honda and SoftBank, the Japanese technology giant, as partners.G.M. Cruise is working on a self-driving car with no steering wheel and no pedals, and it intends to use the car in driverless and delivery services that the company hopes will become a lucrative line of business.G.M. may be one of the first to rush into this field, but it faces an unfamiliar path and plenty of competition. Ford, Uber, Lyft and Waymo, the self-driving company started by Alphabet, the parent of Google, are all working on driverless services. Even if these services generate profits, it could be years before the companies earn back their investments.Not a lot. The halting of production at these three sites doesn\u2019t mean G.M. is struggling. On the contrary, the company continues to report billions in profits, thanks to buoyant pickup and S.U.V. sales.G.M. took this action because it is being squeezed. It is losing money on the small cars and sedans these plants make, and it needs to keep investing in new technologies. By idling the three assembly plants \u2014 the other two make transmissions \u2014 it hopes to use the savings to help fund its electric-vehicle and autonomous-driving ambitions. That particular need to shift capital investment is not an issue in other sectors. And while the industry is the largest manufacturing sector, it makes up only about 4 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.A broader economic slowdown could certainly cause grief for automakers. While Ms. Barra said one factor in G.M.\u2019s move was to \u201cimprove our downturn protection,\u201d she also made a point of saying the automaker was acting \u201cwhile the company and the economy are strong.\u201d So a few idle auto plants are not necessarily a leading indicator for the broader American economy.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Tesla's electric car sales. Tesla is the only company to have sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles in the United States, not the only company to sell 200,000 over all.Advertisement"}

I hope the Democrats win both houses of Congress in the upcoming election and the Republicans turf him from the ticket in 2020.\u201d \u2014 Sheila Dropkin, New Yorker living in CanadaWhen I covered the U.K. for The Times, I was always struck by what seemed to be the instability of the European-style parliamentary model, which seemed to make it so easy for parties to turn on their leaders. Governments kept toppling. It felt provisional and precarious.No system is perfect, and I still don\u2019t know which I prefer. But a great benefit of the parliamentary system is that it makes it harder for a country to fall under the sway of a particular person. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher surely attracted a kind of cult following. But when her party had had enough, it got rid of her. She was never bigger than the country she led.That leaves us with regularly scheduled elections. So, for those people who love the electoral process and are wistful that this eventful midterm season is coming to a close, or who are suffused by fear about what will happen next, do not worry! The next election is just two years away.Following the tradition under which past presidents refrain from publicly criticizing their successors, Former President Barack Obama has kept a low political profile the past two years.That\u2019s changed in recent months, as he has been aggressively campaigning on behalf of Democratic candidates, and against Mr. Trump and his policies.Mr. Obama has done his share of ridiculing and throwing shade at Mr. Trump, but as the bruising midterm season winds down, it is clear that the two men have fundamentally different approaches to the business of campaigning.In his many rallies, Mr. Trump has been sneeringly referring to Mr. Obama as \u201cBarack H. Obama\u201d \u2014 H is for Hussein, with all that the word implies when the president uses it. He has also been pushing hard on immigration (message: it is out of control) and the economy (message: it is better than ever) while warning that the country should not allow the House to fall into Democratic hands.In Chicago over the weekend, Mr. Obama urged the country to believe in \u201cthe abiding spirit of the American people.\u201d\u201cGoodness and decency is still out there,\u201d he said. \u201cKindness is still out there. Generosity is still out there. Hope is still out there. We just have to stand up and speak for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China and Trump, Listen Up!", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoth sides need to be smart and honest about how the countries became economic successes. Opinion ColumnistHONG KONG \u2014 I\u2019ve been in Tokyo and Hong Kong this week, and if I were to distill what echoed in all my conversations, it would sound something like this:From Chinese business and government types, some real anxiety \u2014 \u201cCan you please tell me what is President Trump\u2019s bottom line in this trade war? Is this about rebalancing trade or containing China\u2019s rise?\u201d \u2014 combined with some real bravado \u2014 \u201cYou realize that you Americans are too late? We\u2019re too big to be pushed around anymore. You should have done this a decade ago.\u201dFrom the Japanese it was gratitude \u2014 \u201cThank God for Donald Trump. Finally we have a U.S. president who understands what a threat China is!\u201d \u2014 combined with real anxiety \u2014 \u201cPlease, please be careful. Don\u2019t go too far with Beijing and break the global trading system.\u201dAnd from a smart European consultant it was bewilderment \u2014 \u201cBoy did the Chinese have a failure of intelligence. They had no clue just how much both Democrats and Republicans, and Europeans, all want to see Trump hammer China in these trade talks. But please, please don\u2019t start a cold war with China that will force us to choose sides.\u201dAnd from me to both my Chinese and Japanese interlocutors: I\u2019m glad Trump is confronting China on its market access barriers. Those are the real issue \u2014 not the bilateral trade imbalance. This is long overdue. But trade is not a zero-sum game. China can thrive and rise, and we can, too, at the same time. That\u2019s what\u2019s been happening for the past 40 years. But we\u2019d be even better off if China offered the kind of easy access to its market for U.S. manufacturers that it enjoys in America. It\u2019s time to recalibrate U.S.-China economic ties before it really is too late.That\u2019s why this may be as consequential a moment as America\u2019s decision to contain the Soviet Union 70 years ago. We don\u2019t want to be containing China. But to avoid going down that path, both countries have to be smart and honest about how we got here: China has to be a lot more humble about how its economy got so big so fast, and Trump has to be a lot more sophisticated about how America got so strong for so long.What do I mean? China\u2019s formula for success had three pillars. The first was a lot of hard work; delayed gratification; high savings; smart investments in infrastructure, education and research; and a Darwinian system of capitalism. In China\u2019s \u201cjungle capitalism,\u201d 30 companies in the same business emerge and compete to see which becomes the alpha male and wins the government\u2019s backing to go global. This system has produced high levels of innovation \u2014 Alibaba, Tencent, DJI \u2014 despite a censored internet, lack of a free press and an authoritarian government.The second pillar was a system of cheating on World Trade Organization rules; the forced transfers of technology; the stealing of the intellectual property of others; nonreciprocal trade rules; and massive government support for the winners of both its Darwinian competitions and inefficient state-owned industries.The third pillar \u2014 never acknowledged by China \u2014 was a stable global trading system built by U.S. statesmen and sustained by the U.S. Navy. It\u2019s been the U.S. Navy in the Pacific that has assured China\u2019s trading partners there that China\u2019s economic domination wouldn\u2019t result in China\u2019s geopolitical domination over them \u2014 and therefore made them open to massive trade and investment from China.America\u2019s formula for success, which dates from our founding, also had multiple components: We always educated our children to take advantage of the prevailing technology of the day.When it was the cotton gin that meant universal primary education; when it was the factory, it meant universal secondary education; once it was the computer, some form of universal postsecondary education was required; and now that it is becoming big data and artificial intelligence, it\u2019s going to be lifelong learning.We also always aspired to have the best infrastructure (roads, ports, airports and telecom), the most government-funded basic research to push out the frontiers of science so our companies could innovate further and faster, the best rules and regulations to incentivize risk-taking and prevent recklessness, and the most open immigration system to attract both high-energy low-skilled workers and high-I.Q. risk-takers.Finally, we always stood for universal values of freedom and human rights, always paid extra to stabilize the global system from which we were the biggest beneficiary, and therefore always had enduring allies \u2014 not just intimidated neighbors and customers like China does.And all our strengths were enabled by a democratic system and political class that at key moments always found ways to compromise to renew the elements of our growth model. We had not yet become what we are today, what Francis Fukuyama calls a \u201cvetocracy\u201d \u2014 where the two national political parties often just veto each other, making it impossible to reinvest in our formula for success.This trade war can end well only if China is honest about all the pillars of its formula for success and if Trump is honest about all of ours. We can get tons of trade concessions from China, but if we get away from the formula that actually made us great, we\u2019re not going to enjoy sustainable, inclusive growth.So when I watch this spiraling trade war and listen to both sides, I want to tell the Chinese: You didn\u2019t get here with just hard work; the barriers you put up were not an entitlement that you\u2019re allowed to keep forever, and the global economic system you grew into was not one you built. Your biggest customer and rival did that \u2014 America.And to Trump I want to say: America became great with a formula that every great American president refreshed and reinvested in. And you\u2019re not doing that. You\u2019re actually undermining and neglecting some of its key elements \u2014 immigration, allies, rules and regulations.In sum, I worry that America has become so focused on who the Chinese are and what they\u2019re trying to become that we\u2019ve lost sight of who we are and how we got here. That's the biggest threat to our economy and our future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Was Trump\u2019s Tax Cut a Fizzle?", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe G.O.P.\u2019s only legislative achievement has been a big disappointment.Opinion ColumnistLast week\u2019s blue wave means that Donald Trump will go into the 2020 election with only one major legislative achievement: a big tax cut for corporations and the wealthy. Still, that tax cut was supposed to accomplish big things. Republicans thought it would give them a big electoral boost, and they predicted dramatic economic gains. What they got instead, however, was a big fizzle.The answer, I\u2019d argue, is that business decisions are a lot less sensitive to financial incentives \u2014 including tax rates \u2014 than conservatives claim. And appreciating that reality doesn\u2019t just undermine the case for the Trump tax cut. It undermines Republican economic doctrine as a whole.About business decisions: It\u2019s a dirty little secret of monetary analysis that changes in interest rates affect the economy mainly through their effect on the housing market and the international value of the dollar (which in turn affects the competitiveness of U.S. goods on world markets). Any direct effect on business investment is so small that it\u2019s hard even to see it in the data. What drives such investment is, instead, perceptions about market demand.Why is this the case? One main reason is that business investments have relatively short working lives. If you\u2019re considering whether to take out a mortgage to buy a house that will stand for many decades, the interest rate matters a lot. But if you\u2019re thinking about taking out a loan to buy, say, a work computer that will either break down or become obsolescent in a few years, the interest rate on the loan will be a minor consideration in deciding whether to make the purchase.And the same logic applies to tax rates: There aren\u2019t many potential business investments that will be worth doing with a 21 percent profits tax, the current rate, but weren\u2019t worth doing at 35 percent, the rate before the Trump tax cut.Also, a substantial fraction of corporate profits really represents rewards to monopoly power, not returns on investment \u2014 and cutting taxes on monopoly profits is a pure giveaway, offering no reason to invest or hire.The key word here is, however, \u201cappear.\u201d Corporations do have a strong incentive to cook their books \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, manage their internal pricing \u2014 in such a way that reported profits pop up in low-tax jurisdictions, and this in turn leads on paper to large overseas investments.So the basic result of lower taxes on corporations is that corporations pay less in taxes \u2014 full stop. Which brings me to the problem with conservative economic doctrine.That doctrine is all about the supposed need to give the already privileged incentives to do nice things for the rest of us. We must, the right says, cut taxes on the wealthy to induce them to work hard, and cut taxes on corporations to induce them to invest in America.But this doctrine keeps failing in practice. President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts didn\u2019t produce a boom; President Barack Obama\u2019s tax hike didn\u2019t cause a depression. Tax cuts in Kansas didn\u2019t jump-start the state\u2019s economy; tax hikes in California didn\u2019t slow growth.And with the Trump tax cut, the doctrine has failed again. Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to get politicians to understand something when their campaign contributions depend on their not understanding it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Defeat for White Identity", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by What the midterms tell us about racial backlash and economic populism.Opinion ColumnistRunning for president in 2016, Donald Trump sold two kinds of populism. One appealed to white tribalism and xenophobia \u2014 starkly in his early embrace of birtherism, recurrently in his exaggerations about immigrant crime, Muslim terrorism and urban voter fraud.The other was an economic appeal, aimed at working-class voters hit hard by de-industrialization who found the existing Republican agenda too libertarian. Trump promised to protect entitlements and replace Obamacare with something more generous; his anti-immigration arguments were about jobs as well as crime; he promised lavish infrastructure spending and trade deals that would bring back factory jobs; he pledged to make the G.O.P. a \u201cworker\u2019s party.\u201d When this combination of appeals delivered victory, it set off an interminable debate about whether to look at Trumpian populism primarily through the lens of race or economics. Interminable, but crucial, because the answer would say a lot about whether a less tribal political alignment is possible \u2014 with Democrats winning back blue-collar whites or Republicans building a pan-ethnic nationalism \u2014 or whether we\u2019re doomed to a permanent racial polarization of the parties.The strongest argument for privileging economics is a simple one: Trump won millions of working-class white voters in the Midwest, the constituency and the region hit hardest by globalization, who had previously voted for Barack Obama. If you voted twice for the first black president, this argument goes, your main political motivation probably isn\u2019t racism, and the fact that Trump ran as an economic populist seems like a more important explanatory fact.The rebuttal, the case for privileging race, relies on a raft of studies, the most recent one summarized by Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp just weeks before the midterms, which show that those Trump-Obama switchers were more likely to express racially conservative attitudes and hard-line anti-immigration views than they were to have suffered recent economic setbacks.The hypothesis floated by these studies' interpreters is that the combination of Obama's presidency and Trump's deliberate race-baiting had an activating effect on white anxiety. Racial backlash against the first black president was more limited in 2012 because Romney didn't play to racial fears, but the backlash escalated, and flipped more white voters, once the next Republican nominee did. Which brings me to the recent midterms, which offered a natural experiment in the race-versus-economics question \u2014 because, as president, Trump has been more plutocratic than populist on many issues, even as he has kept up the tribalist provocations and, just before the midterms, used the migrant caravan as an excuse for race-baiting.If the Obama-Trump voters were primarily motivated by racial anxiety, you would expect his approach to consolidate them for the G.O.P. \u2014 especially with a strong economy, with the Democrats putting up lots of minority candidates, and so on. But white identity politics failed to hold Trump\u2019s gains. Some of the biggest swings against the G.O.P. were among middle and lower-income Americans, not just among affluent suburbanites. The Upper Midwest swung back toward Democrats. And among whites without college degrees, Democrats improved on Hillary Clinton\u2019s showing by eight percentage points \u2014 identical to their gains among college-educated whites. This doesn\u2019t mean that the racial fears Trump stoked didn't bring some Republican voters to the polls. But it proves that white-identity politics isn\u2019t simply destiny, that Democrats can reach wavering white-working class voters instead of writing them off, and that if Republicans want to hold them, then actual economic populism \u2014 with its potential pan-ethnic rather than racially polarizing appeal \u2014 is a better bet than what we\u2019ve gotten too often from his White House.In what is not the most optimistic time for race relations in America, I call that good news.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Mitt Romney was the Republican nominee for president. It was 2012, not 2016.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Will Tourists Be Able to Return to the Florida Panhandle?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateRecovery will be slow for many of the vacation spots devastated by Hurricane Michael. But there are some options in the area for vacationers looking for a winter getaway.\u201cOur windows were all blown up, pieces of sliding doors all blown out, with these gaping holes between. If you\u2019re outside,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can see what\u2019s left of the unit looking inside through what had been a wall. All of the furniture had been strewn away. It\u2019s just terrible.\u201dMr. Allen, who lives in Tennessee, rents out his two-bedroom Florida property \u2014 just a flight of stairs above the sand, with a balcony overlooking the ocean \u2014 to snowbirds each winter. His next guests were scheduled to arrive on Dec. 1 for a three-month stay. But after the Category 4 hurricane devastated this part of northwest Florida, destroying swaths of Bay and Gulf counties, Mr. Allen and many others in the storm\u2019s path no longer have anything to lease.The Panhandle, known for its postcard-quality beaches and charming seaside towns, is a year-round destination. And the final stretch of 2018 \u2014 including Thanksgiving weekend and the upcoming holiday break \u2014 would ordinarily be no exception. But following Hurricane Michael, the most severe storm in the history of the Panhandle, some mainstays in and around the \u201cEmerald Coast\u201d will not be able to welcome their usual crowds, a major financial hit for local homeowners and establishments.Despite being evacuated or experiencing outages during the hurricane, the communities along 30A, the scenic highway between the city of Destin in the west and Panama City Beach about 50 miles to its east, were largely unscathed. And Panama City Beach, with the exception of some wind and water damage on its east end, was also spared. But just a couple miles away, Panama City suffered a tremendous blow. The infrastructure there, and in nearby Mexico Beach, will take years to rebuild. Beyond Bay County, recovery efforts are ongoing in Gulf County, which includes Port St. Joe, Cape San Blas and other inlets, with some businesses up and running again and others closed indefinitely.\u201cWe will have no rental business this year,\u201d Mr. Allen, 62, said of Mexico Beach, where he said he and his wife will lose about $10,000 this winter on their now-uninhabitable unit. \u201cThere\u2019s no infrastructure that a tourist would want or need for this winter. There\u2019s no restaurants, the mom-and-pop shops are virtually all gone, so if I\u2019m a tourist, as much as I love Mexico Beach, I wouldn\u2019t go there.\u201d VRBO is advising those who have reserved rentals in the area to contact the homeowners to check the status of not only the property itself, but also the nearby beaches and businesses. \u201cWhether or not a traveler can get a trip refunded or rescheduled depends on the cancellation terms they agreed to with the owner in checkout or in the rental agreement,\u201d said Melanie Fish, a VRBO spokeswoman.Tourism boards are heartily encouraging people to visit and reassuring vacationers of their offerings and resilience.Lynne Andrews, a homeowner in Santa Rosa Beach who rents out her three-bedroom cottage for more than half the year, said she is already booked for Thanksgiving through VRBO. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge more for Mexico Beach and Panama City Beach,\u201d she said. \u201cI do suspect that some of those renters will probably shift out to 30A.\u201dFor Mr. Allen, who had been renting out his Mexico Beach home for eight years, the finish line to recovery is not near, and the future of the community is uncertain.\u201cThe beauty of Mexico Beach is that it was this throwback to the old Florida of the 1960s and 70s \u2014 they didn\u2019t allow chain restaurants or chain stores there; everything in Mexico Beach was mom-and-pop,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cAnd so I think the big question is: Now that it\u2019s almost entirely wiped out, what will it be in the future? Will it somehow try to recapture the quaintness that it was and that appealed to us as a family, or will some big developer come in and make it an extension of Destin and Panama City?\u201dThe answer, he added, is that there isn\u2019t one \u2014 at least not yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Road to Confrontation", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "They didn\u2019t like the West\u2019s playbook. So they wrote their own.The U.S. adopts a hard line against China, and an era of engagement recedes into the past.On a late August weekend in 2017, a week after he was forced out as President Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon made a trip to the Connecticut country house of Henry A. Kissinger to talk about China.It was more of a pilgrimage, actually: the prophet of disruption seeking out the high priest of geopolitics to make the case that Mr. Kissinger\u2019s view of America\u2019s relationship with China was hopelessly out of date. The two men talked for hours in the sunroom, and while they enjoyed each other\u2019s company, they did not, in the end, see eye to eye.\u201cHe agreed 100 percent with my analysis,\u201d Mr. Bannon recalled, \u201cbut he disagreed with my conclusions because they were too blunt force.\u201dMr. Kissinger confirmed this account, saying he told his visitor that the United States and China must strive for the \u201cpartial cooperation of countries that by normal standards might be considered enemies.\u201d\u201cHe has a different view,\u201d Mr. Kissinger added dryly.In the four decades since the United States re-established diplomatic ties with China, Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Bannon can be seen as bookends.With his secret trip to Beijing in 1971, Mr. Kissinger kicked off an era of engagement marked by the stubborn belief that bringing China out of its isolation through trade and investment would make America safer \u2014 and perhaps make China more like America. That era now seems to be ending, giving way to a more hostile one, with a trade war encouraged by Mr. Bannon and the ascendancy of his view that the United States must confront China while it still can.From the White House to the boardroom, from academia to the news media, American attitudes toward China have soured to an extent unseen since Mr. Kissinger\u2019s historic trip. China\u2019s rapid rise, and the acute sense of grievance and insecurity it has stirred in the United States, has led some to conclude, as the title of a recent book about the relationship suggested, that these two giants are \u201cdestined for war.\u201dHow China became a superpowerThe United States and China, of course, have had their ups and downs ever since the 1780s, when New England brigs first sailed to China with beaver skins and silver coins, ushering in more than a century of exchanges that sent Christian missionaries to the Middle Kingdom and Chinese railroad workers to the Wild West.The two nations fought as allies in World War II, then faced off as foes in the Cold War, before Richard M. Nixon rekindled relations with Beijing to isolate the Soviets. The hopes generated by Deng Xiaoping\u2019s economic opening in the 1980s were dashed by the Tiananmen Square massacre. The trade deals of the 1990s were strained when wayward American bombs destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.For at least a decade, Americans have blamed China for shuttered factories and jobless workers. Public views of China swung from positive to negative in 2012, according to Pew Global Research, and have remained underwater since. About 38 percent of Americans now view China favorably \u2014 down from 44 percent in 2017 \u2014 but that number is not markedly worse than it has been for the last half-decade.Yet the current chill in the relationship seems different, less a temporary rupture than a searching reappraisal of what a status-quo superpower should do about an ambitious, formidable challenger.Many Americans who embraced trade and cooperation with China had hoped that bringing it into the global economic order would, over time, pull its politics and society into a kind of convergence with the West. Yet China is heading in the opposite direction under the strongman rule of Xi Jinping, toward less political freedom and more state control of the economy \u2014 a surveillance state at home that nourishes imperial ambitions abroad. Far from modeling itself on the United States, China is presenting itself as a defiant alternative.\u201cIn our good-hearted way, we wanted to believe that with a few more cultural exchanges, a few more visiting ballet troupes, China would come around,\u201d said Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cBut Xi Jinping shut the door on that. He said, \u2018Not only are we not going there, but we have our own model now.\u2019 \u201dKevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia and longtime observer of China, said the political and economic changes in China under Mr. Xi, and in the United States under Mr. Trump, had shattered the consensus in both nations about how to manage the relationship. That, Mr. Rudd said, portended an uncertain \u2014 and almost certainly more dangerous \u2014 future.\u201cYou can almost hear the ripping sound somewhere up the middle of the Pacific,\u201d Mr. Rudd said in an interview, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s put back together.\u201dRealpolitik motivated Mr. Kissinger\u2019s outreach to China: He and Nixon saw it as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. But they were not immune to what an American diplomat, U. Alexis Johnson, called \u201crapturous enchantment.\u201d After a return trip to Beijing in 1973 to open a liaison office, a euphoric Mr. Kissinger wrote to Nixon, \u201cWe have now become tacit allies.\u201dIn the United States, China suddenly became cool. \u201cAmericans donned Mao jackets and Mao hats, stir-fried in woks, and wielded chopsticks,\u201d the journalist John Pomfret wrote in his 2016 book, \u201cThe Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom.\u201d Shortly after Nixon\u2019s landmark trip, the Chinese cut a $392 million deal with a Texas company to build 16 fertilizer plants in China, an early sign of engagement\u2019s bottom-line benefits.Diplomatic relations would ebb and flow, buffeted by domestic politics in both nations. But trade across the Pacific began a relentless upward march. Companies like IBM, Citibank and Jeep were entranced by the vastness of the Chinese market, and the pioneers of engagement marveled at how quickly commerce came to define the relationship.Even a devastating setback, the deadly crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, did not snuff out those ties. President George Bush, who once headed the United States liaison office in Beijing, secretly sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to Beijing to keep the relationship from going off the rails.In March 2000, after the United States opened the door to China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization, Bill Clinton laid out the case for economic integration as the best way to bring freedom to the country. In one of the more forceful arguments for engagement made by an American president, he promised that W.T.O. membership would wean China off state-owned enterprises and open its society.\u201cThe more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people \u2014 their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when individuals have the power, not just to dream but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.\u201dMr. Clinton\u2019s view was widely shared at the time, and not without reason. Under President Jiang Zemin and his prime minister, Zhu Rongji, the Communist Party withdrew from large parts of the economy, encouraged private entrepreneurship and welcomed foreign investors.Over the decades, the United States and China built the mightiest commercial relationship in history: Trade between the two ballooned from $5 billion in 1980 to $231 billion in 2004. China soon became the manufacturer of choice for T-shirts and toys, laptops and television sets. General Motors, Motorola and other American companies that invested in China made healthy profits. To satisfy the American appetite for low-cost goods, China began exporting more to Walmart alone than it did to most entire nations.By 2006, though, China\u2019s transition to market economics was slowing, and it began pursuing a policy of \u201cindigenous innovation,\u201d establishing targets to achieve dominance in high-tech industries that were traditionally the domain of the United States and Japan. By the time Barack Obama was elected, a narrative had taken hold in some quarters that letting China into the W.T.O. was a mistake.Mr. Obama called out Beijing on the theft of American technology and intellectual property, and needled two of his advisers, Lawrence H. Summers and Jeffrey A. Bader, about their work in negotiating with China during the Clinton administration. \u201cDid you guys give away too much?\u201d he asked, according to Mr. Bader.President Trump has since turned Mr. Obama\u2019s private gibe into a political slogan. Letting China into the W.T.O., he argues, was the original sin of America\u2019s dealings with China \u2014 a defective agreement that gave the Chinese license to steal from American companies and siphon off American jobs.But to Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative who ran the negotiations with Beijing in the 1990s, whether China should have been admitted is a \u201cnonsensical question.\u201d\u201cOf course it was going to end up in the W.T.O.,\u201d she said.With a fifth of the world\u2019s population, nuclear weapons, a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council and a track record of economic opening, China could not realistically be kept out, she argued. It already had significant access to the world\u2019s major economies, including the United States. If it did not join the W.T.O., it would have continued to reap the benefits without being forced to open its own markets.\u201cThe issue is, was it going to be a substantively, commercially significant deal?\u201d Ms. Barshefsky said. \u201cAnd I would argue that the proof is in the pudding.\u201d China, she noted, now imports more goods from the world than any country besides the United States.But with every step China took to open its markets, it erected new barriers that hobbled foreign competitors and favored its own companies. The problem was not China\u2019s W.T.O. membership but the failure of American officials to use the tools in the agreement to force China\u2019s compliance with the terms, Ms. Barshefsky said.\u201cThe U.S. did the right thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t continue to do the right thing.\u201dPeter Navarro, the bomb-throwing economist who heads Mr. Trump\u2019s trade office, said he first noticed the corrosive impact China was having on the American economy in the early 2000s, when he was teaching evening classes at the University of California, Irvine.During the day, most of his students held down jobs. But Mr. Navarro recalled noticing that \u201cmy students were having more and more problems in the job market. It was a puzzle to me. I thought, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 \u201dMr. Navarro already suspected that jobs were moving to China because of its low labor costs. But after a year of research, he concluded there were four other factors at play: China\u2019s theft of American intellectual property, its subsidies for exporters, its currency manipulation and its dearth of environmental regulations.\u201cAll roads led to China,\u201d he said.The economist remade himself into a China Cassandra, publishing books like \u201cThe Coming China Wars\u201d and \u201cDeath by China\u201d that put him on the radical fringe of his profession. But his views dovetailed with those of Mr. Trump, who had railed for decades against the unfair trade practices of China and, earlier, Japan.While the Japanese threat was overblown, there is little disagreement now that China contributed to the hollowing out of American manufacturing. Cheap Chinese clothing decimated textile jobs between 1973 and 2015. Chinese furniture makers wiped out their American counterparts. For blue-collar America, \u201cMade in China\u201d became synonymous with the ravages of globalization.Now ensconced in the White House, Mr. Navarro has supplied the intellectual grist for Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China. In June, his office published a report titled \u201cHow China\u2019s Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World,\u201d which accused China of preying on American companies in a variety of ways.Other economists still dismiss Mr. Navarro\u2019s prescription, which consists of piling on more tariffs until China agrees to fundamental changes. But privately, many businesspeople share his diagnosis. Their immediate concern is Made in China 2025, a state policy that seeks to dominate key industries by forcing American companies to hand over technology and assisting Chinese firms with subsidies.Occasionally, American frustrations with Chinese partners and competitors spill into the open. In July 2010, the then-chief executive of General Electric, Jeff Immelt, said at a private dinner, \u201cI am not sure that in the end they want any of us to win, or any of us to be successful.\u201d General Electric backpedaled furiously after his comments were reported. Despite their grievances, American business executives were still afraid of antagonizing the Chinese authorities, who could order raids on their operations.Doing business in China became even harder after the financial crisis of 2008. By that time, China had passed Japan to become America\u2019s largest creditor, holding about $600 billion of United States Treasury notes. Chinese officials were appalled by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and fearful of their own exposure. If they were always suspicious of American politicians, now they turned against their friends on Wall Street, too, taking a harder line in negotiations and rejecting their calls to open up the Chinese economy further.\u201cChinese officials began to dress down Americans and skip meetings,\u201d said James McGregor, the chairman of greater China for APCO Worldwide, who advises companies dealing with Chinese officials. \u201cFor the Chinese leadership, this was the emperor-had-no-clothes moment.\u201dFor all of Mr. Obama\u2019s wariness on trade, he was as committed to engaging China as each of his predecessors going back to Nixon. He sought global issues, like climate change and nuclear nonproliferation, on which the United States and China could work together. But his strategy, known as the \u201cAsia pivot,\u201d also called for a greater American diplomatic and military presence in the region, to try to manage China\u2019s rise.The Trump administration has rejected the Obama strategy, branding it na\u00efve and inadequate. It has adopted a more combative approach, formally designating China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and \u201crevisionist power,\u201d one that is trying to rewrite the rules of the post-World War II order to match its own interests and ambitions. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides say that China has gotten away with too much for too long, and that only a show of American strength can force it to change its behavior.The cornerstone of this policy has been the trade war, with new tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports in place and Mr. Trump threatening more. Yet the administration\u2019s objective is uncertain.Mr. Trump has floated various demands that would be difficult to enforce or require a wholesale overhaul of the Chinese economy, including a sharp reduction in the trade deficit and an end to coercive technology transfers. Some trade and security hawks have urged \u201cdecoupling\u201d the United States entirely from the Chinese economy.The Trump administration has taken a tougher approach outside trade as well. It has stepped up naval patrols in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, where the Chinese have been turning isolated spits of reef into military installations. But it has not laid out how the United States can stop a Chinese military buildup that is already tilting the balance of power in the region in Beijing\u2019s favor.The Trump administration has also taken a harder line on economic espionage, indicting Chinese citizens accused of being intelligence agents, tightening controls on Chinese investment, and even considering a plan to restrict Chinese students from attending American universities.Left unanswered has been a profound question: How can the United States compete by closing its doors when openness has been key to its success?Vice President Mike Pence laid out the case for confrontation in a harshly worded speech last month that many interpreted as a call for a new Cold War, with the United States as defender of democracy and market competition and China as the champion of authoritarianism and state-led growth. But as he called for a sustained effort to counter Beijing, Mr. Pence made little effort to reach beyond America\u2019s partisan divide and rally the entire nation behind it.\u201cTo put it bluntly,\u201d he said, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s leadership is working; and China wants a different American president.\u201dThe conflict with China is intensifying amid unresolved concerns about American leadership and overreach that built up during the era of globalization, and in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and other distant battlefields.If anything, Mr. Trump has shown a desire to pull back from commitments around the world \u2014 a pattern, critics say, that has sundered trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and undermined America\u2019s allies, depriving the United States of one of its greatest advantages in a geopolitical competition.China\u2019s own efforts to win friends and expand its influence, meanwhile, have brought mixed results so far. As part of its Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing has dangled billions of dollars for infrastructure projects in dozens of countries, from Malaysia to Kenya. The Trump administration has condemned the loans as predatory and is trying to put together its own competing aid program.Mr. Trump\u2019s instincts about China are not easy to pigeonhole. He speaks often about his friendship with Mr. Xi and admiringly of China\u2019s economic success. His grievances are rooted in trade \u2014 in the conviction that China has been cheating the United States \u2014 rather than in Beijing\u2019s ambitions in Asia or its repressive political system.Among his advisers, there is a wide disparity in how they view the coming contest. Some, like Mr. Navarro, cast it as an epic struggle over who will control the commanding heights of the 21st-century economy. Others, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and the director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, have tried to put the brakes on Mr. Trump\u2019s most belligerent trade moves.They feud constantly, and at times publicly, about who speaks for the president, leaving both Chinese officials and China experts in the United States confused about the direction of American policy.Mr. Bannon, who says his views of China were formed as a young Navy officer in the Pacific in the 1970s, speaks in almost apocalyptic terms, foreseeing a clash of civilizations. \u201cIt\u2019s either going to be the Confucian, mercantilist model or the liberal democratic Western model handed down from Greece,\u201d he said.Matthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia on the National Security Council, portrays it as more of a traditional, Cold War-style rivalry between superpowers with competing ideologies. He began his career as a foreign correspondent in China, where a state security officer once roughed him up.\u201cWe in the Trump administration have updated our China policy to bring the concept of competition to the forefront,\u201d Mr. Pottinger said recently at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s O.K. For us, in the United States, competition is not a four-letter word.\u201dThe trouble is, there has been very little public debate about any of this. What are the goals of America\u2019s competition with China: toppling the Communist regime or thwarting China\u2019s rise, as some in China have long suspected, or merely trying to modify its behavior? And in any case, how much are Americans willing to sacrifice for it?Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who worked in the Defense Department to reshape relations with former Soviet nations after the end of the last Cold War, argues that a rising power like China is likely to come to blows with an established one like the United States. In his book \u201cDestined for War,\u201d he describes a chilling scenario in which an accidental naval collision in the South China Sea escalates calamitously into a full-blown conflict.But some China experts note that other areas of dispute, like Taiwan, have not become more fraught in recent years. And whatever the issue, they argue, a disastrous miscalculation is more likely without persistent engagement.\u201cAmericans need to understand that if we go down the road of disengagement from China in pursuit of unbridled competition, it will not be a repetition of the Cold War with the Soviet Union,\u201d said Mr. Bader, the former Obama adviser. \u201cThe rest of the world, like us, is deeply entangled with China.\u201dAs a result, he said, even countries as wary of China as the United States \u201cwill not risk economic ties nor join in a perverse struggle to re-erect the \u2018Bamboo Curtain,\u2019 this time by the West. We will be on our own.\u201dAt 95, Mr. Kissinger, not surprisingly, takes the long view. Together, he said, the United States and China exert such power, and are capable of inflicting such unthinkable destruction, that they owe it to the world to find a path toward \u201cpartial cooperation.\u201d\u201cWe have to make the effort of moving in that direction,\u201d he said.Harking back to his session with Mr. Bannon, Mr. Kissinger added, \u201cI cannot guarantee that that will be the result.\u201dDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaMore China RulesDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Search of the Real Thing: China\u2019s Quest to Buy Back Its Lost Heritage", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Perceptions of the art market can often be shaped by the huge prices paid for work by the West\u2019s most famous painters and sculptors. But there is another culture that can also inspire spectacular sales.Last month, at Sotheby\u2019s in Hong Kong, a Chinese 18th-century Imperial porcelain \u201cpoppy\u201d bowl sold for $21.6 million. At the same auction, an elaborately decorated \u201cfish\u201d vase, also thought to be of Imperial provenance from the Qianlong era, raised $19 million.Reflecting the selectivity seen in Hong Kong, the sale at Christie\u2019s raised \u00a38.7 million, selling just over half of the 320 lots.The star of the collection was undoubtedly a 15th-century gilded bronze seated Buddhist figure, estimated at \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3200,000. Remarkable for the quality of its casting and for the rare survival of its original sealed base, the piece topped the sale with a price of \u00a31.9 million to an Asian bidder, according to Christie\u2019s.Roger Keverne, a dealer exhibiting at \u201cAsian Art in London,\u201d was in the salesroom. \u201cTwo of my Chinese clients asked about the piece. They\u2019ve been revving up on Buddhism for a while,\u201d Mr. Keverne said. \u201cThe Cultural Revolution tried to wipe it all out. Now they want to appreciate that culture. It\u2019s a repatriation thing.\u201dGiuseppe Eskenazi, founder of Eskenazi, one of the 43 dealerships participating in \u201cAsian Art in London,\u201d said he had been buying Chinese Buddhist sculpture since 1972.\u201cI was selling it mostly to English and American collectors, and to museums,\u201d Mr. Eskenazi said. \u201cThere was a lack of appreciation in China. It just didn\u2019t register. But now younger Chinese collectors bow in front of it.\u201dEskenazi has recently sold an imposing Song dynasty wooden Buddhist sculpture to the Louvre Abu Dhabi. The piece was priced in a 2014 exhibition in the gallery at $25 million. This week, the gallery was offering works made during China\u2019s fractious \u201cSix Dynasties\u201d period from the third to the sixth centuries, collected over four decades by the Hollywood talent agent Norman Kurland.With its emphasis on terra cotta tomb figures \u2014 which Chinese people traditionally regard as inauspicious to own \u2014 and serene stone Buddhist sculpture, the Kurland collection could be viewed as reflecting a scholarly Westerner\u2019s taste, but there were plenty of Chinese admirers at the Monday night viewing. By Wednesday, the gallery said that several of the 38 pieces had sold to Chinese collectors, including three Buddhist objects. Among those was a sixth-century limestone bust of the Buddha, priced at more than $1 million.Among the show\u2019s less expensive items, a difficult-to-date but charming inkstone carved with an elephant quickly sold at \u00a315,000.\u201cThe usual dealers are here, but there isn\u2019t as much for them to buy,\u201d said David Priestley, co-founder of Priestley & Ferraro. Mr. Priestley added that the supply of high-quality Chinese artworks was being progressively depleted by the \u201cvacuum cleaner that is China sucking the goods out of Europe.\u201dRepatriated Chinese antiques generally don\u2019t come back. Those pieces that do arrive in Britain from China are often not what they seem, according to John Axford, an Asian art specialist at Woolley & Wallis, a British auction house.\u201c \u2018Real\u2019 is the hard part,\u201d Mr. Axford said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Australia\u2019s Cities Get Crowded, Its Leader Targets Immigration", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia has proposed imposing stricter limits on immigration to control overcrowding in the country\u2019s major cities, a plan that experts called a politically motivated gambit that could legitimize resentment against immigrants.Population growth has played a major role in the country\u2019s economic success, but people in Australia\u2019s biggest cities are concerned about an influx of immigrants, Mr. Morrison said in a speech Monday night.\u201cThey are saying: enough, enough, enough,\u201d he told influential figures in Sydney\u2019s business, media and urban planning sectors. \u201cThe roads are clogged, the buses and trains are full. The schools are taking no more enrollments. I hear what you are saying. I hear you loud and clear.\u201dOn Monday, Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister, said he supported the proposal as one way to confront worsening congestion in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia\u2019s most populous cities. \u201cWe want people out of cars and spending more time with their families, more time doing the things they want,\u201d he said at a news conference.The cap is likely to be adjusted next year to reflect that decline, Mr. Morrison said, after the government solicited feedback from Australian states and territories.While some cities are looking to grow, others, like Sydney, the country\u2019s largest, are suffering from \u201cpressure points\u201d in infrastructure, congestion and public services, and these need to be addressed, he added.But experts said that, given the success of the permanent migration program, any cuts to immigration should be carefully considered in light of the potential economic and social implications.\u201cThese decisions have very long-term consequences \u2014 enormous consequences for congestion, for infrastructure, various businesses,\u201d said Abul Rizvi, a former senior immigration official.\u201cI would strongly encourage him to slow down,\u201d Mr. Rizvi said of the prime minister.The permanent migration program has been a central component of the country\u2019s successful economic growth, said Chris F. Wright, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney Business School. \u201cThe people that come under that program contribute more to the economy through income taxation than it takes via government services.\u201dPolitically, it could fuel a \u201cgrowing fire of populist sentiment\u201d against immigrants, Mr. Wright said. \u201cThere is a real risk of giving credence and legitimacy to the views of the anti-immigration fringe.\u201dMr. Rizvi said the planned changes would have a disproportionate impact on businesses in Sydney, where federal and state governments have previously encouraged newcomers, particularly international students, to settle.\u201cNow you\u2019ve got a huge success,\u201d he said of efforts to draw students and other immigrants to Sydney, \u201cand you\u2019re complaining that they\u2019re crowding out the roads?\u201dUrban planning experts said that while immigration does add to demand for services, poor urban planning has contributed to a sense of congestion and resentment against immigrants in cities.In Sydney, for example, a division between an affluent, largely Anglo population in the city\u2019s north and east and a denser immigrant population in the south and west has caused tensions, said Awais Piracha, an associate professor of urban planning at Western Sydney University.\u201cA complex problem is being simplified into migrants causing this difficulty,\u201d Mr. Piracha said about blaming immigrants for urban congestion. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that.\u201dGiven that the city\u2019s developers are building projects based on population forecasts around the current immigration cap, a change in permanent migration levels may have implications for the housing sector by depressing housing prices.\u201cIf the immigration is reduced, there would be some impact on house prices,\u201d Mr. Piracha said, suggesting that builders might end up with unsold inventory. \u201cAll kinds of planning will have to adjust.\u201dThe new immigration policy will be discussed with state and territorial leaders at a meeting next month, Mr. Morrison said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Have a Humming Economy to Tout, but Trump Rhetoric Muddies the Message", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn normal political times, a glowing report on the nation\u2019s economy just before Election Day would be a gift to the party in power and a uniform talking point for its candidates. But entering the final weekend before Tuesday\u2019s midterm vote, President Trump\u2019s blistering message of nativist fear has become the dominant theme of the campaign\u2019s last days, threatening to overshadow the good economic news.But Mr. Trump, again, has upended the traditional political playbook. Candidates are frequently forced to answer for his inflammatory and baseless tweets. And at the political rallies that are becoming a daily event as the election draws closer, the president has waded into racially fraught waters, using a broad brush to paint immigrants as villainous and dangerous.\u201cThey all say, \u2018Speak about the economy, speak about the economy,\u201d Mr. Trump said Friday, during a rally in West Virginia. \u201cWell, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. But sometimes it\u2019s not as exciting to talk about the economy.\u201dOn the campaign trail, Republican candidates have taken a split-screen approach to Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist message; many, recognizing its political potency with the conservative base, are continuing to embrace it.Democrats have \u201copen borders psychosis,\u201d Kris Kobach, the hard-right Republican candidate for governor in Kansas, told a crowd in Kansas City, Mo., during a rally on Friday with Vice President Mike Pence. Earlier in the day, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas began a stump speech by boasting about the economy, but quickly shifted to a more foreboding theme closely aligned to Mr. Trump\u2019s warnings about a migrant \u201cinvasion.\u201d\u201cYou mean the people of Texas want to stop the caravan?\u201d bellowed Mr. Cruz, who is in a competitive, closely watched race against Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic challenger. The crowd responded with chants of \u201cbuild the wall.\u201dOther Republicans, however, are straining to avoid the president\u2019s strident language and focusing instead on an economy-first message.In Winterset, Iowa, Representative David Young, a Republican in a very close race, spent the bulk of an address to voters talking about the strong economy and Republican job creation.\u201cRight now we\u2019re seeing a real economy renaissance going on in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cHere in rural Iowa, the incredible things going on with our economy are quite spectacular. I just want to keep the federal government out of your way so people can work, small businesses can grow, larger businesses can hire more people, we can keep the economy growing like today.\u201dIn campaign appearances this week, two Illinois Republicans locked in tough races in Chicago\u2019s suburbs, downplayed the immigration issue. Randy Hultgren, the incumbent in the 14th Congressional District, appeared at a metal forging plant Friday and did not mention Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration speech at the White House the day before.Peter Roskam, a Republican who is facing his own tough challenge, told McClatchy the immigration rhetoric was not important to his constituency.Some Democrats have actually weaponized the tax package against their opponents, including Danny O\u2019Connor, a Democrat running in a tight race against a Republican incumbent, Troy Balderson, in Ohio. In the run-up to a special election in August \u2014 they are squaring off again in Tuesday\u2019s general election \u2014 Mr. O\u2019Connor and his backers spent more money attacking the tax cuts than Mr. Balderson and his allies spent defending it.Traditional Republican pollsters and strategists said hewing too closely to Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary strategy could contain more risk than reward for candidates in the campaign\u2019s final days. They warn of possible backlash among minority voters and college-educated whites, two groups that could be especially crucial in deciding congressional control.Polling suggests that the same suburban independents who broke for Mr. Trump in the final days of the 2016 election could shift back to Democrats this time around. And Republican campaign veterans said that while Mr. Trump\u2019s fear-mongering is firing up his base, it could energize other voters who were previously apathetic to vote for a Democrat next Tuesday.\u201cThe problem is Republicans have a good story to tell in the economy,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a former adviser to Jeb Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney. \u201cBut the Republican with the largest microphone only wants to go on these rants about immigration.\u201dMr. Trump, he said, is \u201cmanaging to offend every swing voter in the country.\u201dThat could prove particularly risky in competitive races for the House of Representatives. Republicans are defending many seats in diverse metropolitan regions where the president\u2019s heated language could prove a hindrance.Mr. Trump even acknowledged at his rally Friday that Republicans could lose the House, saying, \u201cit could happen, could happen.\u201dIn the Senate, both parties have clung to nervous optimism about the half-dozen most competitive races. But in Missouri, which has one of the most closely watched Senate races, officials in both parties said internal polling indicated Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, had gained ground in her race against her Republican challenger, Josh Hawley, the state\u2019s attorney general.Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, said he did not think Mr. Trump\u2019s closing message was harmful, even if it was not aligned with the economic arguments the state\u2019s Republican candidates were offering.\u201cAs long as the noneconomic issues that he is talking about do not run counter to the core of what defines us as a state, I don\u2019t think he is a distraction,\u201d Mr. Kaufmann said. \u201cI almost think his presence and his energy at this point in our midterms is more important than specifically what he is saying.\u201dStill, some Republicans have expressed dismay that their party is offering an inflammatory closing argument.Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican who is retiring at the end of his term, called the party\u2019s tone \u201cunseemly.\u201d Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania, who is also retiring, said Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration stances have distracted from the party\u2019s best midterm message.\u201cWe all know challenges of suburban\u201d Republicans,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSo now POTUS, out of nowhere, brings birthright citizenship up. Besides being basic tenet of America, it\u2019s political malpractice.\u201dBut some Republicans \u2014 and the voters who support them \u2014 have said Mr. Trump\u2019s explicit language mirrors their own beliefs.\u201cThe radical left is on the move,\u201d said Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican facing a tough re-election campaign in a suburban swing district, who also appeared at the rally with Mr. Pence. \u201cThey\u2019re on the march. And this radical left is based on socialism.\u201dAt Mr. Cruz\u2019s rally in Fort Worth, Bill Ranelle, 75, said that on a scale of one to 10, he rated his concerns about immigration an eight, and gave voice to some unfounded characterizations of migrants.\u201cMy grandparents came through Ellis Island and their purpose was to live the American dream and become part of the American culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the illegals wishing to do that.\u201dLisa Lerer contributed reporting from Fort Worth.

{"Headline": "Argentine Prosecutors Consider Charges Against Saudi Crown Prince Ahead of G-20", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentine authorities are looking into possible criminal charges against Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia as he prepares to attend an international summit meeting of world leaders this week in Buenos Aires, officials involved in the inquiry said.The Khashoggi case, too, is expected to be part of the inquiry as well as allegations of torture in Saudi Arabia.Mr. Trump insisted that Washington should nonetheless continue to back Prince Mohammed, calculating that it was in the nation\u2019s economic and strategic interest to do so: because Saudi Arabia is a valuable customer for American weapons, an important source of oil and a useful partner in containing Iran.Bolstered by Mr. Trump\u2019s support, Prince Mohammed recently embarked on a week of visits to Saudi allies in the region, where Saudi news organizations photographed him smiling and shaking hands with fellow Arab rulers, with no mention of the Khashoggi case.But the move by Argentine prosecutors now threatens to interrupt his victory lap just as it reaches its finish, at the summit meeting where he was set to mingle with Mr. Trump and other Western leaders of the so-called G-20 countries.\u201cMohammed bin Salman should know that he may face a criminal probe if he ventures to Argentina,\u201d Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.The law in Argentina is unusually favorable for bringing international human rights cases because of the legacy of the country\u2019s transition from a military dictatorship. During the military\u2019s rule from 1976 to 1983, some 30,000 people were killed or disappeared. Argentina\u2019s own immunity laws were overturned in the early 2000s, and its prosecutors have since charged thousands with human rights violations committed under military rule.Argentine law has incorporated a broad interpretation of universal jurisdiction, the doctrine that some serious rights violations constitute offenses against humanity and should be subject to prosecution anywhere.Carlos R\u00edvolo, the head of the prosecutor\u2019s association, said a complaint against the crown prince was referred to a prosecutor on Monday, and that prosecutor will now decide whether to open a formal investigation.Such cases are assigned by draw in Argentina, and the prosecutor assigned to evaluate the potential charges, Ramiro Gonz\u00e1lez, could not be reached for comment.Although it is the killing and subsequent dismemberment of Mr. Khashoggi by Saudi agents in a consulate in Istanbul that has most damaged Prince Mohammed\u2019s international image, the Argentine inquiry appears to center on potential crimes committed during the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen.Prince Mohammed, who is the kingdom\u2019s defense minister as well as its de facto day-to-day ruler, has led a three-and-a-half-year bombing campaign and naval blockade of Yemen by a coalition of Arab allies seeking to dislodge from power a Yemeni faction allied with Iran.The Human Rights Watch petition, delivered to the Argentine judicial system on Monday, argues that Prince Mohammed was responsible for multiple violations of international law in Yemen, including \u201cindiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes on civilians\u201d as well as the use of internationally prohibited munitions known as cluster bombs.Human Rights Watch has documented as many as 90 \u201capparently unlawful coalition airstrikes,\u201d which \u201chit homes, markets, hospitals, schools and mosques,\u201d while United Nations agencies and other organizations have identified scores of others, Mr. Roth wrote in the petition.\u201cSome of these attacks \u2014 if ordered or carried out by individuals with criminal intent \u2014 may amount to war crimes,\u201d Mr. Roth wrote.By restricting critical food imports, the Saudi-led coalition \u201cmay also have violated the prohibition against using starvation as a method of warfare, which is a war crime,\u201d the petition argued.In addition, \u201cthe Saudi government under the authority of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been implicated in serious allegations of torture and other ill treatment of Saudi citizens,\u201d the petition argued. Several recent reports, including in The New York Times and by Human Rights Watch, have recounted allegations that detained women activists were subjected to electrical shocks, beatings and sexual harassment.Daniel Politi reported from Buenos Aires, and David D. Kirkpatrick from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Copa Libertadores at a Crossroads, a Weekend to Forget", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerSlowly, laconically, technicians wandered around Sunday afternoon, dismantling the stage they had constructed. They rolled up vast tentacles of wiring and piled up the electronic advertising boards. They took apart Fox Sports\u2019s pitch-side studio, and they vented the meter-high gas canisters stationed behind the goal.But they dawdled a little as they worked, too: some basking in the sunshine, some kneeling to kiss the turf, some taking photos \u2014 digital proof that they were present for an event that never actually took place.Two men lifted the Copa Libertadores, a great gaudy tower of silver, from its plinth, and carried it along the edge of the field, stopping only to pose for a few more pictures. Then the trophy \u2014 actually a replica owned by the television rights-holder \u2014 slipped from view, disappearing underneath the stadium stands. It was taken by taxi to a \u201cmore secure\u201d location, a tournament official said. Nobody is quite sure when it will be seen again.This was not, needless to say, how it was supposed to end: with the final postponed not once, but twice; with the Boca Juniors bus attacked by River Plate fans and the visiting players in no condition to play either on Saturday or Sunday; with a meeting scheduled for Tuesday to decide when \u2014 or if, really \u2014 the game will go ahead; and with reports circulating that Boca already had been discussing possible legal challenges if the resolution is not to its liking.It was supposed to be a red-letter day for Argentina, for all of South American soccer \u2014 the culmination of the first meeting of River Plate and Boca Juniors, Buenos Aires\u2019s sibling rivals, in the final of the continent\u2019s most important club competition.Before the first leg, Mauricio Macri, the Argentine president, had declared the final a chance to show that the country had \u201cchanged,\u201d that it had grown up, that it was capable of staging an event of this magnitude, that it could \u201cplay in peace.\u201dTwo weeks later, in a meeting room in the Hotel Alvear Icon in the affluent Puerto Madero neighborhood the morning before the first attempt at the second leg, Alejandro Dominguez, the president of Conmebol \u2014 South American soccer\u2019s governing body \u2014 explained confidently how this would prove an opportunity for his organization and the continent it represents, too.River vs. Boca might have been the end of a 58-year wait for South America\u2019s biggest game to take place on its biggest stage, but it also would mark the start of something, Dominguez said: a new era in the Copa Libertadores, one in which it might not be able to match the glamour of the Champions League, its European sister, but could at least provide an appealing counterweight.Already, the Copa Libertadores is being modernized: The final has been shifted to November from May, so that the time difference to Europe is not so extreme, and it is being played on the weekend, rather than on weeknights. Rules designed to prevent two teams from the same country from meeting in the final have been abolished, opening the door for a Supercl\u00e1sico showdown like River vs. Boca.And starting next year, the two-legged format for the final will be abolished in favor of a Champions League-style, one-off final, held at a neutral site. The first edition is slated for Santiago, Chile. Conmebol, rather than the two host clubs, will be in charge of the logistics, and through that authority it would be able to guarantee not only the presence of both sets of fans at the final, but also their security, and thus produce a grand spectacle \u2014 \u201ca world-class event,\u201d Dominguez boasted.A more appealing Copa Libertadores would not just benefit Conmebol, he said, but all of South American soccer. It has already been able to improve its broadcast deals, promised $1.4 billion over four years by its new partner, FC Diez.\u201cIs it a lot of money? Yes,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cIs it enough? No. But it is a huge step.\u201dTo Dominguez, the destination is what matters. He is not na\u00efve; he does not believe South American soccer can ever catch and overtake Europe, mostly because he does not think improved television income for the Copa Libertadores can balance out the massive economic advantages enjoyed on the other side of the Atlantic.But he does hope that by harnessing what makes the Libertadores so special, so different \u2014 the color, the spirit, the frenzy \u2014 South America could start to stanch the endless flow of its best players to Europe, to end the decades of decline the game has seen here.There is an allure, he said Friday, to how South America \u201clives its soccer.\u201d He has previously compared the Champions League to \u201cPlayStation soccer\u201d: precise and perfectly executed, but somehow shallow, two-dimensional. \u201cI see my kids playing it and they have fun, they tease each other, but it is football on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the way we live it here. The way the fans support their teams, the passion they bring: It is life.\u201dThat spectacle is what attracts viewers, and that is what brings in money: more money for the clubs, which means they can pay their players a little better, improve their facilities a little quicker, persuade their stars to stay just a little longer before moving to England, to Italy, to Spain.\u201cIt is not that we can shorten the gap to Europe,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cBut at least we can keep track of it. We can prevent it from getting bigger.\u201dIt is an admirable plan, a fine vision. River against Boca was supposed to illustrate how it would work, what South America could offer that Europe had lost. And then, as Boca\u2019s bus rounded the corner at the end of Avenida Monroe on Saturday and a flurry of projectiles smashed its windows and pepper spray drifted along its aisle, the vision fell apart. Argentina\u2019s new dawn and South American soccer\u2019s fresh start were both lost in the chaos, scattered with the shards of glass.That is because, ultimately, the latter cannot induce the former. The challenge facing Dominguez is one of organization, strategy and financing; there is a part of it that can be turned into a neat presentation, drawn up on spreadsheets. There is a part of it, however, that cannot.\u201cIt is a combination of factors: the climate of suspicion that pervades our game; the policies of prevention and control of violence that have always failed; and the culture around our football, which is violent, macho, forgetful and thinks only of success.\u201dIt is that last element that comes up most frequently when speaking with those inside Argentine soccer: an awareness that here, ultimately, winning means too much. It infects the game at every level. It means managers are given no time to build teams, getting fired after a bad week of results. It means youth systems are anarchic, with little thought of how to develop players. It means clubs are constantly in disarray, lurching from one perceived crisis to another. It means fans exist on a coiled spring, conditioned by a hyperbolic discourse both within their teams and their news media to see the slightest setback as a disaster.It means defeat is unthinkable, a fate to be avoided at all costs. For players, that might mean a little casual brutality toward an opponent or some deliberate theatricality. In a country where many see their soccer team as the principal source of their identity, where far too many feel they have little else to live for, and where the economy is struggling and inflation rampant, it can have much more serious consequences for fans.For some, it creates an environment where any measures in support of their team, or to the detriment of a rival, can be considered. That may be why River fans targeted the Boca Juniors bus: because this was a game they could not lose.It is an example worth considering across the globe, in an era where sport \u2014 and soccer in particular \u2014 is afforded an ever-greater significance and discussed in increasingly breathless, histrionic terms, where all defeats are crises and all failures humiliation. Argentina is an example of what can happen when it goes too far.Dominguez seemed sincere when he said, in the calm before the storm, that next year\u2019s final would be \u201cwonderful.\u201d He appears to feel, genuinely, that a more lucrative, better organized Copa Libertadores can start to change things.But Argentine soccer \u2014 though its problems are not unique \u2014 cannot be changed in a boardroom, on a spreadsheet. It has to be changed on the streets. That is where the damage is done, where the problems lie, where the final to end all finals became the final without end.Advertisement"}

This year, a court struck down the 1991 law, siding with state lawyers who argued that the requirement posed unreasonable burdens on building owners.Since then, Mr. das Neves said, the union, which once fought for better working conditions, is now simply devoted to survival.\u201cOur fight is not to raise wages,\u201d he said, noting that elevators operators make about $290 a month. \u201cIt\u2019s merely to keep attendants inside elevators.\u201dManuel Fernandes do Prado, who at 77 is well past retirement age, is in charge of the lift at a building on President Vargas Avenue, the main street that crosses downtown Rio de Janeiro.What does he think of his job? \u201cI adore it!\u201d he said.Mr. Fernandes, who has been in the business for more than 40 years, sometimes works back-to-back shifts in different buildings. He said he enjoyed tracking the lives of regulars as they aged.It\u2019s easy to do when you see people daily, he said, often at predictable hours.He notices when they walk in feeling chipper, when they seem upset, when something is wrong.\u201cLife is good when you work surrounded by people,\u201d Mr. Fernandes said. Addressing a regular passenger, he asked, \u201cDid you ever see me sad?\u201dMs. da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o said the job wasn\u2019t quite as obsolete as it might seem.Many elevators in the city are several decades old and have been repaired using custom-made parts because the models are no longer sold.Keeping them operational requires someone who knows how to handle all the cranks, quirks and funny noises of the aging, fussy machines. And a steady hand when they malfunction, as they often do.\u201cWhen an elevator breaks down, the only person who can\u2019t panic is the operator,\u201d she said.That speaks to a phenomenon Jacob Carlos Lima, a professor of sociology at the Federal University of S\u00e3o Carlos in S\u00e3o Paulo, has studied in several sectors of Brazil\u2019s economy. While some factory jobs have been eliminated by technological advances, poor infrastructure has spared several occupations, he said.\u201cAutomation in Brazil will be limited by deficient infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat good is a driverless car if we\u2019re gridlocked on top of an overpass?\u201dMs. da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o said the job certainly had downsides. Being confined to the small, windowless cube for hours has taken a toll on her figure.\u201cWhen I started, I was thin,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cLook at me now: I\u2019m older and voluminous.\u201dBut it\u2019s a job she would love to continue doing for at least seven years, when she\u2019ll be eligible to retire.\u201cThe profession is going to end,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re over 50, you can\u2019t easily get another job.\u201dLis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: The Homeless Millennial Connection", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.It\u2019s similar to the $1.2 billion bond that Los Angeles voters approved two years ago to build thousands of homes for the chronically homeless.Will these measures work? Much depends on how quickly and how well they are carried out, and what happens to the economy.Dennis Culhane, an expert on homelessness at the University of Pennsylvania, says there is also a much more unappreciated factor: demographics.A previous bout of severe homelessness came in the 1980s, when the second half of the baby boomers were in their 20s.These large groups of young people can push up rents as they search for apartments, aggravating the housing shortage.\u201cWe certainly see that homelessness in this population is bigger relative to the generation before them,\u201d Dr. Culhane said.And by dint of their numbers, millennials may be also straining the mental health system.\u201cThere is anecdotal evidence from cities I\u2019ve been to where people are saying that this young adult population with severe mental illness is overwhelming the health system,\u201d Dr. Culhane said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take many people to have a big impact.\u201dWhat does demography say about the future of homelessness in California?Nationally, births declined for seven years from the millennial generation peak of 4.2 million. There may be some hope in that. Yet the millennial cohort will be with us for decades longer \u2014 and Dr. Culhane believes it will take a \u201cmassive infusion of resources\u201d to assist the neediest among them.\u201cAt the scale of homelessness we are witnessing on the West Coast, little pilot efforts here and there are not going to make a dent,\u201d he said.This is the 10th and final puzzle in our series of California-themed crosswords, written by the veteran Times crossword constructor and San Diego resident Bruce Haight.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)If you happened to be wandering around downtown San Francisco on Halloween night, you might have noticed an unusual sight at the top of Salesforce Tower: flames with an ominous flickering eye in the middle.\u201cIt has been said that bonds are formed through shared experiences, the strongest of which are forged in fire,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cWe ask of you to help us unite the city, and raise the torch on Halloween night as one community, together.\u201dPerhaps it was the petition\u2019s begrudgingly inclusive ending that persuaded the Salesforce gods: \u201cOakland can come, too.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "What America Owes Frederick Douglass", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "OpinionSupported byMr. Blight is a professor of history at Yale and the author, most recently, of \u201cFrederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom.\u201dAt the end of the memoir, Douglass admitted that he had, until recently, fought only with \u201cpen and tongue.\u201d But now, in the roiling crises over slavery in the 1850s \u2014 fugitive slave rescues, violent clashes in Kansas over slavery\u2019s expansion and a nation enthralled by the antislavery novel \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u201d \u2014 the author announced his new \u201cdisposition.\u201d He had discovered the force of politics in a republic dominated by slavery. He wished to add his own story to the nation\u2019s \u201cblood-written history\u201d as clouds of \u201cwrathful thunder and lightning\u201d hovered over the land. Then he gave voice to his life\u2019s work. He would, as long as \u201cheaven\u201d gave him the ability to speak and to write, fight for abolition and the beginning of black equality with \u201cmy voice, my pen, or my vote.\u201d So much of Douglass\u2019s life echoes down through American history, but especially this week, perhaps nothing more so than those words. All those Americans voting across our country right now, and especially those whose votes are thwarted by people who still refuse to accept historical verdicts a century and a half old, owe Douglass a nod of recognition. In 1866-67, the United States had no obvious path ahead in the wake of the Civil War. A people \u2014 North and South, black and white, still mourning 700,000 dead \u2014 faced elections without clearly defined rules about who could vote. Nearly four million former slaves, many living in physical hardship and under the threat of terror and violence in the South, did not yet know what \u201cfreedom\u201d would mean, nor what kind of civil and political rights they might exercise.Americans ached to be put back together in some new, reimagined way. Hundreds of thousands had fled their homes during the war. The nation\u2019s politics was shredded into blood-born hatreds and seemingly hopeless polarization. Its national and state governments had to be remade. Racism, fear and hope all marched together as traumatized soldiers from both sides made their way home to farms in a thriving Northern economy but an utterly devastated South. The party in power in Washington was led by a group of visionaries, the \u201cradical\u201d Republicans who had championed the cause of emancipation during the war and believed in an interventionist federal government as a means of fashioning a second American republic out of the destruction of the first. They imagined at least the beginning of a revolution in racial equality. The war was over, but everything still seemed at stake in the struggle over Reconstruction. Whether free exercise of voice, pen and vote would really be protected for all remained to be seen.The president was Andrew Johnson, a Tennessean who had been invited onto Abraham Lincoln\u2019s ticket in 1864 because he had been the sole senator from a Confederate state who did not secede with it. Johnson\u2019s support of the Union notwithstanding, he was a staunch proponent of states\u2019 rights, a virulent white supremacist and a believer in limited federal government. Johnson grudgingly accepted the end of slavery but denounced the extension of civil and political liberty to black Americans. His spirit lives on today, in more subtle ways, in the voter suppression practices of the Republican Party and in the desire to revoke birthright citizenship.As Johnson and the radical Republicans locked horns over fundamentally different visions of Reconstruction in the winter of 1866, Douglass led a delegation of 12 black leaders to the White House. Hoping for an honest hearing of their hopes and grievances, they received a barrage of vitriol from an angry racist who hoped to thwart any revision of the Constitution that would guarantee rights for blacks. Johnson and his anxious conservative followers desired an America that was largely pre-1861, a society many Northerners believed had been buried by the sacrifices at Antietam, Fort Wagner and Gettysburg. Douglass led off the encounter by respectfully informing the president that they had come to ask for \u201cequality before the law,\u201d and to be \u201cfully enfranchised throughout the land.\u201d \u201cExtend us the ballot,\u201d Douglass pleaded, \u201cwith which to save ourselves.\u201d Johnson interrupted and for the next 40 minutes harangued and insulted his guests. He was willing to be their \u201cMoses,\u201d he declared. His \u201cfeelings\u201d had always been with blacks. \u201cI have owned slaves, and bought slaves, but I never sold one,\u201d he assured the delegation. He did not like being \u201carraigned\u201d by one \u2014 Douglass \u2014 \u201cwho could get up handsomely rounded periods and deal in rhetoric.\u201d If his guests pursued their goals of equality it would cause \u201crace war,\u201d and he insisted that the only good solution was for blacks to leave the country. As Douglass looked at him in disgust, Johnson asserted that in his relationship with blacks, \u201cI have been their slave instead of their being mine.\u201dJohnson then made a fierce defense of states\u2019 rights. The federal government could not force a state to follow its dictates, the president claimed. The \u201claw\u201d and majorities must be obeyed. As if he had not offended Douglass and his colleagues enough, Johnson then maintained that the truest victim of slavery and the war was the poor, non-slaveholding Southern white: \u201cThe colored man and his master combined to keep him in slavery.\u201d As this disastrous meeting came to an end, Douglass did manage one direct claim to Johnson\u2019s face. \u201cThe very thing Your Excellency would avoid\u201d \u2014 a race war \u2014 \u201cin the Southern states can only be avoided by the very measure that we propose,\u201d i.e., black suffrage, Douglass said. As the delegation walked out, the president was overheard saying: \u201cThose damned sons of bitches thought they had me in a trap. I know that damned Douglass; he\u2019s just like any nigger, and would sooner cut a white man\u2019s throat than not.\u201dIn the wake of this worst-ever meeting between black leaders and an American president, Douglass did what he so frequently did in the middle of crises \u2014 he went to his desk, wrote a remarkable speech and took it out on the road. From Brooklyn to St. Louis, Douglass, who called his speech \u201cSources of Danger to the Republic,\u201d skewered Johnson as an \u201cunmitigated calamity\u201d of a president under whom, for now, the nation \u201cmust stagger.\u201d A constant refrain in this and other postwar speeches was his claim that \u201cslavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot.\u201dDouglass\u2019s words echo on today. Are our institutions adequate to the challenges presented by a president animated by a combination of authoritarianism and ignorance? Is the right to vote really safe and free? Are our political parties disintegrating? Is our free press robust enough to withstand the attacks upon it and the technology revolutionizing the dissemination of information? David W.

We can build a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just wealthy elites.\u201dMs. Warren also linked foreign policy with her trademark populist rhetoric about corporate greed and inequality, saying America \u201ccan project power abroad only if we are strong and secure at home.\u201dThe speech drew a quick barb from Republicans.\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that Elizabeth Warren has chosen to launch her 2020 campaign with the two topics she knows the least about: her heritage and foreign policy,\u201d Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee said, referring to Ms. Warren\u2019s release last month of DNA tests that she said provided proof of her Native American ancestry.In the prepared speech, a rarity for the often-extemporaneous Ms. Warren, she announced her opposition to the renegotiated free trade agreement President Trump is set to sign this week and, as Mr. Trump regularly takes credit for major increases in military spending, she called for major cuts to what she called America\u2019s \u201cbloated defense budget.\u201d\u201cInvestments at home strengthen the economy, but these investments also serve national security,\u201d she said. \u201cA 21st century industrial policy, for example, would produce good jobs that provide dignity, respect and a living wage, and it would also reinforce U.S. international economic power.\u201dMs. Warren also cast doubt on Trump administration policies toward Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\u201cIn some cases, as with our support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s proxy war in Yemen, U.S. policies risk generating even more extremism,\u201d she said.\u201cIf you\u2019re skeptical that this is a problem, consider this: The president of the United States has refused to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia in part because he is more interested in appeasing U.S. defense contractors than holding the Saudis accountable for the murder of a Washington Post journalist or for the thousands of Yemeni civilians killed by those weapons,\u201d she added.She ended her remarks by saying, \u201cThe world changed in 2016, and it changed in 2018, and I think the world is going to change again in 2020.\u201dFor Ms. Warren, who is considered among the Democratic presidential front-runners should she choose to run, the speech marked the culmination of a yearslong effort to shore up her foreign policy credentials.She secured a spot on the Senate Armed Forces Committee after the 2016 presidential election, and she has taken high-profile trips to visit troops with Republicans such as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has since died.In recent years, progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders were consistently panned by foreign policy experts for a lack of expertise that, they said, amounted to na\u00efvet\u00e9. Thursday\u2019s speech underscores how proactively Ms. Warren is trying to distance herself from that pack, straddling the line between left-leaning talking points and a serious, informed approach to the world\u2019s dangers.Among others who have expressed interest in the 2020 Democratic nomination, some have credible claims to foreign policy expertise, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former Secretary of State John Kerry.But if Ms. Warren were to announce her candidacy, few of her fellow first-time presidential candidates would have similar foreign policy credentials or have similarly articulated a vision for America\u2019s role in the international order.Ms. Warren also conducted a question-and-answer session after the speech, where she took questions from students regarding Russia sanctions and climate change.The speech will provide plenty of fodder for Ms. Warren\u2019s conservative critics. Far from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra of President Trump, Ms. Warren\u2019s call to contract the military budget and limit the influence of contractors will be anathema to many foreign policy hawks.She also specifically called out Mr. Trump for encouraging authoritarian regimes and called it a critical time to restore trust in American democracy.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s actions and instincts align with those of authoritarian regimes around the globe,\u201d she said. \u201cHe embraces dictators of all stripes. He cozies up to white nationalists. He undermines the free press and incites violence against journalists. He attacks the independence of our judiciary. He wraps himself in the flag and co-opts the military for partisan purposes \u2014 but he can\u2019t be bothered to visit our troops.\u201dIn the largely supportive audience of hundreds, mostly students, jabs at the president were well received. Also a hit: Ms. Warren invoking her signature tag line, \u201cNevertheless, she persisted.\u201d\u201cFifty-five years ago, when President John F. Kennedy spoke here at American University, he said that \u2018our problems are man-made \u2014 therefore, they can be solved by man.\u2019\u201cThe same is true today,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cO.K., I\u2019d add that they can also be solved by women, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Republican Gains in Senate, Social Conservatives Tighten Their Grip", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican victories in crucial Senate and governors\u2019 races this week have tightened social conservatives\u2019 grip across American government, strengthening the party\u2019s power as it seeks to limit abortion rights and push harder to the right on a number of divisive cultural issues.Even as Democrats captured the House and promised to act as a check on President Trump and Republican policy priorities, conservatives were breathing a deep sigh of relief on Wednesday after strengthening their majority in the Senate. Their gains in the upper chamber could have a far-reaching impact on the remainder of the president\u2019s term, particularly on his ability to continue shifting the ideological balance on the federal courts.The election of conservatives to Democratic-held Senate seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota \u2014 as well as to an open seat in Tennessee, and possibly in Arizona, Florida and Mississippi, where races have not been decided \u2014 will almost certainly add to the Republicans\u2019 one-seat majority. It will also dilute the votes of moderate Republicans like Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom are abortion rights supporters who have opposed judges on the grounds that they could threaten Roe v. Wade.President Trump, who has already filled vacancies on the federal bench at a faster pace than most previous presidents, and cemented a conservative majority on the Supreme Court with two appointments so far, is now in a stronger position to put forward even more conservative judicial nominees if he chooses to.In taking stock of conservatives\u2019 gains in the Senate on Wednesday morning \u2014 a bright spot in an election in which the Republicans lost their hold on many moderate suburban districts and seven governorships \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, vowed to continue pressing ahead with the confirmation of judges.From the South to Appalachia to the Great Plains, high turnout among evangelical Christians translated into wins for social and religious conservatives as well as anti-abortion ballot measures, demonstrating the potency of a different kind of culture war issue in the midterm elections \u2014 one that had nothing to do with immigration or caravans or the politics of grievance and revenge that President Trump campaigned on so aggressively.In West Virginia and Alabama, voters approved ballot initiatives that would essentially ban abortion, and one that even gives rights to a fetus, in the event that a new constitutional challenge to Roe succeeds at the Supreme Court \u2014 an outcome that activists on both sides of the debate believe is possible since the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh tilted the court decidedly to the right.In the North Dakota Senate race \u2014 one of three in which Republicans prevailed by defeating a Democratic incumbent who supported abortion rights \u2014 the winner, Representative Kevin Cramer, had cut an ad against late-term abortions featuring his pregnant daughter and brought his newborn grandchild onstage for his victory speech.In Missouri, the day before the election, Senator Claire McCaskill endorsed the Hyde Amendment \u2014 which bars federal programs like Medicaid from paying for most abortions \u2014 but it appeared too late to convince many voters, and she was defeated.Social conservatives said on Wednesday they were elated by the victories in the Senate and in the governors\u2019 races, which they believe provide openings to push their agenda in the judiciary and the states even if a Democratic-led House ties up legislative priorities of President Trump and Washington Republicans.\u201cWe are so much stronger than we were before,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group that led an extensive turnout operation this year in states like North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri, where incumbent Democratic senators were defeated by anti-abortion Republicans. \u201cWe win when we go back to our roots,\u201d she added.Having more anti-abortion governors in states that have previously advanced anti-abortion legislation, and a stronger anti-abortion majority in the Senate, also means that activist groups can focus their spending on the president\u2019s re-election in 2020, instead of pouring money primarily into preserving or building a Republican Senate.\u201cThe anti-choice movement is putting all of the pieces together they believe need to be in place to end legal abortion,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral Pro-Choice America. \u201cThe Republican Party has next to no rank and file left except for the extreme anti-choice movement and the white nationalist movement, who don\u2019t knock doors that much.\u201dAbortion rights advocates point to significant victories on Tuesday: There are new Democratic representatives in the House who will replace Republicans who oppose reproductive health rights, and new governors in four states \u2014 Nevada, Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 all of whom favor abortion rights.\u201cLegislatively defunding Planned Parenthood is off the table,\u201d said Andrew Taverrite, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cVoters from every political party sent a clear message last night: They want more access to health care, not less.\u201dBut even if federal legislation is no longer an option to anti-abortion activists, the courts are where the biggest battles ahead most likely lie.And while Republicans will not be in the majority in the House, the hard-line Freedom Caucus is expected to wield more influence inside the Republican conference because there will be fewer moderate Republicans in that chamber.\u201cConservatives won last night,\u201d said David McIntosh, a former House member and president of the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative advocacy group. \u201cHad Republicans all run that way, arguably we could have kept the House.\u201dThe Faith & Freedom Coalition, the Christian conservative group founded by Ralph Reed, which had an extensive ground game this cycle, found in its data that evangelicals made up more than a quarter of the midterm electorate, and about 80 percent of them voted Republican. In 2016, 81 percent of white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump.Evangelicals will also be \u201cindispensable to Trump\u2019s re-election prospects in 2020,\u201d said Mr. Reed, \u201cin what promises to be the mother of all turnout battles.\u201dMr. Trump ingratiated himself to white evangelicals by promising, and delivering, their biggest policy priorities \u2014 none more important than the naming of two conservative Supreme Court justices who had the approval of anti-abortion groups.For now, staying loyal to Mr. Trump remains a winning strategy for evangelical leaders. Ron Johnson, the pastor of Living Stones Church in northwest Indiana, who urged his congregation to support the \u201cno brainer\u201d choice of Mike Braun for Senate on Sunday, said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d with Tuesday\u2019s results.\u201cWe believe in good and evil, in God, in his agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cI honestly believe that everything the pro-choice movement was founded on is running out of gas.\u201dActivists see the potential for strengthening their base even more in 2020.Last Sunday, Brent Burnett, a congregant at Mr. Johnson\u2019s church, said he did not vote for Mr. Trump two years ago, citing concerns over his character. But now, \u201che\u2019s kept his word\u201d on the issues most important to him, Mr. Burnett said, from abortion to the economy.\u201cI\u2019d definitely vote for him next time,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Give Gig Economy Workers Equity? The S.E.C. Is Considering It", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe gig economy has created economic opportunities for millions of people. Uber and Lyft have empowered everyday drivers to become paid chauffeurs. Airbnb has made homeowners hoteliers. And TaskRabbit has opened new markets for handymen and other laborers.But much of the wealth created by these companies is not passed along to workers through conventional wages, but to a small number of insiders who own stock.In each case, employees and investors reap the vast majority of those profits, while the gig economy workers \u2014 arguably the ones creating much of the value for these companies \u2014 can\u2019t partake in those winnings. That\u2019s because they are contractors, not regular employees, and federal securities law restricts private companies from issuing shares to such workers.That may soon change.In considering a change, the S.E.C. is tacitly acknowledging that for all the value gig economy companies are creating, they are also, in some ways, contributing to the stark income inequality that is roiling society.Though contractors provide much of the labor for these tech companies, the S.E.C. noted that gig economy workers were not traditional employees who enjoyed conventional benefits and wages.Companies were supportive of the idea. Uber, Airbnb and Postmates, a food-delivery start-up, all chimed in, saying they would welcome the change.\u201cAs a sharing economy marketplace, Airbnb succeeds when these hosts succeed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe believe that enabling private companies to grant hosts and other sharing economy participants equity in the company from an earlier stage would further align incentives between such companies and their sharing economy participants to the benefit of both.\u201dEven gig workers chimed in.Yet even if gig economy workers did have access to equity, there is no guarantee that it would solve their financial woes. Though it\u2019s not clear if such equity grants would replace or reduce wages, labor experts say that relying on private company stock is risky, especially for workers lacking financial security.\u201cEquity is not wages, it\u2019s risky,\u201d said Louis Hyman, a professor at Cornell University and author of \u201cTemp,\u201d a recent book on the labor market. \u201cFor people who need to have a steady paycheck, this is not the answer.\u201dShould the S.E.C. move ahead with such a plan, there are plenty of details still to be sorted out, including the tax treatment of such equity grants. If gig economy workers receive private company stock without any way to sell it, they could be liable for taxes on those gains, without having any easy way to pay those taxes.The S.E.C. could also need to modify other rules that stipulate that if companies distribute stock to more than 2,000 people who are not employees, such as accredited investors, they need to adhere to more rigorous public reporting requirements. And in one of the rare instances when a company tried to do something similar, it failed spectacularly.Despite the inherent risks in such an arrangement, it\u2019s a fair bet that most gig economy workers would jump at the chance to get even a sliver of equity in a company like Uber or Airbnb.\u201cIt\u2019s said that \u2018the greatest social program is a job,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sament wrote the S.E.C. \u201cBut a job or contractor position with stock benefits would help hundreds of thousands of people to do more than just tread water financially. We may be able to achieve some measure of security.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Holiday Spending Should Be Strong. And Then?", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConsumer confidence points to open pocketbooks in the short run. Trade tensions, market upheaval and other factors may make the new year less bright.Americans are upbeat about the economy heading into the holiday shopping season. But that good cheer may not last long. \u201cYou see momentum going into the season, cutting across a large range of categories,\u201d said Stephen Sadove, a former Saks Fifth Avenue chief who is now a senior adviser for Mastercard. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the healthiest growth we\u2019ve seen in the past half-dozen years.\u201dIt\u2019s too soon to say whether the drop will rattle consumers. But even before the sell-off, many economists were warning that a combination of factors \u2014 including rising interest rates, a weakening housing market and a new round of tariffs set to take effect in January \u2014 could begin to slow down the economy in 2019.Last year\u2019s holiday season was the best for retailers in more than a decade. Americans are feeling even better this year.Thirty-seven percent of Americans say their finances are in better shape than they were a year ago, while 17 percent say they are worse off, according to a survey conducted for The New York Times in early November by the online research platform SurveyMonkey. Last November, just 28 percent said they were better off.Consumers say they are feeling even more positive about the future. Forty-one percent expect to be better off financially a year from now \u2014 versus just 14 percent who expect to be worse off \u2014 and a majority of survey respondents said \u201ccontinuous good times economically\u201d were in store over the next five years.\u201cConsumers are dressing up and stepping out a bit,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got money for discretionary spending, they\u2019re traveling a lot.\u201dHouseholds are also getting help from gasoline prices, which have fallen sharply in the last month after rising earlier in the year.Then there is the actual tax cut. The $1.5 trillion tax law that Republicans passed last year helped pump up consumer spending earlier this year, and economists said the effect is lingering into this holiday season. Over all, households\u2019 finances are in their strongest shape in years, with low levels of debt and rising after-tax income.United States gross domestic product has posted two straight quarters of strong growth, driven largely by robust consumer spending. Most economists expect that growth to slow in the final three months of the year as the effects of the tax cuts fade.Those concerns may be part of what has driven the stock market\u2019s recent drop. Retail stocks fell on Tuesday despite strong results, as investors worried that rising costs could eat into earnings.The market turmoil could affect consumer sentiment, especially among wealthier households more likely to own stocks. The University of Michigan survey found that confidence fell more among higher-earning households in November.But falling share prices are unlikely to hurt holiday sales much, Mr. Song said. Most Americans don\u2019t own stocks outside of their retirement accounts, and many have already set their holiday budgets \u2014 or have even begun to shop. A Bank of America survey found that about 20 percent of consumers started their holiday shopping before November, and 67 percent said they planned to shop over the extended Thanksgiving weekend.\u201cI have a tough time really seeing this hurting consumer spending,\u201d Mr. Song said of the market declines. \u201cA lot of the shopping is already baked in.\u201dSurveyMonkey took its survey the week of the election, conducting about 4,300 online interviews on or before Election Day and 5,000 after the results were known. Among Democrats and independents, the results changed little over the course of the survey.But for Republicans, there was a clear shift in outlook: Among Republicans interviewed before the election, 66 percent said they expected their finances to improve over the next year. Among those interviewed afterward, that share fell to 59 percent. The effect was particularly pronounced among strong supporters of Mr. Trump, who showed a nine-point decline after the election in the share expecting their finances to be better a year from now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Sweet-Talks Xi, Trying to Ease Trade Fears Before Midterms", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 When President Trump said Thursday he held a \u201clong and very good conversation\u201d on trade with President Xi Jinping of China, it kicked off a brief rally in financial markets and a flurry of questions about why the tensions between Washington and Beijing had suddenly eased.The answer is, they haven\u2019t really. The explanation for Mr. Trump\u2019s newly soothing tone lies less in the state of trade negotiations \u2014 which remain on hold \u2014 than in the president\u2019s domestic political calculations, particularly in states heavily dependent on trade, like Indiana.\u201cWe\u2019ve had very good discussions with China,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House, as he left for a pair of political rallies in Indianapolis and Huntington, W.Va. \u201cWe\u2019re getting much closer to doing something. They very much want to make a deal.\u201dThe president\u2019s enthusiasm was at odds with his advisers, who said nothing much had changed with Beijing. But it cheered investors in a market increasingly depressed by worries about a trade war. And analysts said it would pacify farmers and factory workers across the Midwest.Mr. Trump came to Indiana to campaign for Mike Braun, a Republican who is trying to unseat the Democratic incumbent, Senator Joe Donnelly. Mr. Donnelly has a slim lead in the polls, but Mr. Braun has made inroads lately, in part by challenging his opponent on trade.\u201cI spoke to President Xi today,\u201d Mr. Trump told a raucous crowd at a high school here. \u201cThey want to make a deal, but we have to have a fair deal. We have to have a deal that\u2019s fair for the United States.\u201dThe president took credit for the recently revised North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he called a \u201cgiant victory for Indiana farmers, manufacturers and dairy producers.\u201dThe trade showdown with China, however, has whipsawed Indiana, benefiting it in some ways while hurting it in others. Steel mills in the industrial north are prospering because of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on China and other steel exporters. But soybean farmers are suffering because of the retaliatory tariffs China imposed on agricultural exports.Companies that make auto parts are able to charge higher prices because of a loss of competition from China. But the recreational vehicle industry, one of Indiana\u2019s manufacturing pillars, worries that sales will be hurt if it passes along those higher prices to customers.\u201cThe R. V. industry could be in a period of transition,\u201d said Richard Curtin, an economist at the University of Michigan, who studies the industry. A deal with China \u201cwould be widely welcomed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe closer you are to these industries, the more it would be welcomed.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s phone call to Mr. Xi, however, did not appear to be linked to any progress in trade negotiations. Those talks have been on hiatus for weeks, and officials said they did not expect any progress at least until the two presidents meet, which is likely to be at the Group of 20 meeting of industrialized nations in Buenos Aires early next month.Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, dismissed reports that Mr. Trump asked his cabinet to draft a trade deal with China and said \u201cthere\u2019s no massive movement\u201d to get something done quickly.\u201cWe\u2019re doing a normal, routine run-through of things that we\u2019ve already put together and normal preparation,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on Friday on CNBC. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the cusp of a deal.\u201dStill, after warning for weeks that China was not ready to negotiate on trade with the United States, Mr. Trump took an uncharacteristically conciliatory tone after his call with Mr. Xi, which was both unusually long \u2014 56 minutes \u2014 and initiated by him.Mr. Xi issued a similarly warm statement on Friday, reaffirming the importance of his personal relationship with Mr. Trump and predicting that the two sides could reach a deal. Chinese officials have been taken aback by the vehemence of Mr. Trump\u2019s language against them, and Mr. Xi\u2019s response suggested he was eager to lower the temperature.Administration officials caution that the gulf between the two countries remained wide over issues like market access and China\u2019s alleged purloining of technology from American companies. Any deal, they said, would require specific pledges on the part of the Chinese.In a sign of the administration\u2019s determination to keep up the pressure, the Justice Department took legal action this week against two companies based in China and Taiwan, accusing them of stealing trade secrets from Micron Technology, an American technology company.The Trump administration remains divided internally between officials who want to take an uncompromising approach toward China \u2014 allying the European Union and other trading partners in a united front \u2014 and those who favor cutting some kind of deal.In recent months, Mr. Trump has sided with the hard-liners, though he remains unpredictable, particularly when there are other considerations at play, as his most recent about-face demonstrates.Mr. Trump, people who know him said, was also motivated by a desire to give the markets a tonic, days before voters go to the polls. The president has regularly boasted about rising stock prices since he took office, but the markets have given up those gains in recent weeks.The Chinese are also seeking to defuse the situation at a time when their own economy and currency are showing signs of weakening.Still, they remain confounded by Mr. Trump \u2014 especially his recent claims that they are attempting to interfere in the midterm elections \u2014 and they still feel burned by the president\u2019s rejection of a steel deal negotiated last year by his commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross.Craig Allen, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents 200 American companies that do business with China, said Chinese nationalism would make it \u201cdifficult for any Chinese leader to accept anything that is a less than equal agreement.\u201dTrade concerns have dominated the Senate race in Indiana, with Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Braun, both of whom have business ties, accusing each other of selling out American workers.\u201cI voted against every bad trade deal that hurts Hoosiers,\u201d Mr. Donnelly said in one recent campaign ad, in which he stands next to a pickup truck loaded with boxes of auto parts sold by Mr. Braun\u2019s company \u2014 each bearing a sticker that says, \u201cMade in China.\u201d \u201cMike Braun has used those same deals to outsource Hoosier jobs to China.\u201dSome analysts here said they were dubious that Mr. Trump\u2019s shifting tone on trade would drastically change the outcome in Indiana, a state he won by 19 points in 2016 and in which he remains popular.\u201cI have been amazed by the steadfast support of farmers for the president,\u201d said Mike Yoder, a Republican who is the commissioner of Elkhart County. \u201cThey have been willing to stick by this president, and if there is some plan for an endgame on tariffs, it has escaped me.\u201dBut Mr. Yoder said he welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s softer tone. Elkhart County is a manufacturing hub, with assembly lines that produce recreational vehicles, as well as trucks and buses. Tariffs on steel and aluminum are driving up the cost of parts for these manufacturers.\u201cIt is a good message,\u201d Mr. Yoder said, \u201cbecause for Indiana \u2014 and especially Elkhart County \u2014 these tariffs need to go away.\u201dGlenn Thrush and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

He temporarily suspended Parliament but then agreed to reconvene the 225-member body on Nov. 14. At that time, lawmakers were supposed to choose between the two rivals for prime minister.On Friday, a spokesman for Mr. Rajapaksa acknowledged that his party did not yet have enough support to win that floor test. Hours later, Mr. Sirisena signed papers that dissolved Parliament and called for elections on Jan. 5 to choose new lawmakers.\u201cThe political darkness of authoritarianism is engulfing us once more,\u201d said Jayadeva Uyangoda, a professor of political science at Colombo University, in a lecture on Thursday.Ajith Perera, a lawmaker from the United National Party, said that it would urge the independent Elections Commission, which would oversee any voting, not to conduct any elections. \u201cWe are appealing to the Elections Commission to resolve this issue without bloodshed,\u201d he said.While Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party, the Sri Lanka People\u2019s Front, does not have deep support in Parliament, it performed very well in local elections in February. It would most likely win any parliamentary election held now amid popular discontent with the struggling Sri Lankan economy.The issue is very likely to end up before the Supreme Court, with Mr. Wickremesinghe\u2019s party and citizen groups already preparing petitions challenging the dissolution of Parliament.The country has been in political gridlock since Oct. 26, when Mr. Sirisena dismissed Mr. Wickremesinghe, an electoral ally since 2015, and swore in Mr. Rajapaksa as the new prime minister. Before the 2015 elections, Mr. Sirisena had been a cabinet member in the government of Mr. Rajapaksa, a former president who had been accused of corruption and human rights violations during the country\u2019s long civil war against Tamil separatists.Mr. Wickremesinghe has refused to leave the prime minister\u2019s residence in Colombo, the nation\u2019s capital, and his ministers claim that they remain the country\u2019s lawful government.Jayampathy Wickremaratne, one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most senior constitutional law experts, said that a constitutional amendment \u2014 championed by Mr. Sirisena and passed in April 2015 \u2014 allowed the dissolution of Parliament only after four and a half years of its five-year term, or upon the request of two-thirds of the members. The next regularly scheduled parliamentary elections is August 2020.Mr. Sirisena cited a different provision of the constitution in dissolving Parliament on Friday and calling for elections sooner.Dharisha Bastians reported from Colombo, Sri Lanka, and Vindu Goel from Goa, India.Advertisement"}

It could have created 50,000 high-paying jobs in a place with higher-than-average unemployment.

{"Headline": "3 Books That Take Us Inside the Lives of Britain\u2019s Royals", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistBritain\u2019s modern-day royal household appears to run like a well-oiled machine: It has its own human resources department and employment comes with a standard package of benefits. But it was not always so. In this domestic history of five centuries of palace life, Tinniswood paints a picture of barely controlled chaos.If a flattering history of British royalty exists, this isn\u2019t it, perhaps because no one looks good through the eyes of servants. Sovereigns, courtiers and unruly royal children are cast in unforgiving light as Tinniswood, in some cases quite literally, airs their dirty laundry. While a few sympathetic characters emerge, for the most part members of the royal family appear variously insane, opportunistic, petulant and mercurial.Pulled from ledgers, maps and other correspondence, this is a chronicle of beleaguered officials\u2019 attempts to impose some structure and economy on the royal household. The subjects are equerries and clerks, courtiers and grooms of the stool (an office that, in its original incarnation, was responsible for keeping the sovereign company during his or her bowel movements). A good portion of the people employed by the royals appear to have been freeloaders.Tinniswood is constrained by the source materials available to him, which at times can make for dry reading. This is a history of stuff as much as people, especially in the early years: food, jewels, robes, tapestries, renovations. Procuring, managing and distributing the goods the royal household needs seems to be half the job of maintaining the crown. However, the author displays a knack for uncovering the absurd and delightful. A wit borne of a deep intimacy with his subject shows through. It all has the effect of bringing the monarchy down to earth. Behind the somewhat surreal pomp and pageant, Tinniswood reveals the all-too-human reality of royalty.Legend has it that if the ravens of the Tower of London ever leave, the kingdom will fall. Hence the need for a ravenmaster. And that\u2019s where Skaife comes in. In this memoir, he dives into the day-to-day minutiae of the birds\u2019 care and keeping, their habits and history, and the journey that led him to become their steward.As ravenmaster, a post he took up after more than two decades of military service, Skaife is responsible for more than just the birds. He serves as a tour guide, a ceremonial guard and an amateur historian, bridging the distance between Britain\u2019s past and present. An earnest and exuberant custodian, he\u2019s enthralled by the mythologies of the ravens and the storied, haunted tower they inhabit.His esoteric topic at times clashes with the clunky colloquialisms Skaife deploys when talking about himself. He identifies with the birds, drawing parallels between his identity as a soldier and the symbolism of the ravens, since both are associated with death. But to his readers the connection can feel like a bit of a stretch \u2014 personally meaningful but not particularly effective on the page.Thankfully, the awkward analogizing is soon forgotten as Skaife plumbs the depths of his knowledge of raven lore, of their place in history and in literature. And he becomes more poetic in his recollections of his life as he shares memories from his time in the military and his love for his wife.Ultimately, Skaife\u2019s enthusiasm is contagious. He is entirely likable, and even if the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for his memoir isn\u2019t immediately clear, the corner of British history that he lives, breathes and embodies is illuminated by his efforts.Before a media circus engulfed Princess Diana, her children and eventually their spouses, there was the first celebrity prince, who briefly became King Edward VIII. The media darling of the American and British press, Prince Edward was for a while considered the greatest hope for the monarchy. Of course, he\u2019s best known now for abdicating the throne in order to marry his divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. More recently, the prince was portrayed rather unflatteringly on the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown.\u201dThe Prince Edward of Powell\u2019s account is somewhat more sympathetic. Here he\u2019s seen as an enthusiast of all things American, the modernizing and \u201cdemocratic\u201d prince of the people, the celebrity and would-be king. Powell traces the influence of this American connection on Edward\u2019s personal identity, and on his ultimate, unprecedented decision. Edward\u2019s Americanization, Powell says, fundamentally altered his sense of himself, separated him from his family and sowed the seeds for his abdication. The argument is convincing and serves as a corrective for histories that have laid the blame for his action squarely at Wallis Simpson\u2019s feet.In writing a history of Edward\u2019s life through this perspective, Powell has chronicled the story of America\u2019s growing cultural, political and economic power as seen through foreign eyes. The United States of the prince\u2019s imagination is a familiar one, consonant with America\u2019s own dominant narrative about itself: full of possibility, innovation, freedom and adventure. The telling, probably by design, illuminates much about the prince and his country, but little new about America.As readable as it is dense, Powell\u2019s book is rich and thorough, expertly crafted and completely accessible. An adept storyteller and historian, Powell manages to humanize a monarch who has at times been dwarfed by the voluminous publicity surrounding his abdication.Emma L.

{"Headline": "How to Have a Conversation With Your Angry Uncle Over the Holidays", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "Advertisement\nThe holidays are a beloved time of year because we can gather with relatives from afar. But they\u2019re dreaded for the same reason.Many of us aren\u2019t accustomed to socializing with people who think differently from us, especially about politics. Our political attitudes and beliefs are intertwined with our most basic human needs \u2013 needs for safety, belonging, identity, self-esteem and purpose \u2013 and when they\u2019re threatened, we\u2019re biologically wired to respond as if we\u2019re in physical peril.So how can you talk with people who disagree with you without setting off this fight-or-flight response? Drawing on extensive online dialogues with conservatives and my own background in psychiatry and political psychology, I developed a five-step method to help people have difficult conversations.Across the country, members of my nonprofit group, Smart Politics, are using this process to heal relationships damaged in the wake of the 2016 election. Many report being able to discuss politics with  family members for the first time in years.The holidays are the perfect time for you to give it a try. Before the big day, practice discussing a couple of difficult topics with Angry Uncle Bot, a chat program created to help teach you the techniques.\n\nAs you converse with the Angry Uncle Bot, you\u2019ll notice a pattern. A handful of responses move the interaction forward while others make it halt or careen.Successful responses are part of a five-step process that makes conversations with the Angry Uncle Bot (and real angry uncles) less polarized and more productive.AskListenReflectAgreeShareReflectAskListenShareAgreeAt the heart of the method is a simple idea: People cannot communicate effectively about politics when they feel threatened. Direct attacks \u2013 whether in the form of logical argument, evidence, or name-calling \u2013 trigger the sympathetic nervous system, limiting our capacity for reason, empathy, and self-reflection.To have productive conversations, we first need to make people feel safe.Most political conversations founder because challenges to our beliefs trigger our sympathetic nervous system.The goal is ensuring people feel safe enough during political dialogues to avoid this. That way the rational part of their brains stays in control and they\u2019re better able to hear, absorb and adapt to new information.While it\u2019s a powerful approach, it isn\u2019t easy. It takes patience, tolerance and conscious engagement to get through all five steps. The method puts the burden for keeping the conversation calm on you: Not only must you not trigger the other person, but you must not get triggered yourself.Given the challenge, it\u2019s tempting to avoid political discussions in mixed company altogether. Why risk provoking your angry uncle when you can chat about pumpkin pie instead? The answer is that when we choose avoidance over engagement, we are sacrificing a critical opportunity and responsibility to facilitate social and political change.Throughout American history, important strides were made because people dared to share their political views with relatives. The civil rights movement, the women\u2019s movement, the antiwar movement, the gay rights movement, the struggle for marriage equality \u2013 all gained acceptance through difficult conversations among family members who initially disagreed vehemently with one another.To improve political discourse, remember your goal isn\u2019t to score points, vent or put people in their place; it\u2019s to make a difference. And that means sharing your message in a way that people who disagree with you \u2013 including your angry uncle \u2013 can hear.Produced by Stuart A. ThompsonAdvertisement"}

But that\u2019s not coercing anyone \u2014 it\u2019s isolating America.In the show, though, counterattacks are frequent, and the Trump administration is now facing its own backlash.While the United States\u2019 use of sanctions has been gradually increasing for decades, Mr. Trump has made them the core of his foreign policy. From Iran to North Korea and Russia to Venezuela, from the drug dealers of Colombia to the bomb makers of Hamas, this administration\u2019s first \u2014 and sometimes only \u2014 instrument to shape world events, punish rivals and discourage challenges to American authority has been sanctions.\u201cSanctions are the perfect tool for someone like President Trump, who arrived into office with no governing experience and no real relationships in Congress, the bureaucracy or among world leaders,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cSanctions let him govern on his own. He just has to write an executive order, and it\u2019s done.\u201dThe big problem, however, is that sanctions rarely work. Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, said that in his study of 100 years of sanctions efforts, 90 percent of the penalties applied for national security purposes ultimately failed. In some cases, they were disastrous: Japan\u2019s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor was in large part a response to American oil sanctions.Iran proves the point. Tehran\u2019s regional meddling was particularly ambitious from 2012 to 2015 \u2014 just as sanctions were at their most onerous. There is a small chance that sanctions could lead to the overthrow of Iran\u2019s government, but the administration has repeatedly insisted that regime change is not its goal.Besides being largely unsuccessful, the Trump administration\u2019s unilateral use of sanctions has fueled a campaign led by Europe, Russia and China to remake the financial system, removing the United States from its heart. The consequences for America\u2019s power, economy and alliances could be profound.Now, with Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to walk away from the Iran nuclear accord and threaten allies who have remained in the deal, the backlash is gathering steam. European diplomats say they are determined, despite real challenges, to follow through on their promise to create a \u201cspecial-purpose vehicle\u201d independent of the dollar to continue commercial relations with Iran. Trump administration officials have reacted with derision and fury and have quietly threatened to sanction the entity. Chinese and Russian officials have for years been trying to sell Europe on financial messaging and trade vehicles that skirt the dollar and the United States. So far, these efforts have had little success. That could change: \u201cThe world has been comfortable with the dollar as the currency of reference,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a French economist and senior fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. \u201cBut that could change if doing so is seen as carrying a prize in terms of greater geopolitical independence.\u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s critics worry that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who has said the new sanctions have isolated the United States and not Iran, may be right. They also worry that while Iran\u2019s economy will suffer in the short term, the new sanctions will spur the creation of financial mechanisms that exclude the United States, undermining American power, economic might and ability to track and contain terrorism in ways that could far outlast the Trump administration.\u201cIt is foolishness for the United States to accelerate the development of these financial alternatives, which are a profound security threat in the long run,\u201d said Elizabeth Rosenberg, a sanctions official during the Obama administration.Advertisement"}

Whatever happens on Tuesday isn\u2019t going to decide what happens in 2020. Or am I missing the forest for the trees here?But you\u2019re right that Trump will try to turn Nancy Pelosi into the new version of immigrant caravans.

But shrinking sales forecasts from Nvidia and Applied Materials show that companies are as prone as ever to economic cycles and excess inventory.The past decade has been a happy one for the traditionally boom-and-bust industry. It has become harder, and more expensive, to produce evermore sophisticated chips. To cope with rising costs, the industry consolidated, which restrained over-expansionist tendencies. At the same time, chip demand continued to rise. Profits boomed, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose sixfold over the past decade.One of the hottest areas has been graphics processors. In addition to making games more realistic, these chips are useful for machine learning, self-driving cars and mining cryptocurrencies. Nvidia, a company that has specialized in graphics chips, saw its stock rise 20-fold over the past decade, raising its market capitalization to $175 billion last month.The euphoria blinded investors to the fact that other causes of past booms have not been overturned. Demand is cyclical, and a booming economy has inflated chip sales. In sectors where demand outruns supply, customers order more than they need, in hopes of receiving adequate supply. And chip-makers invest heavily to meet expected future sales.Nvidia\u2019s warning that next quarter\u2019s revenue will be about 20 percent less than analysts had expected is a classic case. The company blamed a burst cryptocurrency bubble, saying it would take another quarter or two to work through excess chip supply. The company\u2019s chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, said that he was as \u201csurprised by it, as anyone else\u201d and noted that rivals faced similar problems. Perhaps, but demand for gaming and data center chips also is coming off the boil. Inventories and accounts receivable have risen sharply, and now total a third more than estimated sales for next quarter.Inventory problems are hard for chip firms. High fixed costs mean that profits rise sharply alongside volumes, while margins fall through the floor as inventories are worked off. Advanced chips shed value as they sit around, losing their technological edge. Firms usually cut capital expenditure to deal with bloat. A warning by Applied Materials \u2014 the biggest maker of equipment for chip-makers \u2014 of slower future sales suggests that this is happening across the industry.This chip cycle is starting to resemble past ones.Advertisement"}

People would use the idiom to convey that they thought so highly of someone they would attend something as distasteful as a public hanging with him.But given its clear negative connotation, Mr. Reed said, most people would not dare to use the phrase in 2018.\u201cIt has fallen so far out of favor,\u201d Mr. Reed said in an interview. \u201cI cannot believe that someone would use that today.\u201dMichael Pfeifer, a history professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who has written several books about lynching in the United States, said the comment must be interpreted within the context of Mississippi\u2019s history of lynching.\u201cSenator Hyde-Smith\u2019s remark is curious and could certainly be read as referencing Mississippi\u2019s white supremacist history,\u201d Mr. Pfeifer said on Monday. \u201cEven as an \u2018expression of regard,\u2019 this racialized historical context in Mississippi is important for understanding such a remark.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mississippi\u2019s Era of Outsize Clout in Washington Is Waning", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOXFORD, Miss. \u2014 It is difficult to miss Mississippi\u2019s trophies of power.There is the Thad Cochran Research Center, standing just off the University of Mississippi\u2019s tailgating hub, and in Hattiesburg, the Trent Lott National Center for Excellence in Economic Development and Entrepreneurship. Close to the Arkansas border, the Jamie Whitten Delta States Research Center towers over rural Washington County. And hundreds of miles toward the coast, the John C. Stennis Space Center fills almost 14,000 acres.Few states have held as much outsize clout on Capitol Hill over the last half-century as Mississippi \u2014 power that brought billions of federal dollars to the nation\u2019s poorest state and gave its relatively small population of about three million residents sweeping sway in Washington. But the era of far-reaching Mississippi influence is waning.When Congress convenes in January, just two of the state\u2019s six lawmakers will have held their seats for at least a decade, a peril in a capital where seniority often rules. And Tuesday\u2019s special runoff election to fill the seat of Senator Cochran, who headed the Appropriations Committee at the end of his 45-year career in Congress, was a measure of how the state\u2019s stature has changed: In contrast to Mr. Cochran\u2019s last campaign four years ago, the recent race won by Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith scarcely focused on how candidates would be able to bend Washington to Mississippi\u2019s wishes.\u201cWe could suffer tremendously,\u201d said State Senator Willie Simmons, a Democrat whose district runs through the chronically impoverished Delta. \u201cMississippi, although it\u2019s a small, rural state, has a history of being in the right place at the right time as far as the federal government is concerned.\u201dBut Mississippi\u2019s extraordinary accrual of power was more than mere luck. It was also a product of parliamentary tradition, cultivated alliances in Washington and the political rhythms of a sparsely populated state with little apparent desire for congressional turnover \u2014 all of which is now at risk of being diluted with a less-powerful federal delegation.Indeed, the South as a whole was famous for accumulating congressional seniority throughout the 20th century, so much so that the journalist William S. White wrote in the 1950s, \u201cThe Senate might be described without too much violence to fact as the South\u2019s unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg.\u201dFew states exacted their payback like Mississippi, which sent just five senators to Washington from 1941 until Mr. Cochran resigned in April 2018. They also gained clout in the House by repeatedly returning lawmakers like Mr. Whitten and G. V. Montgomery, known as Sonny. For a spell in the late 1980s, Mr. Stennis and Mr. Whitten were simultaneously leading the appropriations committees in their chambers, an extraordinary concentration of power for one state.\u201cWhat Mississippians have done, and we\u2019ve lost a beat or two recently, is elect really good people and keep them there,\u201d said Mr. Lott, who was first elected to the House in 1972 and served as the Senate Republican leader \u2014 only after jousting with Mr. Cochran for the post.The Mississippi delegation, Mr. Lott noted, will hardly be without influence in January.Senator Roger Wicker, who took Mr. Lott\u2019s seat, is the incoming chairman of the Commerce Committee, which has broad jurisdiction over issues ranging from broadband to rail. And Mr. Wicker is second in line on the Senate Armed Services Committee, an important panel in a state with multiple military installations and a large shipyard on the Gulf Coast.Further, once Democrats assume power in the House, Representative Bennie Thompson is poised to take over the Homeland Security Committee.But some fear that those posts will not deliver as many perks for a state long accustomed to them.\u201cElected officials and the business leadership in Mississippi have taken for granted a lot of the ways to get things done in Mississippi because of people like Thad Cochran,\u201d said Ray Mabus, a former Democratic governor who was Navy secretary during the Obama administration. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to have to work harder and be more imaginative to get the same results.\u201dDaniel W. Jones, a former chancellor of the University of Mississippi, put it bluntly: \u201cWe don\u2019t have as much firepower as we did in the past.\u201d\u201cMississippi\u2019s relationships on the Hill and in the White House are strong,\u201d said Mr. Bryant, a Republican. \u201cI have full faith in our congressional delegation to continue to deliver for the people of Mississippi and the country.\u201d\u201cSeniority in the Senate is important, but Senator Hyde-Smith also understands that hard work and forging strong relationships is just as important to accomplish good things for Mississippi,\u201d said Chris Gallegos, her spokesman.And Mr. Wicker, striding through the Capitol complex on Wednesday, highlighted the positions he has gained in nearly 11 years in the Senate and played down the state\u2019s lack of old bulls in Washington.\u201cThat\u2019s not something that I lie awake about,\u201d he said.That may be because, while seniority still counts a great deal in Washington, it does not confer the same deity-level status as in the past.Congress has done away with earmarks, the spending projects lawmakers tucked in spending bills for their states, and committee chairmen are not the imposing barons they were before power flowed almost entirely from the leadership, as it does today in the House and the Senate.Further, while Mississippi still suffers from grinding poverty and is deeply reliant on federal aid, the state has made private-sector gains\u201cWe have a much more diverse economy than most people realize,\u201d said former Gov. Haley Barbour, pointing to a pair of auto plants and the presence of corporate titans like Raytheon, General Electric and Caterpillar. \u201cOur economy is vastly different than it was even 25 years ago.\u201dBut the state still suffers from deep tensions over race, and black residents still face racism as well as structural impediments that linger from Jim Crow.And as Mississippi enters a political existence with the soft-spoken Mr. Cochran absent from public life, even residents who believe Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks about the hanging were misconstrued recognize the embarrassment her statement brought.To this end, her ascent not only alarms some in Mississippi because it illustrates their diminished clout \u2014 but also because she revived nagging stereotypes and unpleasant realities about the state\u2019s Old South tendencies.\u201cI don\u2019t think many people are going to take this senator very seriously, partly because of the kind of campaign she ran, and partly because she doesn\u2019t seem to have the heft or capacity to be an effective U.S. senator,\u201d Mr. Mabus said. \u201cFor a small state, this is going to mean a real deal in clout, in influence and, maybe, to some extent, in reputation.\u201dMississippians take deep pride in pointing out that, despite their unsightly worst-in-the-nation rankings, they have long produced a disproportionate number of talented writers, artists and musicians. And, they note, the state has more black elected officials than any other in the country.But Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s misstep helped obscure her own milestone.\u201cWe can\u2019t even get a moment of positive attention for that,\u201d complained Laurin Stennis, an artist and the granddaughter of the former senator, pointing to the history-making options the state\u2019s voters had before them.\u201cI think it behooves her to assume she\u2019ll have her opponent,\u201d said Mr. Barbour, noting that a younger Republican could make an argument about the need to elect somebody who can amass more seniority. (Ms. Hyde-Smith is 59.)For now, some Republicans believe she ought to make a more demonstrative statement about her commitment to inclusion and try to unify the state after a difficult few weeks.\u201cShe might do well to look at some rebuilding,\u201d said Mr. Wicker, invoking his own efforts to build relationships with black Mississippians.Asked if his state\u2019s ugly history put a special burden on Mississippi\u2019s leaders to demonstrate sensitivity on matters of race, he did not hesitate.\u201cThat may very well be one of the lessons that our team has learned,\u201d the senior senator said.While Mr. Wicker did not urge Ms. Hyde-Smith to mirror his position, he did note his support for one measure that may help heal old wounds: getting rid of his state\u2019s flag, which features the Confederate battle flag.Alan Blinder reported from Oxford, and Jonathan Martin from Washington.Advertisement"}

In the same vein, high-quality development of China\u2019s economy in the future can only be guaranteed with greater openness. I have made it clear once and again that China\u2019s door will never be closed. It will only open still wider.\u201dThe six-day expo in Shanghai is believed to be the biggest import exhibition ever held with 3,600 companies from around 130 countries and regions in attendance. Also present were leaders from 18 countries.In his speech Xi once again made a strong defense of globalization as he did in his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2017 as well as at the Boao Forum in Hainan in April. \u201cPeople with vision in the world would agree that economic globalization, as an irreversible trend of history, has greatly boosted global growth. This is an overarching trend, something that is independent of people\u2019s will. What we, mankind, can do is to understand, adapt to, and apply the law of history instead of trying to prevent it from happening. The wheel of history, indeed, will keep rolling forward no matter what.\u201d \u201cIt was a strong statement of steady as you go. China is not going to be deflected from its basic strategy and position. Xi was saying that the Chinese economy is basically in a sound position and that it is more than capable of handling its current challenges, despite what the speculation might be in the West,\u201d he said.In his speech Xi highlighted the importance of the Chinese consumer to the global economy with China\u2019s goods imports expected to exceed $30 trillion and services $10 trillion over the next 15 years.\u201cWe will stimulate the potential for increased imports. China\u2019s initiative to expand imports is not a choice of expediency. It is a future-oriented step taken to embrace the world and promote common development.\u201dXi also pledged to continue opening up the China economy, building on the measures to open up finance, including insurance, and the automotive sector to foreign companies that he announced at Boao.Since that announcement German carmaker BMW has announced that it is taking majority control of its China joint venture with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings.He said China would continue to steadily increase the openness of the financial sector, services as well as agriculture, mining and manufacturing, telecommunications, education, medical services and culture.He also pledged that the foreign ownership limits in both education and medical services would be eased. Xi\u2019s message on openness was welcomed also by company executives.Vladimir Makatsaria, chairman of Johnson & Johnson China, said Xi sent exactly the right signals to business.\u201cHis messages on the deepening of China\u2019s reform and opening up, promoting trade liberalization and optimizing the business environment certainly give us great confidence in continuing to grow our business in China,\u201d he said.Christian Hartel, a member of the executive board of Wacker Chemie, the German chemicals company, said the projections for China\u2019s imports contained in Xi\u2019s speech were encouraging.\u201cWe will surely benefit from the increasing consumption power in China. And we will continue our investment in expanding production capacity in China.\u201dToshihiro Ueda, chief representative in China for AGC Co., the Tokyo-based manufacturers of glass, chemicals and other products, welcomed Xi\u2019s message on further opening up.\u201c[This] has really boosted our morale. China has turned from global manufacturing powerhouse into an international open market. With it being more open, China will gradually become the hub of innovation.\u201d Xi in his speech placed considerable emphasis on innovation, which he said was now the \u201cpremier engine for development.\u201dChina is aiming to make major advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and advanced manufacturing and the country also has a national goal to become a global technology leader by 2035.\u201cOnly with bold innovation and reform can we break the bottlenecks in global growth. The world economy has just emerged from the shadow of the international financial crisis and recovery is still unstable. There is an urgent need for concerted efforts of countries in the world to promote scientific innovation and foster new growth drivers,\u201d he said.Edward Tse, chief executive officer and founder of Gao Feng Advisory, a management consultancy, said innovation was vital for foreign companies wanting to operate and sell into the China market.\u201cCompanies complain a lot about market access in China but that essentially is the old game. The new game is technology.

{"Headline": "\u2018We Don\u2019t Do the Black Friday Madness\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "In rural Pennsylvania, the family-owned department store Dunham\u2019s caters to those who feel left behind by e-commerce or simply prefer to do their shopping at a slower pace. Supported byThe \u201c33 hour\u201d sale at Dunham\u2019s begins the morning after Thanksgiving and lasts through Monday, when the local schools are closed for deer-hunting season. There are no giant sales on flat-screen televisions or stockpiles of the hottest holiday toy. The big draw is the hot chocolate and the chance to win a $100 gift card.Change comes slowly to Dunham\u2019s, one of the few small family-owned department stores still operating in the United States. The store was founded in the early 1900s in Wellsboro, Pa., a town of about 3,200 people surrounded by dairy farms, fracking fields and woods.\u201cWe don\u2019t do the Black Friday madness,\u2019\u2019 said Nancy Dunham, 75, who runs the store with her husband and two daughters. \u201cWe are trying to offer something different.\u201dThe Dunham family, now in its fourth generation as retailers, has created a niche with shoppers who feel left behind by e-commerce, or choose to opt out of it.Dunham\u2019s draws from a 50-mile radius in north central Pennsylvania, a region that is home to many older people who don\u2019t typically shop online. Many regular customers do not have home computers, tablets or smartphones. The store also attracts tourists and retirees who have moved to the area.Dunham\u2019s occupies three adjoining buildings on Main Street of varying heights and design that reflect the store\u2019s history, but also its continuity. The largest of the storefronts, a three-story building constructed during the Great Depression, carries the family name chiseled into the concrete facade.On a snowy morning the week before Thanksgiving, the scent of cinnamon rolls warming in the cafe wafted through every nook of the store\u2019s 35,000 square feet. Shoppers trickled in from the cold: A man browsed for sweaters, a woman looked for winter boots for her mother, and Jim Rice hunted for a lined flannel shirt in a black and yellow pattern.Mr. Rice thinks nothing of driving 28 miles from his home near the New York border to browse at Dunham\u2019s.Mr. Rice worked for 55 years in a glass company warehouse in Elmira, N.Y., while also taking care of his wife, who had Alzheimer\u2019s. She died last year on Christmas night.\u201cI always liked this store,\u201d said Mr. Rice, 77. \u201cThey know how to treat you.\u201dDunham\u2019s has tried to build its business around local needs and tastes.The town considered the plant so important, residents said, that people used to take turns climbing to the top of a hotel roof to scout for German planes that might want to bomb it.Those days are long gone. Dairy farming is struggling and the glass factory has closed. The area, home to a natural mountain gorge billed as the \u201cGrand Canyon of Pennsylvania,\u201d attracts tourists during the warmer months, second homeowners and hunters. But the winter months are slow.Fracking \u2014 the process of extracting natural oil and gas by shooting water and other fluids deep underground \u2014 has helped pump money into the economy. But workers in that industry tend to stay in town for a few weeks at a time and then go home to their families in other states. The gas companies supply many of the workers with gear and clothing, which means they don\u2019t usually shop at Dunham\u2019s.With no hope for a boom that could transform the local economy, the store takes small steps to try to stoke sales. When large retailers cut back on an older women\u2019s clothing line, known for polyester pants with elastic waistbands and shortened cuffs, Dunham\u2019s expanded its offerings.\u201cMy customer, the little old lady, is being forgotten,\u201d said Nancy Dunham\u2019s daughter Ann Dunham Rawson. \u201cOther companies don\u2019t think that type clothing is much fun.\u201dThe bankruptcies of national chains like Sears and Bon-Ton are driving traffic to Dunham\u2019s, too. But the demise of those large stores also means fewer suppliers of affordable clothing, which makes it harder for Dunham\u2019s to locate product. Ms. Rawson came of age in retail of the 1990s, when consumerism was at its peak.\u201cPeople just bought everything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the brakes have been put on that. They don\u2019t want to own stuff that sits around the house collecting dust. They want experiences.\u201dAfter college, she went to work for Lord & Taylor in Raleigh, N.C. Within a few years, her father, John Dunham, asked her to come home.She hesitated at first, leery of returning to rural Pennsylvania at age 25. But she wanted to work alongside her mother and father, an experienced merchant and merchandiser.The store has survived a flood, fire and a tornado. But the most difficult period came during the past few years.\u201cI am struggling with who our men\u2019s customer is,\u201d Ms. Rawson said.Women\u2019s clothing can be equally confounding. Ms. Rawson said Wellsboro had never been a \u201clittle black dress\u201d type of town. Ms. Mahosky studied dance in college and now works at a car dealership nearby. She shopped at Dunham\u2019s as a child and realized how much she missed the store when she moved away.\u201cI think my generation is craving that experience of not being overwhelmed by technology,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am probably a bit of anomaly.\u201dTo Ms. Rawson, 2016 and 2017 was the \u201cthis is it\u201d moment, when the store\u2019s future seemed most in doubt. Her father, 81, was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, and both of his brothers, who were also involved in the business, died.The family spent months applying to Starbucks for the right to sell its coffee in the cafe. It\u2019s now the only place selling Starbucks for many miles, attracting gas workers who line up in their fire-retardant jumpsuits and big boots for drinks topped with whipped cream and drizzled with caramel.\u201cThe things you see in a small town,\u201d said Nancy Dunham, chuckling.That coffee brought Mary Murphy, 70, and Nancy Szabo, 72, to Dunham\u2019s last week. The two friends sat by the cafe window overlooking Main Street, deep in quiet conversation. They were talking, as they do every Tuesday, about dreams.Their \u201cdream group\u201d meets weekly, often in the cafe in Dunham\u2019s. They spend an hour trying to help each other interpret what their dreams might mean. \u201cWrite down every dream you remember in a loose leaf notebook and put the date on the top,\u201d Ms. Murphy said. \u201cThe vivid dreams are the important ones.\u201dAfter their discussions, Ms. Szabo and Ms. Murphy sometimes like to go shopping. Ms. Murphy, who grew up in Wellsboro, likes to buy toys and takes them to her grandchildren in St. Louis. Ms. Szabo, who retired to the area from New Jersey, said that a sales clerk had recently complimented her on her looks when she held a shirt up in the mirror.Dunham\u2019s employs as many as 50 people during the busier months, many of them part time. The store hires mostly older workers who want to supplement their Social Security income. Nancy Dunham said it would be difficult for a younger person with a family to live on the store\u2019s starting hourly wage of $7.25, which is Pennsylvania\u2019s minimum.Mrs. Dunham said the store cannot afford to compete with large retailers on wages and benefits. \u201cWe are at the bottom of the pay scale,\u201d she said.Connie Cumiskey, 66, works in the card and gift department at Dunham\u2019s, and said she depends on it to support herself and the six cats she adopted.Ms. Cumiskey, who does not own a computer or smartphone, has never bought anything online. She worries that the younger generation has no interest in shopping in stores.She loves selling greeting cards like the ones with brightly colored songbirds \u201cso pretty you could frame them.\u201d But with fewer people sending cards, the store is cutting back on inventory.\u201cIt\u2019s a tough time to be in retail,\u201d Ms. Cumiskey said.While the Dunhams watch the industry warily, they aren\u2019t swayed by what everyone else is doing. They still have no deadline for starting online sales. \u201cI hope people want to keep interacting with each other in brick and mortar stores,\u201d Nancy Dunham said. \u201cIt\u2019s one way we learn from one another. It frightens me to think of a world without it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "WeWork\u2019s Rise: How a Sublet Start-Up Is Taking Over", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookCritics have derided WeWork as overvalued and vulnerable to the next downturn. But the company holds so many leases in so many cities, it might hold more power than its landlords.Real estate titans have long scoffed at WeWork, which in eight short years has managed to attain a $20 billion valuation by selling short-term leases for shared office space with a mixture of stylish design and free-flowing alcohol. The naysayers argue that WeWork\u2019s business model looks brilliant only in a rising economy that has allowed it to lock in long-term leases and then re-rent that space to other businesses at a premium. The enormous valuation it has obtained is higher than that of Boston Properties and Vornado, two of the country\u2019s biggest office-space landlords \u2014 companies that actually own the kind of space that WeWork usually rents.Now, with interest rates creeping higher, residential real estate prices flattening and fears of an economic slowdown coming, real estate insiders are gleeful at the notion that a downturn could be an existential threat for the company.But a funny thing happened as WeWork has scaled up all over the globe: It may have become too big to fail.WeWork has gobbled up leases for so much space in so many cities, there\u2019s a compelling case to be made that its landlords wouldn\u2019t be able to afford for it to go under.Because of WeWork\u2019s size, \u201cthey have more power in a down market,\u201d said Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the longtime real estate investor and founder of Colony Capital. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter financial results on Tuesday. A WeWork spokesman, citing the coming report, declined to comment. The conventional wisdom is that when the economy turns south, WeWork\u2019s customers \u2014 many of which are start-ups and may be the most vulnerable \u2014 will simply walk away. The flexibility of WeWork\u2019s short-term leases is part of its appeal, after all. Even those who are bullish on WeWork count changing economic conditions among the dangers it faces. \u201cWhile the company\u2019s flexible contracts may be ideal for small companies, WeWork would inevitably face trouble leasing their spaces if start-ups began to dry up or if the real estate market experiences a downturn similar to the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d the research firm CB Insights wrote as it articulated the criticisms of WeWork in an otherwise upbeat case for the company\u2019s sky-high valuation.But WeWork has been building a more durable business than most real estate executives seem to appreciate. The company was once marketed to individuals and small businesses on month-to-month lease agreements, but large companies like IBM and Microsoft are now using it and signing significantly longer leases. The company says its average customer has a lease of seven to eight months and new customers are signing leases that average 20 months.Underneath all the branding and wide-ranging aspirations \u2014 which include a for-profit elementary school called WeGrow \u2014 it\u2019s still a real estate company. \u201cAt the end of the day, it is about leasing space,\u201d Mr. Barrack said. And WeWork has leased a lot of it.WeWork projects to have about 400,000 individuals using its office space by the end of the year, which would put it ahead of the entire employee base of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway \u2014 one of the largest employers in the nation.Another sign of just how large WeWork\u2019s ecosystem has become: It employs 1,300 people in architecture, interior design, engineering and related activities \u2014 an employee roster that would make it one of the biggest architecture firms in the world. That means when the next economic downturn comes \u2014 and it will \u2014 WeWork\u2019s landlords will actually be less likely to evict the company if it doesn\u2019t pay its rent. If they were to let WeWork fail, those landlords would risk depressing commercial real state prices to such a degree that it would create a serious sense of pain for the country\u2019s largest real estate owners.More likely, landlords would swallow hard and renegotiate the lease agreements on more favorable terms to keep WeWork from creating a full-on panic.The idea of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d has long applied to banks and whether the government would come to the rescue to prop them up, but in this case, landlords all over the world might find themselves in the uncomfortable position of having to help save a failing tenant simply because the tenant is so large.That isn\u2019t necessarily the only solution if WeWork were to end up unable to pay its rent. Rather than kick out WeWork or lower its rent, a landlord could have the company act as a property manager. A big part of WeWork\u2019s value proposition is in its management of properties. It\u2019s possible that WeWork could become the equivalent of Marriott, which manages hotels but doesn\u2019t own or lease them. WeWork also has a cushion that most real estate companies don\u2019t: SoftBank. The Japanese investor has already plowed $4.4 billion into the company and just last month discussed taking a majority stake. Given SoftBank\u2019s deep pockets \u2014 it has a $100 billion fund aimed at start-ups \u2014 it is quite possible that WeWork could weather financial difficulties without any help from its landlords.When the next downturn comes, we\u2019ll find out who was right: real estate traditionalists, or the ones trying to upend them.Advertisement"}

Long the largest car producer in Canada, G.M. lost that title to Toyota last year and will likely end up in the fourth or fifth position after the Oshawa closing. The overwhelming majority of the cars made in Canada are sent to American buyers.On Monday, G.M. workers packed into a local union hall to watch a news conference called by their union leaders, and their anger soon became apparent.As Jerry Dias, the union\u2019s national president, vowed he would hold the company to the current contract that does not allow it to reduce or shut down plants until 2020, the crowd frequently drowned him out with shouts of disapproval for G.M.\u201cWe\u2019re sick and tired of General Motors shipping all of our jobs to Mexico,\u201d Mr. Dias said. \u201cWe will do whatever it take to get them to reverse their decision.\u201dBut several politicians on Monday downplayed any idea that G.M. might have a change of heart about the closure.Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, said the president of General Motors had told him, \u201cThe ship has already left the dock.\u201dOutside the House of Commons in Ottawa, Navdeep Bains, the federal minister responsible for industry, said, \u201cWe\u2019re willing to engage and work with them but they\u2019ve been clear about their position.\u201dPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had expressed his \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d about the closing to Mary T. Barra, G.M.\u2019s chief executive. He added that the government is looking at measures to help jobless G.M. workers \u201cget back on their feet.\u201dGreig Mordue, a professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and the former general manager of Toyota\u2019s manufacturing operations in Canada, said that Oshawa\u2019s location ultimately doomed the factory.Most of Canada\u2019s other assembly plants, including a G.M. factory that will remain open, are west or north of the country\u2019s largest city, Toronto, along highways providing direct and easy links to Michigan and Ohio. Oshawa sits on the other side of Toronto, along an infamously congested corridor.\u201cThis is like a 100-year-old grandma dying,\u201d Mr. Mordue said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad but it is not surprising.\u201dIt takes relatively little effort to find G.M. employees in Oshawa who are third- and sometimes even fourth-generation members of their family to work for the company.Even with the closing, the company won\u2019t completely disappear from the city. Its Canadian headquarters will remain on the edge of town, and it also has an engineering center in the city that researches alternative-fuel vehicles.After the company\u2019s troubles in 2008, much of its work force was reduced through early retirements. But there are comparatively few older workers in the Oshawa plant today. Unifor estimates the average age of current workers is between 30 and 40 and that they have just 15 years of service, far too little for anything approaching a full pension.Scott Aquanno, a political scientist at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, who has studied previous G.M. layoffs, said the local economy\u2019s diversity \u2014 many people commute to jobs in and around Toronto \u2014 will help buffer the effects of the layoffs. But he said those left jobless will find it difficult, if not impossible, to find work with similar pay and benefits.Timothy Martin, the 33-year-old son of a 32-year veteran of G.M., was only hired full time this year. Sitting in special coveralls with flaps to prevent its zippers from scratching the pickup trucks on which he installs airbags and wiring, Mr. Martin said that he was confident he would find work in the construction trades, but added he was still worried for the city\u2019s future in the wake of the closings.\u201cOshawa has a dark underbelly,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see how dark it can get.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tax Cut and the Balance of Payments (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLots of financial maneuvering, signifying nothingOpinion ColumnistNow that Democrats have taken the House, it seems likely that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will turn out to have been the only major piece of legislation enacted under Donald Trump. There might conceivably be an infrastructure bill, but don\u2019t get your hopes up: Trump\u2019s people seem dead set against straightforward public spending, i.e., just building the damn infrastructure, and Democrats probably won\u2019t agree to privatization disguised as public investment.Now, the TCJA played almost no role in the midterms: Republicans dropped it as a selling point, focusing on fear of brown people instead, while Democrats hammered health care. But now that the election is past, it seems like a good idea to revisit the bill and its effects. What I want to focus on in this piece is the effects on the balance of payments.Why the balance of payments? Because the theory of the case - the not-necessarily-stupid rationale for the corporate tax cuts at the heart of the bill - depended crucially on claims about what tax cuts would do to international movements of capital. So one important piece of any attempt to assess the results so far involves looking at the balance of payments changes since the lower tax rate went into effect.And looking at those changes in the balance of payments also offers a good way to debunk some of the fallacies that all too often creep in when we discuss these issues. So let\u2019s dive in, beginning with a recap of how the TCJA\u2019s supporters claimed it would work.What tax cuts were supposed to doThe claim by tax cut advocates was, however, that the tax cut would be passed through to workers, because we live in an integrated global capital market. There were multiple reasons not to believe this argument in practice, but it\u2019s still worth working through its implications.What tax-cut advocates argued was that the rate of return in the U.S., net of taxes, is set by global forces. Suppose that there is a global rate of return r*; then the U.S. will have to offer r*/(1-t), where t is the corporate tax rate.Now imagine cutting t; the figure shows a complete elimination of corporate taxes, but the logic is the same for simply reducing the rate. This should lead to inflows of capital from abroad, increasing the capital stock, which both raises GDP and reduces the rate of return. In the end the after-tax return on capital should be back where it started, with all of the tax cut passed through to wages instead.The crucial point, however, is that for this to happen you have to have a large increase in the physical stock of capital - it\u2019s not an immaculate financial transaction. This in turn means that those inflows of capital have to enable a massive wave of real investment in plant and equipment. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean directly importing machinery; it could mean importing consumer goods or exporting less stuff of our own, either way freeing up resources for producing capital goods here at home. But the logic of the pro-tax cut case depends on the cut facilitating a period of large trade deficits. (I don\u2019t think anyone told Trump about this.)This is not, however, the way most reporting on the issue has framed it. Instead, reports have mostly focused on corporations moving funds home from their overseas subsidiaries, and asked what they are doing with that money. That\u2019s not exactly wrong, but \u201cmoving money home\u201d doesn\u2019t mean what people think it means, and is very loosely connected to the important economic issue here.On \u201cmoving money home\u201dU.S. corporations have large assets overseas. Some of these assets reflect past investments made for fundamental business reasons - e.g., auto plants built to serve foreign markets. But a lot of those overseas assets reflect tax avoidance strategies.But what did these big numbers correspond to in reality? Quite possibly nothing.Imagine a U.S. company whose overseas subsidiary has $1 billion in a London bank account. Following the enactment of the tax cut, it decides to transfer that $1 billion back to the parent company - but the parent keeps the money where it is. In that case the balance of payments statistics show a big drop in net direct investment abroad, because the parent firm is reducing its apparent stake in the subsidiary. But the reality is that the company still owns that same $1 billion in London - it has just shifted from owning it indirectly via the subsidiary to holding it directly. It\u2019s just accounting, with no real-world effect.Of course, the company could choose not to keep that $1 billion in a London bank; it might do something else with it, such as buy shares back from its stockholders. But what happens to the money then? The shareholders might themselves buy assets overseas; even if they buy stock here, whoever sells them the stock might invest the proceeds abroad.In other words, looking at corporate financial maneuvering after the tax cut doesn\u2019t really tell us anything about whether the cut is, in fact, attracting global capital into the United States. To make that assessment, we need to look at net sales of assets to foreigners by the U.S. as a whole - or, equivalently, at our net sales of goods and services, because the balance of payments always balances: the trade balance is by definition the inverse of the net capital inflow.What actually happened to capital inflows?If we\u2019re trying to assess the possible effects of the TCJA on the U.S. ability to invest, we need to know how much, if at all, it promoted true inflows of capital - resources made available to the United States that let us invest more than we ourselves are saving. These inflows can be measured two different ways. One is to look directly at the international financial account: asset transactions with foreigners, where selling assets is an inflow and buying assets an outflow. The other is to look indirectly at the difference between sales and purchases of goods and services, because the trade balance broadly defined (including investment income) - aka the balance on current account - is the flip side of capital inflows.In principle these two methods should give the same result. In practice there is sometimes a significant \u201cstatistical discrepancy,\u201d probably because some financial transactions don\u2019t end up being properly reported. This is less of an issue for goods and services, although some of the same strategies used for tax avoidance can distort this balance too. Anyway, I\u2019ve prepared a little chart showing quarterly measures of capital inflow since 2016, by both methods (Figure 3.)There are big statistical discrepancies in a few quarters. As I like to say, in the fourth quarter of 2017 America was a big exporter of errors and omissions. But overall the data tell a consistent story about what has happened to capital inflows since the tax cut went into effect, which is \u2026 nothing much. That elaborate financial dance between corporations and their subsidiaries seems, in fact, to be an accounting maneuver with little real-world relevance. The international consequences of the tax cut appear to be minimal.And that\u2019s a big deal, because promoting capital inflows was at the heart of the halfway reasonable argument for the tax cut. So far, that argument appears to be not totally stupid, but also, as it happens, quite wrong.The big giveawayOn its face, a corporate tax cut looks like a big giveaway to stockholders. Proponents of the TCJA claimed that this was misleading, because large capital inflows would ensure that the cut went to workers instead. But there\u2019s no sign of those big inflows, so what looks like a big giveaway to stockholders is, in fact, a big giveaway to stockholders.And about 35 percent of that giveaway is to foreigners, so the tax cut makes America as a whole poorer.Can we see this in the data? Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to extract this signal from the noise. If corporations returned all of the tax cut to stockholders via increased dividends, you might be able to see it in increased payments of investment income to foreigners. But much of it was used for stock buybacks, which won\u2019t show up in the same way.True, stock buybacks should raise the price of the stocks remaining, and you could try to allocate 35 percent of this capital gain to foreigners. When Trump boasts about rising stocks, or laments declines that he blames on Democrats, remember: higher stock prices actually make America poorer, because they don\u2019t add anything to our real wealth while increasing foreign claims on the nation as a whole.But stocks fluctuate so much, for so many reasons (or no reason at all), that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s productive to try and guess how much of that fluctuation is due to the tax cut. Better to focus on the fundamentals: corporate taxes have been cut by around $100 billion a year, so that\u2019s around $35 billion going to foreigners.OK, that concludes my wonkiness here. The moral of this story is that the tax cut seems to have produced some biggish financial activity on the part of corporations, but it\u2019s all basically accounting maneuvers signifying nothing. A balance of payments perspective, like other perspectives, points to a tax cut that, surprise, cut taxes on corporations, but had few real consequences for the economy.Advertisement"}

Now They Are Driving It Down.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs concerns about growth and privacy issues took a toll, technology and banking stocks led a slide in Europe, and futures indicated that markets in the United States could follow.The mighty tech titans and their seemingly endless pipeline of profits, which powered one of the longest bull markets in stocks, are looking a little less invincible. Shares of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, are down more than 10 percent since the market peaked, while Facebook and Amazon have dropped more than 20 percent.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing extreme selling in the only favored area that everybody ran to,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a slowdown underway globally,\u201d said James Bianco, president of financial market research firm Bianco Research in Chicago. \u201cThe U.S. has definitely been stronger than the rest of the world. But the fear is, that can\u2019t hold. If the rest of the world slows down, that will eventually slow us, too.\u201dThe potential for higher borrowing costs is also weighing on smaller companies that often borrow money by issuing floating rate debt, which can become more difficult to pay off as interest rates rise. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks is down 14 percent from its high. \u201cThis is simply a continuation of the recent repricing of risk, or growth scare, that we\u2019ve basically been seeing since the end of September,\u201d said Talley Leger, an equity strategist with Oppenheimer Funds. When the stock market hit its peak in September, technology had led the way, accounting for 50 percent of the gains for the year. The tech giants, at first, seemed immune to the sell-off that followed on broader economic worries. Not anymore. Through Friday, roughly a quarter of the market\u2019s decline since September was because of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet, according to data collected by S&P Capital IQ. The sharp sell-off on Monday will only add to that tally. Investors appear especially focused on any signs that extraordinary profits generated by these giant tech companies are under threat. Whether technology stocks can slough off the worries will depend, in part, on whether the companies can continue to deliver strong earnings growth even if the global economy does soften significantly. Recent earnings reports from major tech companies have done little to reassure investors. Since Apple\u2019s share price peaked at just over $232 on Oct. 3, the stock has plummeted by nearly 20 percent, lopping more than $200 billion off the company\u2019s market value. Its shares were down nearly 4 percent Monday.Amazon reported a slowdown in its core retail revenue growth in late October, sending the shares lower. To investors, who often view revenue numbers as a good gauge of the strength of demand in the economy, that was more important than the $2.9 billion in profit the company reported.But if they actually produce the numbers that Wall Street analysts expect, the recent slump in large technology stocks could present a buying opportunity for some investors. Key valuation measures of Apple and Alphabet hit multiyear highs this summer. But the recent drop has left those valuations substantially lower. Prices of Facebook and Amazon are relatively low compared with expected profits, meaning these stocks look \u201ccheap\u201d for certain investors. But they might have to get even cheaper before investors are tempted to snap them up. That\u2019s why some expect the sentiment in the market to get much worse before stocks can resume their climb. \u201cI\u2019m sort of looking for a little more bearishness,\u201d said King Lip, chief strategist at the wealth management company Baker Avenue. An earlier version of this article misstated which company Alphabet is the parent company of. It is Google, not Apple.Advertisement"}

How did it achieve social economic mobility unrivaled by much of the world?And perhaps most of all, how did a country that rejected all of the conventional wisdom Western economists had to offer arrive at a moment when it is on track to surpass the American economy and become the world\u2019s largest?When The Times launched China Rules, the series that began last Sunday, these were the questions we asked our reporters to try to answer. The last four articles in the series will appear this Sunday, when a special print section will also be published.Here are some takeaways about what they found. In the uncertain years after the death of Mao Zedong \u2014 the founding father of the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 Chinese leaders struggled to find a way forward. It was the 1980s, and the country was still recovering from decades of political and economic turmoil.After decades of centralized planning and state control of the economy brought much of the country to its knees, Chinese officials knew they had to try something else \u2014 but what? The answer was far from clear. \u201cThe Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation,\u201d writes Philip P. Pan in the opening article of our China Rules reports.The world may have thought that it could change China, and in many ways it has, but China has also changed the world.Now, the question for China has turned from how to compete to how to pull ahead in an era of American hostility that has realigned the global dynamic. As President Xi Jinping pushes a more aggressive agenda overseas and tightens controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war that has brought the countries to the cusp of a new Cold War. When Henry A. Kissinger, President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, made a secret trip to Beijing in 1971, he opened a new era of engagement between the United States and China. It was grounded in the mind-set that increasing trade and investment would benefit both countries by making America safer and China more prosperous. But the decades of engagement that followed have given way to a trade war encouraged by China hawks like Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Trump. Mr. Bannon\u2019s view that China is the greatest long-term threat to the United States has influenced Mr. Trump\u2019s policymaking.And now, China has begun clamping down even more. President Xi has reversed course on some of the decades of reforms that the former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made to drag the economy forward. New internal and external pressures will test this model like never before. Its relationship with the United States may be contentious, but China has been busy making its mark in a bid for global influence, even as America turns increasingly inward.From Cambodia to South Africa, it has been funding major infrastructure projects like dams, bridges, ports and power plants. Some describe the effort as a modern-day Marshall Plan, the American reconstruction campaign after World War II that laid the foundation for many enduring military and diplomatic alliances.China\u2019s take on that, the so-called Belt and Road Initiative, is bolder, more expensive and far riskier. As it works to win new allies and develop new markets, Chinese-funded projects are reshaping financial and geopolitical ties. But the costs for both aid recipients and China can be high. And Beijing is sometimes accused of using its infrastructure investments to ensnare partners in debt traps \u2014 and then seize their assets.We examined nearly 600 projects that China helped finance in the last decade. They show the scope of China\u2019s strategy on a global scale. As China focuses attention on its immediate neighbors, it has overtaken the United States as the leading trade partner in Asia. It is also projecting power through military might in the South China Sea, where Mr. Xi has ordered the development of several contested islands.The American Dream has long promised a pathway to a better life for those willing to work hard. But unprecedented economic expansion in China has created an environment where upward mobility may now be more attainable in Beijing than Baltimore.While China is still much poorer than America over all, it is outpacing its Western rival in some crucial areas.Its population is among the most optimistic in the world, according to public opinion surveys. Eight hundred million people have risen out of poverty since the 1990s. Incomes are rising across generations, with children out-earning their parents. Life expectancy has soared. It\u2019s more complicated than that, of course. Education and a growing private sector have offered a path to social mobility, but they can also function as a means of social control. The government offers an unspoken pact to its people: A good life is possible for anyone who works hard, even the children of peasants \u2014 as long as they stay out of politics.China charted a new manufacturing model in a bid to build cutting-edge industries that could rival Western giants.Defying the conventional wisdom of economic development, it is trying to do it all. The Communist Party is throwing the full financial weight of the state behind these efforts.Beyond manufacturing, China has begun getting more involved in all types of industries.Mr. Xi has emphasized the need to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well.\u201d Chinese companies have long mimicked their American corporate counterparts, but Chinese tech firms have evolved quickly from copying Silicon Valley\u2019s successes to making huge strides of their own, from mobile payments to social media innovations. Now the inspiration flows both ways, with American companies taking notes from Chinese counterparts.Advertisement"}

Trains were largely on schedule again by early afternoon.The delays have become a familiar refrain to riders of New Jersey Transit, the country\u2019s second busiest railroad, and this week\u2019s bleak streak has raised the political heat on Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, who called the transit system a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d when he ran for governor last year.Mr. Murphy, after inheriting a system that endured years of disinvestment and poor management, has vowed to turn things around.\u201cGovernor Murphy knows that nothing is more important to rebuilding New Jersey\u2019s economy than turning around New Jersey Transit, and he remains fully committed to doing so,\u201d said Dan Bryan, a spokesman for Mr. Murphy.But many riders say the railroad is as unreliable as it has ever been.The derailment meant that the week ended just as it started, with New Jersey Transit commuters suffering:\u2022 On Monday, a shortage of engineers forced the cancellation of a train out of Manhattan. Its passengers crammed onto a later train.The same incident occurred later in the day, causing delays that spilled into the homeward rush hours.\u2022 On Wednesday evening, a New Jersey Transit train stalled briefly as it left Penn Station in Manhattan, blocking one of the tracks to the suburbs and upsetting those who were rushing home to take children out for Halloween.One of those frustrated parents, Dave Kass, called the delays on three consecutive days a \u201ctrifecta\u201d of failures by New Jersey Transit and Amtrak, which owns and operates Penn Station and much of the rail infrastructure in the Northeast, including the swing bridge.Gary Leon, who has been commuting to Manhattan by train from central New Jersey for 36 years, said he could not recall a time when the service was so unreliable.\u201cWhat\u2019s changed in my opinion in the last two years has been just a level of incompetence I\u2019ve never quite seen before,\u201d Mr. Leon said.Even after paring back service twice this year because it could not muster enough engineers and equipment to fulfill its schedule, New Jersey Transit is still aggravating customers by canceling trains.On the line that Mr. Leon rides, the railroad canceled the same train on three straight days.Mr. Leon, 58, has been riding New Jersey Transit long enough to remember when it was a model of efficiency, held in high regard across the country.By next year, nearly 90 percent of those coaches will be at least 12 years old, absent any replacements, the audit showed.Four of New Jersey Transit\u2019s locomotives were 37 years old, each having traveled more than 2.2 million miles, according to the 2017 data, and more than 150 of its passenger cars were at least 40 years old.New Jersey Transit\u2019s trains also break down more frequently than other commuter railroads. Data compiled by the Federal Transit Administration showed that New Jersey Transit\u2019s trains had 236 major mechanical failures in 2017. That was far more than the 89 reported by Metro-North or the 132 reported by the Long Island Rail Road.Mr. Murphy pinned much of the blame on his Republican predecessor, Chris Christie, arguing that Mr. Christie had starved New Jersey Transit of the money it needed to maintain its fleet. But State Senator Tom Kean Jr., the Republican leader in Trenton, said Mr. Murphy had done little to reverse the agency\u2019s decline.\u201cPeople are tired of blame games and just want things fixed,\u201d Mr. Kean said.Mr. Kean said he worried that New Jersey Transit\u2019s decline would hurt the state\u2019s economy, driving people to choose New York or Connecticut when they look for suburban homes in the region.\u201cIf your transportation infrastructure is uncertain, that makes a difference when an individual is trying to decide where to locate their family,\u201d he said.Mr. Bryan took issue with Mr. Kean\u2019s criticism.\u201cDue to many years of underinvestment and mismanagement,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bryan said in a statement on Thursday, \u201cyears in which Senator Kean was silent, New Jersey Transit has a long road back.\u201dThe problems at New Jersey Transit have been building for years and several political leaders have played contributing roles. Now, the power to rescue the railroad rests with a different set of elected officials.During the Christie administration, the state\u2019s direct subsidy to the agency dropped by about 90 percent. To make up for the shortfall, the agency often had to cover its operating costs with money that had been set aside to buy new equipment and other capital improvements.That project was already underway and construction was scheduled to be completed this year. The federal government had pledged more than $3 billion toward the project and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had committed an additional $3 billion.New Jersey Transit had sponsored the project, which was designed in part to reduce the agency\u2019s reliance on Amtrak for access to Manhattan.After the cancellation of the tunnel, New Jersey Transit has partnered with Amtrak and the Port Authority to design an alternative tunnel system known as the Gateway project. That project includes the replacement of Amtrak\u2019s Portal Bridge, the swing bridge that caused delays for commuters this week.The Obama administration agreed to cover half the project\u2019s cost with New Jersey and New York paying the other half. But that agreement was scrapped after Mr. Obama left office last year.President Trump has denied that any such agreement existed. Mr. Cuomo and other elected officials from the region have pleaded with Mr. Trump and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to reconsider.The need for new rail tunnels is especially acute since Hurricane Sandy flooded the existing, century-old tunnels with saltwater, setting off a gradual deterioration of the tunnels\u2019 interior walls and electrical systems. Last month, Mr. Cuomo sent Mr. Trump a video of a late-night tour the governor took to inspect the conditions inside one of the tunnels.Eventually, Amtrak will have to close those tunnels for an overhaul, Mr. Cuomo warned. But taking just one tunnel out of service would cripple the Northeast, he said, because it would reduce the capacity for cross-Hudson commuting during the rush hours by 75 percent.The trustees of the new project\u2019s sponsor, the Gateway Development Corporation, said in a statement that the delays on Friday \u201cwould not have happened with a new Gateway tunnel, which will create badly needed resiliency so trains can operate around minor disruptions without wreaking havoc on the entire Northeast Corridor rail system.\u201dEven with Mr. Trump\u2019s support, the soonest a new rail tunnel could be built is several years off. In the meantime, New Jersey\u2019s commuters will look to Mr. Murphy for relief.But Mr. Murphy has warned repeatedly that fixing the railroad will take time and that significant improvement will not come before next year. For the rest of this year, New Jersey Transit is focused on meeting a Dec. 31 federal deadline for installing equipment for Positive Train Control, a system for automatically slowing speeding trains to prevent collisions and derailments.The agency has taken extreme measures to meet that deadline, including severe reductions in its schedule and the temporary suspension of an entire train line, the Atlantic City line, which crosses the southern part of the state.Mr. Bryan said that once the installation of the equipment is completed, \u201cN.J. Transit commuters will see restoration of service and the agency will shift its full focus to improving reliability and on-time performance.\u201dEmma Fitzsimmons contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Did the Democrats Do on Tuesday in 2016 Trump Country?", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey were the states that broke Democratic hearts the last time \u2014 and the ones where any political comeback would have to begin.So how did the Democrats do on Tuesday in 2016 Trump country? They won. They also lost. And both experiences are instructive for the party\u2019s future.Here\u2019s a look at how the party fared:Rebuilding the \u201cblue wall\u201d that President Trump breached was always going to start here.Even after the president\u2019s victory, Pennsylvania Democrats seemed well positioned to win re-election in contests for governor and the Senate, with relatively popular incumbents (Gov. Tom Wolf and Senator Bob Casey) and weak opponents. And win they did, easily.Mr. Lamb, who won a special election in March in a deep-red western Pennsylvania district, provided an early template for how to win in Trump country. An affable former Marine who focused on labor rights and economic fairness, Mr. Lamb took care not to alienate Trump voters by antagonizing the president.Mr. Cartwright, running in northeastern Pennsylvania, was likewise committed to understanding conservative constituents. He said he had taken up deer hunting as a point of bonding.The pair will be joined in Congress by several Pennsylvania women who won on Tuesday, including Madeleine Dean, Chrissy Houlahan and Mary Gay Scanlon in suburban Philadelphia, and Susan Wild in the Lehigh Valley.\u201cPerhaps in Massachusetts,\u201d Mr. Cruz said in an interview in August, sipping a Texas-brewed beer at a bar outside Houston.In the end, both candidates were right. Mr. Cruz survived on Tuesday with an emphasis on cultural conservatism and a spirited defense of Mr. Trump, his former rival in the 2016 presidential primaries. And Mr. O\u2019Rourke turned out a remarkable number of voters \u2014 more than 4 million, about three percentage points behind Mr. Cruz \u2014 proving that a different kind of Democratic campaign could make the party competitive in Texas. His strength around some of the state\u2019s major population centers also helped lift congressional candidates in key battlegrounds.Still, the way forward for Democrats in statewide races there is uncertain. It is hard to imagine future candidates replicating many of the forces that powered Mr. O\u2019Rourke: his charisma and viral status on social media; his prolific fund-raising; an opponent like Mr. Cruz, who can be polarizing even within his own party. And Mr. O\u2019Rourke still lost.Yet even before he had, the calls for a 2020 presidential candidacy were well underway. They will not soon stop.Few losses were more alarming for Democrats in 2016 than this one. On Tuesday, there was redemption, mostly.Still, the results seemed to suggest that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s visceral appeal to some labor households, his success in 2016 had quite a bit to do with the unpopularity of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe got a lot of pushback on Hillary,\u201d Bill Black, a leader of the Teamsters union in Michigan, said months ago, sizing up the contest for governor. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing that with Gretchen.\u201dAt last, the Democrats got their man.Scott Walker, for years an avatar of the Republican dominance of state-level politics across the Midwest, will be governor no more. He lost, narrowly, to Tony Evers, the state\u2019s schools superintendent.Elsewhere on the ticket, Senator Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic incumbent, won re-election by double digits.They assumed that their nominee, the former Gov. Phil Bredesen, was a good fit, more stylistically equivalent to the Republican he was running to replace, Senator Bob Corker, than the Republican nominee herself \u2014 Marsha Blackburn, a hard-line conservative.It did not matter. Ms. Blackburn won easily, suggesting that the state will not be particularly hospitable to Democrats any time soon. Mr. Bredesen won all 95 counties in the state when he was re-elected as governor in 2006. If he could not keep a race close \u2014 after coming out in support of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, after speaking warmly of gun rights \u2014 it is hard to envision another Democrat faring much better.\u201cIn our mind we think we\u2019re a little more progressive, a little more advanced,\u201d Raumesh Akbari, a Democratic state legislator in Memphis, said of Tennessee before the election, comparing it to other reliably red states. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know.\u201dIn 2016, Mr. Trump effectively took this once-purple state off the board, winning by eight points. Tuesday\u2019s results make it clear he should enter 2020 as a strong favorite again.In defeat, Mr. Cordray won more votes than the incumbent, Gov. John R. Kasich, earned in either of his victories \u2014 and still lost to Mr. DeWine by more than four points.The outcome was sobering for Democrats. Mr. Trump\u2019s success in once solidly blue corners of the state, particularly with many old-guard union voters, seemed to carry over at least in part to Republicans in a nonpresidential year. And Mr. Cordray was never going to approach the kinds of numbers that President Barack Obama enjoyed with young and African-American voters when he won the state in his two campaigns.\u201cDonald Trump has completely disintegrated the old Democratic coalition in Ohio,\u201d said Michael Hartley, a longtime adviser to Republican campaigns in the state. \u201cAnd I think to a lot of people\u2019s surprise, the Trump voters came out.\u201dOh, Florida.Polls generally showed Mr. Gillum with a small lead over his Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, a hard-line Trump supporter, leaving Democrats hopeful that the enthusiasm around his campaign might be enough to lift Mr. Nelson in his race against Gov. Rick Scott.It seems safe to say this did not happen as planned. It does not seem safe to say who won.While Democrats appeared to lose both races on Tuesday night, the margins have shriveled enough in recent days to dip below the threshold for a recount. Republicans have expressed confidence that their apparent wins will remain wins.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S.-China Clash at Asian Summit Was Over More Than Words", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBEIJING \u2014 The tensions were already high.At a major international gathering in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, the United States wanted to end with a group statement emphasizing free trade. China objected.But instead of working out the disagreement through dialogue, Chinese officials barged uninvited into the office of the host country\u2019s foreign minister demanding changes in the official communiqu\u00e9.China\u2019s action marked a striking break with diplomatic decorum at a meeting that is normally used to promote cooperation among countries that ring the Pacific Ocean.More important, analysts said, it signaled a new phase in relations between the two powers, with China showing its willingness to cast diplomacy aside in favor of a more aggressive posture as it challenges the United States\u2019 dominance in the region.The West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It\u2019s still waiting.China\u2019s more assertive approach comes as Mr. Xi considers accepting an invitation from the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit the North. Such a trip could complicate stalled nuclear talks between the United States and North Korea.The way the two big powers vied openly in Papua New Guinea with money and military assets for advantage was reminiscent of how Washington and Moscow behaved during the Cold War, analysts said.\u201cChina doesn\u2019t care if it looks like a boor. If you are a tough guy, you don\u2019t care what others think,\u201d said Hugh White, a former military strategist for the Australian government and author of \u201cThe China Choice.\u201dSuch behavior was only surprising because it had been more than 30 years since the world had witnessed such edginess, Mr. White said. In that era, tit-for-tat diplomacy was a leitmotif between the pre-Gorbachev leaders of the Soviet Union and Ronald Reagan. Such public snarling between Washington and Beijing is likely to become more common, he said.The latest tensions \u2014 part of a heated trade war \u2014 boiled over Saturday when four Chinese officials barged into the office of the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea, Rimbink Pato, according to a diplomat in the region and an American official involved in the drafting of the communiqu\u00e9.Security officials were summoned and the Chinese left voluntarily. The police were then posted at the office to prevent further disruptions.The American official said the Chinese had taken issue with two portions of the draft communiqu\u00e9 that Washington supported and other members embraced.One paragraph said the APEC member economies agreed to fight against unfair trade practices. Another paragraph said that members of the group would work together to improve the \u201cnegotiating, monitoring and dispute settlement functions\u201d of the World Trade Organization.Negotiators had been working on the final communiqu\u00e9 for days, diplomats said, and the disputed material was not suddenly inserted into the text.The diplomat from the region said the Chinese move was puzzling.Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, said: \u201cChina\u2019s strident reaction to such innocuous language signals its leaders\u2019 concern about being isolated by the U.S. and other countries who may still create a unified front to take on unfair Chinese trading and economic practices.\u201dChina seemed to dismiss the account that its officials burst into the foreign minister\u2019s office as \u201crumor.\u201d But Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hinted at the source of Chinese anger by saying that most APEC members opposed the practice of \u201ceconomic bullying,\u201d an apparent reference to the United States\u2019 actions.Beijing\u2019s aggressive posture might backfire on its plans to present itself as a rising power that brings countries together as the United States looks increasingly inward.\u201cIt is certain that China gained nothing by refusing a few words in the proposed draft when almost every other country accepted them,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cWe have seen this sort of situation generally since a few years ago.\u201dThe Chinese may have also gone unceremoniously to the foreign office because they felt targeted, and isolated, by the Americans, and were seeking last-minute support, the diplomat from the region said.By delegating Mr. Pence to attend the APEC meeting, President Trump dispatched the administration\u2019s point person for its get-tough-on-China policy. Mr. Pence was accompanied by the head of China policy at the National Security Council, Matthew Pottinger, also a hard-liner on China.In Papua New Guinea, Mr. Pence continued his theme, criticizing China\u2019s global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative, as a \u201cconstricting belt\u201d and a \u201cone-way road.\u201dThe day before, Mr. Xi had vigorously defended the project, which is considered among the Chinese elite to be the foreign policy effort in which the president is most invested.\u201cIt does not exclude anyone,\u201d Mr. Xi said in his speech about the Belt and Road Initiative. \u201cIt is not an exclusive club closed to nonmembers, nor is it a trap as some people have labeled it.\u201dChina may also have been rattled by the American decision to join hands with its major allies, Japan and Australia, to increase its economic development assistance to Papua New Guinea and to embark on redeveloping a naval port there at Manus Island.Mr. Xi arrived in Papua New Guinea two days ahead of the APEC meeting, for which China financed roads and a $50 million renovation of a convention center. The Chinese leader stressed his nation\u2019s largess to Pacific island nations like Papua New Guinea.But China is the third-largest donor to these countries, trailing Australia and New Zealand, said Jonathan Pryke, an expert on the Pacific islands at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. The United States was the fourth largest, sending most of its aid to the northern Pacific countries of Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, Mr. Pryke said.At the meeting, Mr. Pence announced that the United States would increase engagement in the region, pledging to join Australia and Japan in helping to bring electricity to 70 percent of Papua New Guinea by 2030. (Only 13 percent of the country currently has electricity.)The United States is also working with Australia to develop the deepwater port at Manus Island, which lies 1,060 miles south of the American territory of Guam.Manus Island played an important role for the United States Navy in the defeat of Japan during World War II. Now it could play a strategic role against China\u2019s expansion in part because the port is big enough to hold large naval vessels and task groups, said Peter Dean, professor of war studies at the University of Western Australia.\u201cIf the Chinese were able to land this as a base instead of the United States and Australia, then it would have had significant strategic implications,\u201d Mr. Dean said.Luz Ding contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Is Ensuring That Greenhouse Gas Emissions Will Rise", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump had a clear message Monday when asked about the core conclusion of a scientific report issued by his own administration: that climate change will batter the nation\u2019s economy. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump then laid responsibility for cleaning the atmosphere on other countries like China and Japan: \u201cRight now we\u2019re at the cleanest we\u2019ve ever been, and that\u2019s very important to me. But if we\u2019re clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that\u2019s not so good. So I want clean air. I want clean water. Very important.\u201d \u201cSince virtually the first day the administration came into office they have systematically worked to reverse policies in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard. \u201cBut this report, which is mandated by law, shows that greenhouse gas emissions are going to have profound effects on the United States in this century.\u201dThose impacts include more devastating wildfires, severe storms and coastal flooding, droughts, crop failures, water shortages, threats to public health and the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars to the American economy, according to the authors. The most direct way the Trump administration is working to allow more greenhouse gas emissions is by weakening the Obama-era regulations meant to reduce pollution at its source: the smokestacks of power plants and tailpipes of automobiles.According to estimates by environmental groups, that means the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from American power plants over the next decade could be up to 12 times higher than it would have been under the Obama-era plan.\u201cThese are life-extension projects for coal plants,\u201d said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former counsel to the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s a very calculated effort to go in the opposite direction from what\u2019s needed.\u201dIf fully implemented, the plan would have cut about six billion tons of greenhouse gas pollution over its lifetime, the equivalent of roughly a year\u2019s worth of greenhouse pollution for the entire country. \u201cAnd they sent a long-term signal to Detroit that they need to make vehicles that produce fewer emissions,\u201d Dr. Victor said. \u201cAttempting to loosen them has sent the exact opposite signal to Detroit.\u201dMethane is a potent greenhouse gas \u2014 about 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in its ability to trap heat in the atmosphere. It is emitted from landfills and coal-fired power plants, burned as part of oil drilling operations and routinely leaked into the atmosphere from faulty oil and gas wells.The Obama administration had estimated its steps to regulate methane would prevent the equivalent of 11 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2025. Experts say a rise in methane emissions is an inevitable consequence of Mr. Trump\u2019s rollbacks.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that dumping the venting-and-flaring rule is causing increases in emissions,\u201d said David J. Hayes, a former deputy secretary of the interior during the Clinton and Obama administrations.Finally, there is the Trump administration\u2019s vow to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, a voluntary accord under which nearly every country in the world has agreed to reduce emissions.President Barack Obama pledged the United States would cut carbon at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The Trump administration cannot formally withdraw from the Paris pact for two more years, but in rolling back key climate regulations it has effectively stopped all efforts to meet that goal.But the United States\u2019 role in the Paris Agreement was never just about driving down America\u2019s own emissions. It was also about using its leadership to prod major developing countries like China, India and Brazil to also reduce their emissions despite still climbing out of poverty. Those countries, under United Nations rules agreed to by the United States in the 1990s, also are not legally obligated to cut carbon because of their status as developing nations.Already Mr. Trump\u2019s actions seem to be reverberating in rich and poor countries alike. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has threatened to pull out of the Paris Agreement. His conservative government has since said it will honor its pledges, but the country\u2019s energy policy contains no plans for curbing emissions.In Brazil, the far-right populist President-elect Jair Bolsonaro campaigned on a vow of pulling out of the Paris Agreement.Countries will meet in December in Katowice, the heart of Poland\u2019s coal country, to finalize a set of rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. The United States will attend the talks and, despite the intended rollbacks, is expected to push other countries to be more transparent about their own plans for cutting emissions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Bill Gates Encourages the World to Build a Better Toilet", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Bill Gates believes the world needs better toilets.Specifically, toilets that improve hygiene, don\u2019t have to connect to sewage systems at all and can break down human waste into fertilizer.So on Tuesday in Beijing, Mr. Gates held the Reinvented Toilet Expo, a chance for companies to showcase their takes on the simple bathroom fixture. Companies showed toilets that could separate urine from other waste for more efficient treatment, that recycled water for hand washing and that sported solar roofs.Mr. Gates said in an interview that \u201cit will be at least a decade\u201d before the reinvented toilets reach tens of millions of people in the poorest areas, and they will have to prove both practical and economical. \u201cNobody wants overnight solutions\u201d in sanitation, he added.Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s top leader, has called for a \u201ctoilet revolution.\u201d (Incidentally, the Reinvented Toilet Expo is called \u201cToilets in the New Era\u201d in Chinese.) Having clean toilets, Mr. Xi said in 2015, is an important goal in \u201cadvancing the revitalization of the countryside.\u201dLi Shuangxin, a 41-year-old stay-at-home mother who lives on the outskirts of Beijing, walks about 100 meters to an outhouse several times a day from her shack. About 20 people share the \u201ctoilet,\u201d which is little more than two planks over a mud pit.\u201cWhen you do your business, you just don\u2019t look down,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with such a toilet, but you don\u2019t really have a choice. Our economic conditions are such.\u201dBut China\u2019s toilet revolution has led to excesses \u2014 a problem that critics say could plague the Gates effort as well.Though the products on display on Tuesday were nowhere as flashy, Mr. Gates has drawn criticism for giving thousands of dollars to universities in developed countries to create high-tech toilets that will take years to pay off \u2014 if they ever do.\u201cIt might be a thing like the space program where people have fantasies about colonizing the moon and Mars, but it\u2019s really not that practical,\u201d he said.Mr. Gates acknowledged that some reinvented toilets, in small volumes, could cost as much as $10,000, but added, \u201cThat will pretty quickly come down.\u201d\u201cThe hard part will be getting it from $2,000 to $500,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say we are more confident today that it was a good bet than where we started, but we are still not there.\u201dThe Gates Foundation said the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank would commit $2.5 billion in financing for sanitation projects that provide people in all parts of a city \u2014 including the poorest neighborhoods \u2014 with safely managed sanitation services.\u201cWe see ourselves on the cusp of a sanitation revolution,\u201d Mr. Gates told expo attendees on Tuesday.At a showroom in an art center in Beijing, companies including China\u2019s Clear, Ecosan and CRRC, Sedron Technologies of the United States, India\u2019s Eram Scientific and Switzerland\u2019s Blue Diversion Autarky displayed toilets that could separate urine and recycle water for hand washing.During his opening remarks, Mr. Gates said he had started getting interested in sanitation after he stopped working full time at Microsoft and began traveling more frequently to poor countries with his wife, Melinda.Holding up a beaker of fecal matter, Mr. Gates reminded the audience that human waste is disgusting, containing 200 trillion rotavirus particles and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs, among other organisms.Mr. Gates\u2019s efforts to bring the discussion of toilets into the mainstream have legitimized a topic that many have avoided talking about for decades, said Jack Sim, the founder of the World Toilet Organization, a Singapore-based nonprofit organization committed to improving toilet and sanitation conditions worldwide.\u201cThe subject of toilets has been a neglected subject for some time,\u201d Mr. Sim said. \u201cThe Gates Foundation is part of this momentum of breaking the taboo.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Bill Gates\u2019s remarks on human waste at the Reinvented Toilet Expo in Beijing, based on erroneous information provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

But they are significantly more valuable. Every two weeks or so, each tree produces a 50-pound bunch of walnut-size fruit, bursting with a red, viscous oil that is more versatile than almost any other plant-based oil of its kind. Indonesia is rich in timber and coal, but palm oil is its biggest export. Around the world, the oil from its meat and seeds has long been an indispensable ingredient in everything from soap to ice cream. But it has now become a key ingredient of something else: biodiesel, fuel for diesel engines that has been wholly or partly made from vegetable oil.Finally we emerged, and as we crested a hill, the plantations fell into an endless repetition of tidy bunches stretching for miles, looking almost like the rag of a Berber carpet. Occasionally, a shard of an old ironwood tree shot into the air, a remnant of the primordial canopy of dense rain forest that dominated the land until very recently.Our driver, a 44-year-old island native and whistle-blower named Gusti Gelambong, had brought us here to show us the incredible destruction wrought by the growing demand for palm oil. The oldest male among nine siblings, he was modestly built but exuded a wiry strength. His father, he told us, was a king of one of Borneo\u2019s dozens of Dayak tribes, the sixth descendant of the sultan of Old Kotawaringin, and his mother came from a line of warriors who served in the Indonesian special forces. In 2001, he said, he took part in a brutal ethnic cleansing of Indonesians who had moved in from the nearby island of Madura. He macheted his way through the nearby town of Pangkalan Bun, slaughtering dozens of people. He felt no remorse about the violence. But the palm-oil companies, Gelambong said, were much stronger than the Madurese. As we approached an intersection, we could see two plantation guards lying back in a shack, rifles propped against their knees. He sped past the guards, averting his eyes.Most of the plantations around us were new, their rise a direct consequence of policy decisions made half a world away. In the mid-2000s, Western nations, led by the United States, began drafting environmental laws that encouraged the use of vegetable oil in fuels \u2014 an ambitious move to reduce carbon dioxide and curb global warming. But these laws were drawn up based on an incomplete accounting of the true environmental costs. Despite warnings that the policies could have the opposite of their intended effect, they were implemented anyway, producing what now appears to be a calamity with global consequences.The tropical rain forests of Indonesia, and in particular the peatland regions of Borneo, have large amounts of carbon trapped within their trees and soil. Slashing and burning the existing forests to make way for oil-palm cultivation had a perverse effect: It released more carbon. A lot more carbon. NASA researchers say the accelerated destruction of Borneo\u2019s forests contributed to the largest single-year global increase in carbon emissions in two millenniums, an explosion that transformed Indonesia into the world\u2019s fourth-largest source of such emissions. Instead of creating a clever technocratic fix to reduce American\u2019s carbon footprint, lawmakers had lit the fuse on a powerful carbon bomb that, as the forests were cleared and burned, produced more carbon than the entire continent of Europe. The unprecedented palm-oil boom, meanwhile, has enriched and emboldened many of the region\u2019s largest corporations, which have begun using their newfound power and wealth to suppress critics, abuse workers and acquire more land to produce oil.We arrived at another plantation and stopped near where a stream coursed through the bog. People still lived here: A mother bathed two children beneath a culvert, and a shirtless young boy ran through row after row of identical young palms in the distance, surrounded by dragonflies and sparrows. The uniformity of the world he was growing up in was striking, like the endless plains of drilling rigs in an East Texas oil field. It was, in a way, an astounding achievement, the ruthless culmination of mankind\u2019s long effort to extract every last remaining bit of the earth\u2019s seemingly boundless natural wealth. But it was also frightening. This was what an American effort to save the planet looked like. It was startlingly efficient, extremely profitable and utterly disastrous.The last thing anyone expected from President George W. Bush\u2019s 2007 State of the Union address was a proposal for the largest-ever cut in the nation\u2019s use of gasoline. The president was no climate champion \u2014 he had backed out of the Kyoto Protocol shortly after taking office in 2001 \u2014 but he did favor what he called \u201cenergy independence.\u201d He had declared the United States \u201caddicted\u201d to foreign oil, yet dependence on Middle Eastern fuel continued. Hurricane Katrina, and the lingering damage it did to oil pipelines and refineries, had pushed up gas prices, renewed fears of global warming and kept a firm thumb on the economy.Now, Bush proposed, homegrown energy could be drawn from the rural places most in need of an economic boost. Clean-coal initiatives would generate the electricity of the future, but it was biofuels \u2014 in particular ethanol, which is largely distilled from corn, and biodiesel, made with vegetable oil \u2014 that would power the vehicles of the future. Within 10 years, the country would replace 35 billion gallons of petroleum, or one-fifth of all the gas and diesel burned, with fuel made from plants. The measure, as he put it, would confront \u201cthe serious challenge of global climate change.\u201d Unsaid, but clear to anyone paying attention, was that it would also please America\u2019s agriculture industry, which had been lobbying for ethanol and advanced biofuel research for years. The House chamber erupted in applause.On the night of the president\u2019s address, Timothy Searchinger sat on his couch in Takoma Park, Md., just a few miles from the Capitol, and watched on television, struck by what seemed to him a glaring lapse in logic. \u201cOh, my God, what the hell is happening here?\u201d he recalls wondering aloud.Searchinger wasn\u2019t a scientist; he was a lawyer, working with the Environmental Defense Fund. But he saw a serious flaw in the claim that the president\u2019s proposal would ameliorate climate change. Searchinger knew that cropland had already consumed virtually every arable acre across the Midwest. Quintupling biofuel production would require a huge amount of additional arable land, far more than existed in the United States. Unless Americans planned to eat less, that meant displacing food production to some other country with unused land \u2014 and he knew that when forests are cut, or new land is opened for farming, substantial new amounts of carbon can be released into the atmosphere. Forests hold as much as 45 percent of the planet\u2019s carbon stored on land, and old-growth trees in particular hold a great deal of that carbon, typically far more than any of the crops that replace them. When the trees are cut down, most of that carbon is released.Scientists and lawyers who study environmental impact often deploy \u201ccarbon-life-cycle analysis\u201d to determine just how much carbon a given product is removing from, or introducing to, the environment over the course of its production and consumption. When a truck burns biodiesel, the carbon emissions that come from its tailpipe aren\u2019t much different from those of a truck burning petroleum. But a part of the biodiesel emissions aren\u2019t counted, because \u2014 in theory \u2014 they have been balanced out: Plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere when they grow, and fuel experts subtract that sequestered carbon from the tailpipe emission, completing a transaction that they say balances at zero.In ideal circumstances \u2014 unvegetated land planted for the first time \u2014 this balancing out really happens. When corn grows, it soaks up carbon, and when it is consumed (whether as food or fuel), it releases that carbon back into the air. But the analysis breaks down when faced with the reality of land use. Almost everywhere in the world, planting more corn or soy for biofuel would involve creating more farmland, which in turn would involve cutting down whatever was already growing on that land. And that would mean releasing a huge amount of carbon into the air, with nothing to balance the books. As Searchinger watched Bush\u2019s call for an unprecedented increase in biofuel production, his hunch was that the biofuel balance sheet would turn out to be tragically shortsighted.Representative Henry A. Waxman, at the time a powerful 16-term Democrat from California who had presided over several failed efforts to pass climate legislation, was also skeptical about Bush\u2019s plan. But he knew that one of the most vexing aspects of global emissions reduction was the question of how to replace transportation fuels. It was hard enough to upgrade several thousand electrical power plants to draw on wind or solar or even nuclear power. That would take years. But transforming the more than 100 million cars and trucks on America\u2019s roads would take far longer, decades even, and in the meantime those vehicles were producing 28 percent of carbon emissions in the United States. Waxman thought a biofuel requirement could be a turning point in climate legislation, a moment when Washington stopped pretending.Within months of Bush\u2019s speech, the House and the Senate were reconciling a draft of a sprawling omnibus bill that would eventually be called the Energy Independence and Security Act, or EISA. In addition to requiring carmakers to improve fuel standards, a longtime priority for Democrats, the bill updated and expanded renewable-fuel standards, requiring fuel producers to mix in soy, palm and other kinds of vegetable oil with diesel fuel and to use ethanol from corn and sugar in gasoline. The bill also set tough standards for how much cleaner, in terms of carbon, each of those categories of fuel had to become \u2014 50 percent for diesel, 20 percent for gas \u2014 and empowered the Environmental Protection Agency to judge what qualified.The expected gains were enormous. The switch to biofuels, the E.P.A. would later calculate, promised to stop the release of 4.5 billion tons of carbon over three decades, the equivalent of parking every single American automobile for more than seven years. Before the bill passed in December 2007, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it \u201cthe shot heard round the world for energy independence.\u201dThe law had a profound effect. Biodiesel production in the United States would jump from 250 million gallons in 2006 to more than 1.5 billion gallons in 2016. Imports of biodiesel to the United States surged from near zero to more than 100 million gallons a month. As fuel markets snatched up every ounce of domestic soy oil to meet the American fuel mandate, the food industry also replaced the soy it had used with something cheaper and just as good: palm oil, largely from Malaysia and Indonesia, which are the sources of nearly 90 percent of the global supply. Lawmakers never anticipated that their well-intentioned plan \u2014 to help the climate by helping American farmers \u2014 might instead transform Indonesia and present one of the greatest threats to the planet\u2019s tropical rain forests. But as Indonesian palm oil began to flood Western markets, that is exactly what began to happen.\u201cWe saw great promise,\u201d Waxman told me recently, sitting in a glass conference room at Waxman Strategies, the Washington lobbying firm of which he is chairman. But he is no longer so hopeful. He is now also the chairman of the environmental organization Mighty Earth, which lobbies food and agriculture companies to deploy more climate-friendly production methods. In 2007, he and other lawmakers were focused on the benefits of biofuels and the bridge they promised to even greener technologies. Now the soft-spoken Waxman is far more concerned about the other side of the equation. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think we were going to pay such a heavy price,\u201d he said.Palm-oil producers had been lobbying American lawmakers to introduce biofuel incentives for years, and they were well prepared for the moment when the incentives became law. Wilmar \u2014 the colossal Singaporean conglomerate that controls nearly half of the global palm-oil trade \u2014 announced in 2007 that it would quadruple its biodiesel production. In Indonesia, officials directed state-owned and regional banks to make loans on more than $8 billion worth of palm-oil-related development projects and pledged to produce 5.9 billion gallons of biofuel within five years. They also announced that Indonesia would convert more than 13 million acres of additional forest to industrialized palm production. It was as if in response to a law in China, the United States undertook a plan to convert every single acre of New Jersey to soybean crops, and then threw in all of Connecticut and New Hampshire.To make Indonesia\u2019s plan a reality, a complicated question of land ownership had to be addressed. Much of the new development was focused on Borneo, where many villages were settled before there were nations, let alone land deeds. To create a legal basis for development, the Indonesian government established a commercial land-share system in the 1980s. In theory, the system let villages sign over development rights in return for some part of the profit. But in practice, many villagers said, companies often secured the permits they needed through some combination of intense lobbying, bribery and strong-arming, and the result was broken promises and missing payments.Villagers were often simply outmatched by their huge negotiating partners. Wilmar was already a powerhouse in 2007, with operations in 23 countries on four continents, employing more than 60,000 people. When Wilmar said it would buy more than 200,000 acres in the states surrounding Gusti Gelambong\u2019s village, it was a signal for others, too, to rush in. One of Indonesia\u2019s largest conglomerates, the Salim Group \u2014 which owns Indofood, the nation\u2019s largest maker of instant noodles \u2014 said it would pay $13 million for 200,000 acres in East and Central Kalimantan. Anthoni Salim, the company\u2019s chief executive, was closely tied to Suharto, Indonesia\u2019s longtime dictator who was overthrown in 1998. When the dictatorship fell, an angry mob firebombed Salim\u2019s family mansion in Jakarta, and the new government forced him to abandon dozens of holdings. Within a few years, though, Salim had rebuilt his empire.Even before the boom, Gelambong told me, he saw promise in the new palm industry, and he decided to stake his own welfare to it. When the large companies began to expand their timber and palm-planting to Kalimantan, they brought roads, construction and an influx of goods. They also offered jobs. By the end of 2007, Gelambong was already two years into working with a wildcat palm-oil operation, overseeing the process of putting millions of palm-tree seedlings into the ground.The oligarchs had once brazenly plundered whole states, but Gelambong thought this time would be different. In the post-Suharto era, it was private business capitalizing on free markets, and the companies promised to share profits with the smallholders \u2014 the villagers \u2014 who gave up their land. To win access to protected ancestral lands, the corporations promised schools for local children and wages that far exceeded those from harvesting jackfruit and jalut timber.Gelambong\u2019s company was owned by a midsize upstart named Bumitama, run not by an oligarch but by the grandson of a Chinese immigrant who moved to remote eastern Borneo and opened a grocery store in 1915. The family built a fortune out of mining and timber, and Bumitama \u2014 which sells its palm to mills run by Wilmar and has direct distribution to the American and European markets \u2014 was its palm-oil subsidiary.As Bumitama\u2019s plantations grew, so did Gelambong\u2019s responsibility. He became the public liaison for Bumitama\u2019s local operations, a company called B.G.A. \u2014 in part, he thought, because officials knew that his family held influence over the people who lived there. The deeper he got, however, the more he began to understand that many landowners weren\u2019t being paid. As he gained access to more company documents, Gelambong said, he found new contracts where village elders had agreed to smaller and smaller shares of profit. He offered a theory: The elders, often rewarded with gifts by the companies, weren\u2019t looking out for the interests of their people, and their people simply had no way of knowing. \u201cNo one fights for their rights, because almost no one can write or read,\u201d he said.In his role as liaison, Gelambong was also sometimes responsible for delivering the very gifts that local officials found so persuasive. Indonesia\u2019s new democratic government had reached an uneasy d\u00e9tente with its rural islands by giving them a very long leash to run their own affairs, including the authority to issue permits for developing palm and timber. Acquiring such a permit typically required hefty contributions to one or more local political campaigns. Gelambong said he handled the small stuff; payoffs to the police, military patrols and local chiefs. (Bumitama officials say that Gelambong\u2019s official position was in \u201cdocuments and licensing,\u201d and that while they cannot \u201ccomment on his individual doings,\u201d Bumitama complies with antibribery laws.)As the money flowed, so did the development. From 2007 to 2014, palm concessions in Kalimantan more than tripled. Bumitama alone was planting roughly 37,000 acres of palm each year. Across Indonesia, trees were cut down at a rate of three acres every minute to make room. Soon, palm plantations extended from Kotawaringin in every direction.The palatial remains of Gelambong\u2019s family estate still stand in Kotawaringin, their wood grayed and weathered, ringed by a tall fence capped with elongated spikes that for centuries has turned away tigers and thieves alike. It was there that Gelambong took me to retrieve a box of papers he had acquired. After leaving Bumitama in 2011, he had become the head of his village\u2019s microfinance group, which gave him access to records that helped explain how his former employer had been able to so thoroughly take over the village and its land in the early years of the oil-palm boom. Bumitama, it appeared from the documents, had used the microfinance group as a kind of front to justify putting up land owned by residents as collateral for a $26 million bank loan, effectively mortgaging it to the industry\u2019s financial backers.Sifting through the files, he retrieved copies of three contracts the company presented to its banks. Each contained a list of signatures \u2014 purportedly those of hundreds of villagers, consenting to let the microfinance corporation control their land and represent their views to the bank. Gelambong pointed to the long rows of names. Dozens of these people, he said, couldn\u2019t read or write. When he asked some of them about their names in the document, they told him that they had never seen the paper before and that the signature on it wasn\u2019t theirs. At least six of the signatures were from people who had died before the oil-palm companies arrived.The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a voluntary global governance organization for the industry, is formally investigating Gelambong\u2019s claims. Bumitama officials said that nothing about their deal in Kotawaringin was improper; the company had the consent of village representatives, and it had undergone due diligence from the banks. A spokesman for Wilmar said that it abides by its sustainability commitments and was watching the Bumitama land inquiry closely but that the company\u2019s internal monitoring program had not yet triggered any alerts about Bumitama\u2019s subsidiary outside Tanjung Puting National Park.Gelambong\u2019s discovery had left him cynical about the industry that had overtaken his home. Promises had given way to despair, and he was humbled by the belief that he and others were suckered into giving up their only true assets. Now they were fighting simply for the right to take back a small sliver of land to farm for themselves.Timothy Searchinger spent a year researching cropland demand, and in February 2008, just two months after Bush signed the biofuels mandate into law, he and eight co-authors published their findings in the journal Science. It was a rare coup for a layman \u2014 peer-reviewed scientific journals seldom take an interest in the work of activist lawyers \u2014 but Searchinger had done something important. He had tried to quantify how increasing the demand for biofuel would change land use. According to his calculations, the ripple effects from land use would be so great that ethanol wasn\u2019t going to be better for the climate at all; instead, it would create nearly double the greenhouse-gas emissions of conventional fuels.How was this possible? A typical life-cycle analysis adds up just the carbon emissions involved in the chain of fuel production and use: the carbon produced by burning the fuel, the carbon spit out by the tractor in the field, the carbon produced by the fertilizer manufacturer and so on. By this accounting, vegetable-oil-based biofuel fares well against petroleum fuels, reducing CO\u2082 emissions by as much as 80 percent.What that analysis does not take into account, though, is that there is only so much land. The supposed carbon gains of plant-based fuels have to be offset, Searchinger argued in subsequent papers, by one of three things: reducing food consumption, increasing yields from existing cropland or \u2014 most likely \u2014 creating entirely new cropland, probably in the countries with the largest \u201cunderutilized\u201d forests. And the typical analysis doesn\u2019t count the carbon produced by cutting down these forests or \u2014 if that deforestation happens to take place in Indonesia \u2014 emissions from disturbing the extremely carbon-rich peatland soils that much of the forest grows upon.Jeremy Martin, a fuel-policy expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that before Searchinger\u2019s research was published, the significance of land-use change had been dismissed. \u201cIt was really sort of shocking,\u201d Martin said. Climate scientists quickly agreed on the general notion that land use was an important factor to take into account, but there the consensus ended. The numbers varied depending on who did the analysis using what model, and as the research evolved, few could agree on the scale of the problem.Predicting how people will use land can be challenging. Scientists use a suite of complex models to try to capture the nuance of interactions among commodity prices, vegetation coverage, carbon content of that vegetation, fuel use, the weather and the global political situation.Accounting for the \u201csubstitution effect,\u201d which describes the way more or less interchangeable commodities like palm and soybean oil tend to be swapped out for one another as buyers seek the lowest price, has proved to be a particularly challenging problem. The American biofuels law, for instance, was designed to support soybean and corn farmers, not palm-oil producers. But the United States began increasing foreign palm-oil imports nonetheless \u2014 they more than doubled by 2017 \u2014 in large part because so much of the domestic soybean production that once went to food was now being used for fuel. Much of that palm oil went to food production. But the increased use of palm oil in food production was largely a byproduct of the increased fuel-oil production. (In Europe, which also passed a biofuels mandate in 2009 and uses large amounts of palm-based biodiesel directly in its vehicles, the calculation was simpler.)Wrangling precisely how much palm demand resulted from using a gallon of soy for fuel, and how much rain-forest carbon, in Indonesia for example, might be emitted as a result, became a question that was increasingly influenced by political factors. The E.P.A., in 2009, made one of the most significant efforts to model and predict the carbon from biofuels, using three of the most established models and an overlay of satellite imagery of agricultural lands around the world, including those in Indonesia. The agency determined that the carbon footprint of land-use changes overshadowed any other consideration, and not by a small margin. In fact, when land changes were accounted for, the climate benefit of biofuels was entirely wiped away. Because a huge pulse of emissions comes from land change immediately after forests are cut, the E.P.A. concluded that it would take 32 years before biodiesel from soybean oil was truly net-zero for carbon on an annual basis, and a century for it to reach the level of benefit required under the law.But that finding did not last long. The agriculture industry went to war to save the mandate they worked so hard to put in place. They lobbied the E.P.A. to abandon its consideration of indirect land-use change, describing it as a \u201cradical\u201d approach that could hold American farmers responsible for business decisions made by villagers halfway around the world. They supported research suggesting that the E.P.A. had overestimated the expansion of crops into tropical rain forests and said farmers were getting better crop yields off the same land than the models had acknowledged.By the time the E.P.A. released its final rule in early 2010, it had made a complete about-face. Its models now found that the impact from land-use changes were almost negligible. For Indonesia, the E.P.A. estimated that just 110,000 acres of forest would be converted to cropland as a result of the American biofuels law, and almost none of it on sensitive peatland. It also extended the scope of its analysis to 2022, which had the effect of minimizing the short-term emissions. And it worked: Corn ethanol just barely cleared the law\u2019s hurdle, and soybean biodiesel suddenly appeared to be vastly cleaner than regular diesel.It was nearly two years later that the E.P.A. issued its analysis of palm oil; it said in a cursory three-page draft rule that palm oil did in fact fall short of the E.P.A.\u2019s bar, because of its direct impact on Indonesian forests. And that analysis, which remains in draft form today, simply ignores the substitution effect \u2014 which, calculated in any form, would suggest an even greater carbon cost.Searchinger, who now is a research scholar at Princeton\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School, argues today that instead of developing evermore complex models, it makes more sense to step back and consider some simple logic: Land has competing uses, and taking more of it for agriculture has to have some consequence for the climate. \u201cWe could be off by 100 percent,\u201d he says of his biofuels findings, \u201cand it\u2019s still incredibly bad.\u201dAfter the palm-oil companies gained control of the land, the clearing began. The fastest method was to rip out the forests with excavators and torch what remained. In 2015, the fires spread out of control. Kalimantan \u2014 and most of Indonesia, for that matter \u2014 was overwhelmed by billowing clouds of smoke and ash, visible from hundreds of miles away. NASA satellites detected more than 120,000 hot spots. As far away as Singapore and the Thai islands, people covered their faces with masks and prayed that their air-conditioners could filter out the soot. The smoke was so thick that Zenzi Suhadi, a leading activist with the Indonesian environmental group Walhi, was unable to land at Pangkalan Bun airport the day he was supposed to arrive late that September. Nor could he land the next day. But Suhadi needed to get closer \u2014 right into the heart of the flames.A biologist who wrote his thesis on Indonesia\u2019s wild orchids, Suhadi switched to environmental work because he thought it could have broader impact. He has taken on the pulp and paper, logging and palm industries with a zeal that seems to grind against his quiet, soft-spoken nature. At 37, he has been riotous and unflagging in the face of powerful government ministers, corporate lawyers and even would-be assassins \u2014 all of whom he has faced off with at one time or another.Forest fires are an annual event in Indonesia \u2014 sparked in the dry early fall as village farmers clear their fields and then extinguished by the monsoons. But this year was different. NASA officials said they were the worst fires they\u2019d ever observed. Indonesians suffering from the effects of smoke inhalation were streaming into hospitals by the tens of thousands. Researchers at Columbia and Harvard later estimated that the fires led to 100,000 premature deaths. And the fires wouldn\u2019t stop. Suhadi, long a critic of how the palm-oil companies managed their plantations, feared that they had now done something cataclysmic.His team \u2014 including an American conservationist from Friends of the Earth and Gusti Gelambong as a guide \u2014 had already arrived in Kalimantan. Now he asked them to continue on without him, traveling west toward Kotawaringin and to the jungle of Tanjung Puting National Park. The only way to learn the truth of what was unfolding was to investigate it for themselves.What the Walhi crew found that week in Kalimantan was not just deforestation and misery but a virtual hole ripped into one of the largest banks of concentrated carbon in existence. At every turn \u2014 by motorbike and motorboat \u2014 shards of burned stumps, a crop of shimmering silvery charcoal, stuck out from the blackened earth like gravestones. This apocalyptic landscape stretched as far as they could see, punctuated by only the rare tuft of scorched but otherwise healthy juvenile palm. They traced what they describe as telltale signs that the fires had been started by the palm companies \u2014 which is illegal and which all the palm-oil companies strongly deny doing, but which is also the fastest, cheapest way to raze the land.The process is simple and devastating. First, workers bring in excavators to cut deep trenches across the swampland. These quickly fill with water that drains from the adjacent forest, thereby creating canals that serve as near-instant inroads on which to transport heavy machinery by boat or barge. With the machinery, the forests are cut down, their timber efficiently removed, and the swampy peatland they sit on is left to drain and dry. Once it\u2019s dried, it\u2019s burned.In most of the places the Walhi crew visited, the fires appeared to have been extinguished, but the earth remained hot, smoldering underground. And this \u2014 more than the landscape destruction itself \u2014 was what concerned the group most. The dried and decaying peatland soil in this part of Borneo would almost certainly continue to burn for many more months, even years, releasing volumes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that far exceeded those from the rain-forest deforestation itself.Peatland is boggy, waterlogged ground, loaded with layers of decomposing plants that can\u2019t get enough oxygen to support the microorganisms that would normally break them down. So they accumulate, layer by layer, season by season, compressing into a dense, black carbon-rich mud of partly decayed matter that sinks below the shallow water table and is preserved there in an anaerobic state. Left alone for a couple hundred million more years, the peat would solidify into coal.Exposed peatland can spew carbon into the atmosphere for decades, even centuries, after the land is first disturbed. Indonesia\u2019s peatland destruction \u2014 just the amount that has already occurred \u2014 is roughly the equivalent of opening 70 new, large coal-fired power plants. And if even a fraction of these emissions are counted as land-change effects in the process of evaluating biofuels, the scales are forcefully tipped. \u201cIt\u2019s all a deception,\u201d Suhadi said. \u201cThere is no sustainability.\u201dGlobally, peatlands from Norway to Brazil hold a volume of carbon equivalent to 21 percent of the entire carbon content in the earth\u2019s soil. Indonesia\u2019s peatlands alone (which are greater in size than others anywhere in the world except for those in Russia and Canada) now emit more than 500 megatons of CO\u2082 each year, an amount greater than the entire annual emissions of the state of California. Peatland forests hold 12 times as much carbon as other tropical rain forests around the world. This makes destroying them one of the planet\u2019s greatest threats \u2014 and protecting them one of the most accessible opportunities to curb rising global emissions.The peatland problem had been known for some time. It\u2019s one reason that six of the world\u2019s leading carbon-modeling schemes, including the E.P.A.\u2019s, have concluded that biodiesel made from Indonesian palm oil makes the global carbon problem worse, not better. The World Agroforestry Center found that peatland-based biodiesel could produce nearly four times the emissions of petroleum diesel. In 2011, the government began a process to survey and designate millions of acres of Indonesia as protected peatland. In 2013, Wilmar signed a pledge to avoid peatland from inside the industry, and other companies eventually followed. American investors and regulators have taken solace in these pledges, assuming that they have lessened the environmental threat. And yet in 2015, as the peat fires raged aboveground and below, Suhadi could see only that none of that mattered.In early July, I traveled to Kalimantan to investigate rumors that large-scale illegal peatland logging operations were still underway. Gelambong met me in a shaded garden behind my hotel. He was deeply uncomfortable and believed he was being followed. We switched tables to move farther into the yard, away from the town officials he suspected were listening. Gelambong\u2019s life hadn\u2019t been the same since he went public with documents accusing Bumitama of seizing his village\u2019s land. The company accused him of embezzlement, and he was arrested in 2016. He spent six months in the Pangkalan Bun jail before a judge determined that there was no evidence to hold him and dismissed the charges.The palm companies keep getting stronger. In 2014, Indonesia\u2019s highest judge and three associates were convicted in a huge bribery scandal that journalists have linked to palm land deals in Borneo. A few years later, a Kalimantan governor was caught granting palm concessions to family members, who flipped them back to the companies that paid for his election. Stories of corruption, and threats to keep it quiet, were legion. I was reminded of the threats that Suhadi had described \u2014 a series of anonymous phone calls and an intimidating run-in at a market in Jakarta. Suhadi went dark for several weeks as a result \u2014 hiding out in a friend\u2019s house outside the city. His fear was justified. In 2015, one of Suhadi\u2019s colleagues was stabbed to death outside a Jakarta nightclub in a case that news reports speculated was linked to his environmental work, and Global Witness has counted at least eight assassinations of Indonesian environmentalists fighting palm oil.Gelambong drove us out of downtown that afternoon, to the ramshackle waterfront port of Kumai. There, he turned us over to a boat pilot, and we squeezed into a tiny wedge of wood and fiberglass with a large outboard engine. We motored past derelict anchored ocean tankers, toward the entrance to Tanjung Puting National Park.The exception to the devastation of South Kalimantan is supposed to be the national parks. But the parks are not safe, either. As our boat cruised out the mouth of the Kumai River, a teacup skipping over the white caps into the open sea, our guide, Fajar Dewanto, warned us that a large part of the park was threatened by palm development. Dewanto works for Orangutan Foundation International, a group that has resettled many of the more than 5,000 orangutans here in the park. But because it\u2019s the widespread conversion of the land to monoculture plantations that threatens the orangutan habitat, Dewanto has also become a de facto park ranger, policing the forest where officials don\u2019t have enough staff, or willingness, to do it themselves.A week before our arrival, Dewanto\u2019s team found the rigid body of an orangutan, half buried under a fallen log next to a scar of freshly cut forest in a peat bog being razed for a new palm plantation. They turned the orangutan over. It was riddled with bullet holes to the chest, arm and thigh. As more than a dozen police officers and wildlife experts established a crime scene, an excavator continued ripping down trees on the peat bog behind them, unwilling to lose even a day of progress.Dewanto couldn\u2019t get the scene out of his head. As our boat rounded a small point of mangroves toward a little-visited swatch of parkland, he wasn\u2019t sure what he would find. Our captain slowed the motor and turned into a small tributary crowded with nipa, a stalky canelike plant that is a food staple for native people here, and from there we navigated into a recently dredged canal no wider than 10 feet. Dewanto had been here one month earlier and seen forest. Now the forest was gone.This level of deforestation on protected peatland supposedly wasn\u2019t happening anymore. In Jakarta, a string of officials \u2014 from the government palm-oil agency, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, the palm-industry association, the Peatland Restoration Agency \u2014 all denied to me that peat deforestation in Kalimantan still took place. Uniformly, they insisted that Indonesia had learned its lesson and solved its palm-oil problem, that peatland bans were in full force. Restoration was even underway, they claimed, painting a picture of a palm industry on a sustainable path \u2014 farming only on dry land and focused on increasing yields, not expanding footprints.But where we stood, a broad expanse had been laid bare, the splinters of wood still so fresh they were pungent, crisscrossed by deep pools of black, boggy water. About a mile back, the tree line marked the new edge of Tanjung Puting National Park, a threshold protecting the largest population of orangutans left in the world. Beside an idle excavator, 24-inch tufts of baby palms had been set in rows, the mound of dirt around their base still fresh from planting. Dewanto wasn\u2019t particularly surprised to find the devastation. \u201cThis is every day in Borneo,\u201d he said.In government documents from 2011, this field was mapped not only as protected peatland but also as part of the national park. When the Walhi group visited during the fires of 2015, the forest was still protected. Records show, however, that a nearby village petitioned the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry to carve the plantation out of the park, and this allowed Bumitama, which farms there along with the village, to expand its operation. The government agreed. The park got smaller.North of Sintang, a grim commercial town of concrete and rebar at a fork in the Kapuas River, two palm plantations were being developed on peatland bogs. These plantations, too, were located on tracts that Indonesian government maps had at one time explicitly labeled protected peatland, which should have placed them under the moratorium on palm development. The maps had since been changed. Yet there was no mistaking that this was peatland: Paths submerged into black goop, teams of dragonflies swarmed over the hot water, reeds and forest grew from their depths. And here came a flatbed truck, carrying an excavator toward the entrance gate, where a guard in a neatly pressed dark blue uniform turned away visitors.The permits named two obscure companies, but a villager at the gate told us that he thought both plantations were run by the same company and that it had been clearing the forest for months. It\u2019s not uncommon for Indonesian companies to use layers of subsidiaries to hide their connections to illegal palm operations. \u201cWe call them shadow companies,\u201d said Eric Wakker, a founder of Aidenvironment Asia, an environmental consultancy that has investigated the two plantations. Upon further scrutiny, it appeared that the two companies may indeed have been linked to the Salim Group. They shared a business address with a Salim subsidiary in Jakarta and employed the same plantation managers in Kalimantan. Salim was also a buyer of the palm that would come from the Sintang plantations.The connection matters because the Salim Group has benefited from more than $1.5 billion in loans and capital from foreign investors, including the American firms BlackRock and Vanguard, and Salim companies have pledged that their palm oil is not a product of recent deforestation or peatland destruction. Satellite images from 2017 confirmed that the forests on the Sintang plantations were now virtually gone. (A Salim Group executive, Mark Wakeford, declined to comment about the Sintang companies.)An aide offered a more nuanced explanation. The phrases \u201cpeatland\u201d and \u201cforest\u201d have distinct legal meanings in Indonesia, he claimed; not all treed areas are forests, and not all peat-filled bogs are peatland. In the strictest legal sense, he was correct. The Sintang regency alone, according to Indonesian government estimates, contains more than 160,000 acres of old-growth, heavily treed land that it has not designated as \u201cforest\u201d under the law and more than 86,000 acres of nondesignated peatland. After a request from the companies, the government maps for Sintang were revised to change the peatland borders. New maps show the bog boundaries tracing perfect 90-degree angles and straight lines \u2014 lines that happen to match the boundaries of the companies\u2019 land holdings. How do you account for such details in a life-cycle analysis?This September, with late-season heat pounding Washington, Zenzi Suhadi cleared security at the Russell Senate Office Building, preparing to brief Senate aides about the impact that palm-oil development was having on Indonesia\u2019s environment. I asked if he was nervous, and he said no. \u201cThese are just people. I don\u2019t have to face any tigers.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to be joking.Suhadi wanted to tell the lawmakers the same thing he told them in two previous visits to Capitol Hill: that the palm trade, driven by American investment, is slowly killing his country. \u201cIt\u2019s important for you to understand that all acts of deforestation in Indonesia start with a signature,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd more than a little of it starts right here.\u201d He was not confident that he would be heard \u2014 the last time he visited Washington, lawmakers chewed up their time asking him about water buffalo in his village. But still he felt compelled to speak.From Washington, Suhadi traveled to San Francisco to attend a climate march and address a group of hedge-fund investors. Just down the street, Michael Bloomberg implored strong immediate action on emissions reductions at the Global Climate Action Summit, one of the nation\u2019s largest gatherings on climate goals. But the conference was light on substance when it came to the subject of forests. There was scarcely any mention of peatland at all.When Nancy Pelosi took the stage, she looked back on the 2007 fuel-economy bill and biofuels mandate she shepherded into law. The initiative should be credited, she said, with \u201ccharting a new path to clean energy, reducing emissions, increasing the use of renewables.\u201d She made no mention of Indonesia. When I asked her about the deforestation in an earlier email, her office wrote back defending the bill, citing the Union of Concerned Scientists and arguing that even with the Indonesian forest effect accounted for, biodiesels were cleaner than fossil fuels. \u201cBottom line,\u201d the office responded, \u201cthe biofuels in your tank are better for the planet than 100 percent fossil fuels.\u201dHenry Waxman, of course, doesn\u2019t agree. He said Congress was so focused on domestic climate policy that it failed to see the repercussions of those policies around the world \u2014 repercussions that now seem obvious. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a situation that is so contrary to what we had hoped for,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more harm to the environment. It was a mistake.\u201dThe advanced cellulosic-biofuels program that once seemed so promising has been a failure. It never attracted the investment it needed, and the E.P.A. has allowed biodiesel to serve as a substitute in meeting the mandate. President Trump has wandered into the renewable-fuels-standard debate, too, and found himself caught in a thicket, at one moment poised to reform the fuel standard completely and the very next snagged by the interest of a powerful agriculture industry grown accustomed to its enormous benefit. The result is likely to be at least a near-term doubling down on American biofuels use, no matter the cost.It may no longer be possible to slow the momentum behind Indonesia\u2019s palm markets. Sitting in the lavish dining room of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Jakarta in July, over an awkward meal of mushroom consomm\u00e9 and blanched scallops, officials from Indonesia\u2019s Palm Oil Development Fund made a case for their industry. I asked how important the American biofuels mandate has been, given that other countries buy more Indonesian palm oil than Americans do. The answer was unequivocal: It\u2019s what got Indonesian palm off the ground. \u201cThe U.S. is not only a market,\u201d said Ruddy Gobel, the chief political adviser to the director. \u201cIt also sets the global agenda.\u201d Now, according to the Indonesian development officials, 80 million Indonesians depend economically on palm oil, and nearly half the industry consists of individual landowners like the people in Kotawaringin. \u201cIf you pull out biofuel, the whole system will collapse,\u201d said Dono Boestami, the fund\u2019s director.In perhaps the final turn of the life cycle, Indonesia is now working to become its own largest customer. In 2016, it instituted a 20 percent biofuels mandate for its domestic fuels, and this August, it extended that mandate to cover railways and power generation too. Then it upped the pressure further, simply making it compulsory that Indonesians buy and use biodiesel. Officials offer a simple justification for this push: Under the Paris climate accord, they say, converting Indonesia to renewable fuels is the only way the country can meet its own climate goals.The central problem, of course, is that the goals of Paris \u2014 slowing planetary warming just enough to allow humans time to adapt to excruciating and inevitable changes, including flooding coastlines, stronger hurricanes and perpetual famine and drought \u2014 are unlikely to ever be achieved without stopping deforestation. The planet\u2019s forests have the potential to sequester as much as a third of the carbon in the air. Right now deforestation globally contributes 15 percent of the planet\u2019s total emissions, the same as all the cars and trucks and trains across the globe. On paper, biodiesel is a way to make all those modes of transportation produce less carbon. But in the world as it is, that calculation is far more likely to lead to catastrophe.Advertisement"}

Bolton, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, defended on Tuesday the fact that neither Mr. Trump nor top national security officials had listened to audio of the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying that they did not speak Arabic and would not be able to understand what was on the tape.During a nearly hourlong briefing focused on foreign policy, Mr. Bolton took the lectern at the White House and declined to answer repeated questions about why he had not listened to the recording provided by Turkish officials of the killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\u201cWhy do you think I should?\u201d Mr. Bolton asked reporters, suggesting he could read a transcript instead. \u201cPeople who speak Arabic have listened to the tape, and they\u2019ve given us the substance of what\u2019s in it.\u201dMr. Bolton\u2019s comments came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis were preparing to brief the Senate on Wednesday about the circumstances surrounding Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, which has prompted outrage among members of Congress.Mr. Bolton indicated that the president\u2019s views have remained unchanged since then. \u201cThe president has spoken to our position on this issue,\u201d Mr. Bolton said. \u201cThat is our position.\u201dThe recording is seen by intelligence officials as some of the strongest evidence linking Prince Mohammed to the killing. People familiar with recordings of the killing say that Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a security officer who frequently traveled with the prince, can be heard in one recording making a phone call to someone believed to be one of the prince\u2019s aides.While translations of the Arabic may differ, the people briefed on the call said Mr. Mutreb said to the aide words to the effect of \u201cthe deed was done.\u201dGina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, took two experts in Arabic with her to Turkey when she listened to the audio, according to American officials. Neither Ms. Haspel nor other intelligence officials will join Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mattis at the briefing Wednesday, according to American officials.Intelligence briefings to Congress are typically kept separate from policy briefings, and some officials did not think it would be appropriate to have a senior intelligence leader join the two cabinet secretaries.Congressional officials said Ms. Haspel would have also faced questions about her visit to Turkey that she would have been barred from sharing with a large group of lawmakers.\u201cI\u2019m glad that Pompeo and Mattis are coming, that\u2019s going to be helpful,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cBut I just think it\u2019d be better if the C.I.A. director was here, who basically did the assessment.\u201dThe White House briefing \u2014 one of only a few held this fall as the president\u2019s aides have traded briefings for more presidential interviews and news conferences \u2014 came in advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s trip this week to the Group of 20 summit meeting of the world\u2019s largest economies in Argentina.On Ukraine, Mr. Bolton deferred to the departing United Nations ambassador, Nikki R.

{"Headline": "How Would You Draw History?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEWhen cracks start to appear in the world order, the old textbook timeline just won\u2019t do. Mr. Sartwell is a professor of philosophy.Recent world events \u2014 take your pick \u2014 might have you wondering about where human history is headed, and by what route. You would not be alone. The fracturing of global alliances and the rise of hard-right movements like those in Hungary, Brazil and the United States have caused many of us to question the inevitability of what we generally call progress. Ecological disasters like the California wildfires, plausibly connected to climate change and suburban development, raise the specter of a human history moving inexorably toward self-destruction. The philosophy of history, which flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries and has enjoyed periodic revivals in the hands of thinkers like Arthur Danto and Francis Fukuyama, set itself the remarkably ambitious project of describing the forces that shape human events: history\u2019s structure, its direction, its aim, its point and even its end. There are good reasons to be skeptical of such a project, which we might associate above all with the names Marx and Hegel, and it is possible that history has no coherent shape or direction, or many. It may be, too, that the shape of history depends on our decisions and not on impersonal forces. But the philosophy of history is also a seductive project because, among other things, it seems to promise an understanding \u2014 even an approximate one \u2014 of what might happen next.The basic timeline of history, which still ornaments elementary-school classrooms, remains the way many of us picture how we got to where we are. Its ubiquity suggests that drawing history, trying to capture the shape of time graphically, on a page or in our imaginations, is fundamental to how we understand both the past and the future; we need to diagram history to grasp it, if it can be grasped at all. There is only one history or course of time, in this view, and all humankind is swept up in it. As we tilt the right end up, we portray \u201cthe Whig interpretation of history,\u201d a term coined in 1931 by the historian Herbert Butterfield to describe what he thought of as na\u00efve progressive optimism, the idea that history was headed pretty directly for freedom and enlightenment. We\u2019ve often gotten very much the same picture from progressive leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and former President Barack Obama, who tell the story of America as a march toward justice, characterized by the enfranchisement of oppressed groups, presented at times almost as inevitable.On the other hand, many theorists and many traditional cultures have envisioned time as circular or at least cyclical, which is even suggested by the rhythm of day and night or of the seasons.Nietzsche, for example, speculated that a finite number of atoms in infinite time would assume the same configurations again and again, infinitely. But many ancient philosophies, such as Stoicism, and ancient religions, such as some elements of Hinduism, believed in the wheel of time (or kalachakra). We talk this way informally as well, when we say that history repeats itself, and certainly the idea that we live in an era when fascists and capitalists are squaring off against socialists all over the world sounds like 1930, and 1890 and 1850.The repetitions are striking but not exact, so perhaps history has a loop structure.It\u2019s cyclical, but it often doubles back on its journey forward. Here we might also think of progress pursued through a revival of traditional values, or radical reform movements that make what almost appears to be a reactionary appeal to the source or origin, as in the philosophy of Confucius or the Reformation of Martin Luther. Obama\u2019s first inaugural address, typically for American political rhetoric, portrayed his victory both as progressive and as a return to the values of America\u2019s founding, as the top of the loop, as it were. A strength of this picture is that it explains seeming setbacks as continuations of the way forward. We are likely to flow out of our period of reaction and disaster.The most ambitious accounts of history in the 19th century were Hegel\u2019s and Marx\u2019s, which described the structure in terms of \u201cdialectics,\u201d or opposites that were reconciled at a higher level in the next phase: conflicting cultures or classes or spirits of the age that were merged and transcended at the dawn of the next period, which in turn generated a new conflict or tension.For example, Marx described the feudal economy as generating a conflict between lord and serf that was finally overcome by the rise of bourgeois capitalism, which in turn gave rise to a conflict between owners and workers that would inevitably lead to communism. Hegel looked on the Romantic art of his time as a synthesis and transcendence of symbolist or iconic art (Egyptian, for example) and classical Greek and Renaissance styles, overcoming the apparent opposition between reason and passion or reason and subjectivity. Both of them, like Fukuyama, thought that the whole thing was leading toward some kind of ecstatic or at least satisfactory end-state.Once we let the physicists and cosmologists in on the action, however, things are liable to get explosively weird, and Stephen Hawking (following Richard Feynman and others) concludes from quantum mechanics that \u201cthe universe has every possible history.\u201dIt\u2019s a big bang not only of matter but also of almost infinitely many timelines, each of which might be a line or a loop, a circle or spiral. At this point, however, the complexity might just be getting too great to yield much in the way of predictions. Or rather, if you predicted that everything that can possibly happen will happen, you\u2019d be right, and finished.If I were trying to draw history, I\u2019d draw it as a loop spiral: all on a single timeline, but crossing and recrossing itself, not making any particular progress forward or upward, but blossoming or expanding outward, more complex with each spiral because of the accretion of events.Well, that\u2019s the shape I think history would have, if I thought history had a shape. I call it the Spirograph theory.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the author of \"The Whig Interpretation of History.\" He is Herbert Butterfield, not Alexander Butterfield.Advertisement"}

Flexibility is your friend when it comes to planning your ski vacation, and it will help you target some good deals.Users can get ideas from the app and then further whittle down their preferences. For example, I set New York City as my home and looked for three-day getaways to Salt Lake City that began on either a Friday or Saturday.

In that scenario, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t really see how the economy can keep powering ahead.\u201dThe vast majority of prominent economic forecasters, including various arms of the federal government and all of the major Wall Street banks, still regard continued growth as the most likely outcome for the American economy in 2019. But there is a broad consensus that the pace of growth will slow as the sugar high provided by the Trump administration\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut and spending increases begins to wear off. And some forecasters see a small, but growing, chance of a recession.President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, tried to play down such concerns on Tuesday, insisting that the overall health of the economy remained robust.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of pessimism I\u2019m reading about, maybe it has to do with a mild stock market correction,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, before describing such pessimism as misplaced.

Major stock indexes are roughly flat for the year.\u201cThis is a geriatric expansion,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.Mr. Kelly noted that if economic growth continued through next summer, this would become the longest-running expansion of the American economy since at least the Civil War.It is proverbial among economists that expansions do not die of old age. But the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus will most likely drop economic growth back toward an annual rate around 2 percent, leaving little margin for error. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take much to go wrong to put us into a recession,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.Many analysts regard Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell as the greatest threats to the economic expansion.Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China has yet to make a discernible dent in domestic growth, but if the conflict continues, or escalates, the impact on the economy could increase.Another concern is that the Fed\u2019s current path of interest rate increases will choke growth.Both forces already are battering the automobile industry. Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on aluminum and steel have raised costs for carmakers, the nation\u2019s largest consumer of those materials. The Fed\u2019s rate increases, meanwhile, have raised the cost of car loans, discouraging potential buyers.\u201cI\u2019m doing deals, and I\u2019m not being accommodated by the Fed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else\u2019s brain can ever tell me.\u201dThe Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate for a fourth time this year at its next meeting, in mid-December. But Fed officials, well aware of the danger, have emphasized in recent weeks that their plans for next year will depend on the evolution of the economic data.Mr. Powell said on Wednesday that the Fed\u2019s rate hikes are approaching an important threshold \u2014 the \u201cneutral\u201d level at which rates neither stimulate nor discourage borrowing. Mr. Powell said the current level of the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate, which sits in a range between 2 percent and 2.25 percent, is \u201cjust below\u201d most estimates of the neutral level.The remarks contrasted with Mr. Powell\u2019s statement in October that the benchmark rate was still \u201ca long way\u201d from neutral.Some Fed officials have said that they want to pause at the neutral level to consider whether further rates hikes are warranted. Others have said they want to raise rates past neutral, judging that the economy will need a little restraint.Richard Clarida, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said Tuesday the economy remained \u201crobust,\u201d and that the Fed planned to keep raising rates. Deciding how high to go, he said, would require \u201cjudgment and humility.\u201dMr. Powell said earlier this month that the Fed would proceed like a man in a dark room. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d he said. \u201cYou slow down. You stop, probably, and feel your way. It\u2019s not different with policy.\u201dG.M.\u2019s cuts reflect the particular challenges facing the auto industry, including the nascent shift toward electric and self-driving vehicles. Mary T. Barra, the company\u2019s chief executive, said G.M. was eliminating some mechanical engineers to make room for more software engineers. And she said the company was not acting in anticipation of a recession. \u201cWe are taking these actions now while the company and the economy are strong to stay in front of a fast-changing market,\u201d she said.But the company\u2019s retrenchment underscored the broader fragility of the economic expansion. G.M. must fund its investment plans by cutting back in other parts of its business because its costs are rising while its sales are declining in both of its major markets: the United States and China.The Trump administration said its economic policies would deliver a lasting boost to growth, and Mr. Trump specifically highlighted the auto industry, and G.M., as beneficiaries of those policies. So far, however, those policies have delivered a short-term increase in spending.The tax cuts passed in 2017 were designed to encourage investment: New factories, new equipment, new products. Tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, and on Chinese goods, were supposed to serve the same purpose. But G.M. has said the cost of the tariffs exceeds the benefits from the tax cuts \u2014 and instead of building new factories, G.M. is moving to shutter domestic plants.Mr. Kudlow defended the administration\u2019s policies on Tuesday, and said that revisions to the North American Free Trade Agreement would help the auto industry. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of disappointment, even anger,\u201d about the company\u2019s decision, he said. The administration also said it was considering ways of punishing G.M. by ending other federal subsidies, which seemed unlikely to help the economy.\u201cConsumers haven\u2019t run out of money and confidence yet, which means economic growth remains on track,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. Mr. Rupkey noted that 46.6 percent of consumers said in the November survey of consumer confidence that good jobs were plentiful, the best figure during the current recovery. \u201cWhy is confidence so high?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s jobs, jobs, jobs.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Raymond Plank, 96, Coal Miner\u2019s Son Who Became an Oil Tycoon, Dies", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRaymond N. Plank, a coal miner\u2019s son and former combat pilot who witnessed the atomic-bomb attack on Nagasaki and then returned from the war to help found one of the nation\u2019s largest independent oil and gas companies, Apache, died on Thursday at his home in Ucross, Wyo. He was 96.His death was confirmed by his son Roger.World War II, as it happened, provided an impetus for Mr. Plank\u2019s career. Back home in Minneapolis after his service and armed with a degree from Yale, he saw a postwar surge in small businesses on the horizon. And those businesses, he knew, would need accounting and tax services.He and two business partners rented a tiny third-floor walk-up apartment in Minneapolis for $10 a month, bought a war-surplus Jeep on a New Jersey dock and began prospecting for customers.Before long, the venture, which they called Northwest Business Service, was selling insurance, mutual funds and, most auspiciously, interests in drilling oil wells.It ultimately expanded into exploration and production itself, becoming one of the nation\u2019s largest independent oil and gas companies, with reported revenue of almost $6 billion in 2017.At Apache, Mr. Plank pioneered the use of what came to be known as master limited partnerships, or M.L.P.s, an investment vehicle that can be traded publicly and offer significant tax advantages to investors.Mr. Plank\u2019s Apache \u201cdefinitely had the first partnership that was publicly traded,\u201d said Mary S. Lyman, executive director of the National Association of Publicly Traded Partnerships. In doing so, she added, Mr. Plank was responsible for \u201cdemocratizing\u201d and popularizing investments that until then had largely been confined to the rich.Oil exploration in the 1950s offered huge tax advantages at a time when the top federal income-tax brackets were 91 or 92 percent. Moreover, with the war having depleted energy resources, the government was encouraging domestic oil and gas exploration to fuel a booming postwar economy and a society increasingly dependent on automobiles, with Americans fanning out to the suburbs on newly built interstate highways.M.L.P.s helped Apache reach what Mr. Plank called \u201ccritical mass.\u201d But when oil prices fell in the 1980s and tax laws made public drilling programs less appealing, Apache dropped the partnerships. (They still thrive elsewhere, mainly for pipelines, other energy infrastructure businesses and to some extent in financial services.)Apache, Mr. Plank wrote in a memoir, \u201cA Small Difference\u201d (2012), \u201cwas the first to create and enter the M.L.P. field \u2014 and the first to leave it.\u201dA weakened Apache then moved to Denver with a plan to transform itself into a company that owned and operated oil properties for its own account. After doubling its assets and balancing its oil and gas holdings through deals with Amoco, Shell and British Petroleum, the company began to exploit a large concession in Egypt, with the help of the country\u2019s president at the time, Hosni Mubarak.\u201cThat was an absolute diamond in the rough,\u201d David C. Higgins, a 30-year Apache executive, said in an interview.Mr. Plank retired from Apache in 2009.Raymond Norwood Plank was born on May 29, 1922, in Wayzata, Minn., a small city on the shore of Lake Minnetonka, about 13 miles west of Minneapolis. His coal miner father, Raby, was also a farmer; his mother, Maude (Howe) Plank, was a homemaker. Raymond grew up on a farm, and his mother died when he was a teenager.He was in his senior year at Yale University in 1941 when World War II broke out in the United States. He left before graduation to join the Army Air Forces. Flying B-24s, he went on to survive 40 missions in the South Pacific.On Aug. 9, 1945, while stationed on an island near Okinawa, Mr. Plank risked court-martial when he and a friend made an unauthorized flight on a hunch (because all flights at the base had been cancelled) that they might witness the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan.Coming three days after the strike against Hiroshima, it was the second, and last, atomic bomb attack by American forces. Mr. Plank was one of the last surviving Americans to directly observe atomic war.With the war over, he returned to graduate from Yale in 1946 and launch himself as an entrepreneur. From its humble bookkeeping and tax-advisory infancy, Northwest Business Service built a smartly growing mix of managed assets and insurance, real estate and other interests.From this evolved Apache. (The first three letters of the name were derived from the surname initials of Mr. Plank and his partners, Truman Anderson and Chuck Arnao.) When some clients sought more liquid investments, Apache overcame a series of regulatory rebuffs to establish master limited partnerships.As the company\u2019s chairman, Mr. Plank could be cantankerous, but he maintained a reputation for integrity. He moved the company to Houston in the mid-1990s. There he determined that the Enron Corporation, also based in Houston, was riddled with fraud and concluded that huge profits were to be made by selling its stock short.\u201cI knew I could make a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Plank said in an interview for this obituary in 2014. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any inside information,\u201d he added. \u201cThese guys were sitting ducks.\u201dMr. Plank \u201cwas ahead of the curve on that one,\u201d Mr. Higgins, the former Apache executive, said. \u201cHe nailed it.\u201d Enron collapsed in scandal in 2001.In addition to his son Roger, Mr. Plank is survived by three other sons, Michael, Raby and Dana; two daughters, Kate Plank Sage and Pamela Plank Thaut; 12 grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren. His marriages to Sally Bovey Stevens, Lollie Benz and Heather Burgess ended in divorce.Mr. Plank\u2019s philanthropy was wide-ranging. In addition to the girls\u2019 schools in Egypt, he created the Ucross Foundation in northeastern Wyoming in 1981 and set up a conference center on a 20,000-acre working ranch there.Its artist-in-residence program has included winners of five Pulitzer Prizes \u2014 among them Annie Proulx, author of the best-selling novel \u201cThe Shipping News\u201d \u2014 and five MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius\u201d awards. Another best seller written in part at Ucross was Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s \u201cEat, Pray, Love.\u201dIn 2001, Mr. Plank established the Fund for Teachers, a Houston-based foundation that each year awards fellowships to some 500 public- and private-school teachers for summer study in the United States or abroad.He also established a professorship of global energy policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and was a major supporter of numerous charitable causes in Minneapolis and Wyoming, including on behalf of ranchers and farmers in his adopted state.Ana Fota contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Luck of the Democrats", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump could have flattened liberalism. Instead he\u2019s given it an opening.Opinion ColumnistOne of the interesting features of this election cycle has been the gulf, often vast, between the hysteria of liberals who write about politics for a living and the relative calm of Democrats who practice it.In the leftward reaches of my Twitter feed the hour is late, the end of democracy nigh, the Senate and the Supreme Court illegitimate, and every Trump provocation a potential Reichstag fire. But on the campaign trail, with some exceptions and variations, Democrats are being upbeat and talking about health care and taxes and various ambitious policy ideas, as though this is still America and not Weimar, a normal time and not a terrifying one.One way to look at this gulf is to argue the pundits are saying what the politicians can\u2019t \u2014 that alarmed liberals grasp the truth of things but swing voters don\u2019t, so Democratic politicians have no choice but to carry on as normal even if inside they\u2019re screaming too.To understand this good fortune, consider two counterfactuals. In the first, the last 21 months proceeded in exactly the same fashion \u2014 with the strongest economy since the 1990s, full employment almost nigh, ISIS defeated, no new overseas wars or major terrorist attacks \u2014 except that Donald Trump let his staffers dictate his Twitter feed, avoided the press except to tout good economic news, eschewed cruelties and insults and weird behavior around Vladimir Putin, and found a way to make his White House a no-drama zone.In this scenario it\u2019s hard to imagine that Trump\u2019s approval ratings wouldn\u2019t have floated up into the high 40s; they float up into the mid-40s as it is whenever he manages to shut up. Even with their threadbare and unpopular policy agenda, Republicans would be favored to keep the House and maintain their state-legislature advantages. All the structural impediments to a Democratic recovery would loom much larger, Trump\u2019s re-election would be more likely than not, and his opposition would be stuck waiting for a recession to have any chance of coming back.Then consider a second counterfactual. Imagine that instead of just containing himself and behaving like a generic Republican, Trump had actually followed through on the populism that he promised in 2016, dragging his party toward the economic center and ditching the G.O.P.\u2019s most unpopular ideas. Imagine that he followed through on Steve Bannon\u2019s boasts about a big infrastructure bill instead of trying for Obamacare repeal; imagine that he listened to Marco Rubio and his daughter and tilted his tax cut more toward middle-class families; imagine that he spent more time bullying Silicon Valley into inshoring factory jobs than whining about Fake News; imagine that he made lower Medicare drug prices a signature issue rather than a last-minute pre-election gambit.But instead all the Trumpy things that keep the commentariat in a lather and liberals in despair \u2014 the Twitter authoritarianism and white-identity appeals, the chaos and lying and Hannity-and-friends paranoid style \u2014 have also kept the Democrats completely in the game.But it\u2019s the president\u2019s denial that\u2019s more politically costly for his party. If left-wing Twitter were running Democratic strategy while Donald Trump talked about infrastructure and drug prices, 2018 might seal a conservative-populist realignment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Library Has New Books by Major Authors, but They Can\u2019t Be Read Until 2114", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Scottish artist Katie Paterson is collecting 100 unpublished works that won\u2019t be released in their writers\u2019 lifetimes.In previous years, it has rained, which means the local foresters have brewed coffee and hot chocolate on colossal iron grills while the audience has stood shivering under their umbrellas. But this year, the entire day \u2014 the entire summer, really \u2014 has been uncommonly hot and dry, and so the audience sits scattered among the saplings, drinking water and perspiring, as they listen to Shafak, author of 10 novels and a prominent feminist and critic of Turkish nationalism, speak. She describes writing a novel for the Future Library as \u201ca secular act of faith\u201d in a world that seems to have gone mad, a world that violently accentuates the differences between people instead of celebrating their common humanity. \u201cWhen you write a book,\u201d she says, \u201cyou have the faith that it will reach out to someone else, to someone who is different from you and it will connect us. That you will be able to transcend the boundaries of the self, that was given to you at birth, that you will be able to touch someone else\u2019s reality.\u201d Yet in 96 years, when the seedlings become trees and the trees are sacrificed to the written word, it is impossible to know whose reality they will touch.But these are thoughts for tomorrow and not today, which is a day for celebration. Shafak\u2019s manuscript is sealed in a handsome gray box tied with a royal purple ribbon. \u201cDon\u2019t open it and don\u2019t talk about the contents,\u201d Hovind warns Shafak as she gets up to hand the box to Paterson, who weeps softly and openly. She explains that she is especially emotional this year as she has just had a child who she has brought with her to the forest, a towheaded little creature who will be 96 years old when the Future Library\u2019s anthology is printed.Shafak kisses Paterson on both cheeks as she makes her offering. \u201cI\u2019m only allowed to share the title of the manuscript,\u201d she apologizes, turning back to the audience. \u201cIt is called \u2018The Last Taboo.\u2019\u201d\u201cPERSONS OR THINGS which are regarded as taboo may be compared to objects charged with electricity,\u201d observed the anthropologist Northcote Thomas. Taboo, a Polynesian word that Sigmund Freud translated as \u201choly dread,\u201d most often referred to an action that was both sacred and forbidden, consecrated and dangerous. It is an apt description of the Future Library, which grafts an environmental taboo onto an artistic one: trees that are planted to be cut down; books that are written not to be read.The manuscripts are electrified by these taboos. In 2020, they will be moved to the New Deichmanske Library, currently under construction in Oslo, where they will be displayed in a \u201cSilent Room\u201d: a womb-shaped chamber facing the forest, lined with wood from its trees. Visitors will be able to enter, one or two at a time, to gaze at the manuscripts lying under their protective glass cases, waiting for the years to pass. More like a prayer closet than a reading room, Paterson describes the Silent Room as a \u201ccontemplative space.\u201d Her hope is that it will prompt the visitor\u2019s imagination to journey through \u201cdeep time\u201d to probe the mysteries of the forest.What Paterson\u2019s description of the Silent Room makes clear is that the books of the Future Library were never meant to be read, certainly not in our lifetime, but not even in the future. They are meant to be worshiped, to be desired \u2014 a desire that draws all its strength from the impossibility of reading or reproducing them: Theirs is the fetishization of the singular, the uninterpretable. Like the 48 surviving copies of the original Gutenberg Bible, the manuscripts are devotional rather than functional objects, the geneses of a new practice of reading and writing. The correspondence they stage between writer and reader is not the immediacy of address Shafak attributes to a book as it circulates in the world but the projection of a literary kinship so deep, so transcendent, that it is worth waiting for \u2014 worth dying without.It is no coincidence that the re-enchantment comes at a time when books as objects are treated like endangered species, their vitality threatened by the rise of new media ecologies and economies. This is a false panic \u2014 there are more books published and printed now than ever \u2014 but it is an infectious one. You can hear the defensiveness in her voice when Paterson insists during the Handover Ceremony that, in a hundred years, \u201cThere will be life! There will be books!\u201d and it is surprising to note that her inflection falls harder on the latter than the former. What she means is that there will still be certain kinds of books: books written by authors already consecrated by the Western, white literary establishment; books which will be exempt from the vicissitudes of the market and preserved in what David Mitchell, referring to the Future Library, called \u201cthe Ark of Literature.\u201d But the ark does not preserve those who are most in need of preservation. It is firmly committed to those authors who have already proven themselves the fittest, at least according to the tastes of the current literary marketplace.What seems more na\u00efve is how the mystical valence of the book is tied to the fate of life on earth, as if the manuscript\u2019s totemic powers could somehow ward off ecological devastation. The hope that underwrites the Future Library is, in turn, underwritten by a near apocalyptic sense of doom. Ecocide is a frightening, complicated political issue, and yet the members of the Future Library Trust allude to it with a strange air of placidity. \u201cThis is a simple place,\u201d Hovind says of the clearing. Paterson echoes her sentiment. \u201cThis is an ordinary forest,\u201d she says, as if the simplicity or ordinariness of the trees meant that protecting them did not have to be complicated, as if everything that threatened them could be wished away.THE OPTIMISM OF ART feeds off the pessimism of ecocide \u2014 this is the dialectic that sits at the heart of projects like the Future Library and their banks of sacred objects. Many of these projects are in or around Oslo, which is a wealthy city that can afford to be one of the most sustainable. Buoyed by a rise in oil prices and Norway\u2019s generous welfare state, Oslo has invested heavily in sustainability initiatives: hydropower plants, biofuel buses, electric cars, an energy-positive airport city. Here it is a privilege and a duty to be aware of not just today, but the next hundred years.If the ark is one metaphor that writers have invoked to describe projects like the seed bank and the Future Library, the other is the time capsule \u2014 quixotic, hopeful, in search of a connection with another time and place. Not far from the seed bank is the stainless-steel box buried last year in Hornsund, Svalbard by permafrost researchers from the Polish Academy of Sciences. The box included an assortment of \u201ctechno-fossils\u201d: a cellphone, a credit card, a compass, a bee in resin, human and rat DNA samples, and 300 live, desiccated tardigrades \u2014 eight-legged micro-animals known as \u201cwater bears\u201d or \u201cmoss piglets.\u201d In a particularly poetic gesture, many of the scientists left their own fingerprints on the inside of the container cap. \u201cOur own time capsule is sure to be found one distant day, and its discoverers will be able to grasp the message,\u201d said Marek Lewandowski, the scientist who selected the objects. \u201cIf they look carefully inside \u2014 like we did into the Cheops pyramid and the tombs and artifacts inside it \u2014 they will understand who we were.\u201dThe desire for understanding across time is a powerful fantasy of human endurance, and deliberately burying things (or shooting them off into space, like NASA\u2019s Golden Record) is a 5,000-year old tradition that gives material life to this fantasy. Objects can testify to our existence in the absence of people, inviting many colorful and curious retro-projections of what we were like. For the curators of time capsules, what is more important than factual testimony is the endlessly speculative revival of the past \u2014 the production of stories not unlike those now housed in the Future Library.But hope is a quiet and melancholic affect, an ethical position that is defined by a horizon of impossibility rather than action. Hope does not agitate. It does not incite opposition; it is often touted as transcending politics. Perhaps this is what makes it so readily available for art, which often privileges the virtual, the magical, over the political, economic and ecological practicalities of building a sustainable city, weaning it off fossil fuels and decreasing carbon emissions. The reconstitution of hope is an artistic task; indeed, it is art\u2019s only possible gift to the future. The Future Library is real in that there are books being written for it and there are trees growing to fuel its creation. But its politics are imaginary.Advertisement"}

She graduated from Middlebury College and received a master's degree in global affairs at the University of Toronto.She is a daughter of Barbara E. Jordan and Allan L. Morrison of Toronto. The bride\u2019s father is the principal and founder of a Toronto-based international and commercial law firm that bears his name. Her mother, who is retired, was a consultant in Toronto for Toronto Children's Services.The groom, also 33, is the senior adviser to the under secretary for International Affairs at the Department of the Treasury in Washington. He previously served as the Treasury Department's financial attach\u00e9 to Mexico and Central America, and was based in Mexico City. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University, from which he also received a master\u2019s degree in international finance and a Ph.D. in international political economy. He is the author of \u201cSocial Finance: Shadow Banking During the Global Financial Crisis\u201d (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018).He is the son of Shaila K. Shenai and Kamalakar P. Shenai of Orlando, Fla. The groom\u2019s mother, who is retired, was the vice president for marketing production at the Xerox Corporation in Rochester. His father, also retired, was the chief client officer of Sutherland Global Services, a business process outsourcing firm in Rochester.When Ms. Morrison booked a one-way ticket to Mexico City in September 2014, leaving behind a good job in Toronto, \u201ceveryone thought I was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Mexico was undergoing fiscal and financial reform, which opened up many new opportunities.\u201dShe soon found work there as a senior associate in the investigations and dispute practice at Kroll, a corporate investigations and risk consulting firm based in New York.In December 2016, she found Mr. Shenai, whom she was introduced to through a mutual friend at a bar in Mexico City. He had arrived three months earlier, just after being appointed the Treasury Department\u2019s representative to Mexico and Central America.\u201cI had broken up with the woman I was seeing prior to moving because neither of us wanted to date long distance,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I moved to Mexico, I was single and a little bit lonely, and decided to throw myself into my work.\u201dThen he met Ms. Morrison, who threw him for a loop.\u201cI thought she was just this incredibly dynamic, intelligent woman,\u201d Mr. Shenai said. \u201cWe clicked immediately, and spoke as if we had known each other all of our lives.\u201dThey learned they had grown up about 100 miles away from each other on opposite sides of Lake Ontario, she in Toronto and he in Rochester. They also lived a block apart in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington, and had several friends in common.Mr. Shenai told Ms. Morrison he thought her move to Mexico City, \u201cwas courageous, not crazy.\u201d\u201cAnyone willing to leave behind a cushy life in a developed world and move to a more uncertain place, well, there\u2019s a certain level of adventure there, a willingness to roll the dice,\u201d he said, \u201cand I found that very attractive about her.\u201dMs. Morrison, who would start at Goldcorp in March 2017, knew she had found someone special in Mr. Shenai. \u201cHe was a very handsome and extremely positive person,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was also very easy to talk to, someone I just wanted to be around.\u201dWhen they returned to the States for a few weeks to enjoy the holidays with their families, he was all she could think about.\u201cI was counting the days until I saw him again,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Blue Chip Companies Pile on Debt, It\u2019s Time to Worry", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFueled by cheap credit, American corporations have been gorging on acquisitions. The party may soon be over.Mr. Cohan is a former investment banker and the author of four books about Wall Street.Corporations, like people, are pretty simple: They do what they are rewarded to do. So when the Federal Reserve, by keeping interest rates very low for nearly a decade, rewards companies for borrowing money by making it historically inexpensive to do so, it can\u2019t be a surprise to anyone that that\u2019s exactly what they did.It\u2019s been quite a party. Now comes the hangover. In the last decade, well-established companies including G.E., AT&T, CVS Health, Sherwin-Williams and Campbell Soup went on acquisition binges fueled largely by cheap borrowing. As interest rates rise and the economy appears to be slowing, they are in not-insignificant danger of defaulting on the debt, a fear that has started to cause disturbing ripples in the debt and equity markets. But the heavy debt load leaves little margin for error, making a tricky merger \u2014 combining a legacy phone company with a major content provider \u2014 even more difficult. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure what AT&T is anymore,\u201d said Christopher Whalen, the founder of Whalen Global Advisors, an advisory and economic research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a resurrected zombie.\u201dThere\u2019s a lot at risk here. If these BBB-rated companies get downgraded further into \u201cjunk\u201d status \u2014 a distinct possibility if a slowing economy makes a dent in their profits or if their big acquisitions do not pay off \u2014 a vicious cycle is nearly inevitable. That means higher borrowing costs when it comes time to refinance or to obtain a new credit line and an increasing risk of default.When bellwether companies such as G.E., AT&T and IBM get into financial difficulty, that\u2019s bad news for the rest of us. When credit markets feel nervous about the biggest corporations, it\u2019s a good bet that it will be harder for ordinary Americans to get or refinance a mortgage, or get a car loan or credit card. It is a scenario that became very familiar a decade ago; the sequel may be upon us soon.William D.

{"Headline": "Why the Director of \u2018Anchorman\u2019 Decided to Take On Dick Cheney", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "FeatureWith \u201cVice,\u201d his biopic of Bush\u2019s vice president, Adam McKay completes his journey from \u201cS.N.L.\u201d writer to fierce critic of the American right.Supported byMcKay made his name as a filmmaker in the early 2000s with a string of hit comedies that included \u201cAnchorman\u201d and \u201cTalladega Nights.\u201d But since co-writing and directing a 2015 adaptation of Michael Lewis\u2019s financial-crash caper \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which earned him an Oscar for screenwriting, he has gravitated to more serious material. His new movie, \u201cVice,\u201d is a grim account of the life of Dick Cheney, with Christian Bale \u2014 smoldering beneath prosthetic jowls and the ample weight he gained for the role \u2014 in the lead. McKay went into it aware that it would be, as he put it to me, \u201cthe most challenging, ambitious movie\u201d he ever made.\u201cThe movie was big,\u201d he said. His shooting script encompassed five decades of Cheney\u2019s life, 200 locations and more than 150 speaking parts. Chief among McKay\u2019s coping mechanisms for stress, going back to his 20s, were cigarettes and junk food, and during the \u201cVice\u201d shoot, he averaged half a pack of American Spirit Ultra Lights a day and put on around 25 pounds. When filming was through, McKay, who is 50, booked time with a trainer he\u2019d hired before. He came over for a session in mid-January. It was then that McKay\u2019s stomach turned. \u201cMy trainer says, \u2018Are you O.K.?\u2019 And I\u2019m, like: \u2018Yeah, yeah, I\u2019m just in bad shape. I\u2019m worn out. I\u2019m still smoking.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe trainer decided not to push it and left. Just then, McKay remembered that Bale, when researching Cheney\u2019s several heart attacks in preparation for \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cmet with a heart surgeon, and he said: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of ways you can show a heart attack. The hands tingling is one, the most common one is the pain in the arm, but what\u2019s really common is queasiness.\u2019 And in that moment, I ran upstairs.\u201d McKay swallowed three baby aspirin and called his wife, who called 911. At the hospital, a doctor confirmed the bad news: He\u2019d had a heart attack. The good news was that they were opening him up, inserting a stent and, if McKay quit smoking and got into better shape, he\u2019d come out fine. One of his two daughters brought him a card at the hospital that read, \u201cCongratulations on Your New Baby!\u201d which she\u2019d modified to say, \u201cI\u2019m Sorry about Your New Heart Attack!\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m 100 percent O.K.,\u201d McKay said. \u201cI do get a little lightheaded sometimes, but I recovered. It\u2019s like in \u2018Jaws,\u2019 when the shark swims right past the kid and doesn\u2019t touch him.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd then about two days later, I called Bale and I said, \u2018Hey man, either you or Dick Cheney saved my life.\u2019\u2009\u201dThis is as close as McKay is likely to come to expressing good will toward the 46th vice president. Far from a grateful tribute, \u201cVice\u201d \u2014 which co-stars Amy Adams as Cheney\u2019s wife, Lynne \u2014 proceeds in a spirit of frenetic and ferocious irreverence. Annapurna, the company behind the film, spent about $60 million to make it, and executives there are positioning the movie, as they did last year with \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d as a major awards-season contender. But McKay had little interest in obeying the familiar rhythms of the academy-pleasing biopic that Cheney\u2019s story might have inspired. In previous features, McKay staged the murder of a man by an airborne trident; filmed a prosthetic scrotum in close-up bobbing atop a snare drum; and enlisted Margot Robbie to explain subprime mortgages from a bubble bath. And yet \u201cVice\u201d is, in tone and form, one of the wildest movies he has made \u2014 and one of the wildest movies ever made about politics, period.A filmmaker less restive than McKay, having cast actors as gifted as Bale and Adams, might have done his best impersonation of, say, Steven Spielberg directing \u201cLincoln\u201d \u2014 filling his movie with so much solemn soliloquizing and rousing Oval Office debate. But in \u201cVice,\u201d scenes of finely wrought drama give way to passages of surreally heightened satire, which in turn give way to horrible v\u00e9rit\u00e9 footage of \u201cenhanced interrogations.\u201d The movie doesn\u2019t only double and triple back on itself but is punctuated throughout with nature-documentary clips, the \u201cWhassup!\u201d beer commercial and a variety of self-reflexive feints. The film\u2019s narrator is Jesse Plemons, whose relationship to Cheney is mysterious: at points he is a soldier, at others a warehouse worker, and at others, Naomi Watts, playing a cable-news anchor, is suddenly narrating instead.What is unambiguous, by the end, is McKay\u2019s conviction that the American right, in its post-Reagan consolidation of power, has set our country and our planet on a path to ruin \u2014 and that no single figure illustrates this better than Cheney. \u201cHe was the expert safecracker who opened up the safe,\u201d McKay said, alluding to Cheney\u2019s deft dismantling of checks on executive power, \u201cand now the orangutan is in there, throwing around the money and the jewels.\u201d McKay knows that a conservative backlash to his film is very likely, and while he emphasized how diligently he grounded the film in research, he also argued that making a less confrontational movie, hewing to a measured realism would have felt not only boring but also incommensurate to the task.\u201cI\u2019ve never dealt with a tone like this, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s by accident,\u201d McKay said. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a world with a tone that none of us has ever experienced. Pipe bombs are being sent to the leaders of a political party, and the guy who made \u2018Dilbert\u2019 is saying, You know the bombs were really made by left-wingers because they didn\u2019t work.\u201d He made an incredulous face. \u201cSo, you\u2019re claiming the assassination attempts are a false flag operation while slamming the liberals and you\u2019re the guy who did \u2018Dilbert\u2019?\u201d When it came to the movie\u2019s protean tone, he said, \u201cAll I can tell you is that we were very conscious of it, we knew it was challenging and indefinable \u2014 and we knew it had to be.\u201dThis was true, he added, not in spite of the material\u2019s seriousness, but because of it. \u201cI\u2019m suspicious of anything that feels like an old form,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re discovering new styles and forms, because this era we\u2019re in demands it. The world has gotten so cartoonishly exaggerated and over the top. Why be subtle anymore?\u201dBut like many self-identifying progressives, McKay \u2014 who grew up on food stamps and was raised in suburban Pennsylvania by his waitress single mother (his father, a musician, left the family when McKay was 7) \u2014 has grown steadily disenchanted with what he calls \u201cthe corporate left.\u201d This summer he joined the L.A. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. He thinks that capitalism must come under greater, Scandinavian-style regulatory control, \u201cespecially if we\u2019re going to do anything about climate change.\u201d Earlier this year he left Funny or Die, a comedy website he co-founded in 2007, after it entered into a sponsored-content agreement with Shell, a deal he called \u201cdisgusting.\u201dMcKay stands at a towering 6-foot-5 and sometimes seems to have more body than he knows what to do with. In his home office, he arranged himself across a beige couch like a coat hurled off in a hurry: torso horizontal, head kinked up against a pillow, legs crossed off the front. The room was trimmed in dark wood. \u201cThis is where I wrote \u2018Vice,\u2019\u2009\u201d McKay said, indicating a desk facing a bay window. A faux-Roman bust, purchased in a prop-department sale for $5, dwarfed McKay\u2019s computer. A vintage poster for the Japanese release of \u201cNetwork\u201d hung beside bookshelves decorated with memorabilia from McKay\u2019s films: the clapboard from \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d a production still from \u201cThe Other Guys.\u201dPiled together on one shelf were some of the books McKay consulted for \u201cVice,\u201d including Barton Gellman\u2019s Cheney biography, \u201cAngler,\u201d Jane Mayer\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d history, \u201cThe Dark Side,\u201d and Cheney\u2019s own memoir, \u201cIn My Time.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of layers to my attraction to Cheney\u2019s story, and one of them is how quiet and mysterious he was, how he\u2019s covered his trail all these years,\u201d McKay said. \u201cYou read his entire autobiography, and you learn nothing about him. Cheney is one of the most brilliant bureaucratic infighters in history, but he knew how to do all this stuff so that you barely knew it was happening.\u201dMcKay has dedicated his recent work to illuminating just such self-obscuring systems of power, the kind that depend on opacity to function. In \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d the narrator, played by Ryan Gosling, puts it this way: \u201cMortgage-backed securities. Subprime loans. Tranches. It\u2019s pretty confusing, right? Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid? Well, it\u2019s supposed to. Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or, even better, for you just to leave them the [expletive] alone.\u201d Last year, McKay directed the pilot for and served as an executive producer on \u201cSuccession,\u201d an HBO drama about a Murdoch-style media-empire patriarch and his reprobate heirs \u2014 their nefarious business dealings and abject power moves.In \u201cVice,\u201d he uses Cheney\u2019s life to tell a broader tale about what McKay describes as \u201cthe Republican revolution and how it changed our country.\u201d He sees Cheney as a \u201cZelig-style\u201d figure of the right. His career in national politics began in the Nixon administration as a congressional intern and then apprentice to Donald Rumsfeld and, from there, intersected and coincided with the rise of key conservative figures: among them the Fox News founder, Roger Ailes, who first floated the idea for a conservative news network while working for Nixon; right-wing megadonors like the Koch brothers; conservative strategy shops like the Heritage Foundation; and, finally, George W. Bush, over whose administration \u2014 and over whose decision to invade Iraq after Sept. 11, despite paltry intelligence linking the two \u2014 Cheney exercised unprecedented influence for a vice president.One of McKay\u2019s models was \u201cThe Power Broker,\u201d Robert Caro\u2019s landmark biography of Robert Moses. \u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of all this stuff,\u201d McKay said of Cheney, \u201cand finally he gets his hand on the wheel.\u201d Unlike Caro, McKay had to tell his story through a camera, and so there are compressions, elisions and metaphors in \u201cVice\u201d that reflect both a filmmaker\u2019s desire to enthrall the crowd and a prosecutor\u2019s desire to nail the defendant. Reading journalistic accounts of Cheney\u2019s move, in 2000, from the private sector back into public service, we learn that he took elaborate steps to divest from Halliburton, the oil conglomerate where he was C.E.O., to avoid the appearance of conflict; here, the relationship between Cheney and the energy sector is presented as one of clear cronyism. Or take Sept. 11. In Barton Gellman\u2019s play-by-play of that morning in \u201cAngler,\u201d it\u2019s strongly implied that Cheney usurped Bush\u2019s authority, ignoring the chain of command and giving fighter jets the O.K. to shoot down commercial airliners if they appeared to be hijacked. The official White House version was that Bush gave Cheney permission to pass along this order, and Gellman, poring carefully through communications records and notes taken by administration staff members, leaves open the extremely slim possibility that this is true. In \u201cVice\u201d there is no such equivocation. We see Cheney give the order to take out the planes himself. Compression, of course, isn\u2019t the same as distortion: Jane Mayer, the investigative journalist, described this scene to me as \u201ca perfect gem,\u201d and told McKay, after he screened the movie for her, that he \u201cgot it right.\u201dOne way McKay might have buttressed \u201cVice\u201d against possible charges of liberal bias would be to include the sorts of political critiques he readily offers up in conversation. \u201cWhen Clinton was elected, he cut welfare and deregulated banks, just like a Republican would have done,\u201d he said, from his couch. \u201cObama waged a war against whistle-blowers, he let the banks off the hook and he expanded executive power.\u201d McKay did tinker for a while with stitching points like these into \u201cVice\u201d \u2014 making it \u201cthe story of Dick Cheney and the rise of the Republican Party, and how they got so big they swallowed the Democrats.\u201d To this end, he pieced in footage of Hillary Clinton supporting the Iraq war. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard,\u201d McKay went on. \u201cThe audience only has a certain amount of oxygen in their lungs.\u201d As he said earlier: \u201cI could have made the movie three and a half hours long, but you can thank me that I didn\u2019t.\u201d (The film runs just over 130 minutes.)McKay predicted that some of the fiercest criticisms of \u201cVice\u201d might come from putatively sympathetic voices: \u201cI actually think left-wing friends of mine are going to be mad at me for humanizing him as much as I do.\u201d Throughout the film, Cheney is depicted as a fearsomely capable stalker of prey; a recurring motif concerns his passion for fly fishing, which McKay described to me as crucial to understanding him. He hired a fly fisherman as a consultant. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe the level of patience and detail that\u2019s involved \u2014 lifting up the rocks to see what kinds of bugs are underneath so you know what kind of lure to use; watching the drift, the way the sun\u2019s hitting it so you know what illusion to create with your lure. And that\u2019s the story with Dick Cheney. Meticulous detail and tremendous patience.\u201d Cheney is rendered tenderly in his interactions with Lynne, his sweetheart since high school, and with his second daughter, Mary, whose coming out as gay in the mid-\u201980s he met with private encouragement and affection. Christian Bale told me that he seized on Cheney\u2019s marriage as his way into the role. \u201cWith any part, you choose what you focus on,\u201d he said, explaining that, in \u201cVice,\u201d he chose \u201cthe love story. I think Cheney\u2019s one of the most romantic men around. At the start he wasn\u2019t particularly ambitious. Very laid back. But he has this undying love, where he\u2019ll do anything to win Lynne\u2019s approval \u2014 he did it all for her.\u201d He added that \u201cthe hardest thing with playing him was trying to understand that awesome power. I could never quite imagine what it must be like to wake up every morning knowing the power within your hands, where your choices affect whether people will die. I obsessed over it for months. But I don\u2019t think he sees himself as a villain \u2014 unless someone\u2019s a sociopath, I think they believe their motives are for a bigger good.\u201dOn the subject of villainy, McKay said: \u201cCheney and Bush did kill, conservatively, half a million civilians in Iraq. Some estimates have it at more than a million. So he\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d But, he said, \u201cI think you have to humanize him, because unless we see how a regular human being can go down these roads, it\u2019s useless.\u201d (McKay has heard nothing from the Cheneys, who did not participate in the making of the film, although he noted that Mary started following him on Twitter.)Recently, a sizable portion of the left has adopted surprising, relatively sanguine attitudes toward the Bush-Cheney years. I asked McKay, who directed a scathingly satirical 2009 Broadway show about Bush called, \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome America,\u201d whether he saw his unsparing portrait of Cheney in \u201cVice\u201d \u2014 humanizing gestures notwithstanding \u2014 as a would-be corrective to liberal amnesia on this score. \u201cI hope to God that it is,\u201d McKay said, nodding. \u201cReally what that shows you is the number of people for whom government is just about appearance. Bush and Cheney just kept up the facade, whereas this administration doesn\u2019t even remotely pretend. So when I hear people say, \u2018I miss the days of Bush and Cheney,\u2019 what they\u2019re really saying is, \u2018I miss the days when people would at least pretend.\u2019\u2009\u201d He went on: \u201cEvery time I see it, I shake my head, like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. The world economy collapsed, we had the greatest military fiasco in U.S. history apart from Vietnam.\u2019 When I hear \u2018Trump makes you miss Bush,\u2019 I go, \u2018There\u2019s no question that Bush and Cheney are way ahead of him in terms of damage done.\u2019\u2009\u201d He characterized such Bush nostalgia bluntly: \u201cNow that my house is on fire, I long for when it was infested by bees.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been playing with this one scene,\u201d McKay explained. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our most challenging runs.\u201d The scene in question takes place in Dick and Lynne Cheney\u2019s bedroom on a stormy night in 2000, after George W. Bush has won the Republican nomination and offered Cheney the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Cheney has declined, volunteering instead to lead the vice-presidential search. In the available accounts of this moment, Cheney\u2019s motivations remain obscure. Was the search a canard \u2014 a mechanism for Cheney, who always intended to take the job, to amass dirt on G.O.P. luminaries that he could later leverage against them? By stalling, was he able to extract more power from Bush when he eventually said yes?Rather than paper over this uncertainty, McKay decided to dramatize it in a particularly audacious way: Bale and Adams begin speaking in a Shakespearean approximation of Early Modern English. \u201cIs my life to be spent in servant\u2019s bow to Nixon, Ford, the thespian Reagan and Bush the Elder?\u201d Dick asks, to which Lynne replies, \u201cDanced nimbly \u2019round the kings\u2019 hearth thou hath, even whilst clamored I for more.\u201d As thunder grows louder in the background, the couple converse in iambs for three full minutes, working themselves up into a libidinal fever as they contemplate the opportunity before them: \u201cMine own blood and will are yours \u2019til pierced be the last soldier\u2019s breastplate spilling forth its ruby jellied treasures!\u201d Adams cries out as she climbs atop Bale.Corwin showed me the Shakespeare run, then said, \u201cEvery time we play this at test screenings \u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s resoundingly rejected,\u201d McKay said.\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying how much people hate it,\u201d Corwin reiterated.Wholey chimed in on a more upbeat note: \u201cI missed it when you took it out.\u201d\u201cSome people love it,\u201d McKay allowed, \u201cbut three out of four definitely hate it.\u201dMcKay has long relied on test screenings to shape his movies. Making comedies, he liked to swap in different punch lines for different crowds, like a stand-up, seeing which ones got bigger laughs and tweaking cuts accordingly. Even after moving into drama, he has found test screenings and focus groups indispensable to ensuring that audiences remain on board, moment to moment \u2014 especially so with \u201cVice,\u201d given its collage of moods and modes. \u201cIf you sit in rooms like this too long, you lose perspective,\u201d Corwin said. Not that the goal is milquetoast consensus. In 2013, when I visited the set of \u201cAnchorman 2,\u201d McKay put it to me this way: \u201cIdeally, you want to be alienating four people, and you want six people to love it.\u201d (Annapurna is likely hoping for more favorable math \u2014 in October, reports circulated that the company was suffering from money trouble, attributed to its model of spending lavishly on auteur-driven projects; McKay\u2019s movies have all done well at the box office, but several of these reports invoked \u201cVice\u201d as a particularly pricey gamble. Annapurna dismisses such reports and says they have full confidence in \u201cVice.\u201d)McKay also showed \u201cVice\u201d to filmmaker friends like Paul Thomas Anderson and David O. Russell. After Anderson, who watched two preliminary cuts, told McKay that the end of the movie worked great but the start \u201chad problems,\u201d McKay decided to scrap two early sections: an elaborate musical number and a prolonged passage set in Cheney\u2019s Wyoming adolescence. McKay adored both but decided that Anderson was right \u2014 they were gumming up the machinery.Amy Adams, for her part, loved the Shakespeare sequence. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great way to explain the motivations of the characters,\u201d she said, while acknowledging that \u201cit was challenging, because it could so easily feel big and broad, but it has to feel intimate.\u201d The passage testified, in her mind, to the way McKay \u201cwas able to so seamlessly navigate tone.\u201d She mentioned an informal exercise that she and McKay practiced on set to help keep her grounded in her character despite the movie\u2019s many shifts in register. \u201cI\u2019d come in at the beginning of the day, kind of half-Lynne, half-Amy, and Adam and I would have these debates\u201d \u2014 about news events depicted in the film, about whatever was in the headlines on that day of shooting. \u201cIt was such a great tool for me to get into Lynne,\u201d she said.McKay wasn\u2019t sure he could get the Shakespeare scene to click, but he was intent on trying. \u201cWe have a nice head of steam going through this part of the movie that we\u2019re loath to mess up, so we took it out for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scene ends well \u2014 it\u2019s always ended well. Getting into it is a little rickety. Now we\u2019re feeling that the movie\u2019s overall structure is playing so strong, though, that maybe we can try and pull off this cliff dive.\u201d So they experimented. Three minutes did feel long. Could they trim the exchange closer to one? And what if Plemons\u2019s narrator came in up top with some coy prefatory remarks to the effect of, \u201cO.K., so we have no idea what was going through Cheney\u2019s head here, and it\u2019s not like we can just imagine it through a scene of fake Shakespeare \u2014 or can we?\u201dMcKay was leaning toward something like that: \u201cMy new thought is maybe we just go bigger with our interruption.\u201d What if the screen went black?\u201cNo matter what we do, there\u2019s gonna be a \u2018What the [expletive]\u2019 reaction,\u201d said Corwin.\u201cOh, that\u2019s a given,\u201d McKay replied. \u201cIt\u2019s more about percentages of \u2018What the. ... \u2019 I could live with 46 percent. I could even get to 55-60 percent. But this scene might be 88 percent, where you start ripping a hole in the movie. Are you O.K. with 88 percent \u2018What the ... ,\u2019 Hank?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll follow you to the gates of hell,\u201d Corwin said, and rewound the scene to give it another look.He found a like-minded conspirator in Will Ferrell, who was hired onto \u201cS.N.L.\u201d the same day as McKay, and who shared his taste for absurd sketches poking fun at oafish, arrogant, rageful men. In the first thing they wrote together, Ferrell played a grotesque version of Neil Diamond, revealing the depraved inspirations behind benign hits like \u201cForever in Blue Jeans.\u201d (\u201cThis next song I wrote after I killed a drifter to get an erection.\u201d) One of McKay\u2019s fondest early contributions to the show starts with the title sequence for a program called \u201cThe Hulk Hogan Talk Show!!!\u201d This sequence \u2014 consisting of a droningly repetitive jingle, garish title cards and numerous stills of Hogan in the ring \u2014 lasts an almost interminable 45 seconds, ramping up in fanfare as it goes. The joke is that this is all misdirection. When the talk show finally starts, we are greeted by Ferrell, wearing a suit and tie on a chintzy set and interviewing a recently released hostage. \u201cHulk Hogan is on vacation,\u201d Ferrell says. \u201cI\u2019m your guest host, Phil Tobin.\u201d (McKay mocked Cheney several times on the show, including in cold opens and an installment of the animated \u201cX-Presidents\u201d series, which he co-wrote, during which the ghost of George Washington calls Cheney \u201ca douche bag\u201d and impales him with a quill pen.)McKay traces his sense of humor to a youthful love of Monty Python and some lasting lessons in irreverence from his mother. \u201cShe\u2019d always be poking holes in things,\u201d McKay said, whether it was sneaking him into the local Y.M.C.A. pool, because memberships were too expensive, or reading children\u2019s books and changing them \u201cso that Little Andy and Dottie were going to the supermarket and shoplifting.\u201d He recalled how one April Fools\u2019 Day, when he was in second grade, he got into bed and she\u2019d dumped sand into it. \u201cAnd she\u2019s like, \u2018April Fools\u2019! It confused me for a couple days, but then it was awesome. It opened up the whole world to me, like, You can play pranks on people!\u201d Over the past decade or so, McKay noted, his mother has grown increasingly conservative, faithfully watching Fox News and voting for Trump in the 2016 election despite supporting Obama in 2008. McKay described her move rightward as a source of both pain and confusion for him \u2014 and a source of ongoing debate between them \u2014 but said that their relationship remained a loving one.When he went to college at Temple University in Philadelphia, McKay studied literature. His favorite authors were those who scrambled storytelling conventions, like John Dos Passos and William Faulkner. Outside class, he tried stand-up comedy. \u201cI started doing open mics and bombing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was never great, but I got decent enough.\u201d McKay has said, \u201cOccasionally I\u2019d drop a political joke in, and I was really bad at it, so I would quickly get them out of my act and go back to joking about airplanes and girlfriends I broke up with.\u201dDuring his senior year, a fellow aspiring comedian named Rick Roman came back from a trip to Chicago and told him, \u201c\u2009\u2018There\u2019s this thing out there called long-form improv, where you get onstage and do whatever you want,\u2019\u2009\u201d McKay recalled. \u201cI go, \u2018Like stand-up?\u2019 \u2018No. You go into a scene and you say, \u201cWe\u2019re on the moon,\u201d and the only rule is you can\u2019t say no.\u2019\u2009\u201d McKay was sold. In 1990, just 18 credits shy of graduation, he unloaded his comic-book collection for $800, bought a secondhand Chrysler and moved to Chicago.There, he enrolled in improv classes with the avant-garde acting coach Del Close, a gruff, bearded guru whose past students had included Bill Murray and Gilda Radner, and whose \u201990s-era charges included Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert. (Close died in 1999.) McKay joined an improv team called the Family, which became Close\u2019s test group: \u201cHe would work out his new forms through us,\u201d McKay recalled. In one of these, \u201cwe\u2019d improvise a whole movie, and use movie language \u2014 credits, camera angles, smash cuts and all.\u201d McKay, the erstwhile lit major, named one new form \u201cthe Deconstruction\u201d: \u201cYou started with a scene played really well. Close listening, detailed characters, implying a world. And then for the rest of the form you rip that first scene apart: pick up on pieces of it, flash backward, flash forward, pick up a character element and exaggerate it.\u201dIn the early 1990s, McKay formed a troupe that would become the Upright Citizens Brigade, including Matt Besser, Horatio Sanz and Ian Roberts. Today, U.C.B. has grown into a bicoastal talent factory, offering classes in New York and Los Angeles, and its former students are everywhere in modern comedy. In its earliest incarnation, though, it was a scrappy upstart with an anarchic sensibility that stood in contrast to more established and relatively staid Chicago outfits like Second City. \u201cWe were doing this crazy show in a coffee house, but then we got a good review, and there were lines around the block,\u201d McKay said. \u201cIt was an amazing experience, but I was still broke.\u201d He eventually decamped for Second City, where he was integral to some modernizing changes \u2014 no more stage, no more curtain, no more rigidly formulaic revues \u2014 and where he \u201cactually started making some money. Besser was pissed at me, but I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, I can\u2019t pay my rent!\u2019\u2009\u201d (His U.C.B. teammates soon replaced him with another young comedian, Amy Poehler.)It\u2019s hard to imagine McKay making a movie like \u201cVice\u201d without his time spent exploding narrative strategies and provoking audiences in Chicago. This is nowhere clearer than in accounts of \u201cPi\u00f1ata Full of Bees,\u201d a hit Second City revue he cocreated. In one bit, McKay portrayed Noam Chomsky as a substitute teacher, terrifying grade-school children with the genocidal story of \u201cthe real Thanksgiving.\u201d Cast members would interrupt performances to recite statistics about how, say, military spending dwarfed welfare spending.One night, they tried to convince the audience that President Clinton had just moments before been killed, stopping the performance with a shellshocked announcement. Wheeling out a television to watch news of the assassination, however, the cast became distracted by frivolous programming. The comedian Scott Adsit, who was part of the troupe, described this stunt several years ago: \u201cWe all started sitting with our backs to the audience, watching sports bloopers, and didn\u2019t do anything but laugh at the TV for another 10 minutes, until the room cleared.\u201d It was a macabre and confrontational prank they pulled only once, Adsit said, noting that even some Second City members were uncomfortable with it. He gave credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 where it was due: \u201cIt was Adam McKay\u2019s idea.\u201dMcKay, like Hayes and Glass, has become invested in figuring out how to get audiences to enjoy the taste of vegetables. He is producing a documentary series at Amazon called \u201cThis Giant Beast That Is the Global Economy,\u201d which will explore such topics as the corruption-riddled world of concrete. He has signed on to direct a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence as Elizabeth Holmes, the Silicon Valley executive, indicted on charges of fraud, behind the disgraced health-services company Theranos. And, he told me, he has three ideas for movies about climate change, which he considers the ultimate vegetable: \u201cI have one that\u2019s epic, one that\u2019s comedic and one that\u2019s a poetic art film,\u201d he said. The comedy \u2014 the only one of these he would describe \u2014 concerns a group of Republican congresspeople from Oklahoma, forced to live in an air-conditioned dome after their state has been otherwise depopulated by global warming, unwilling to give up their seats despite their nonexistent constituency.If McKay ever makes this movie, it will be bleak, no matter how funny it turns out. He acknowledged that \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is a bleak movie, too, and that \u201cVice\u201d is bleaker still: \u201cIt does not send you back into the world feeling good.\u201d It was getting late in the afternoon. I could hear an animal whimpering in McKay\u2019s kitchen. It was the family\u2019s new puppy, a black-and-brown rescue named Timothy, who was being house-trained within a mesh-walled pen.McKay told me that not long after his heart attack, the last family pet, a beloved dog named Pumpkin, died. \u201cThat was tough,\u201d he said, and there was more where that came from. Last fall, Shira Piven was riding in a Lyft when another driver smashed into the car. An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where they took CT scans and M.R.I.s. Scrutinizing these, doctors discovered two troubling things: Piven\u2019s neck was broken and, what\u2019s more, there was a small growth in her chest, eventually diagnosed as malignant. \u201cLung cancer,\u201d McKay said. \u201cThey removed a quarter of her lung, and for a month you could barely hear her talk.\u201d Like McKay, Piven recovered, he said, but they were shaken. \u201cAnd then on top of all this, you\u2019re seeing democracy worldwide collapse, and we\u2019re getting scientific reports from the U.N. basically saying mankind will be extinct in 25 years. I have just never experienced a two-year period like the last two years.\u201dMcKay\u2019s comedies always carried dark undertones. Ferrell\u2019s protagonists might have registered as endearing buffoons, but their tendencies toward ignorance, selfishness, sexism, racism and/or jingoism were among the ways that McKay signaled mordant satirical intentions. It might be most accurate to say that, rather than abandoning comedy in his films, he has inverted the ratio between light and dark.But despite McKay\u2019s suspicion of \u201cold forms\u201d \u2014 despite his conviction that, circa 2018, the best use for a big megaphone is to deliver urgent and edifying messages as loudly as possible \u2014 spending all your time exploring the dark side can be wearying, especially if you spent much of your career chasing sillier and sillier ways to make strangers laugh. Making comedies, McKay was essentially a shadow cast member, yelling out impromptu jokes, midscene, for his actors to repeat, cracking them up as the cameras rolled. Far from disavowing his early movies, he recalled them proudly, describing the family-prayer scene in \u201cTalladega Nights\u201d \u2014 an improv-heavy sequence full of preposterous tangents about infant Jesus and Lynyrd Skynyrd \u2014 as \u201cthe best scene we\u2019ve ever done.\u201dOf his directorial approach, he told me that \u201cdoing a scene with Ferrell, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m out there with him,\u201d whereas, working with Bale and Adams on \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s very gentle, very subtle. If Ferrell\u2019s a Ferrari, meaning fast and fun, I feel like Bale and Adams are narwhals\u201d \u2014 a wondrous species of whale with a unicorn-like tusk, hard to find outside the Far North. \u201cYou\u2019re watching them, like: \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing this. I\u2019m gonna shut up. That\u2019s an actual narwhal. You can see the horn!\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed. \u201cOnce I have this magical moment, then I\u2019ll dare to wreck it.\u201dI reminded McKay of a moment of a much daffier sort that I observed years ago, during the making of \u201cAnchorman 2.\u201d McKay and Ferrell improvised an improbable erotic fantasy about Mrs. Butterworth, nowhere in the film\u2019s script, with each topping the other\u2019s jokes, relay-race style, and sent the entire set into bouts of convulsive laughter. McKay beamed at this memory. \u201cOh, I miss those days,\u201d he said, sounding suddenly homesick. Timothy was crying softly in the kitchen; the sun was setting; the sea ice was melting; the actual narwhals were imperiled. McKay shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re making me want to go do a comedy right now.\u201dJonah Weiner is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine and a contributing editor at Rolling Stone.Advertisement"}

Tehran has not restarted its nuclear programs despite America\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran deal. U.S. sanctions on Russia are still in place. Democrats badly damaged their chances of taking the Senate with their over-reaching and polarizing crusade to stop Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. What more could Trump ask for?In normal presidencies, good news, along with your opponents\u2019 mistakes, is good politics. It\u2019s your Topic A. In normal presidencies, the politics of cultural anxiety, social division or ethnic scaremongering \u2014 that is, of proposing the end of birthright citizenship and demonizing elite media and militarizing the U.S. border \u2014 is Plan B. It\u2019s what you turn to first when you don\u2019t have enough to say for yourself otherwise.But that\u2019s not how the Trump presidency rolls. In this campaign, fear is what\u2019s on the Republican menu. Peace and prosperity? Mere side dishes.The mystery of Donald Trump is what impels him to overturn the usual rules. Is it a dark sort of cunning or simple defects of character? Because the president\u2019s critics tend to be educated and educated people tend to think that the only kind of smarts worth having is the kind they possess \u2014 superior powers of articulation combined with deep stores of knowledge \u2014 those critics generally assume the latter. He\u2019s a bigot. He\u2019s a con artist. His followers are dumb. They got lucky last time. They won\u2019t be so lucky again.Maybe this is even right. But as Trump\u2019s presidency moves forward, it\u2019s no longer smart to think it\u2019s right. There\u2019s more than one type of intelligence. Trump\u2019s is feral. It strikes fast. It knows where to sink the fang into the vein.This has been Trump\u2019s consistent strength from the moment he entered the Republican race until the second he got wind of the migrant caravan. Yes, his administration doesn\u2019t even have an ambassador in Honduras, and if the U.S. has any kind of coherent Central American policy it would be news to me. Also, the idea of deploying thousands of U.S. troops to repel and even fire on the caravan is repellent, fascistic and probably unlawful.Still, several thousand people are pushing their way to the U.S. border with the idea that they will find a way to push their way through it. If they do, tens or even hundreds of thousands more will surely follow. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for fair-minded voters to wonder how the U.S. will vet and then absorb even a fraction of them (though I think we easily can), and what doing so will mean for our wider immigration system.If it\u2019s \u201ccompassion,\u201d it\u2019s a non-answer. If it\u2019s to abolish ICE, it\u2019s a dereliction of responsibility for governance. If it\u2019s to open the border, it is an honest form of political suicide. If it\u2019s more trade and foreign aid for Central America, that\u2019s a solution for the too-long term.The truth is that there is no easy fix to the challenge of the caravan, which is why Trump was so clever to make the issue his own and Democrats have been so remiss in letting him have it. The secret of Trump\u2019s politics is to mix fear and confidence \u2014 the threat of disaster and the promise of protection \u2014 like salt and sugar, simultaneously stimulating and satisfying an insatiable appetite. It\u2019s how all demagogues work.There\u2019s a lesson here worth heeding. Our economic GDP may be booming, but our moral GDP is in recession. The tragedy of Pittsburgh illustrates, among other things, that the president cannot unite us, even in our grief. Whatever happens on Tuesday, Democrats will only win in 2020 if they find a candidate who can.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tries Old Tricks With Latin America ", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s strategy echoes Reagan\u2019s Cold War battle against leftists and ignores, at Washington\u2019s peril, the concerns of elected leaders in the region\u2019s democracies. Mr. Sabatini is the executive director of Global Americans, which studies issues in Latin America.We finally have a sense of President Trump\u2019s strategy for Latin America.Mr. Bolton didn\u2019t discuss Mexico, where the leftist populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador will be sworn in as president on Saturday. He had very little to say about most of the region\u2019s other main countries and instead harped on punishing Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, whom he called the \u201ctroika of tyranny,\u201d \u201cthe triangle of terror\u201d and \u201cthe three stooges\u201d of socialism.This Manichaean view \u2014 a misguided rehash of the Cold War policies of Ronald Reagan \u2014 threatens to polarize the region. While punitive measures against the regimes in these three countries may be overdue, this strategy ignores, at Washington\u2019s peril, the domestic concerns of elected leaders in Latin America\u2019s democracies. And we already see troubling signs that in pursuing this narrow focus on leftist autocrats, the Trump administration is embracing far-right-wing populist leaders.Squeezing regional dictators is simply not a priority for Latin America\u2019s democratically elected leaders. Nor should it be. Mr. Trump should voice concern for the region\u2019s slowing rates of economic growth by promising better access to United States markets. A strong pledge of assistance from American law enforcement to address corruption in countries other than Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua would help, too.Mr. Trump should show Latin Americans that Washington wants to do more than just ramp up pressure on leftist autocratic governments.Christopher Sabatini is an adjunct professor at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs, executive director of Global Americans and a nonresident fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Democracy at Risk? A Lesson Plan for U.S. and Global History Classes", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCivicsOften we take for granted that the United States is a democracy, and that democracy is a form of government worth celebrating. This lesson starts there, but then pushes students to reflect on why democracies are worth protecting, what elements are essential to a healthy democracy and how it is that democracies sometimes fail.We hope the elements in this lesson can be adapted for use in social studies, history and civics classes, of course, but also in English classes. You might decide to use the activities in the order presented below, which would likely require multiple teaching periods, or you can mix and match activities and resources depending on what you\u2019re teaching and why.But no matter how you decide to tackle this topic, we think it\u2019s worth taking time in school to have students stop and think about what kind of government they want for the kind of society they want to live in \u2014 and what role they play as individuals in making that system of government a reality._________Ask students to write a response to these questions first, and then discuss in pairs or small groups and, finally, as a whole class:Then, have pairs or small groups discuss:As a class, students can share their reactions to the film.For this next activity, students will work in groups to understand in detail a case study of how democracy has been dismantled or is being eroded by a strong elected leader and a ruling party. Each group will use a recent Times article to study anti-democratic forces in one of three countries: Venezuela, Turkey and Hungary.While reading their assigned article, students should keep track of ways a leader and his ruling party chipped away at democratic institutions and values. For each way they identify, they should evaluate how significant they think the change is.Below are links to the three articles as well as brief excerpts that provide a preview to what each is about:VenezuelaVenezuela\u2019s fate stands as a warning: Populism is a path that, at its outset, can look and feel democratic. But, followed to its logical conclusion, it can lead to democratic backsliding or even outright authoritarianism.TurkeyIn Western capitals a decade ago, Turkey\u2019s now-paramount leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held promise as a potential beacon of democracy for a region rife with religious conflict.The article continues:But that was before Mr. Erdogan began amassing supreme powers, and before his brutal crackdown on dissent following an attempted coup two years ago. It was before Turkey descended into a financial crisis delivered in no small measure by his authoritarian proclivities and unorthodox stewardship of the economy. Whatever was left of the notion that Mr. Erdogan was a liberalizing force has been wholly extinguished.HungaryFor the past eight years, Mr. Orban has waged a systemic assault on the hardware of Hungary\u2019s democracy \u2014 rewriting the national Constitution, reshaping the judiciary and tweaking the electoral system to favor his Fidesz party. Less conspicuously, Mr. Orban is also trying to recode the software of Hungary\u2019s democracy \u2014 its cultural sphere, civil society and education system.After students finish analyzing their article, they should share their findings with the class, and then the class can compare and contrast what is going on in these different countries.They can also consider: Did the ideas presented in the film about why democracies sometimes fail capture the reality of what is taking place in Venezuela, Turkey and Hungary? Are there lessons to be learned for other countries about how to protect their own democracies?The previous activities give students an understanding about why democracy as a form of government is sometimes fragile and needs to be nurtured. Students will evaluate what they think are the essential components of a healthy democracy and how to protect it from anti-democratic forces, even when its citizens aren\u2019t aware of what\u2019s going on.In this activity, students will work in small groups and rank the following 14 elements, common in democracies, from most important to least important. They can ask themselves: If a society doesn\u2019t have this element, is it still a democracy?Instructions: Rank these 14 elements in a democracy from most essential to least essential:When groups are done with their rankings, the class can compare their lists. Are they more similar or different? Groups can also explain why they selected certain elements as more important or less important. And, if they notice any essential elements of democracy that are missing from the list, they can explain why those elements should be included.Students can now apply what they learned about the fragility of democracy to another country.Democracy in the United StatesFor U.S. history and civics classes, students can analyze whether American democracy is facing a crisis, or whether it is working as intended. The first two Opinion articles below argue that American democracy is strong and alleged dangers are overblown; the second two argue that threats to American democracy are very real:After conducting their research, students can hold a forum about the state of democracy in the United States, in which they evaluate whether they notice any actions, rhetoric or patterns that pose a threat to American democracy. As part of the discussion, they can offer suggestions about how the general public can work together, no matter their political allegiances, to strengthen democracy in the United States.Global DemocracyHere are related excerpts from Times articles about three of those countries:The Philippines\u2019 highest court on Friday forced out its chief justice, removing a fierce critic of President Rodrigo Duterte and his brutal war against drugs, which has left thousands dead.Voting 8-6, the Supreme Court justices removed Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, approving a petition filed by the government\u2019s lawyer that questioned the validity of her appointment on the ground that she had failed to fully disclose her wealth.Ms. Sereno has been a constant irritant to the increasingly autocratic rule of Mr. Duterte, questioning the validity of his list of public officials deemed to be drug suspects and opposing his declaration of martial law in the southern Philippines.Senator Risa Hontiveros, a supporter of Ms. Sereno, said the court had surrendered its judicial independence and integrity by removing the chief justice.Faced with a presidential couple that controls virtually every branch of government and the news media, young people across the nation are carrying out their own version of an Arab Spring. Armed with cellphones and social media skills, their challenge to the government has astonished residents who lived through Mr. Ortega\u2019s revolution in the 1970s, the civil war in the \u201980s and the 30 years since then.The European Union has accused Poland of posing a grave risk to democratic values, accusing it of undermining the rule of law by packing the courts with loyalists. Western leaders have also criticized Poland\u2019s governing party for pushing virtually all critical voices off the state news media and for restricting free speech with its latest law criminalizing any suggestion that the Polish nation bore any responsibility in the Holocaust.The tug of war has intensified as Eastern Europe becomes the incubator for a new model of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d for which Hungary has laid the groundwork. But it is Poland \u2014 so large, so rich, so militarily powerful and so important geostrategically \u2014 that will define whether the European Union\u2019s long effort to integrate the former Soviet bloc succeeds or fails.When students have completed their research, the class can hold a forum about the state of democracy worldwide in which they share their findings, work together to notice similarities and differences and assess the significance of any trends they notice.Or, as an alternative, students might annotate a world map or create their own infographics that visually depict what they have learned about the state of democracy in the world today.Even though democracy has a simple definition \u2014 government by the people \u2014 in reality, it is a complex system that requires constant vigilance to ensure it does not fall apart. What role can individuals play \u2014 for example, students and teachers \u2014 to make sure that \u201cwe the people\u201d are in fact the foundation, purpose and directors of our government?To conclude this lesson, ask students to write about or discuss the following questions:_________iCivicsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "N.Y. Democrats Vowed to Get Big Money Out of Politics. Will Big Money Interfere?", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the months before the Nov. 6 elections, New York\u2019s Senate Democrats received $25,000 from a mysterious group of five donors, with names like 2332 7 Ave L.L.C., 207 Silver Lane L.L.C. and 228 W 132 L.L.C.The donors shared one address, at 223 West 138th Street in Manhattan \u2014 home to a real estate management firm with properties across Harlem and the rest of the city. Two more donors from the same address gave $20,000 to another Democrat: Letitia James, who was just elected New York attorney general.The law treats limited liability companies as people, allowing each to donate up to $65,100 to every statewide candidate per election cycle \u2014 far more than the $5,000 aggregate contribution limit for corporations. Firms can create multiple L.L.C.s, effectively erasing any maximum.But even as they vowed to muzzle big money\u2019s influence, they benefited from the same L.L.C. donations they were railing against. Before the 2016 election, when the Democrats\u2019 chances of regaining power seemed less certain, their campaign committee amassed $42,500 from L.L.C.s in the final weeks of the campaign. This year, amid widespread consensus that they would prevail, they took in more than $400,000 in the same period.The corporations\u2019 sudden generosity, and Democrats\u2019 acceptance of it, has raised questions about whether lawmakers will make good on their promise to overhaul New York\u2019s much-maligned campaign finance system, or whether \u2014 now that they have consolidated control of Albany\u2019s levers of power \u2014 they might prefer to bask in its perks.\u201cCynics are right to think that, O.K., people in power want to get more campaign contributions, whether they\u2019re Democrats or Republicans,\u201d said Michael Kink, the executive director of the Strong Economy for All Coalition, a group of unions and community organizations.Democrats insist that closing the loophole will be one of their first priorities in the new year. They have proposed holding L.L.C.s to the same limit as corporations, and to count any donations funneled through them toward each stakeholder\u2019s individual limits.By all appearances, the proposal should sail through. The Democrat-dominated Assembly has voted to close the loophole for years. Mr. Cuomo has said he supports ending it.But, as always in politics, there is rhetoric and there is reality.Several people involved with the real estate industry\u2019s political giving said they did not expect the newly Democratic Albany to be entirely hostile to their overtures. Mr. Cuomo has suggested that the Assembly may become less enthusiastic about passing ethics reform without the Senate standing by to squash it.\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that it\u2019s a manipulation, but when you know something\u2019s not going to happen anyway, it\u2019s easier to be supportive of it,\u201d the governor said in a recent radio interview.The same, of course, could be said of Mr. Cuomo. For years, he has professed support for closing the loophole; for years, he blamed Republicans for the effort\u2019s downfall. In the meantime, he has raised far more through L.L.C.s than the entire Senate Republican conference. In 2018 alone, L.L.C.s gave Mr. Cuomo more than $1.9 million.Democratics denied that their new position in the majority would push the loophole down their agenda.\u201cMany Democrats have run on the issue,\u201d said Senator Brian P. Kavanagh, a Democrat who has sponsored several unsuccessful bills to close the loophole. \u201cWe won, and now we\u2019re going to do it.\u201dHe dismissed the benefits that Democrats had accrued from the loophole in the past. \u201cFor better or for worse, people campaign under the laws as they are when they\u2019re running,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a consensus among Democrats that we should change this law.\u201dMr. Kink was also optimistic about the prospect of reform, adding that heightened voter attention to money in politics could be enough to dissuade lawmakers from reneging on their promises. Democrats especially, with their New York City base, could be wary of getting too cozy with the real estate interests most associated with the loophole, he said.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a bunch of lawmakers that might or might not care about abstract campaign finance or good government rules,\u201d Mr. Kink said, \u201cbut they understand that taking care of tenants is really important to their political survival.\u201dIf the Democrats close the L.L.C. loophole and carry out other changes they have backed, including a statewide small-donor matching funds program, New York\u2019s campaign finance laws could go from the nation\u2019s most lax to its most robust, said Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Democracy Program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. No other state has a similar active matching program.The timing of reform may prove pivotal to what is sure to be one of next year\u2019s biggest legislative fights: renegotiation of the state\u2019s rent laws, which are set to expire in June. If Democrats close the L.L.C. loophole early, developers may lose one powerful means for making their voices heard.In the past, real estate groups used L.L.C.s to deluge upstate Republicans, knowing that their constituents would be less likely to care about the industry\u2019s long shadow, according to Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a government reform group.But those involved with the real estate industry said its power brokers did not seem concerned about the prospect of the loophole\u2019s demise. In fact, they cheered it: Tighter restrictions could save firms from having to spend so lavishly on candidates.And they noted that moneyed interests would always find a way to exert influence \u2014 if not through the loophole, then elsewhere, such as through unlimited independent expenditure spending.Indeed, New York\u2019s campaign finance problems run far deeper than the L.L.C. loophole. The state ranks second to last in the nation in the percentage of candidates\u2019 money that comes from small donors, said Michael Malbin, the head of the Washington-based Campaign Finance Institute.\u201cI don\u2019t think the State Legislature should be patting itself on the back\u201d for closing the loophole, Mr. Norden said. \u201cWithout more, it\u2019s not going to mean much in terms of changing the role of big money in New York State politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Weighs Steel Quotas, Instead of Tariffs, on Canada and Mexico", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A potential deal to ease President Trump\u2019s metal tariffs on Mexico and Canada is being complicated by the Trump administration\u2019s push to place strict quotas on imported steel from the two trading partners.Canada and Mexico have been pushing for the removal of Mr. Trump\u2019s 25 percent steel and 10 percent aluminum tariffs ahead of the ceremonial signing of the revised North American Free Trade Agreement this month at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires. While the three countries reached a new trade pact in September, the metal tariffs have remained in place, and Canada and Mexico have been pressing the White House to relax the levies before the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is signed.The White House could ultimately lift the aluminum tariffs, but the administration still wants to impose limits on foreign steel to prevent a flood of cheap metals into the United States, according to people briefed on the discussions. American trade negotiators are proposing a quota system that would cap the volume of steel Canada and Mexico can export to the United States each year. The countries are also discussing an agreement that would bolster efforts to combat dumping of cheap metals from China, which has been a source of ire for all three nations.American trade officials have made some progress in securing an agreement with Mexico, which is eager to eliminate the lingering threat the metal tariffs pose to its economy. But United States and Canadian negotiators remain far apart over the potential quotas, with Ottawa insisting on a higher limit and a more flexible system, according to several people briefed on the continuing talks.The metal tariffs have proved to be especially frustrating to Canada, a close military ally of the United States that has objected to the Trump administration\u2019s rationale that foreign metals pose a national security threat. Mr. Trump imposed the steel and aluminum tariffs using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which gives the president the power to tax imports if they are deemed to be a risk to the country.Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, reiterated her view on Tuesday that the tariffs were \u201cillegal and unjustified\u201d and said she hoped that they would be removed in the spirit of good will.\u201cNow is a great moment to lift these absurd tariffs,\u201d Ms. Freeland told reporters in Ottawa. \u201cWe could do it this afternoon.\u201dJustin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, has said that getting the tariffs removed is his primary focus ahead of the treaty\u2019s signing and raised the issue in a polite but pointed exchange with the president when the two met this month during ceremonies in Paris commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\u201cAs I\u2019ve repeated to President Trump, I hope we\u2019re able to resolve in the time before we meet each other in the G-20 in Argentina,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters after the two leaders spoke.Ger\u00f3nimo Guti\u00e9rrez, the Mexican ambassador to the United States, said at a briefing this week that he was hopeful the issue would soon be settled, expressing optimism about reaching a deal just before President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is to leave office.\u201cIt\u2019s the expectation that by the time of the signing either a solution or a very clear track that gives enough certainty that a solution is coming,\u201d Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez said.But a Mexican official briefed on negotiations said American officials were trying to insert rigid quotas into the deal as a precondition of removing the tariffs.And new signs emerged on Wednesday that the tariff talks were not going smoothly.In a statement, Eleanore Catenaro, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trudeau, said the new pact brought \u201ccertainty to the North American economy and strongly protects Canada\u2019s middle class.\u201d\u201cOur job as a government is to safeguard economic gains and prevent economic threats,\u201d she continued, \u201cand that is what we\u2019ve done with the new agreement.\u201dAmerican officials are more optimistic about their ability to reach an agreement with Mexico than with Canada, which is a large supplier of metals to the American military and has negotiated more aggressively with Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, in demanding a permanent suspension of the tariffs.Staff members from the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Treasury Department and the Commerce Department huddled on Monday to discuss the final push for a deal before the summit meeting that would include the removal of tariffs in exchange for some form of quotas. But negotiators were still unsure of the outcome, citing differences on specific details such as the size and conditions of quotas, as well as the terms of their removal, according to an official briefed on the meeting.Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said, \u201cWe have no announcements or comment on this at this time.\u201dThe president has been under pressure from American manufacturers and powerful unions to lift the tariffs, which have raised costs for companies that use foreign metals, such as automakers and food producers. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers have also been pressing to lift the levies, including Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Larry Kudlow, the National Economic Council director.Canada and Mexico are still expected to sign the deal even if an agreement on lifting the tariffs is not reached, but they want the issue to be resolved beforehand as a gesture of good will.The impending signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement does not mean that the new trade pact is final or that it will go into effect. The Trump administration must still push the agreement through the incoming Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, an arduous process that could take months to complete.Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who hopes to lead the House, has said she will not vote for the treaty unless it significantly beefs up protections for American workers and includes an enforcement mechanism to ensure that Mexican auto manufacturers abide by commitments to raise wages, making it harder for them to undercut American labor.But a new challenge to the treaty is also rising on the right, with a group of 38 conservative Republicans raising objections to language inserted in the deal that would protect workers in all three countries from \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201d That language was inserted at the behest of Canadian negotiators and approved by the United States negotiators.The group, which included many members of the House Freedom Caucus, said the language contradicted the administration\u2019s \u201ccohesive agenda regarding policies surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201dMr. Trump did not immediately respond to the letter. And it is not clear if the conservatives would be willing \u2014 or even able \u2014 to block the overhaul of Nafta to make their point.Asked if Canada would consider renegotiating the trade pact if that provision proved to be a deal breaker with American lawmakers, Ms. Freeland said that it was \u201can internal political matter\u201d for the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Democratic Control of the House Could Mean for Your Wallet", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA change in control will block renewed tax-cut initiatives, but there may be room for accord on drug pricing and even stimulus, if the recovery falters.The Democrats\u2019 success in winning back control of the House comes after an election in which economic issues were often overshadowed. Still, the change on Capitol Hill will make a difference on some spending priorities and tax policy.House Democrats are in a position to block Republicans from extending the temporary tax cuts and provisions enacted last year, and from giving further breaks to businesses. President Trump even talked at his Wednesday news conference about working with Democrats to raise business taxes to pay for a middle-class tax cut. Teaming up to rebuild infrastructure is another possibility, the president said.Prospects for agreement, though, are still sketchy. Republicans and Democrats \u201ccan have overlapping positions,\u201d said William G. Gale, co-director of the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington. \u201cBut any compromise requires trust, and I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any trust available right now.\u201dIn any case, the larger economic story line of the year ahead is unlikely to be shaped by initiatives from Capitol Hill. The economy is strong, but growth is still expected to slow in 2019 as the extra juice injected through the tax cuts fades. Trade tensions are not going away. The jobless rate, already circling near a half-century low, will probably inch down even more. Swoops in the stock market will continue to be unpredictable, and anxieties about global growth remain. Moreover, as Janice Mays, managing director in the accounting firm PwC\u2019s Washington National Tax Services, said: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have the same president.\u201dWith control of only one chamber, and an antagonist in the White House, the Democrats won\u2019t be able to push through initiatives on their own. Instead, they are likely to highlight their priorities for the future by passing a lot of bills \u2014 think of them more as billboards, designed to shape an agenda and deliver a message. An increase in the minimum wage, an expansion of health care coverage, and an infrastructure build-a-thon are obvious candidates. Democrats will be able to block efforts to trim safety net programs like food stamps and Medicaid. They are also likely to focus on investigating the administration. But prospects of any major legislative efforts look doubtful. Consider that a major tax overhaul was passed during the current congressional session, but much of the rest of the Republicans\u2019 legislative agenda stalled despite their control of both houses. Raising taxes would be a repudiation of the agenda of House Republicans. They laid out a plan in September to make permanent most of the temporary cuts and provisions for individuals and small businesses enacted last year. The parties could also find common ground on increased tax incentives for retirement savings. And there is a long list of technical fixes and extensions on Congress\u2019s to-do list. You may remember that for the blink of an eye last year, it seemed that the Democratic leadership in Congress might make a deal with Mr. Trump to tie tax reform to a proposal to repair roads, bridges, waterways and airports. Infrastructure has often been hospitable ground for bipartisan initiatives. Mr. Trump has always been enthusiastic about building on a grand scale, and in many ways, the Democrats are more willing partners than Republicans, who have consistently objected to the kind of spending required. Mr. Trump noted the potential on Wednesday, saying, \u201cWe have a lot of things in common on infrastructure.\u201d The Democrats have put together a trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal aimed at everything from broadband to waterways.Nor is the atmosphere in Washington particularly conducive to cross-the-aisle collaboration. And Democrats may think twice about giving the president a victory before the 2020 election.A significant slowdown in the economy could always change that calculus. With the effects of the stimulus fading, Mr. Trump has stepped up complaints that the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates will slow the economy. \u201cIf somebody offers him the opportunity to offset that with a spending bill, he would sign it, with no regard for the deficit,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington who was an adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Restricting the president\u2019s power on trade would require the approval of the House and a 60-vote majority in the Senate. That is unlikely. The Democrats have traditionally been less enamored with free trade than Republicans. (Their views, however, may evolve as the Republican Party under Mr. Trump continues its shift from free-trade orthodoxy to protectionist measures.)Congress will have the chance to weigh in on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement has incorporated a number of provisions \u2014 like higher pay for autoworkers \u2014 that render it somewhat more palatable for the Democrats, Ms. Mays of PwC said. But the accord could come up for a vote before the Democrats take control, heading off any push by House Democrats for a tougher deal. There are two issues that Congress must confront next year: the debt ceiling and the legally mandated limits on spending approved annually by Congress. Failure to address the budget limits could prompt deep spending cuts and a partial government shutdown. And without an accord on the debt ceiling, the government would default on its payments and risk injuring its credit rating and causing a global panic. After President Barack Obama signed a bill requiring across-the-board spending cuts if the budget exceeded set limits, Republicans and Democrats in Congress have patched together compromise budgets and agreed to raise the spending caps. In general, the deals have involved Republican agreement to greater spending on domestic programs and Democratic acceptance of bigger defense budgets. That has meant larger deficits.\u201cBoth parties seem to care about the deficit when they\u2019re out of the power, but not so much when they\u2019re in power,\u201d said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Since a shutdown can tar both parties, Democrats and Republicans are likely to strike some deal. \u201cThey\u2019ll lurch from deadline to deadline and do the minimum to get by,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the president of the conservative American Action Forum.The wild card is Mr. Trump. The president has said that \u201cI would have no problem doing a shutdown\u201d to force Congress to fund a wall along the Mexican border. He may have even less of a problem with it if he could more easily blame the Democrats.\u201cA shutdown is always a possibility, and the wall would mostly likely be the reason for that,\u201d Mr. Lazio of Alliantgroup said. \u201cBut Senate Republicans are less likely to barrel into a confrontation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
