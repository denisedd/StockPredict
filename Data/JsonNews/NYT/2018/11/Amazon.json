{"Headline": "Top Democrats Vow to Block Matthew Whitaker From Interfering in Russia Inquiry", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Top congressional Democrats demanded on Sunday that President Trump\u2019s acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, recuse himself from overseeing the special counsel investigation, and vowed to use their newfound powers as the incoming House majority to block him from interfering with it.And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, warned that if Mr. Whitaker did not step aside, Democrats would attach legislation protecting the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to a must-pass spending bill. But Mr. Schumer stopped short of saying that Democrats would shut down the government if such legislation did not pass.\u201cSo,\u201d Mr. Schumer added, \u201cCongress has to act.\u201dAs they prepare to take control of the House, Democrats are trying to strike a delicate balance between pressing ahead with their legislative agenda and investigating an administration that has operated for two years without any real oversight from Congress. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader who hopes to become speaker, insisted on Sunday that Democrats do not intend to play politics with their investigatory powers.\u201cWe are responsible. We are not scattershot,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe are not doing any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth. So I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is, we will be very strategic.\u201dBut her colleagues made clear that they intend to move aggressively, not just in overseeing the Justice Department, but on a variety of fronts.Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who will become chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he intended to look at whether Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits federal officials from receiving gifts, or emoluments, from foreign powers. Many Democrats believe that Mr. Trump is violating the clause by continuing to profit from his worldwide real estate dealings.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out when is he acting on behalf of the American people in a lot of his decisions or \u2014 or is he acting on his own behalf?\u201d Mr. Cummings said. But he said he saw subpoenas as a last resort, and ducked a question about what he would do if the White House refused to comply with them.\u201cWe will cross that bridge when we get to it,\u201d he said.\u201cThis appears to be an effort by the president to use the instruments of state power to punish Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.But perhaps nothing is as high on Democrats\u2019 agenda as protecting the Mueller investigation. Mr. Whitaker has stirred deep concerns among Democrats since Mr. Trump, on the heels of the Republicans\u2019 loss of the House last week, named him acting attorney general after firing Jeff Sessions, who had long endured Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath over the Russia inquiry. Among other comments, Mr. Whitaker had once declared that there was \u201cno collusion\u201d between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 a remark that prompted Democrats to say he had prejudged the inquiry\u2019s conclusion.Mr. Whitaker\u2019s appointment went outside the usual Justice Department plan of succession. Ordinarily, Rod J. Rosenstein, who had protected the Russia inquiry as deputy attorney general, would have ascended to the top job. Unlike Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Whitaker, who was Mr. Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, lacks Senate confirmation. Democrats say the appointment is unconstitutional.Mr. Schumer said he and Ms. Pelosi, along with other Democrats, were sending a letter to the top ethics officer at the Justice Department, asking whether he had advised Mr. Whitaker to withdraw. The department\u2019s ethics official had advised Mr. Sessions to withdraw from overseeing the investigation shortly after he took office last year, given his role in the Trump campaign, and Mr. Trump never forgave Mr. Sessions for stepping aside.Earlier versions of this article incorrectly referred to the postmaster general.

He reached out to his boss [Alex Stamos, then the company\u2019s security chief]. Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. \u201cIts leadership squirmed over Russian meddling investigations:\u201cMr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of [Sheryl] Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal. \u2018You threw us under the bus!\u2019 she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.\u201dThe company hadn\u2019t prepared for the worst on its platform:\u201c \u2018We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u2019 Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.\u201dBut pushed its messaging hard:\u201cFacebook also expanded its work with [the P.R. firm] Definers. On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called [Apple\u2019s C.E.O. Tim] Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users.\u201dAnd Mark Zuckerberg was apoplectic about the criticism:After Mr. Cook publicly derided Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg was so furious that he later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.The bottom line:\u201cAs evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view.\u201dThose moves will be important when the company tries to convince public-market investors that it\u2019s worth a sky-high valuation when it files for an I.P.O. But it remains to be seen if investors will believe that argument.More from Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT:\u201cI\u2019m very happy about the state of the economy now,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cThere\u2019s pretty good reason to think we\u2019re going to continue in a positive vein like that.\u201dHe added that the Fed deserved credit for its role in the long and steady expansion. \u201cOur policy is part of the reason the economy is in such a good place now,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell also noted that Congress \u2014 not the White House \u2014 oversees the Fed, and added that the central bank would continue to raise rates for now.China, Germany and Japan have all seen their economies struggle in recent months.

Deals have already begun to leak, retailers are eager to get you in for doorbuster bargains before your Thanksgiving dinner has settled, and online retailers are happy to offer Black Friday deals and even more discounts on Cyber Monday.If you didn\u2019t know better, you\u2019d assume there\u2019s no better time to shop, and retailers save their best bargains for what seems like the extension of a holiday \u2014 but you know better.As for what you\u2019re better off buying another time? \u201cI\u2019ve never been too impressed with outdoors gear or large appliances during Black Friday,\u201d Mr. Burakowski said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily say they\u2019re \u201cbad\u201d deals, you won\u2019t get ripped off, but there\u2019s no real point in buying them and you\u2019ll get better prices at other times of the year.\u201dThe key to buying on Black Friday or Cyber Monday is to make sure that what you\u2019re shopping for is at its best price of the year, and that it\u2019s something you\u2019ll need as soon as possible (for the holidays, as an example.) So how do you determine if that deal really is the best of the year before you hit the stores Black Friday morning or shop online on Cyber Monday?\u201cThere are price tracking tools like CamelCamelCamel and Honey that let you know Amazon\u2019s price history on products,\u201d Mr. Burakowski said. \u201cWhile that doesn\u2019t mean other stores didn\u2019t offer better sales, it gives you a good idea of what online pricing has been like the past few months.\u201dSmall businesses may not always have the cheapest overall prices \u2014 but most drastically cut their own prices for events like Small Business Saturday in order to get shoppers in the door, and even if you wind up paying a bit more, you\u2019re helping a local business and their employees stay in business in a highly competitive landscape.Similarly, consider small businesses and shops that operate online for Small Business Saturday as well. Many offer shoppers free or discounted shipping and special coupon codes for registering or for signing up for promotional newsletters.It\u2019s easy to talk about tracking prices and walking the line between desire and deals when Black Friday is staring you in the face, but let\u2019s be real: even those great holiday deals may pale compared to better prices other times during the year. For example, while HDTVs usually see great pricing around the holidays, they also see a round of discounts shortly after the New Year \u2014 and right before the Super Bowl.\u201cI\u2019d say people go in looking to upgrade certain categories of items, or hold off in the fall for some more expensive items because they correctly expect Black Friday will have better than average prices,\u201d Mr. Burakowski said.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t have received better prices a couple months before, but if they\u2019re not people who regularly follow deals, they\u2019re likely to save more in significantly less time than they would have buying at other times of the year. So for most shoppers, the personal desire is high and beats the objective nature of the deal by a bit. For really tuned-in shoppers, they\u2019re looking for those categories that\u2019ll have best of year pricing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bertolucci\u2019s Best Movies Streaming Now: \u2018Last Tango in Paris,\u2019 \u20191900\u2019 and More", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorking often in collaboration with his favorite cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro, he made films about ordinary and extraordinary people alike, and about the ways in which they struggle to dictate the course of their own lives.The seven movies featured here, however, comprise an excellent sampling of his most celebrated and controversial works, along with a few flawed visions that deserve a second look. (Dates reflect the year of a film\u2019s earliest theatrical debut, foreign or domestic.)A persistent theme in Bertolucci\u2019s work is how individuals are swept up by the forces of history, whether they\u2019re royalty, like Pu Yi in \u201cThe Last Emperor,\u201d or the childhood friends whose fates follow opposing political trajectories in \u201c1900.\u201dWith \u201cThe Conformist,\u201d his rapturously beautiful film about life in Mussolini\u2019s Italy, Bertolucci contends that fascism can also find an audience in passive and susceptible people, not only in the fervent ideologue. Jean-Louis Trintignant\u2019s character makes for a compelling case study: He is a member of the secret police assigned to murder his former college professor, a political dissident exiled in Paris, but he\u2019s hamstrung by feelings for the professor\u2019s wife (Dominique Sanda). Through flashbacks, Bertolucci identifies the circumstances that have led him to this place \u2014 and implies that others can be vulnerable, too.Seen today, the film embodies both the possibilities and the excesses of the Method style of its lead actor, Marlon Brando, whose intense brooding and wrenching outbursts are its driving force. Brando stars as a middle-aged American abroad who enters into an affair with a much younger Parisian woman (Schneider), initially as a salve to get over his wife\u2019s suicide. Their anonymous trysts \u2014 they share no personal information with each other, names included \u2014 are not without emotional consequences.This historical epic immediately ran aground when his 317-minute director\u2019s cut, which he had hoped to release in two parts, was scuttled by his producer, who edited together a 195-minute version before they compromised at 247. Since its 1991 rerelease, however, the longest cut has emerged as the definitive one, fully articulating Bertolucci\u2019s grand statement about Italian politics in first half of the 20th century.Robert De Niro and G\u00e9rard Depardieu star as a two childhood friends born on the same estate on Jan. 1, 1900, one the grandson of a peasant, one the grandson of an aristocrat. Although they remain in contact over the years \u2014 extremely close contact in one scene, which earned the re-release an NC-17 rating \u2014 they\u2019re driven apart by a shared love for the same woman (Dominique Sanda) and their conflicting roles in the fascist takeover of the estate.Although it swept the Oscars in 1987, winning awards for best picture and best director, \u201cThe Last Emperor\u201d has receded from view over the years, which seems entirely appropriate to its story of a leader who was worshiped as a boy and all-but-forgotten as a man.But there\u2019s plenty here to cherish, starting with the sumptuous beauty of the production, which revivifies China\u2019s Forbidden City. It also has one of the greatest film scores in cinema history, composed in separate and distinctive portions by Ryuichi Sakamoto, David Byrne and Cong Su.The life of Pu Yi, played as an adult by John Lone, unfolds in four distinct phases, with the emperor learning the ropes from a British tutor (Peter O\u2019Toole) as a boy, being exiled from the Forbidden City in 1924, returning as a puppet leader of Manchuria for Japanese invaders and, finally, living out the end of his life as a gardener.In the wake of \u201cThe Last Emperor,\u201d this picturesque love triangle, set in North Africa after World War II, was dismissed as comparatively insubstantial, less an engagement with the historical moment than a pretty snapshot.But in adapting the novel by Paul Bowles, who had just settled in Tangier when he wrote the book, Bertolucci is trying to account for how people struggle to find a place for themselves in a suddenly borderless world. Described as \u201ctravelers\u201d rather than tourists \u2014 the distinction being that travelers could stay indefinitely while tourists are just passing through \u2014 an American couple (Debra Winger and John Malkovich) and their friend (Campbell Scott) arrive in Tangier in 1947 and soon get caught up in romantic entanglements that threaten the marriage and the friendship.The casting of Keanu Reeves as Siddhartha all but guaranteed that Bertolucci\u2019s earnest spiritual journey would get scoffed out of theaters. T hat\u2019s to say nothing of the awkwardness inherent in its premise, which follows the search for a reincarnated Buddhist teacher to a middle-class white family in Seattle.Yet \u201cLittle Buddha\u201d has a storybook simplicity that is unusual for Bertolucci, who seems utterly committed to making the transcendent accessible to the widest possible audience. The quest to find the reborn Lama Dorje leads Tibetan Buddhist monks to a sweet young boy (Alex Wiesendanger), whose parents (Chris Isaak and Bridget Fonda) are understandably wary about handing him over to a higher fate. Bertolucci cuts between these recruitment efforts and a highly stylized story-within-the-story about Siddhartha\u2019s quest to end universal suffering.After years of cinematic globe-trotting, Bertolucci returned to Italy for this fetching wisp of a coming-of-age film, which cast Liv Tyler as a 19-year-old who heads to a Tuscan villa with the secret mission to lose her virginity.Advertisement"}

Even from the sidewalk, even without windows you can see through. There it is on Lafayette Street, a salt lamp of retail real estate, a frosted beacon. There is a name-printed banner flying above, but if you are coming here, you probably don\u2019t need it. You already know, deep in your pores, that you are at the new Glossier flagship store.Emily Weiss, the founder and chief executive, is as close as we\u2019ve come to a millennial Est\u00e9e Lauder, but unlike Est\u00e9e Lauder, Glossier has bypassed department stores altogether. Ninety percent of Glossier\u2019s revenue comes from online sales.But even many of those who can (and do) order online found the option to shop in person irresistible, as Glossier discovered when it opened a shoppable showroom space here, in what was then its office building, in 2016. Lines formed down the street; more than half a million customers came through, the company said. \u201cOnce they got upstairs, they didn\u2019t shop and go,\u201d Ms. Weiss said. \u201cThey really hung out, sometimes for hours. At one point, someone even ordered pizza.\u201dSo for Glossier\u2019s second and largest permanent shop, which opens on Nov. 8, Ms. Weiss and her team wanted to offer an experience. Glossier is a social club for the like-minded, an auto-body shop for the human body.

{"Headline": "Gillian Flynn Peers Into the Dark Side of Femininity", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "FeatureThe novelist and screenwriter has built an enormous following, especially among women, by portraying women at their worst.Supported byThe day after the story broke, I was talking with Flynn and her husband, Brett Nolan, in her office. Semi-underground and brightly lit, it\u2019s less lair than rec room. Flynn frequently works down here while clocking miles on a treadmill desk, her laptop placed precariously on a box and a stack of books. Nolan was joking about how he used to come upon disturbing Post-its scattered around the house when Flynn was deep in a project, and this inspired him to gift her the whiteboard that covers one wall, where she jots character motivations and bits of setting in the precisely loopy handwriting of a prom queen. When I was there, her grimly matter-of-fact brainstorms were interspersed with her kids\u2019 drawings.\u201c\u2009\u2018Dead body floating ...\u2019\u2009,\u201d Nolan said, referring to the kind of notes Flynn would leave next to the refrigerator or on the coffee table. He had always assumed the Post-its were evidence of something his wife was working on professionally, and not literal evidence, but did we see that article yesterday, about the woman who wrote about how to kill her husband and then was indicted on a charge of killing her husband?\u201cI had multiple people forward that to me,\u201d Flynn said, laughing.Flynn is best known for her hugely successful third novel, \u201cGone Girl,\u201d in which a wealthy, beautiful woman, Amy Elliott Dunne, elaborately frames her husband for her own murder in order to avenge his infidelity and typical masculine neglect. In the process, she fakes a rape, murders an ex-boyfriend and impregnates herself by stealing her husband\u2019s frozen sperm before eventually returning home, and to the marriage, which is now significantly more troubled than it was at the outset. If Flynn were going to carry out a nonfictional crime, Nolan can take small comfort in knowing she would never stop at such an obvious place as \u201cwife murders husband.\u201dThese books sold well, but neither Flynn nor her publishers anticipated the omnipresent best seller \u2014 or object of scorn \u2014 that \u201cGone Girl\u201d would become. Since then, she has also benefited from a trend in feminist cultural criticism: These days representations of the \u201cmessy\u201d lives of \u201cflawed\u201d women are celebrated as indications of a multifaceted (and maybe even \u201cradical\u201d) portrayal of the gender. Though \u201cSharp Objects\u201d didn\u2019t garner much critical attention in 2006 \u2014 when, as she says, the biggest conflict female protagonists faced was \u201ccan she get the boy and can she get the shoes and, oh, she\u2019s had a cosmo again!\u201d \u2014 over the summer it became a relentlessly dissected limited series on HBO starring Amy Adams, with Flynn as an executive producer. Next year, Amazon will host the series \u201cUtopia,\u201d about a group of online friends investigating government conspiracies, with Flynn adapting it from the British series as creator, executive producer and showrunner. And this month \u201cWidows,\u201d a film she adapted from the 1980s British TV series of the same name with the director Steve McQueen, will be released. Viola Davis stars \u2014 in a cast that includes Liam Neeson, Daniel Kaluuya and Colin Farrell \u2014 as the ringleader of a group of women who plan a robbery after their husbands are killed trying to pull off a different heist.\u201cGone Girl,\u201d of course, made Flynn \u201cthe writer of \u2018Gone Girl,\u2019\u2009\u201d as the trailer for \u201cWidows\u201d trumpets, and the film marks the beginning of a new phase in her career: She is now an event, a shorthand, a writer whose name conveys a mutually understood, reliable sensibility. While a heist movie is something of a departure from her crime/mystery/whatever-you-want-to-call-them novels, \u201cWidows\u201d nevertheless flashes several Flynn calling cards in the way it focuses on mostly realistic women solving unrealistic problems \u2014 committing crimes or uncovering others \u2014 which always involve, and are complicated by, the people in their lives. Though extreme in pr\u00e9cis, the story comes to feel oddly relatable: If I were going to commit a crime, that\u2019s probably how it would be.Like this movie, Flynn\u2019s books fall into a category you might call anti-middlebrow: packaged as thrillers, written in the knowing pop-cultural cadence of mid-2000s blogs and comprising a disorienting blend of genre influences, they avoid the striving pretensions of bad literary fiction, despite also being fairly dense and containing, sneakily, many of the pleasures of a digressive social novel. She often uses setting and minor characters \u2014 the portrait of sleepy Wind Gap, Mo., in \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d or the evocation of post-recession malaise in \u201cGone Girl\u201d \u2014 to flow into incisive cultural critique, and even employs postmodernist flourishes like metafiction. Still, it takes an open mind to compare her with someone like Zadie Smith or Philip Roth; Flynn says that people at parties and other passive-aggressive spaces sometimes let her know that they \u201cdon\u2019t normally read this kind of book,\u201d which she takes in stride. She cares more about the work than the labels on the work.\u201cI really do think the world can be divided into the people who like to look under the rock and the people who don\u2019t want to look under the rock,\u201d Flynn told me. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, since birth, \u2018Let\u2019s look under the rock.\u2019\u2009\u201dShe has actually always said this. Back in her office, once Nolan left, she took out a box her parents brought her on a recent visit. Though shy as a child, Flynn found an outlet making fake newspapers called Cat\u2019s News, a name she jingled as she showed me copies. They\u2019re a testament to the idea that artists return to the same themes over and over again for their entire lives. One story reads:\u201cMiss Minnie Cat (no relation to Minnie Mouse) was at the beach when she was kidnapped by some pirates who are holding her for hostage.\u201cMr. Basil Derk, owner of [the] beach, says, \u2018It was just a coincidence,\u2019 even though Minnie was the 18th kidnapped.\u201d \u2014 Gillian Flynn (Staff)Amy Adams, who had been a fan of Flynn\u2019s work since she first read \u201cDark Places,\u201d also expected there to be some angstiness to Flynn when she met her; as she studied Camille, the protagonist of \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d she began to assume that some part of Flynn identified with the character. But even though not much about Camille\u2019s biography overlaps with Flynn\u2019s, Adams came to believe that there still was a connection, that the real-life novelist and fictional journalist may share a desire to \u201cget at what\u2019s inside\u201d themselves so other people can see it.Flynn grew up in Kansas City, Mo., to parents who make a lot of sense. Her mother was a reading-comprehension professor at the local community college. Her father was a film professor at the same school, and the movies he took her to see before age 10 were rarely, in her words, \u201cprincess-led\u201d: \u201cThe Great Santini,\u201d \u201cAlien,\u201d \u201cThe Elephant Man.\u201d After college at the University of Kansas, Flynn moved to California, planning to establish residency and apply to Berkeley to get a graduate degree in English. In the meantime, she found a job working at a trade magazine for human-resources professionals based in Orange County. When it came time to apply for graduate school, she went to Northwestern for a journalism degree instead, and from there moved to New York. She got a job at Entertainment Weekly, where she worked for 10 years, serving as both the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d beat writer and the television critic. She was able to move back to Chicago, a city she felt was \u201cher place,\u201d and keep the job, until she was laid off in 2008, not long before her second novel was to be published.She went for a depressing meal at a diner called the Hollywood Caf\u00e9 and briefly wondered if she\u2019d have to respond to the Help Wanted sign in the window. She\u2019d been a waitress before, she reasoned; she could do it again. But she\u2019d already written two novels, and her time as a journalist had instilled in her a helpful work ethic and lack of preciousness: She could write fast, under pressure.Though she didn\u2019t have an idea for a new novel when she got laid off, she decided to use her severance to work out the first chapter of \u201cGone Girl.\u201d She sold the book on the strength of those pages, not expecting that it would go on to become a massive hit \u2014 just as a reactive mode of feminist critique was starting to shape online discourse. Headlines like \u201cIs \u2018Gone Girl\u2019 Feminist or Misogynist?\u201d and \u201cHow \u2018Gone Girl\u2019 Is Misogynistic Literature\u201d gave way to editorials outlining Flynn\u2019s transgressions against women: though, of course, not all female characters must be likable, none of hers were, except maybe Amy\u2019s sister-in-law, Go, who nevertheless has what one writer deemed stereotypical \u201cdaddy issues.\u201d Amy was seen to fortify all sorts of harmful clich\u00e9s about women, particularly for the craven way she falsifies a rape allegation, but also because she\u2019s superannoying.The book is told in his-and-hers alternating viewpoints, and at first Amy\u2019s side of the story comes in the form of grating diary entries written in the semi-ironic, overadjectived voice of a young person trying to conceal that she really wants to be a writer but is too in love with how clever she is to manage it. In fact, she is a 38-year-old woman who only recently lost most of her trust fund because her parents \u2014 rich off a long-running series of children\u2019s books called \u201cAmazing Amy\u201d \u2014 overspent. She lies about everything, which we know because she tells us, smugly. Though her husband, Nick, is not innocent of the crimes of lying and of writerly obnoxiousness (they\u2019re both writers, sort of), he\u2019s at least self-hating and working class. Given the choice, Amy is not the one you would rather hang out with.The question that spawned a thousand think pieces is whether Amy\u2019s overbearing, sociopathic self-awareness was an intentional artistic choice, and therefore whether Flynn is reflecting the pressures of patriarchy or blindly perpetuating them. This is further complicated by the fact that the diaries are later revealed to have been fabricated by Amy as evidence of Nick\u2019s abuse, which could be read as either another point for \u201csexist portrayal of women as crazy liars\u201d or for \u201ca capable woman, driven to extremes by the patriarchy, is establishing her agency, and in a really messed-up way becoming the writer she\u2019s always dreamed of being.\u201dFlynn\u2019s response to these questions is refreshingly pragmatic: She wrote a character, and she wanted to see what that character would do under certain conditions. Still, the furor upset her. Though she has always been aware of feminism in general, and identifies as a feminist, she says she could be better versed in feminist theory, and was blindsided by the occasionally vitriolic accusations of misogyny she faced. No, most women don\u2019t falsify rape claims, she says, but most women also don\u2019t frame their cheating husbands for their own murders. Flynn remembers one negative review in particular \u2014 of the movie adaptation, directed by David Fincher \u2014 which she paraphrased for me: \u201cIt ended by saying that Fincher and I had found in each other evil soul twins of death, that we were riding off into the sunset into hell and that on the back of our car it said, \u2018Just Married.\u2019\u2009\u201d Reading it made her wonder, only half-jokingly, if she\u2019d \u201ckilled\u201d feminism.On the way, we talked about women\u2019s issues: her skin-care routine (standard), her torn labrum (an injury common to writers and baseball players) and her resistance to meditation (she just doesn\u2019t want to!). When we arrived at the skinny Victorian she used to live in, the trees she and Nolan had planted outside still there, she looked up at it fondly and reminisced about the neighbors.Then things got kind of dark. Flynn wrote \u201cGone Girl\u201d next to a space heater in the basement. Surprisingly, given how meticulous she is, Flynn doesn\u2019t plot out her stories beforehand, writing them straight through, from beginning to end. So when she wrote the beginning of \u201cGone Girl\u201d \u2014 a book unimaginable without its twist halfway through \u2014 she had no idea where it was going. Working out the winding narrative was maddening, and she crafted entire story lines that never made it in. This was, in part, because she became pregnant and had her son \u201cliterally smack in the middle\u201d of writing the novel, and because she was \u201cweirdly insistent\u201d on taking a \u201ctraditional\u201d maternity leave, she didn\u2019t look at the book for three months. When she read through her partial draft afterward \u2014 during nanny time, three days a week \u2014 she realized she had made \u201ca grave, grave error\u201d in taking such a long break.\u201cI was like, I don\u2019t know what the [expletive] this is,\u201d she said as we strolled down the leafy streets leading to Wicker Park. I imagined this reckoning taking place where all artistic reckonings take place, outside in the dead of Chicago winter. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it was, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, I don\u2019t know who this character is. What is this?\u201d She couldn\u2019t remember what she\u2019d planned on doing with the half-novel she had in front of her. The labyrinthine plot she\u2019d constructed was full of dead ends; characters\u2019 motivations were opaque to her. A dead bird we passed on the sidewalk seemed symbolic somehow. Obviously, she ended up finishing the book \u2014 only six months past deadline.The realities of child care are representative of the realities of being a woman, the wall you come up against no matter how many other advantages you have: There are things you can do to ameliorate the difficulties, but you can\u2019t escape them altogether, because the kid is always there. In \u201cGone Girl,\u201d having a child is Amy\u2019s trump card, the way she ensnares her husband for life, despite all she\u2019s put him through. (Crazy liar, or finally having it all?) \u201cWidows\u201d is marginally less gruesome than Flynn\u2019s previous work, but it presents a similarly bleak image of society as one in which some people will do whatever it takes to survive, and even those who resist this interpretation of life are nevertheless forced to recognize its advantages.If Flynn is particularly popular among women, it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t make a big deal out of writing about women, because being a woman doesn\u2019t really feel like a big deal, even when, unavoidably, it is one. Doing press for the film, Flynn was discouraged by how frequently she was asked beside-the-point questions, like, \u201cWhat do you want women to take away from this movie?\u201d Audiences want some kind of lesson, conventional wisdom says, something easily digestible and repeatable, for all the usual reasons: social media, laziness, discomfort with ambiguity. People like to be able to say what it is they\u2019re doing. Flynn\u2019s popularity suggests otherwise. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a movie that\u2019s made for women,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a women\u2019s-issue movie. It\u2019s unnerving, the idea that if there is a movie that has more than two women onscreen together, it\u2019s a message movie.\u201dWhich isn\u2019t to say that it contains no messages, only that it resists being defined by them. \u201cWidows\u201d is about women taking up a task that we\u2019re used to seeing men do, but it isn\u2019t a simple gender-swap, with Viola Davis filling in for Danny Ocean or Peter Venkman; the gender inversion is written directly into the movie, and so to some extent generates the movie. The women come together not for the purposes of revenge, but because their husbands\u2019 mistakes leave them no choice: The fiery explosion that kills the men also engulfs $2 million that belongs to a Chicago crime lord, and the widows must pay back their partners\u2019 debts before they meet the same fate. As in her novels, Flynn fuses her probing social critique with her nimble plotting. Over the phone, Steve McQueen described her rigorousness as related, in part, to her interest in \u201cthe perversities of life and the perversities of the social situations that we find ourselves in.\u201dFlynn\u2019s approach to gender in the movie is flexible, neither totally subversive nor traditional: One woman poses as a battered mail-order bride to get help buying guns; another bursts into tears when she fails to complete her assigned task. Babysitters have to be coordinated for the night of the heist. Flynn\u2019s script draws a shrewd contrast between the men\u2019s approach to robbery, which is stoic and ruthless, and the women\u2019s, which involves the characters panicking and bickering, yes, but also taking care of one another.The mainstreaming of feminism (and online surveillance thereof) has made many women I know \u2014 and myself \u2014 anxious about conforming to stereotypes, lest we perpetuate the same conditions we find so constraining. At the same time, self-consciously rejecting even harmless or positive ingrained ideas about women for the sake of doing so feels ridiculous, maybe even regressive. If there\u2019s any way to escape this double bind and establish some agency, it may be to approach womanhood like Flynn does, as just another perversity among many. Ultimately, women\u2019s issues are particular in the same way anyone\u2019s are: How do we keep going, given the circumstances? After we finished the \u201c\u2009\u2018Gone Girl\u2019 walk of woe,\u201d and I was thinking about Flynn, frustrated that she had taken time off her book to nurse her infant son, I realized we had been talking about female empowerment the entire time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visions of a Tech Hub? Landing Amazon Is Just a Start", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Amazon announced plans to build a second headquarters somewhere in North America, it set off a competition for a sort of new-economy golden ticket, a chance for one city to become, almost overnight, a magnet for the high-paying jobs and entrepreneurial spark that are hallmarks of urban success in the 21st century.Critics were just as quick to highlight potential downsides: soaring housing costs, clogged roads and strained public resources.A year later, Amazon appears poised to transform two communities, not just one. But the central question \u2014 will that transformation be for the good or the bad? \u2014 has not changed. Economists, urban planners and other experts say the answer could hinge on decisions in the coming months by the company and by the state and local officials who worked so hard to woo it.\u201cThis is not about a one-time deal,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThis is about whether Amazon and these winning communities are going to create a long-term partnership to minimize the negative impact of supersonic growth.\u201dAmazon may have made that job a bit easier. Splitting the project, known as HQ2, between two cities should ease the pressure on housing and infrastructure that critics have feared. And the company seems to have zeroed in on places able to handle an influx of workers.\u201cThose two markets were in the leading edge of rental slowdowns,\u201d said Aaron Terrazas, a Zillow economist. \u201cThere is definitely a lot more supply in those markets than there was in Seattle a decade ago.\u201dThe specter of Seattle has loomed over the HQ2 debate. Its economy has boomed since Amazon moved into the South Lake Union neighborhood in 2007. But many residents complain that growth has come at the cost of affordability and livability. Although Amazon has never said so explicitly, its tense relationship with its native city may have contributed to its decision to search for a second home.In New York and Virginia, Amazon has a chance for a fresh start. And those places have an opportunity to learn from Seattle\u2019s mistakes.\u201cWhen Amazon moved into its South Lake Union headquarters, no one knew that it was going to become the global phenomenon that it is today,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said. \u201cIn Seattle there was a lot of catch-up in housing development, catch-up in infrastructure.\u201dNew York and Virginia, by contrast, can start planning immediately to build housing, expand infrastructure and improve transit systems. If they do, Amazon could be the nudge that regions needed to address longstanding challenges, said Sarah Rosen Wartell, president of the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\u201cThere is a way that something like this focuses the mind,\u201d Ms. Wartell said. \u201cAmazon or no Amazon, all of our major housing markets and communities that are thriving are dealing with the consequences of growth.\u201dThe key is ensuring that policies benefit all residents, not just highly paid tech workers that Amazon will employ directly, Ms. Wartell said. That means building housing for low- and middle-income families, not just luxury condominiums, and improving transit options in poorer neighborhoods.Critics are skeptical of that prospect. Lauren Jacobs, executive director of the Partnership for Working Families, a network of local advocacy organizations, said Amazon should make specific promises to train and hire workers locally, rather than just bringing them in from out of town.\u201cMany of our neighbors are still struggling in this economy, and this could be an amazing transformational thing to have 25,000 jobs come to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to ensure we don\u2019t see another wave of mass displacement of working-class residents.\u201dTimothy J. Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has studied tax incentives, said comments such as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s were concerning. He and other economists worry about a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d where state and local governments compete to offer ever-bigger subsidies.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to hand out cash, and it\u2019s especially easy to hand out cash if it\u2019s going to be the next governor\u2019s problem,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.But not all incentives are created equal, he noted. Efforts to streamline regulatory and permitting processes, for example, can make projects more attractive to companies without costing taxpayers much if anything. And investments in infrastructure or job training can reap benefits for the community even if they are initially promised as a way to help a specific company.\u201cI would be trying to leverage this into improvements that wouldn\u2019t just benefit Amazon but benefit you more broadly,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.New York and Washington, of course, are a far cry from the rural Southeast. And white-collar tech jobs at Amazon require different skills than the factory jobs created by Mercedes and BMW.But Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, pointed to parallels. Amazon and other technology companies employ not just hotshot graduates of Stanford and Caltech but also thousands of lower-level programmers, data analysts and other workers who have technical skills but not advanced degrees.Amazon\u2019s decision could change the pecking order among technology hubs, in which New York and Washington have lagged behind San Francisco, Seattle and Boston.\u201cI think it does set these cities up to be rivals to Silicon Valley a generation or two down the road,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt could be the catalyst.\u201dAmazon\u2019s arrival will also mean more demand for the pool of tech workers in New York and Washington. That worries some start-ups, who already compete with Google, Facebook and other giants that have set up offices there.But Sam Mandel, senior vice president at Betaworks, a company that develops and invests in start-ups, said Amazon would be a net benefit for the tech sector.\u201cThere will be more people leaving Amazon and wanting to do earlier stage start-ups than there will be people leaving start-ups to go work at Amazon,\u201d Mr. Mandel said.Erin Griffith contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Even though our wedding was canceled because of a hurricane, with less than 48 hours notice, we were able to pull through and have a smaller wedding. Our pups were able to stay with us through the entire reception. A family member made a dress for Zoe to match the dresses that my maid and matron of honor wore.Melody Emerson, High Point, N.C.He\u2019s our son. We couldn\u2019t imagine our special day without him participating. He truly stole the show, especially when he peed on the huppah at the end of his strut down the aisle. Our florist made Wayland a custom collar to match the rest of our florals. We even had to measure his neck so that it would fit just right. We wanted him to have something unique that you couldn\u2019t buy in a store.Chloe Zale, New YorkHe will always be our first son and the first pet each of us had. We bought him a harness tuxedo on Etsy. That way he could stand up at the altar. Danielle Rains-Walker, Austin, Tex.He is our child, our baby and he\u2019s been with me through everything. He adores his new permanent papa. He is wiser than the day is long. Our wedding was a Roaring \u201920s and Gatsby theme. We ordered his tuxedo and gold bow tie from Chewy.com, his top hat from Amazon and his ring-bearer pillow from eBay.Shae Steven Franklin, DenverBecause he is just as important to me, if not more, than the man I was marrying, Ernie wore a satin blue tuxedo with a velvet bow tie. It was a custom purchase on Etsy. Post ceremony, on the dance floor, Ernie loosened up and took off his jacket, sporting just his shirt underneath.Victoria Lam, Los AngelesThey are our family. My dachshund Lily had a message for all of us. She waited 10 years for us to finally get married. She wore a white linen and lace dress with a silk flower collar and matching leash. My Berner, Zoey, wore a silk flower collar with a matching leash, and she walked my husband down the aisle. Allison Black Goldberg, Union Pier, Mich.Stella is a part of our family, so there was never a question about her being a part of our wedding. One of Stella\u2019s friends from school has a mom who makes custom dog clothes, and I asked her if she could design a dress for Stella similar to my bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. We did a FaceTime fitting, and she told me how exactly I should pin it. I also included a flower from my dress, and the result was incredible, with unexpected surprises like a glitter top hat with tiny little flowers and a beautiful leash to match. Stella looked incredible.Devora Libin, New YorkWe moved to San Francisco from Hoboken, N.J., just two months after getting engaged. Upon moving, we knew we wanted to get a dog, and Bernie stole our hearts from the minute we met him. He quickly made the cross-country move for two East Coasters much easier and really is a part of our family. We couldn\u2019t imagine our wedding day without him. We got married in New Jersey overlooking our favorite city, New York, with our family and friends. Having Bernie be a part of our day allowed us to incorporate our new home of San Francisco, and we couldn\u2019t have pictured it any other way. Bernie\u2019s tuxedo was from a local San Francisco pet shop. As soon as we saw it, we knew it was the perfect black and white classic tuxedo to complement his human father and the rest of the bridal party.Elise Nest, San FranciscoBoth Bruno and Barkley are our family, and it was only fitting that they would be the ring boys for us. Their outfits were incredibly simple: a burgundy bow tie to match the ones that male members of the wedding party wore.Sophia Boccard, New YorkWoodrow was our first dog. He moved with us from the University of Michigan to Alaska, back to Cornell University, and again to Alaska. He was an enthusiastic member of our early sled dog teams, a hobby we have kept up for 37 years. At our wedding, the rabbi would not allow Woodrow into the sanctuary, but he was allowed to attend the reception in the temple's social hall. Woodrow's checkered vest and bow tie were very stylish for 1983.I can't imagine a wedding day without Nala being a part of it. I actually messaged my husband first on OkCupid, and the first thing he asked was what type of a dog I had. Little did he know, it was two weeks until Nala would come to live with me. She has been there since the beginning of our relationship and is an important part of our lives together. We bought Nala\u2019s suit off Etsy from Olivia's Doggie Designs. The suit was custom made for our pup. The color of her suit matches the groomsmen and her bow tie matched the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. We spent more time on the dog outfit than the actual wedding dress.Mandy Menaker and Eric Winer, New YorkWhile we knew that Baloo would undoubtedly steal the show at our wedding. We also knew that our wedding day would not be complete without him there. Baloo was a groomsman, and he fulfilled the role completely. He helped the groom loosen up and relax before the ceremony by taking him for a walk around the park, providing an easy conversation starter with guests that arrived early, and most importantly, stood right by his side throughout the ceremony. Of course, the bridesmaid that walked him down the aisle knew that all eyes would be on Baloo and not her, but she was willing to make that sacrifice because Baloo is our pride and joy, and firstborn child. In fact, in honor of Baloo, we chose to donate to a bulldog rescue organization, the Philly Bully Team, in lieu of providing traditional wedding favors. Baloo is a short, stocky, dense American bulldog. While his legs are no more than seven inches in length, his build is that of a large bulldog. We knew that his tuxedo for the wedding needed to be custom made. Sean did some research and found an Etsy shop that had experience with pet outfits for weddings. He took out the measuring tape, sized up Baloo's weird-shape torso, and provided the measurements over to the designer. The tuxedo, designed to match the groom, was flawless. Everything fit perfectly.Marissa Sudol and Sean Christie, PhiladelphiaSlim Jim started our family by joining our pack when she was a puppy. She showed us that love is an infinite, unconditional gift. Slim Jim wore a custom tutu inspired by joy and festivity. The tutu was handmade by our friend\u2019s young daughter, Jane Keenan.Lorelei Narvaja Gauthier and Daniel Michael Gauthier, PhiladelphiaA bridal party is supposed to be composed of your best friends, and Atticus is certainly a best friend to both of us. We call him our chaperone because he always likes to insert himself physically between the two of us and grumbles when we don't include him in hugs and kisses. Still, he's both friend and family to us and a huge part of our lives. We knew he had to be included in the wedding. But because being at the actual wedding would have been too exciting for Atticus, we went with a Build-a-Head cutout of his face from Buildahead.com. His cutout participated in photos and walked down the aisle on the arm of one of our bridesmaids.Madeleine Minton and Jaret Glazer, ChicagoTurtle is a big part of our lives, and since we had a destination wedding, she was coming with us. She was the most photogenic one of the group. Turtle is just donning her feathers. Her beautiful colors don\u2019t need any additional outfit!Jaime Altabet and Jeff Monheit, Forest Hills, N.Y.The boys are part of our family. Tasuki has been with me for 13 years and Bagel completed us when I moved back to the Bay Area to be with my future husband after a two-year stay in New Jersey. We could not imagine them not being a part of the biggest day of our lives. We looked at a lot of different options, but settled on these bow ties from Chewy.com. My husband liked the Chippendale look it gave them.Edward Lim and Luana Lim, South San Francisco, CalifBefore being with my husband, Bill, I\u2019d never had a dog of my own. After being together nine years, and despite his vow not to subject himself to the pain of losing a dog again, Bill arranged for me to get LuLou. She has truly been the most loving gift of which I could ever be the custodian/recipient. She was the only member of our wedding party because she symbolizes the generosity and sacrifice that love requires every day. She wore a Martha Stewart checkered dress, purchased at Ross for its appropriateness for a late-August outdoor wedding ceremony. We wanted it to reflect a feeling of casual fun.Honestly, having Combo in the wedding was never a question. It was an automatic detail that neither of us had to think about. Combo is a part of the family and the only logical place for her to be while we were getting married was at the ceremony. Combo was the star and \u201cbrand\u201d of our wedding. Our hashtag was #perfectcombo, because she is perfect, of course. And because we are a perfect couple and a perfect combo. Combo's leash was custom made at LaVilla Dog Works, a shop in the bride's hometown, Johnstown, N.Y. The leash's fabric was the same fabric that was used for the napkins at each place setting. Her collar was made by the bride with faux flowers.Marlaina Hunter and Dan Hunter, Poughkeepsie, N.Y.Cooper Brownstone McIsaac is a rescue dog, who as a four-month-old puppy was found abandoned just outside Paris. He was taken in by the Society for the Protection of Animals and arrived the very same day we did to our local shelter, seeking a home, as we were seeking a puppy. Cooper was an obvious choice for the Dog of Honor role at our wedding. Since his adoption in January 2018, he has proved to be a tremendously clever, playful and loving companion. He is at the very center of our days and lives. As Paris is quite dog friendly, he accompanies us on shopping excursions, long strolls through scenic Paris and often joins us when we go out to eat. He even sleeps between us in our bed each night. Our nickname for him is \u201csweetness and light.\u201d It was always obvious to us that we would include him in our wedding ceremony. We purchased Cooper's kilt on a trip to Edinburgh in May 2018, the day after we bought the groom's kilt. As the groom is Franco-Scottish, we thought doing a kilt wedding (and having a bag piper) would be a great way to pay homage to his roots. Catherine Victoria Olien and Florent John McIsaac, ParisCoco is a part of the family, so she naturally was a part of the wedding. The morning of the wedding, she hung out with the bridesmaids for hair and makeup. During the ceremony, she walked down the aisle with the flower girls. Later in the day, she mingled with friends and family. Our wedding was a traditional Indian ceremony, so fittingly Coco, like the rest of the wedding party, wore traditional Indian attire. Her outfit was designed in India to match the bridesmaids\u2019 saris. The dressmaker, Kiran of Bangalore, India, was a little surprised by the request for a dog-size sari, but did a wonderful job creating a custom piece for Coco. On her neck, Coco wore a peach garland to match the ones worn by her parents.Savina Aneja and Shravan Kandula, Winter Park, Fla.Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion, and Vows) and Instagram.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Why Corporate America Is Content With the Midterms", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are some other key corporate takeaways from the midterms:____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London.____________________________The move is the result of a settlement between Tesla and the S.E.C. over Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets about plans to take the company private. To end a lawsuit over the posts, the S.E.C. demanded that the automaker separate the roles of chairman and C.E.O., and Mr. Musk is now unable to serve as chairman for three years.The decision thrusts into one of the brightest spotlights in American business a woman who is little known in the U.S. but has extensive experience as a finance executive in Silicon Valley and her native Australia. As a Tesla board member, Ms. Denholm has provided some rare automotive experience to a company that prides itself on being an industry outsider. She spent seven years at Toyota Motor Corp. in Australia, where she was a senior financial manager.Democrats have called on Mr. Whitaker to recuse himself, given his previous public comments. Expect the political battling to drag on.H.F.R.\u2019s equity hedge fund index fell 4.25 percent in October \u2014 its worst performance in nearly three years \u2014 while the index that tracks funds that invest in technology stocks fared the worst, with a decline of 4.7 percent.Those strategies weren\u2019t even the worst performers for the month. That title went to H.F.R.\u2019s index that tracked funds that invest in energy stocks, which was down just over 8 percent for October.Analysts broadly think that China sees a renminbi exchange rate of 7 to the dollar as a big psychological barrier (the currency is currently just below that level). The big spending suggests that is the case, but the FT also notes that the Chinese central bank is treading a careful line to avoid eroding its foreign exchange reserves below $3 trillion.The news may assuage some concerns about whether China is unfairly manipulating its currency. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned China not to reduce the renminbi\u2019s value as a weapon in its trade war with the U.S.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Do You Leave Funny Comments Online?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStudent OpinionHave you ever written or read a memorably funny comment online? Do you ever read online posts for the humorous comments?Upon searching \u201cPacific Ocean\u201d using Google Maps, one might expect to find a diagram of the world that illustrates Earth\u2019s largest body of water. And yes, the result returns an interactive graphic displaying just that.But the Pacific also gets a rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars, and more than 14,500 reviews, many describing presumably fictional experiences. \u201cStop down-voting the ocean because of sharks,\u201d chides one.User-generated feedback is now constantly self-published on sites such as Google Maps, Amazon and Yelp, a crowdsourced education for potential customers about the functions, satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) of products, services and venues. The format is so common that it is now often spoofed.In September on Google Maps, a critic with the screen name Makorun shared thoughts on the Pacific: \u201cWonderful ocean. Very refreshing, although it needs a heating feature. If it was drinkable I would rate it 5 stars but I\u2019ll keep it at 4 until the developer fixes the water. Almost every species is aggressive, except for the dolphins sometimes. I suggest making it breathable too and maybe add more light in the deep parts of the ocean.\u201d This imaginative paragraph received more than 140 likes.Funny comments on Amazon became so popular that the company published \u201cDid You Read That Review?: A Compilation of Amazon\u2019s Funniest Reviews\u201d in 2014.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Is Worth as Much as Apple. How Did That Happen?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world.It was big and still quite profitable, but the company had lost its luster, failing or trailing in the markets of the future like mobile, search, online advertising and cloud computing. Its stock price languished, inching up 3 percent in the decade through the end of 2012.It\u2019s a very different story today. Microsoft is running neck and neck with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company, both worth about $850 billion, thanks to a stock price that has climbed 30 percent over the last 12 months. At the end of trading Friday, Microsoft was just ahead of its longtime rival.So what happened?There is a short-term explanation for Microsoft\u2019s market rise, and there is a longer-term one.The near-term, stock-trading answer is that Microsoft has held up better than others during the recent sell-off of tech company shares. Apple investors are worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Facebook and Google face persistent attacks on their role in distributing false news and conspiracy theories, and investor concerns that their privacy policies could scare off users and advertisers.But the more enduring and important answer is that Microsoft has become a case study of how a once-dominant company can build on its strengths and avoid being a prisoner of its past. It has fully embraced cloud computing, abandoned an errant foray into smartphones and returned to its roots as mainly a supplier of technology to business customers.Microsoft\u2019s path to cloud computing \u2014 processing, storage and software delivered as a service over the internet from remote data centers \u2014 was lengthy and sometimes halting.Its forerunners to cloud computing go back to the 1990s, with Microsoft\u2019s MSN online service and later its Bing search engine. In 2010, four years after Amazon entered the cloud market, Microsoft introduced its cloud service. But it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.Even then, Microsoft\u2019s cloud service was a side business. The corporate center of gravity remained its Windows operating system, the linchpin of the company\u2019s wealth and power during the personal computer era. That changed after Mr. Nadella replaced Steven A. Ballmer, who had been chief executive for 14 years.Microsoft has also retooled its popular Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a cloud version, Office 365. That offering caters to people who prefer to use software as an internet service and gives Microsoft a competitive entry against online app suppliers like Google.The financial payoff from the shift came gradually at first, but is accelerating. In the year that ended in June, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 15 percent, to $110 billion, and operating profit increased 13 percent, to $35 billion.\u201cThe essence of what Satya Nadella did was the dramatic shift to the cloud,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cHe put Microsoft back into a high-growth business.\u201dIt is the perception that Microsoft is on a high-growth track that has fueled its rising share price.Microsoft would not try to compete with the smartphone technology leaders, Apple, Google and Samsung. Instead, Microsoft focused on its developing apps and other software for business customers.Microsoft does have a successful consumer franchise in its Xbox video game business. But it is a separate unit, and though it generates revenue of $10 billion, that is still less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s overall sales.Microsoft products, in the main, are about utility \u2014 productivity tools, whether people use them at work or at home. And its Azure cloud technology is a service for businesses and a platform for software developers to build applications, a kind of cloud operating system.\u201cIt\u2019s really the coming together of the professional cloud and the professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella explained at the time.Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has loosened up. Windows would no longer be its center of gravity \u2014 or its anchor. Microsoft apps would run not only on Apple\u2019s Macintosh software but on other operating systems as well. Open source and free software, once anathema to Microsoft, was embraced as a vital tool of modern software development.Mr. Nadella preached an outward-looking mind-set. \u201cWe need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft,\u201d he wrote in his book \u201cHit Refresh,\u201d published last year.The company\u2019s financial performance \u2014 and its stock price \u2014 suggest that the Nadella formula is working.\u201cThe old, Windows-centric view of the world stifled innovation,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThe company has changed culturally. Microsoft is an exciting place to work again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "ActBlue, the Democrats\u2019 Not-So-Secret Weapon", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut all have at least one thing in common: ActBlue.The online giving platform emerged as the piggy bank of the Democratic resistance in the 2018 midterms, funneling nearly $1.6 billion in contributions to Democratic candidates and causes. That\u2019s more than an 80 percent increase over what it brought in four years ago.And while ActBlue wasn\u2019t the sole source of small-dollar donors for Democrats, it was certainly a powerful one: The candidates, committees and organizations who used the platform \u2014 more than 14,500 of them \u2014 paid credit card transaction fees and, in turn, got to outsource their financial collections to tested, easy-to-use software. (The group, a nonprofit, funds its staff of about 100 through donations.)Republicans have long benefited from stronger support among wealthy donors and the business community, relying on a network of lavishly funded super PACs. But ActBlue has changed the game for Democrats. Founded in 2004, the nonprofit has developed into a trusted platform, turning the once-cumbersome process of donating to a campaign into something that can be done with just one click of a cellphone.The technology encourages small, recurring donations that go directly to candidates, giving campaigns more control over how the money was spent. The money can also be transferred quickly, wired from ActBlue into campaign coffers by the next morning.\u201cThere used to be these old ways of thinking that there was just a finite pool of people to reach out to when you were doing it all on paper,\u201d said Erin Hill, the executive director of ActBlue. \u201cTechnology can help democratize this process in a way that wasn\u2019t possible 20 years ago.\u201dBut strategists on both sides say the flood of small dollars \u2014 helped along by $110 million from the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2014 changed the race for Democrats in the final weeks of the election season, allowing the party to remain competitive in reach districts, dominate the airwaves and force Republicans to spread out their spending.\u201cTheir money was astronomical,\u201d said Corry Bliss, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC. \u201cIf you had told me last year this is how much money they would have to spend in these races, I would have laughed at you.\u201d\u201cActBlue wasn\u2019t ActBlue in year one, two or three,\u201d said Mr. Bliss. \u201cSomeone has to develop a brand. It\u2019s doable but takes time.\u201dThey\u2019ll have a lot of catching up to do. In the early handicapping of the 2020 presidential race, some of the strongest potential contenders are those with expansive lists of small donors, a group that includes Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and Beto O\u2019Rourke, who lost his bid for a Texas Senate seat. That\u2019s in part because of the success of Mr. Sanders, perhaps the highest-profile ActBlue user, who powered his 2016 primary campaign through small dollars.\u201cWe don\u2019t go away after a campaign,\u201d said Ms. Hill. \u201cCampaigns, whether they won or lost, they disappeared on Wednesday.

They were each invited to a large social gathering there by the same mutual friend.At the time, Mr. Groberg, who lived in nearby Bethesda, Md., was receiving treatment for his war injury at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he had undergone more than 30 surgeries over two years. He had not yet been retired by the Army.Ms. Zarin, who was living in Washington, was sitting outside on the patio and dropped her cellphone by accident at precisely the same time as Mr. Groberg walked past her.

{"Headline": "How to Crush an Outlaw Biker Club: Seize Its \u2026 Logo?", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 For many years, federal law enforcement authorities have been trying to take down the Mongols, a biker group they consider one of the most dangerous criminal enterprises in the country.They have infiltrated it with undercover agents. They have hammered members with charges ranging from drug dealing to money laundering to murder. They have conducted mass arrests that resulted in dozens of guilty pleas, including one by a past president.But after a decade of trying, they have failed to deliver what they view as the coup de gr\u00e2ce: seizing control of the Mongols\u2019 trademarked logo, a drawing of a brawny Genghis Khan-like figure sporting a queue and sunglasses, riding a chopper while brandishing a sword.Now, in a racketeering trial underway in Orange County, Calif., federal prosecutors believe they have their best chance yet to take the Mongols\u2019 intellectual property, using a novel approach to asset forfeiture law, which allows the seizure of goods used in the commission of crimes.Prosecutors argue that taking the logo will deprive the group of its \u201cunifying symbol\u201d \u2014 the banner under which prosecutors say the group marauds.If federal prosecutors have their way, one of them boasted at an earlier point in the court battle, the police could stop any Mongol and \u201cliterally take the jacket right off his back.\u201dBut legal experts question the prosecutors\u2019 grasp of intellectual property law. \u201cTrademark rights are not tangible personal property like a jacket. They are intangible rights,\u201d said Evan Gourvitz, an intellectual property lawyer with the law firm Ropes & Gray in New York. \u201cBut prosecutors are treating a trademark like a jacket.\u201dThe Mongols are equally mystified. The logo \u2014 also called a patch \u2014 is emblazoned on the vests, T-shirts and motorcycles of hundreds of members.\u201cLots of brothers have tattoos of the marks on their necks and heads and everywhere,\u201d David Santillan, the national president of the club, said. \u201cHow do you regulate that?\u201dFor bikers, the patch is key to belonging and the optics of appearing tough, and members can spend months or even years proving themselves before they earn the right to wear it.\u201cThe patch is like the American flag to these guys and speaks to the identity of the club, the individual and the culture,\u201d said William Dulaney, a retired associate professor who is an expert on motorcycle groups. \u201cSome clubs have the rule that if the colors even touch the ground, they have to be destroyed.\u201dThe Mongols\u2019 marks, like those of other biker groups, are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Clubs have aggressively protected their patches from unauthorized use.The Hells Angels have gone after large corporations including Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, the Alexander McQueen fashion line, Amazon, Saks, and Walt Disney, accusing them of infringement on its death\u2019s head logo \u2014 a skull in a winged helmet \u2014 and other club symbols.They have usually been successful, reaching settlements that require defendants to cease using the trademarks and to recall and destroy merchandise, among other concessions.The Mongols have had their share of run-ins with the law. The group was founded in Montebello, Calif., in 1969 and has about 1,000 members in the United States, most of whom are Hispanic. About half of the club\u2019s membership is in California, though Mr. Santillan said 11 new chapters were recently established in Texas.In 2012 Christopher Ablett, a suspected member of the Modesto, Calif., chapter, was sentenced to life in prison for the 2008 murder of the president of the San Francisco chapter of the Hells Angels, Mark Guardado. In 2014 David Martinez, a Mongols member in San Gabriel, Calif., was charged with murder in the shooting death of a Pomona police officer.Five months ago, 21 members and associates of the Mongols chapter in Clarksville, Tenn., were charged with a host of crimes including racketeering conspiracy, murder, kidnapping and robbery.The Mongols say that they are not a criminal operation and that such crimes were largely the work of rogue members who are no longer in the organization. They further contend that some violent acts were committed in self-defense or in defense of others. Mongols, they say, are simply part of a brotherhood who are exercising their constitutional rights by wearing the patch.\u201cThis is a case of guilt by association, an attempt to put the liability on all members,\u201d said Joseph A. Yanny, the Mongols\u2019 lead lawyer. \u201cThis is one of the most absurd cases I have seen the government pursue.\u201dBut prosecutors argue that the patch is the flag under which Mongols carry out unlawful acts and intimidate the public.\u201cThe government will show that the marks served as unifying symbols of an enterprise dedicated to intimidating and terrorizing everyone who is not a member,\u201d they wrote in a court filing, \u201cand assaulting and killing those who have sworn their loyalty to other outlaw motorcycle gangs.\u201dA spokesman for the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Central District of California said he could not comment on the case.The quest to gain control of the Mongols\u2019 colors began in 2008, when the tactic was suggested by members of the prosecution team at the United States attorney\u2019s office, said Thomas P. O\u2019Brien, who led the office at the time. \u201cWe were looking for a way to have real impact and we knew this was going to be a test case,\u201d he said.The pursuit of the patch was part of a criminal indictment against 79 Mongols that ultimately resulted in 77 guilty pleas. Over the years, the trademark part of the case has been punctuated by conflicting interpretations of intellectual property law, judges overruling their own orders and confusion over who even owns the rights to the logo.\u201cJustice is often a long and bumpy road and this case has been particularly long and bumpy,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien acknowledged.During an early stretch of the case, Judge Florence-Marie Cooper of Federal District Court in Los Angeles granted a sweeping order that authorized the seizure of \u201cproducts, clothing, vehicles, motorcycles, books, posters, merchandise, stationery, or other materials bearing the Mongols trademark\u201d from members, their relatives and any associates.In response, some members defiantly flaunted the marks while others wore alternative Mongols logos. After further litigation, Judge Cooper would then rule that the Mongols\u2019 marks were not subject to confiscation. In 2009, Ramon Rivera, a Mongols member who had not been charged with a crime, filed a lawsuit with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union.Mr. Rivera argued that his First Amendment and due process rights had been violated by the order, and asked that law enforcement authorities be blocked from confiscating his property. He ultimately prevailed and was awarded $252,466 in lawyers\u2019 fees.In 2010, another federal judge, Otis Wright, preliminarily forfeited the logo to the government after the lead defendant and former club president, Ruben Cavazos, reached a plea deal with prosecutors.But the Mongols argued that the club, not Mr. Cavazos, owned the rights to the images. Judge Wright sided with the Mongols, \u201cregrettably\u201d concluding that the marks were not forfeitable since they belonged to the organization.In a somewhat similar case in Michigan, prosecutors withdrew their bid for the Devils Diciples trademark after six members were convicted at trial for firearms offenses, drug trafficking, illegal gambling and other crimes. The individual who owned the trademark, prosecutors had discovered, was not among the defendants.In a 2016 letter to one of the prosecutors, Fritz Clapp, a lawyer for the Diciples, said that if the government gained ownership of the trademark, it would face a quandary because owners must periodically demonstrate that the mark is still in active use for the purpose registered.\u201cUnless the government were to use the collective membership mark to operate a motorcycle club, then it could not satisfy the requirement,\u201d Mr. Clapp wrote. \u201cTrademarks, unlike copyrights and patents, have no enduring value apart from their use.\u201dBut in Los Angeles, prosecutors did not give up. In 2013, they came back with a new indictment, this time against Mongol Nation, for many of the same racketeering offenses as were in the 2008 indictments, plus some newer ones. Again, they asked for the forfeiture of the trademarks. The trial is expected to continue for several more weeks.The Mongols are watching closely, saying they know theirs is a test case.\u201cThey take our patch,\u201d Mr. Santillan, the president, said. \u201cAnd then they take all the clubs\u2019 patches.\u201dAlain Delaqueriere and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leading the Way to Flushing, Queens", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byrentersAfter they moved to a rent-stabilized building, seven of their friends followed, lured by the affordable rent and the great food in the neighborhood. When Cynthia Chung, 31, and Jeddy Hao, 32, found their one-bedroom apartment on Craigslist five years ago, it seemed like too good a deal.Rent was $1,050 a month, a few hundred less than everything else in the area, with no obvious defects to explain the discount. If anything, the apartment was nicer than others they had seen: It was well sized and well maintained, with large windows and a good layout.To Ms. Chung\u2019s surprise, he turned out to be right. Rent stabilization accounted for the lower-than-average rent. If there was any downside, it was that many of their friends lived elsewhere.But as they would soon discover, the prospect of a rent-stabilized apartment in a pleasant building is a powerful lure. They would not be alone for long.\u201cBack then, it was like, \u2018If you\u2019re in Flushing, you\u2019re hanging out with a bad crowd.\u2019 People were always getting into fights,\u201d said Mr. Hao, who grew up in Whitestone, N.Y. \u201cOur parents wouldn\u2019t even let us go here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not shiny and new like Long Island City, but it has its charms,\u201d Mr. Hao said. \u201cLike authentic Chinese food.\u201d\u201cSo much good food,\u201d Ms. Chung said. \u201cBuying food out is actually cheaper than cooking \u2014 most meals are, like, $6. There\u2019s a great range of high-end and dirt-cheap, but the dirt-cheap is actually better: White Bear, New Curry Leaves, Shiny Tea, New World Mall food court. You can get real milk tea, cheong fun, mala tang premade hot pot. I love it, I just love it.\u201dSuch is the abundance of inexpensive restaurants that the couple has to make a point to cook at home at least one night a week \u2014 but even then, they\u2019re often tempted to take an after-dinner stroll to one of the area\u2019s many dessert spots.$1,350 | Flushing, QueensIt didn\u2019t take long for the couple\u2019s friends to take notice of their cheap rent and Flushing\u2019s charms. The neighborhood\u2019s improved reputation and influx of new development and higher-end restaurants and stores didn\u2019t hurt, either. And as their friends\u2019 leases ended and apartments in the building opened up, they started moving in.The first, a pair Ms. Chung has known since sixth grade, found a one-bedroom listed on StreetEasy and snapped it up immediately. Then two friends considering a two-bedroom in Astoria heard about another opening in the building and decided to take it. Others followed suit, and the couple now has seven friends living in four different apartments in the building.\u201cWe hang out, eat together, lounge together. We\u2019re even all on the same phone plan, and we share Amazon accounts,\u201d said Ms. Chung, who is delighted that so many friends have joined them in their building. \u201cIt\u2019s very open-door, no one would turn you away. It\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, are you bored? Do you want to hang out?\u2019\u201dBesides knocking on one another\u2019s doors, the friends use a Facebook group chat to share leftovers, borrow a vegetable steamer or beg for assistance clearing out a shoe closet. They also coordinate movie nights, video game sessions, Costco runs and evening cocktails at \u201cthe bachelor pad,\u201d the apartment with a bar. A recent afternoon was spent updating the buzzer labels by the front door.Stephen Fang, who lives down the hall with his wife, Ester Linton, said it was a lot like college \u2014 only better: \u201cIt\u2019s like the best of both worlds. You have community, but you also get alone time.\u201d Mr. Hao nodded. \u201cI like to hang out, but not every night exactly. Sometimes you\u2019re tired and you just want to watch TV.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the more social one,\u201d said Ms. Chung, adding that she almost never craves an evening alone. Ms. Linton said she was looking forward to spending even more time together over the holidays, when people are home more often. \u201cLast year we did hot pot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the bachelor apartment for coffee \u2014 they have a really nice espresso machine \u2014 and ours for video games.\u201dWhile Ms. Chung said she has some friends who wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with a no-frills building like theirs \u2014 particularly as the Long Island Rail Road runs directly behind it \u2014 she expected to be welcoming more people in the future.\u201cI definitely think more friends will end up moving in,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are constantly asking us to be on the lookout.\u201dAnd earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a renter in Flushing, N.Y.

Yet there is a silver lining: This is the best time to buy a few items, like video game consoles, televisions and smart home accessories, which plummet to their lowest prices. If you know ahead of time what to focus on, you might score a few good deals.To help narrow your search for good buys on Black Friday, I teamed up with Wirecutter to round up the products that are worth following \u2014 and the ones you can skip.\u201cThis year in particular, the consoles are pretty much the best prices we\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said.For example, both Walmart and Best Buy plan to sell Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 bundled with the new Spider-Man game for $200, down from the retail price of $300 for the console alone. In addition, Nintendo\u2019s Switch console will cost about $300 together with a Super Mario Kart game \u2014 normally, the system costs that much without a game included.Black Friday tends to be one of the best times to buy a great television for a significant discount. But there are caveats.For one, don\u2019t be fooled by ads for so-called doorbusters \u2014 like jaw-droppingly cheap TVs \u2014 at retailers like Best Buy, Mr. Burakowski said. Those tend to be mediocre TV sets, or they sell out extremely quickly. For another, during Black Friday, manufacturers sometimes sell subpar televisions with model numbers that are nearly identical to popular, high-quality sets, he added.SIZEBEST TVRUNNER-UPSTEP UPLessthan50\u201dSony XBR49X900F Samsung UN49NU8000NoneThe Samsung NU8000 has a nice streaming interface, good image quality and special motion features just for video games, making it the best choice for hard-core gamers.51\u201dto60\u201dVizio P55-F1TCL 55R615-17LG 55C8PThe Vizio P-Series offers superb image quality, and with Google Chromecast built in, it can stream from almost any service on your phone. \u00a061\u201dto70\u201dVizio P65-F1TCL 65R617Vizio PQ65-F1The Vizio PQ-Series is the best-looking LCD TV, and it truly shines with HDR content.

These include:outdoor gear laptops large kitchen appliances office suppliesHere\u2019s why: Outdoor gear usually goes on sale in the weeks before Black Friday, and well-reviewed laptops get better discounts during back-to-school season in the fall. Office supplies and large kitchen appliances like refrigerators sporadically go on sale throughout the year and are not tied to a particular season.There\u2019s one more thing you can skip altogether: lining up to stampede into stores at the crack of dawn.The overwhelming majority of good Black Friday deals are obtainable online, Mr. Burakowski said. So after filling up on turkey, you can stick with your friends and family and occasionally peek at your phone to see if the item you wanted went on sale. No early-morning waking up required.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sigrid Johnson Was Black. A DNA Test Said She Wasn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "The surge in popularity of services like 23andMe and Ancestry means that more and more people are unearthing long-buried connections and surprises in their ancestry.Supported byThree years ago, when Sigrid E. Johnson was 62, she got a call from a researcher seeking volunteers for a study on DNA ancestry tests and ethnic identity. Johnson agreed to help. After all, she and the researcher, Anita Foeman, had been pals for half a century, ever since they attended the same elementary school in their integrated Philadelphia neighborhood, where they and other black children were mostly protected from the racism beyond its borders. Foeman, a professor of communication at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, asked Johnson to swab the inside of her cheek and share her thoughts about her ethnic and racial identity before and after the results came back.Johnson\u2019s father, a chauffeur who later became a superintendent at a housing project in North Philadelphia, had a golden-brown complexion. Her mother, who said her own father was a white Brit and her mother was half African-American and half Native American, was light-skinned. People sometimes mistook Johnson\u2019s mother for white, and when she applied for seamstress jobs at department stores in the 1920s and \u201930s, she chose not to correct them.Sigrid, who had light caramel skin, was their only child, and her parents, Martha and Frank Gilchrist, doted on her. In grade school, she prayed each night for an older brother, someone who would be fun to play with and would look after her, as her friends\u2019 brothers did with their siblings. When she wasn\u2019t busy with ballet and piano lessons, she caught lightning bugs and played dolls, hopscotch and jump rope with nearby friends. The neighborhood, West Mount Airy, was a tree-lined community, one of the first in the nation to integrate successfully. It was populated mostly by middle- and upper-class people, including many African-American professional men who had fair-skinned wives and children whose complexions matched their mothers\u2019.Johnson doesn\u2019t remember her parents talking much about race, except when her father made it clear that he expected her to marry a black man. But even without that explicit talk, she was immersed in the highs and lows of black life. Her cousin, a surgeon named William Gilchrist Anderson, lived in Albany, Ga., where he led a large coalition of activists in the early 1960s to desegregate public facilities. A friend and classmate of Ralph Abernathy, Anderson persuaded the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to participate in the city\u2019s demonstrations, which Johnson remembers she and her parents sometimes joined. During the family\u2019s trips to visit her cousin in Georgia, Johnson saw water fountains that said \u201cWhites Only.\u201d And she still remembers the night that a giant cross burned near her cousin\u2019s front yard and how he swept her and everyone else out of the house and put them all up in a hotel.As a young teenager, Johnson pestered her mother about what it was like to give birth to her \u2014 a query her mother always dodged. But when Johnson was 16, her mother broke down and said through tears that they adopted her when she was an infant. Her mother explained that Johnson\u2019s biological father was black and that her biological mother was a white Italian woman who said she couldn\u2019t keep the baby, who by then was 2 or 3 months old. The woman, who lived in South Philadelphia, had explained that she already had several children, all of whom were blond, and that her white husband didn\u2019t want another man\u2019s child raised in his home, not least of all one whose color so boldly announced that fact. Johnson\u2019s mother said the woman came to see the baby for about a year, until she asked the woman to stop visiting because she didn\u2019t want Sigrid to find out she was adopted. Johnson teared up as she recounted the conversation with her mother that took place 49 years ago. \u201cThe news \u2014 all of it \u2014 was crushing,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cTo this day, I honestly wish she had never told me. I wanted my mom to be my mom.\u201d Neither one ever broached the subject with the other again.So when Anita Foeman requested that she take a DNA test, Johnson figured it was no big deal: She was half African and half Italian. \u201cI knew what the results would show when they came back \u2014 that is, until the results actually came back.\u201dJohnson is one of many millions of people around the world who have placed a bit of saliva into a DNA kit, sent it off to a testing company, waited a good month for the results and then discovered the sometimes life-altering secrets hidden in those tiny drops. Virtually every cell in a human\u2019s body carries that person\u2019s whole unique blueprint \u2014 the double helix of DNA. The genes on chromosomes influence the traits of every living thing. Testing companies analyze hundreds of thousands of particular genetic sequences and use those snippets as clues to all sorts of information. Scientists have determined specific locations in the DNA code that provide hints about where your ancestors came from, because people from the same geographical place share certain genetic similarities. The tests can also reveal your biological relatives, and how closely you\u2019re related, by evaluating how much of your and their DNA patterns overlap. In addition, DNA analysis can identify some of the hereditary disorders you may be predisposed to or may pass on to your children.Rudimentary DNA testing has been around since the mid-20th century, but at-home genetic tests (aside from simple paternity tests) didn\u2019t show up until this century, after the Human Genome Project prompted biotechnological advances that made genetic sequencing much more affordable. Most of those early personal genomic tests focused on genealogy, a way to fill out the family tree, because determining familial connections is scientifically much more straightforward than determining a person\u2019s true ethnic lineage. But in 2007, as scientists linked more genes to diseases and traits, 23andMe pioneered a much broader kind of retail genomics, a $999 saliva test that promised to reveal genetic information from the novel to the profound. It included ancestry and information about medical and other genetic information, including consumers\u2019 risk for age-related macular degeneration, Parkinson\u2019s disease and Type 2 diabetes, as well genes that block the bitter taste in vegetables and influence weight gain.The following year, Time magazine named the company\u2019s retail DNA test the Invention of the Year, describing this moment as \u201cthe beginning of a personal-genomics revolution that will transform not only how we take care of ourselves but also what we mean by personal information. ... Not everything about how this information will be used is clear yet \u2014 23andMe has stirred up debate about issues ranging from how meaningful the results are to how to prevent genetic discrimination \u2014 but the curtain has been pulled back, and it can never be closed again.\u201dThose debates continue, but in the last year or so, sales of at-home genetic tests have risen meteorically. By April 2017, 23andMe had roughly two million customers, and this past January, just nine months later, it had more than five million. AncestryDNA\u2019s customer base doubled to about six million in 2017 alone and has since grown to more than 10 million. Add to that all the customers of MyHeritage, FamilyTreeDNA, Helix, National Geographic\u2019s DNA test and dozens of others. The most popular tests are those that promise to reveal test takers\u2019 ancestry and identify their relatives \u2014 and have the potential to upend our understanding of ourselves. Just imagine what you might find out: Your father is not your dad but actually your dad\u2019s best friend. Or your sister is really your half sister or isn\u2019t your biological sister at all. Or you\u2019re the child of a sperm donor and have 150 half siblings. These and endless other DNA surprises all raise the same question: Are we really who we think we are?Once Johnson found out she was adopted, the 16-year-old examined every passer-by in Philadelphia, wondering: \u201cAre you my relative?\u201d When it came time to choose a college, she opted for a school more than 500 miles away: a historically black university in Ohio called Wilberforce, named after a prominent 18th-century abolitionist. It was 1970, and on campus, talk of black power and black pride swirled around her. At first she felt self-conscious that she lacked the richly colored skin that was finally being celebrated in society, but her cousin\u2019s prominence in civil rights efforts gave her a certain confidence. While Johnson was at Wilberforce, she told no one that she was adopted and no one that she was half white. \u201cI was at an all-black school, so if anyone asked what I was, I just said, \u2018Black.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn college, Johnson\u2019s sense of herself as a black person intensified, immersed as she was in a cocooned world that celebrated the contributions and ambitions of the community. Most of Johnson\u2019s professors were black, as were virtually all the students. She was surrounded by people who exuded pride in their identity.All around her, classmates were sporting dashikis and other African garb, or the black beret and black leather jacket of the Black Panthers. Large Afros seemed ubiquitous, often with Afro picks decorated with a clenched black fist. Johnson stopped straightening her hair, which had required her to wrap her gentle curls around large rollers and sleep that way all night. By the early \u201970s, straightened hair was pass\u00e9 for black women, and Johnson did her best to keep up. \u201cI tried really hard to make a bush, an Afro, teasing it up and then putting bobby pins in to keep it up, but when it rained, my bush would just fall.\u201d She bought an Afro wig with hair that stood five inches high and wore it daily. \u201cNo one ever asked if it was a wig,\u201d she said, \u201cbut my best friends knew.\u201d Soon after, she quit wearing it.When Johnson was 22, she fell for a man she would later marry, but she never told him that she was half white or adopted. Her parents disapproved of how dark the man\u2019s skin was, because in their experience, lighter complexion meant higher status and more options. When the young couple\u2019s son was born in 1976, Johnson\u2019s parents were relieved that his coloring was more like their daughter\u2019s.Johnson and her husband split up two years later. That same year, Johnson went back to school to get her nursing degree. In 1985, she married another man, a physical therapist; by then, both her parents had died. She told her husband what she had never told anyone else besides her son and a few close friends: She was adopted. His response was kind and supportive. Years later, he happened upon a conversation on \u201cThe Phil Donahue Show\u201d about adoptees successfully requesting their original birth certificates from state officials. He called Johnson at work right away and encouraged her to request her birth certificate too. He gathered all the information she needed, and they sent it off together. When it arrived, she learned that her mother\u2019s name was Ann D\u2019Amico, so Johnson and her husband called D\u2019Amicos they found in the Philadelphia phone book. Some who answered said they knew no Ann D\u2019Amico. Others just hung up.Still, when Johnson took the DNA test in 2015 at age 62, she was certain about what it would find and was sorry she wouldn\u2019t be able to share the results with her husband, who had died years earlier. The results, which indicated a stunning level of precision, shocked Johnson. They said she was 45.306 percent Hispanic, 32.321 percent Middle Eastern, 13.714 percent European and 8.659 percent \u201cother,\u201d which included a mere 2.978 percent African.\u201cTwo percent African?! I thought, Well, who am I then? I knew that at my age, I shouldn\u2019t really care what people think, but I was embarrassed to show it to anyone besides my son and my cousin, who\u2019s like a sister to me. I was afraid people would think I was a fraud. I was so disappointed, and in my heart of hearts, I didn\u2019t believe it, because how could I not be black? I\u2019d lived black. I was black.\u201dWith the stupendous rise of DNA ancestry testing, academics have wondered how those genetic results affect people\u2019s core identity. Our sense of self, of course, is built on much more than just the ethnic tribe we belong to. We forge our identity from the social and cultural milieus we\u2019re raised in; the messages we get from parents, teachers and society about ourselves; the family lore and traditions passed down from generation to generation; and the experiences we have and hold dear. All of that is deeply woven into who we are.\u201cOur identity is what grounds us and gives our lives meaning,\u201d said David Brodzinsky, emeritus professor of developmental and clinical psychology at Rutgers University, whose work focuses on identity and adoption. \u201cThat identity can be a motivating force or a debilitating one, depending on how we define ourselves and internalize the feedback we get from others. We spend our lives searching for self, though we each do that in different ways and at different times. It\u2019s all about the desire to fill in empty spaces, to find connection, to know more about yourself.\u201dFor children cut off from their origins because of a closed adoption or an unknown sperm or egg donor, those answers are harder to get. And if a person\u2019s origin was a secret that they discover later in life, Brodzinsky said, they may feel that everything they knew about themselves and their roots was a lie. Even people who were raised by their biological parents can feel shaken when their DNA tests present results that don\u2019t fit with their understanding of who they are.Anita Foeman is one of the academics studying the effects of unexpected DNA results. Since 2006, she has tested roughly 3,000 people. Before her subjects receive their results, she asks them about their racial and ethnic identities, then follows up with them once the results are in. Her research subjects often conflate race and ethnicity \u2014 \u201cIf I\u2019m this color, my ancestors must be from this place.\u201d But ancestry tests look for genetic links to geographic regions, not to physical characteristics associated with race, like skin color, which is an unreliable indicator of ancestry. Foeman and researchers at other universities have found that people accept the results that suit their aspirations and often dismiss results that challenge their long-held core beliefs.\u201cWe seek out and cultivate identities to fill our need to belong, and it\u2019s through that lens of identity that we see and understand the world,\u201d said Jay Van Bavel, a psychology professor at New York University who researches how group identities, values and beliefs shape the mind and brain. \u201cSo when you get information that challenges your identity, many people tune it out, just like we do with headlines and news stories when they counter our politics and belief system.\u201dWhen white test takers see results that indicate they have African ancestry, some, especially young people, welcome their newfound multicultural heritage, even when the percentage is small, which raises an interesting question: How much ancestry is enough to give someone the authority to claim that identity? Research also shows that some whites whose reports indicate African lineage conclude that it\u2019s irrelevant, and still others, no matter their race or ethnicity, disbelieve results they didn\u2019t expect. For example, many blacks and whites whose families have long claimed that some of their forebears were Native American dismiss DNA reports that say otherwise. And Asians, like whites, often rebuff results that indicate that their heritage isn\u2019t pure. Some people take that to extremes: White nationalists who use DNA tests to prove their racial purity adamantly reject any non-European results. A professor at the University of California at Los Angeles and another researcher studied comments on the online white-supremacist forum Stormfront. They found that some posters who had taken DNA tests and were upset with their results argued that they were \u201crigged\u201d to \u201cspread multiculturalism\u201d or that the non-European findings were merely \u201cnoise DNA.\u201d Many African-Americans, meanwhile, upon seeing how much of their lineage is European, are not necessarily surprised or doubtful about the results, but they feel gut-punched by the bald reminder that even their genes carry slavery\u2019s legacy. Underlying all these reactions is the question of identity: What do these results mean about who I am? How do these results fit with the stories I\u2019ve long clung to that connected my past, my present and my future?Ever since Johnson received her disorienting DNA results, she wondered if her saliva sample might have been accidentally mislabeled or she had been sent someone else\u2019s results. But it turns out that the company that analyzed her DNA focuses on forensic genetics and legal paternity tests, which evaluate only a few segments of DNA, not the hundreds of thousands used by most ancestry-testing companies. (Foeman used this company for a minority of her research.) So this summer, when The New York Times offered to buy Johnson ancestry tests from more mainstream companies, AncestryDNA and 23andMe, she eagerly agreed.Their tests determine ethnicity by analyzing segments of customers\u2019 DNA that give clues to their ancient geographic origins. Five hundred to 1,000 years ago, before large-scale transcontinental migration, people who lived in the same region had similar genetics. Scientists have been able to identify distinct patterns of genetic variation among people whose ancestors hail from the same lands, which is easiest to do with populations that were geographically isolated, like Finns and Filipinos, or were insular, like Ashkenazi Jews. Ideally, ancestry-testing companies would compare customers\u2019 DNA to that of people from premigration days. But given that impossibility, the companies use an imperfect proxy: people alive today who have a deep family tree in a particular geographic area, and sometimes a paper trail to prove it. Those people\u2019s DNA becomes the company\u2019s reference data set for that geographic area. When a segment of your DNA closely matches the data for that location, the company assigns you that ancestry. The more segments on your genome that match that genetic pattern, the larger your estimated percentage will be for that ancestry.The larger the reference data set for any particular corner of the world, the better the resolution will be: suggesting that your ancestors aren\u2019t, say, just from Europe but from Northwestern Europe, or more specifically from Ireland and Scotland. Each testing company builds its own reference data set, drawn primarily from its own customers, and each company also creates its own algorithm for assigning heritage. In other words, customers\u2019 results are based on inferences and are merely an estimate, often a very rough one \u2014 something many test takers don\u2019t realize and testing companies play down.Still, Johnson, now 65, hoped the new tests would conclude that her genes aligned with who she believed herself to be. In early August, with the kits in hand, she walked around her apartment, trying to work up enough saliva to fill the little collection tubes. Afterward, Johnson was both eager for quick results and hesitant about what they might say. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if the results are the same as they were before, I am still a black woman.\u201dWeeks later, her AncestryDNA report was posted. It marked more than a third of her ancestry as \u201clow confidence,\u201d meaning it couldn\u2019t establish its ethnicity because her DNA didn\u2019t sufficiently match the company\u2019s reference data sets. She was disappointed. It\u2019s a common experience for customers with non-European ancestry, because Africa and Asia are underrepresented in many companies\u2019 data sets, in part because most of their customers \u2014 the building blocks of their reference set \u2014 are of European descent. Many companies are trying to remedy that by seeking DNA from people in regions underrepresented in the data set.The rest of Johnson\u2019s ethnicity, AncestryDNA said, broke down this way: 21 percent Europe South (but no percentage from Italy), 11 percent Caucasus, 10 percent Benin/Togo, 9 percent Mali, 8 percent Ivory Coast/Ghana and 6 percent Europe West. As Johnson heard the results, she teared up. \u201cI\u2019m so relieved to see the African part, that I really am a black woman.\u201d (Neither AncestryDNA nor 23andMe includes a \u201cHispanic\u201d category, because they, like most companies that search for heritage, focus on ancestry before Europeans and Africans ever arrived at what\u2019s now called the Americas.)I wondered how certain AncestryDNA was about Johnson\u2019s percentages, which wasn\u2019t readily apparent on the site. I called customer service and asked several representatives where on the website I could find the company\u2019s confidence level. One said that any percentage not marked \u201clow confidence\u201d was 100 percent certain. Another said each percentage was 99 percent certain. When I asked that representative to check with a supervisor, she did, then returned to tell me that the company\u2019s certainty was 99.7 percent. Those answers were confusing, because behind each of Johnson\u2019s percentages was a range from which each ancestry point was drawn. For example, when we clicked on Johnson\u2019s Benin/Togo segment, which had been assigned 10 percent of her ancestry, the site showed that the percentage of her DNA from those nations could be as low as zero and as high as 21. In fact, every one of her African links showed a range that started with zero, while her Europe South\u2019s percent had a range of 9 to 33. Even the customer-service representative agreed that it was hard to fathom that the company could be so certain about the percentage when the range behind it ran to zero, which it did in four of the six geographic findings on Johnson\u2019s report. Johnson and I asked if someone higher up could call us with better answers; the representative amiably said she would put in our request and assured us that the call would come within a few hours. None ever did.AncestryDNA\u2019s chief scientific officer, Catherine Ball, later told me that the company doesn\u2019t provide a confidence level for each percentage on its personalized report for users, but it is 95 percent certain that the range behind each percentage is accurate. In other words, AncestryDNA was 95 percent confident that 9 to 33 percent of Johnson\u2019s ancestry was from Europe South, that 4 to 16 percent was from Caucasus and that 0 to 58 percent was from Africa. And because that \u201ccertainty\u201d is based on the reference data set and the algorithm the company uses, even that certitude evaporates if the data set or algorithm changes. \u201cThere is no ground truth here,\u201d Ball said, \u201cno \u2018I guarantee that you are 22.674 percent Italian!\u2019 These are all just statistical estimates. Every statistic has a lot of science and math behind it, and a lot of imperfection and room for improvement too.\u201dIn September, AncestryDNA updated its reference databases and changed its algorithm, and overnight, Johnson\u2019s ancestry report was completely different. Although all of her African percentages still showed that the figures could be as low as zero, this time, instead of being identified as 27 percent African, she was now 45 percent African, primarily from Cameroon, Congo and the Southern Bantu Peoples. And though the previous version showed no percentage or range for Italy, the new version said she was 49 percent Italian, with a range of just 48 to 51 percent. And that 95 percent certainty about ancestry from Caucasus? Gone. Caucasus doesn\u2019t even show up on the updated report.Johnson\u2019s 23andMe results, on the other hand, said that she was 43.4 percent sub-Saharan African, 36.9 percent European (just over half of which was Italian), 12.8 percent Western Asian, 2.7 percent East Asian and Native American and 1.8 percent a combination of Western Asian and North African. The rest was unassigned. The company does not provide ranges, but it does give a confidence level for its result.The ancestry-composition report from 23andMe, with each figure to the tenth of a percent, suggests a high level of precision, but the default conclusions are remarkably speculative; they\u2019re only at the 50 percent confidence level, meaning that the ancestry composition you see on your report is as likely to be not true as true. If you dig down enough \u2014 I couldn\u2019t figure out how, so I called for instructions \u2014 you can increase the confidence level to 90 percent (meaning your geographic assignments are 90 percent likely to reflect your true ancestry, based on the company\u2019s data set and algorithm), though the figures locked at the top of the main page remain at 50 percent. At the 90 percent confidence level, 38 percent of Johnson\u2019s ancestry was unassigned (compared with 2 percent at the 50 percent level). Her Italian ancestry dropped to 7.9 percent, from the 19.6 percent Italian that showed on her main page, and the specificity of her African heritage disappeared.I asked Scott Hadly, a 23andMe spokesman, why the default is set at the 50 percent level, given that it\u2019s so uncertain. \u201cPeople want really specific information, down to which county in England they\u2019re from. We would rather be more general in the results, than to give specific results that may not be accurate. So we try to give results that are interesting to them, which they can use to explore, to see if it tells them something informative. We\u2019re not necessarily telling them, \u2018This is what you are.\u2019 We\u2019re saying, \u2018This is what the DNA says.\u2019\u2009\u201dAnd yet, in a matter of weeks, Johnson\u2019s African roots had bounced from 27 percent to 45 percent African \u2014 and her Italian roots had been reported as 0 percent, 49 percent and 20 percent. Through it all, of course, Johnson\u2019s true ancestry, whatever it actually is, never changed.Ethnicity is not the only area in which personal genomic testing companies have been criticized for insufficient transparency; public-health and consumer advocates have raised serious concerns about how companies use the avalanche of genetic data they\u2019ve collected from their customers. The data haul is a potential gold mine for biotech firms, insurance companies, marketers, data brokers, law enforcement and, most of all, pharmaceutical companies. Drug companies have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into at-home-DNA-test companies worldwide, banking on all that genetic data, linked to vast crowdsourcing on individuals\u2019 physical and psychological disorders, to slash the time and cost of developing new treatments and drugs, including ones tailored to an individual\u2019s unique genetic makeup. Scientists have already made incredible progress, building on the advances by the Human Genome Project. Data from 23andMe customers has revealed spots on the genome that are linked to depression, Parkinson\u2019s, lupus, inflammatory-bowel disease, allergies and some cancers, prompting Fast Company to name the business the second Most Innovative Health Company this year.But critics say the business model that led to that heap of data is worrisome, putting at risk the privacy of the most precise identifier a person has \u2014 a concern that intensified after studies showed that it\u2019s possible to reidentify individuals from anonymized genetic databases. In July, hackles were raised again when the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline invested $300 million in 23andMe and gained exclusive rights to its customers\u2019 data. Much of the jump in DNA-test sales this past year or two has been a result of deeply discounted prices (they now cost about $99) and aggressive marketing, as companies try to lure evermore people to give up their personal genetic code. Last year on Black Friday, 23andMe\u2019s discounted test was one of Amazon\u2019s five best sellers; that same weekend, AncestryDNA reportedly sold a whopping 1.5 million kits. In 2017, in a consumer guide to DNA ancestry testing, the Council for Responsible Genetics wrote, \u201cThese come-ons promise more than they can deliver, ignoring problems with accuracy while obscuring a business model in which customers pay for the privilege of giving away valuable information to venture capitalists who expect it will make them very, very rich.\u201dIn the last few years, just a few miles away from Sigrid Johnson, another woman\u2019s origin story was unfolding. Her name is June Smith. Like Johnson, Smith had no idea as a child that the parents who were raising her weren\u2019t the ones who created her. Smith\u2019s neighbors knew that the 6-day-old baby who had suddenly appeared in the Smith house wasn\u2019t born to the Smiths, and they also understood that fact was meant to remain private. So for years, neighbors knew more about Smith\u2019s origins than she herself did. In their solidly black neighborhood in South Philadelphia, Smith stood out. Her skin was lighter than most, and her hair was wavy and long, \u201clike a white girl\u2019s,\u201d she said. Though she had some good friends, she was bullied by others. \u201cAutomatically, I was a target, because darker people thought that a lighter-colored person is more privileged,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t black enough.\u201dLike Johnson, Smith learned startling news about herself when she was 16, when a neighborhood friend let slip that Smith\u2019s parents weren\u2019t her \u201creal\u201d parents. Smith marched inside to interrogate her mother, who chided her for asking such crazy questions. Eventually her parents confessed. They described a white Italian woman who handed over her 6-day-old infant after explaining that the father was black and adding: \u201cI can\u2019t take that baby home. If I do, they\u2019ll kill her.\u201d Smith told me: \u201cI never knew if my mom added that last part, but I know she never wanted me to know that woman, so she may have said it to deter me. Then again, it was part of that era. Either way, I grew up with a lot of animosity toward that white woman, the idea that she didn\u2019t want me just because I was black.\u201dSmith\u2019s mother showed June her original birth certificate. It said she was Gail Moser. The news shook Smith\u2019s understanding of who she was. The search for identity that\u2019s so central to adolescence took on extra urgency. For starters, she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine a white woman gave birth to me.\u201d So Smith did what she could to reconcile the two versions of her life. Her high school was predominantly white and disproportionately Italian-American, so \u201cI began hanging out with white kids and started acting and dressing like a punk rocker, because I thought that\u2019s what white kids did. I went through a total change. I told the white kids I was half Italian. I actually felt they were more accepting of me than my black peers were.\u201dSmith never denied she was black, but she didn\u2019t embrace it either, once she found out she was half white. It wasn\u2019t until she was in her 30s, as her self-esteem solidified, that she welcomed back her black identity. \u201cI saw how society treated people of color, and I thought, You know, black people raised me. And so I became more conscious that, culturally, that\u2019s who I am.\u201d Had her birth mother raised her, she said, \u201cI\u2019d probably consider myself white, because I would have grown up in that Italian home. I would have grown up with Italian ways, Italian foods, Italian whatever. But because of how I was raised, African-American, this is who I am. And I accept that, and I\u2019m proud of it.\u201dAlthough her cultural identity was clear by then, she still yearned to know about her biological family. She wrote and self-published her autobiography in 2014. The last line says, \u201cI am the product of someone, but the reflection of no one.\u201dAncestryDNA and 23andMe give their users the option to have their DNA profile uploaded to see if any genetic relatives pop up. Johnson did so, curious but expecting little. AncestryDNA promptly revealed two women whose DNA indicated that they were \u201cclose family,\u201d which Johnson thought meant they were her first cousins. She reached out to them. One never responded. The other was June Smith.In late August, Johnson and Smith connected by phone. After introducing themselves, Smith asked Johnson if she was adopted. Johnson said yes. Smith asked, \u201cWas your biological mother Ann D\u2019Amico?\u201d Johnson was startled that this stranger would know such a thing. Smith then asked what her birth name was. When Johnson said, \u201cJoan Moser,\u201d Smith started to cry. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for Joan Moser \u2014 for you \u2014 all these years.\u201dEach knew she wasn\u2019t really a child of Eric Moser, D\u2019Amico\u2019s white husband, despite his name being on their birth certificates. These babies had black fathers, presumably two different men, given that Johnson and Smith\u2019s DNA results indicate that they are half siblings, not full ones.Smith told Johnson that she discovered her first Moser connection in 2015: a half sister named Nancy Moser, who told her that D\u2019Amico had six white children, all of whom D\u2019Amico raised. Moser said that their parents had died, and that on D\u2019Amico\u2019s deathbed, their mother conceded that she had \u201cother children\u201d and added, \u201cI wonder if they made it. ... \u201dSmith had been swiftly enfolded into the Moser family, a comforting but also confusing experience. The siblings had told her she wasn\u2019t the only biracial child. They told her that three years before Smith\u2019s birth \u2014 when at least some of D\u2019Amico\u2019s children were already in grade school \u2014 D\u2019Amico gave birth to a baby she named Joan. After two or three months, according to Moser lore, someone told D\u2019Amico\u2019s white husband that Joan, whose skin was darker than her siblings\u2019, couldn\u2019t be his child: She was black, so she had to go.Smith described how welcoming the Moser siblings had been and how the eldest told her she thought Smith might have a twin sister, though she has never shown up on Smith\u2019s AncestryDNA page. But a few years back, AncestryDNA linked Smith to a niece whose deceased father, Thomas, was another biracial child of Ann D\u2019Amico. The Mosers welcomed his family too.After Smith and Johnson talked, Smith alerted the Moser siblings that Joan Moser was alive and well. Johnson was flooded with warm texts, phone calls and Facebook messages from the Moser family. \u201cAll at once,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI got: \u2018I\u2019m your brother!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m your sister!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m your cousin!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m your sister\u2019s daughter!\u2019\u2009\u201d Though they were total strangers, they embraced her as they had Smith, writing: \u201cHi honey. I\u2019m one of your sisters. ... Love you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad to know you\u2019re in our family now.\u201d And \u201cI accept you no matter what color you are and I can\u2019t wait to meet you. Just remember you are accepted into our family because you are family, and we love you.\u201d When Johnson saw a photo of Thomas, she was stunned by how much he looked like her son, Ron. That family resemblance made the connection all the more real.\u201cIt all hit me real hard,\u201d Johnson told me. \u201cI cried and boohooed like a baby.\u201d She went from being an only child to a woman with a slew of siblings, nieces and nephews. After two days packed with catching up on 65 years of family, Johnson stopped answering calls and reading texts. Overwhelmed, she went to church to calm her soul and express her gratitude. And then she dove right back in with her new-old clan.Since then, she still sometimes feels dizzy as she tries to replace a long-familiar identity with a welcome but much more complicated one. She marvels that for all those decades as a \u201csingle child,\u201d she had siblings galore, living only a few miles away, and she never knew it. One of them even looked like her and had been told the same lie about her origins, and then the same gut-wrenching truth. Smith so deeply understood Johnson\u2019s experience, because she had lived it herself, as a sister would. A real sister. Finally. Those realities were far more mind-bending than any of the ancestry findings, with their wildly different percentages and ephemeral certainties.Johnson and Smith talk two or three times every day. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck on each other,\u201d Johnson said.She sighed. \u201cYou turn 65, take a DNA test and find out your whole life is a lot different than you ever thought it was.\u201dAll source photographs by Jessica Tang for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Economy and the Trump Rump", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy we went from regional divide to political chasm.Opinion ColumnistBut not everyone was in the running. From the beginning, Amazon specified that it would put the new facility only in a Democratic congressional district.Over the past generation, America\u2019s regions have experienced a profound economic divergence. Rich metropolitan areas have gotten even richer, attracting ever more of the nation\u2019s fastest growing industries. Meanwhile, small towns and rural areas have been bypassed, forming a sort of economic rump left behind by the knowledge economy.Amazon\u2019s headquarters criteria perfectly illustrate the forces behind that divergence. Businesses in the new economy want access to large pools of highly educated workers, which can be found only in big, rich metropolitan areas. And the location decisions of companies like Amazon draw even more high-skill workers to those areas.In other words, there\u2019s a cumulative, self-reinforcing process at work that is, in effect, dividing America into two economies. And this economic division is reflected in political division.In 2016, of course, the parts of America that are being left behind voted heavily for Donald Trump. News organizations responded with many, many, many profiles of rural Trump supporters sitting in diners.But this was, it turns out, fighting the last war. Trumpism turned America\u2019s lagging regions solid red, but the backlash against Trumpism has turned its growing regions solid blue. Some of the reporters interviewing guys in diners should have been talking to college-educated women in places like California\u2019s Orange County, a former ultraconservative stronghold that, come January, will be represented in Congress entirely by Democrats.Why have lagging regions turned right while successful regions turned left? It doesn\u2019t seem to be about economic self-interest. True, Trump promised to bring back traditional jobs in manufacturing and coal mining \u2014 but that promise was never credible. And the orthodox Republican policy agenda of cutting taxes and shrinking social programs, which is basically what Trump is following in practice, actually hurts lagging regions, which depend a lot on things like food stamps and disability payments, much more than it hurts successful areas.Can this chasm be bridged? Honestly, I doubt it.But restoring these regions\u2019 dynamism is much harder, because it means swimming against a powerful economic tide.So the bitter division we see in America \u2014 the ugliness infecting our politics \u2014 may have deep economic roots, and there may be no practical way to make it go away.America, then, is a divided nation, and is likely to stay that way for a while. But the better angels of our nature can still prevail.An earlier version of this column misstated the title of a new book analyzing the 2016 election. It is \"Identity Crisis,\" not \"Identity Politics.\"Advertisement"}

Unlike many big American companies, Amazon is not squandering its profits on stock buybacks.What is it that makes Amazon different from other large companies?The web services division has transformed Amazon into an enormously profitable company. Amazon incurred an annual loss of $241 million as recently as 2014, but in the first nine months of 2018, it had net income of $7 billion \u2014 more than double its $3 billion in profits for all of 2017.That makes it an outlier among big American companies. From 2013 to 2017, companies that were in the S.&.P. 500 index during that period gave away 98 percent of their profits to shareholders, with 56 percent as buybacks.The investment shows up in its work force. From 2014 to 2016, Amazon increased its United States employment of high-paid \u201cprofessionals,\u201d mainly software engineers, to 30,433 from 18,266. And it will be adding many more of those among the 50,000 people it will eventually employ at its new outposts in New York City and in Northern Virginia.The company should continue this strategy, making it a top priority to bring the pay of its low-paid employees closer to a middle-class standard of living. But by being different, and choosing to reinvest profits in the current \u201cfinancialized\u201d business environment, Amazon, and other large American companies, can make a difference for the tens of millions of low-paid workers who have thus far been left behind.William Lazonick, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, is president of the Academic-Industry Research Network.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Singles Day Sales Top $30 Billion. The Party May Not Last.", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 After 24 hours of frenzied buying and selling, and weeks of advertising and promotions before it, the Alibaba Group announced that its sales hit another titanic high on Singles Day, the Nov. 11 shopping festival that the Chinese e-commerce behemoth cooked up a decade ago.This time, as China\u2019s vast economy slows, the party was held with icebergs in sight from the deck.But all around China, gloom and uncertainty are the word.Meanwhile, some young Chinese shoppers seem less enthused this year about celebrating manic consumerism.Yang Sun, a 26-year-old from the northern city of Xi\u2019an, said that the Singles Day discounts were no longer good enough to persuade her to wait all year to buy the things she wanted. Wang Xin, 24, an engineer in Shanghai, said he had rediscovered the joys of shopping offline.\u201cSingles Day just doesn\u2019t hold that much appeal for me,\u201d Mr. Wang said.Asked about the current mood among Chinese consumers, Joseph C. Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, told reporters on Sunday that Alibaba should be understood in the context of the epochal rise of China\u2019s middle class.\u201cThat trend is not going to stop, trade war or no trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cAny kind of short-term economic effects, we believe, will be cyclical.\u201dAlibaba is not like Amazon in that it is not a retailer. It merely provides the digital shelves and aisles for other merchants to sell their goods. But in its relentless ambition, Alibaba may be Amazon\u2019s only global equal. Both companies want to fulfill their customers\u2019 every desire and need.The business case for all this empire-building, Alibaba says, is that the company\u2019s lakes of commercial data give it a leg up in anything that requires understanding customers or merchants.But Wall Street is still waiting for results, and has grown skeptical in the meantime of the costs of expanding into new areas. Alibaba\u2019s shares have lost nearly one-third of their value since June.Singles Day 2018 showed that Alibaba remains, if nothing else, China\u2019s king of hype. During the broadcast event, the M.C.s periodically encouraged people watching at home to open up their phones and check out the great deals. As acrobats with Cirque du Soleil twirled in midair, the logo of Kukahome, a Chinese furniture maker, shone brightly behind them.At one point, the performer Liu Wei rapped out the specs of a new model of Skoda sport utility vehicle.Anna Lin, a 25-year-old who works in finance in Shanghai, said she was feeling more lukewarm about the whole thing than in years past. Singles Day is now just one of many big shopping festivals each year, she said.Plus, Ms. Lin said, the Singles Day promotions have become increasingly baroque. This year, there were coupons for specific items and brands, coupons that were available only at certain times of day, and coupons that appeared randomly and could be grabbed only by playing a game. Gathering friends into a team could help you collect even more coupons.\u201cThat\u2019s too much work,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cIt also isn\u2019t worth it when you realize that after you\u2019ve done all that, all you\u2019ve got is 10 to 15 percent off, or even less.\u201d\u201cMy time is more valuable than that,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \u201cI honestly think all the math is a way to hide the fact that there isn\u2019t much of a discount.\u201dAlibaba does not lack for other methods of subtle persuasion on Singles Day. If you had opened your Taobao shopping app on Sunday, you would have seen how your spending that day ranked against that of other people in your area.The company\u2019s methods for ginning up excitement have come under scrutiny before. Two years ago, Alibaba said that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating it for the way it reports Singles Day sales. The company\u2019s preferred metric, gross merchandise value, is supposed to represent the amount of money that changes hands on its platforms. But there is no standardized way of calculating it.The company has since de-emphasized the number. But the episode illustrated the way that Alibaba sees itself \u2014 as a company that breaks the mold.Ever since Alibaba listed its shares in New York four years ago, the company has used a sense of manifest destiny to beguile investors, stock analysts and an eager news media. China was on the long road to middle-class prosperity, the company said, and Alibaba had the biggest tollbooth. A bet on Alibaba was a bet on China itself.Now, though, it is clear that Alibaba\u2019s privileged place in China\u2019s rise is not guaranteed.In takeout delivery, for instance, Alibaba is facing off against several wealthy rivals. It has made big bets that have struggled, including on the troubled bike-rental company Ofo.No one expects Alibaba to generate whopper Singles Day sales growth numbers every year for eternity. At some point, when growth starts decelerating quickly, the event could change, to focus on one week\u2019s sales instead of one day\u2019s, or on something else entirely.Alibaba\u2019s track record suggests that when the time comes, it will have no trouble pulling off another act of conjuring.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about Alibaba at all,\u201d said Steven Zhu, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm Pacific Epoch. \u201cThese guys are really good at creating things from nothing.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Election Showed a Divided Country. Investors Can Live With That.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks jumped on Wednesday, extending a recovery from the sharp sell-off in October with broad-based gains, after midterm elections that will split control of the United States government between both major parties.The S&P 500 rose 2.1 percent, led by giant technology companies including Amazon, Apple and Google. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 2.6 percent, its strongest gain this month.Stock in consumer discretionary companies climbed 3.1 percent, in a sign of growing optimism that President Trump, stung by his party\u2019s loss of the House of Representatives, could seek a win by striking a trade bargain with China at the Group of 20 summit meeting this month. Shares of Wynn Resorts, the casino company with significant business in China, jumped 3.9 percent.After weeks of uncertainty heading into the election, investors seemed to focus again on the strong fundamentals for American businesses, helping fuel the gains on Wednesday.In the voting on Tuesday, Democrats secured control of the House in the next Congress, while the Republicans padded their majority in the Senate. A divided government is conventionally thought of as good for stock investors, because it means lawmakers are unlikely to produce sweeping policy changes.\u201cInvestors can basically refocus their mental energy away from the macro and back to the micro, where earnings are really good and valuations are really reasonable,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at the institutional brokerage BTIG.Industrial shares rose, bolstered by renewed hope for a bipartisan infrastructure-spending bill. The construction machinery maker Caterpillar, which also has large exposure to China, rose 4.5 percent.Health care shares rallied on the prospect that major health legislation is much less likely. Managed care companies that sell contract Medicaid services to state governments and insurance products on health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act rose sharply.\u201cYou worry less about large sweeping regulatory change,\u201d said Zack Sopcak, an equity analyst covering managed care companies for Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt means a repeat of \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 is off the table,\u201d he added, referring to the potential for a wholesale replacement of the law, commonly known as Obamacare.After an ugly sell-off in October, investors appear to have regained their appetite for stocks. The S&P 500 has risen in four of the first five trading days of November. The 2.1 percent gain on Wednesday for the broad index of large companies was its third-best showing this year.That turn of events reflects a dizzying swing in market sentiment. As recently as Oct. 29, the market was down more than 1 percent for the year after a rout that started in September had vaporized nearly 10 percent in gains.At that time, investors saw ubiquitous threats to the nearly decade-long rally for stocks. The potential pitfalls included rising interest rates, climbing commodity and wage costs, signs of slowing growth in China and Europe and the tariff war between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies.Most of the issues remain unresolved, but the markets have found their footing and trading seemed to suggest investors see reasons for optimism now that the elections have concluded.Equity investors are now sitting on gains of more than 5 percent for the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s New York Home Qualifies as \u2018Distressed\u2019 Under Federal Tax Law", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are wine bars and a cycling studio along the riverfront in Long Island City, among gleaming high-rise apartment buildings with views of Midtown Manhattan. The soon-to-open library branch is a modern art cube of concrete, the median income is $138,000 a year, and America\u2019s hottest online retailer is about to move in.In the eyes of the federal government, the census tract that will house Amazon\u2019s new headquarters in New York is an \u201copportunity zone,\u201d eligible for tax credits meant to spur investment in low-income communities.[Do you live or work near Amazon\u2019s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]That tax break was pitched as a benefit for distressed communities. But critics fear it could primarily help wealthy investors and speed gentrification in parts of the United States that were already likely to draw investment.Investors who pour unrealized capital gains into funds that invest in real estate or other assets that qualify for opportunity zone status can essentially avoid as much as 15 percent of the taxes they would have owed on their investment gains. If they hold an investment in an opportunity zone for more than a decade, they avoid all taxes on any gains that the investment produces.The waterfront Long Island City zone, in contrast, embodies what critics have worried might happen when place-based tax benefits extend to investment in areas that most Americans would not consider impoverished.The program\u2019s architects say that there are few tracts nationwide like the ones surrounding Amazon\u2019s new home, and that Long Island City will not divert investment from more distressed areas that lack a new high-tech tenant.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that the Long Island City tract is an outlier,\u201d said John Lettieri, president of the Economic Innovation Group, a Washington think tank that helped advocate the creation of opportunity zones. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that Amazon, and this HQ2 thing, is an outlier. I don\u2019t think those are the cases that are going to define the national experience for opportunity zones.\u201dState governors selected the zones from a list of eligible census tracts, based on a formula used to calculate eligibility for another federal effort to aid struggling areas, the longstanding New Markets Tax Credit. Governors were allowed to designate one-quarter of eligible areas as opportunity zones. Their designations were approved by the Treasury Department.But the relatively broad criteria allowed governors to choose some low-poverty, higher-income, rapidly developing areas adjacent to low-income zones. They constitute about 200 of the nearly 8,800 zones that Treasury approved, including the waterfront area that Amazon has chosen in Long Island City.Brookings estimated that 11 percent of the final opportunity zones have lower poverty rates than the national average. A third of the zones in Washington, D.C., for instance, are already gentrifying quickly, according to estimates by the Urban Institute. Among the states, New York has the highest share of gentrifying areas, with 13 percent of its zones in areas that are beginning to prosper.Areas like Long Island City \u201care already getting a lot of capital,\u201d said Brett Theodos, a principal research associate in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute. \u201cThis use case was allowed from the beginning. Whether that\u2019s a good use of public subsidies is another question.\u201dThe riverfront tract in Long Island City scored a 9 on that investment scale, and was flagged for gentrification.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Brooklyn Army Terminal: New York\u2019s Next Manufacturing Hub?", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "The massive, 100-year-old industrial space in Sunset Park could have lured more tech start-ups, but instead its focus is on New Yorkers who make things.Supported byThe Brooklyn Army Terminal was built for war, and during World War II, it was the largest military supply base in the country, with its own railroad line and police and fire departments along what today is the Sunset Park waterfront.But on a Saturday afternoon in September, children lined up for ice cream on the terminal steps. A little girl in a pink shirt reached for what appeared to be her fourth free sample of a chocolate-flavored waffle cone. Down by the ferry landing, two women sat on a wide platform that wrapped around a tree, sharing hummus and pita from one of the food trucks set up for the day. And at the parking lot at 58th Street and Second Avenue, which had been cleared to make a dance floor and outdoor venue for the day, couples and families waited for the rapper Busta Rhymes to take the stage later that evening.The daylong event, celebrating the terminal\u2019s 100th birthday, was part of an ongoing city effort to take this massive relic and retool it for the 21st century.But in this case, the city, which owns the terminal, is not transforming the massive structure into a tech jobs hub; it\u2019s leaving Amazon to do that in Queens. In Brooklyn, something arguably much more revolutionary is developing: a manufacturing hub.In May, the city finished a $115 million renovation of part of the complex \u2014 replacing windows and elevators, remediating mold and asbestos, and making landscaping improvements like the new waterfront seating, to attract entrepreneurs.This is not the first time this sprawling complex, designed by Cass Gilbert, an architect better known for designing the Woolworth Building, has been reimagined. During Prohibition, the federal government stored crates of seized alcohol, with workers dumping the contents into the harbor. In 1958, crowds of fans and news photographers gathered to watch Elvis Presley deploy to Germany from here.And in 1967, the United States Postal Service set up a temporary facility at the terminal after a fire damaged a Chelsea post office. By the time the city bought the terminal in 1981, however, it was a dilapidated behemoth. Its revival, a project marked by decades, not years, has cost around $300 million.At four million square feet, the Brooklyn Army Terminal is much, much larger than the Empire State Building. It\u2019s so big that trains once pulled into the central atrium of one building, where cranes hoisted goods up to the jutting concrete balconies. In this complex \u2014 built for an era when the Brooklyn waterfront was a bustling industrial center with 20,000 workers \u2014 the city sees an incubator for today\u2019s manufacturers, said James Patchett, the president of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation, which operates the terminal.Currently, 3,800 people are employed at 100 companies there. They make goods like eyeglasses, sweaters, HVAC parts, pasta sauce and salad dressing. The city hopes to add another 1,000 jobs once the renovated space is fully leased.\u201cWe can bring the waterfront back to its former glory with tens of thousands of people working there in a modern, industrial way,\u201d Mr. Patchett said, referring to the revival of the larger waterfront area all the way up to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, next to Vinegar Hill.One solution for the terminal may have been to encourage Amazon to consider moving there. After all, its surrounding area is much less congested than Long Island City. A number of Sunset Park developers, including nearby Industry City, about 22 blocks north of the terminal, did try to bring Amazon to the neighborhood.But the Brooklyn Army Terminal never became a contender because it did not meet Amazon\u2019s criteria. \u201cUltimately, Amazon was looking for 500,000 square feet of existing commercial office space\u201d that would be move-in ready by 2019, wrote Ryan Birchmeier, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation, in an email, while emphasizing that the city was committed to keeping the terminal as a place for industrial jobs.Manufacturing is not the most obvious choice in 2018. The challenges for keeping the industry afloat in the city are daunting. Between 1992 and 2017, the city lost 152,400 manufacturing jobs, according to the New York State Department of Labor. Today, only 72,300 remain.New York companies that haven\u2019t left the country for cheaper labor overseas are lured across the Hudson River to New Jersey, where operating costs are substantially cheaper and ports and highways are easily accessible. The asking rent for manufacturing space in Hudson County, N.J., for example, was $7.06 per square foot in July, compared with $22.20 per square foot in Brooklyn, according to Costar Group, a commercial real estate research firm.Even for those willing to pay a premium to stay in Brooklyn, the space just isn\u2019t there. The vacancy rate for manufacturing space in Brooklyn was 4.6 percent in July, according to CoStar. But there\u2019s also a real desire, at least among the New York entrepreneurial class, to keep production local.\u201cThe days of the smokestack are gone, and they\u2019re not coming back,\u201d said Andrew Kimball, the chief executive of Industry City, who previously oversaw the redevelopment of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. \u201cBut there is this new kind of making that is happening, that is creating the same kind of pathways to employment that the old-school manufacturer jobs did 50 or 75 years ago.\u201d\u201cI got to the point where I said, the city doesn\u2019t have the infrastructure for this kind of business,\u201d he said. He considered relocating the company to the Hudson Valley, but ultimately rejected the idea. \u201cIt would lose the essence of made in New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cI was born here, and that\u2019s part of the whole aura of the story.\u201dSo he kept looking and found places that lacked running water, or enough electricity to power the heavy equipment. He and his business partner almost settled on a space in the basement of a residential building in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The landlord took them up to the first floor apartment and told the tenant there that he would need to cut a hole in the floor to drop the heavy machinery through it. \u201cThe guy was unfazed,\u201d Mr. Masci said. \u201cI would have done it, except for the fact that when I wanted to get it out I wouldn\u2019t be able to.\u201dSo, in 2015, when 1,800 square feet became available in the Brooklyn Army Terminal, Lowercase moved in, opening for business in early 2017.\u201cSome days we don\u2019t even turn the lights on, the light is so nice,\u201d said Kristine Tonkonow, who owns the company with her parents. Ms. Tonkonow said that the company\u2019s previous factory, in the former Pfizer Building in South Williamsburg, was less than half the size, but cost more than twice as much per square foot.To attract tenants like Lowercase and the Konnery, the city sets rent below market rate, asking between $15 and $25 per square foot, depending on the size and condition of the space. Some of the 72,000-square-foot floors have been subdivided.The city is not renewing leases for tenants that primarily used the terminal for warehousing and distributing goods. Those tenants are being replaced with ones that promise to bring jobs and actually make things. The median employee salary at the Brooklyn Army Terminal ranges from $42,000 to $75,000 a year, according to the Economic Development Corporation.\u201cThese are really important, accessible, middle-class jobs for New Yorkers,\u201d said Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, an urban research group.At this point, renovations on the terminal are 92 percent finished. Renovating a decaying building is a long process. The latest phase, which began in 2015, restored 500,000 square feet spread over seven floors in one building. The city also restored an annex building for food manufacturing. Two NYC Ferry routes, the Rockaway and South Brooklyn, now stop at the terminal. In July, the city released a request for proposals to build a distribution center on an existing parking lot.Despite the investments, failure still happens. The city spent $5.2 million renovating 20,500 square feet to bring TechShop, a membership-based workshop and manufacturing studio, to the terminal in October, 2017. The next month, the California-based company liquidated, and the space has been vacant ever since.\u201cWe are going to see manufacturers fail,\u201d said Mr. Bowles, of the Center for an Urban Future. \u201c The global competition is intense. But at the same time, I feel more optimistic about manufacturing today, more than at any time in a while.\u201d\u201cOn a map, it looks like it\u2019s five million miles away,\u201d said Mr. Masci of Lowercase, who has struggled to convince customers to come to the factory for demonstrations and showings. \u201cIt feels really far and isolated.\u201dMr. Masci said the city tried to bring food trucks out to the property, but without enough foot traffic, they didn\u2019t last long. By comparison, Industry City has a tenant lounge with a coffee bar and billiard table, a tenant gym, and a five-acre courtyard where tenants can mingle.But for smaller manufacturers looking to grow, the bells and whistles take a back seat to affordable rent and plenty of space.\u201cIt\u2019s more and more difficult for those types of companies to operate in many neighborhoods in New York. Where can you move your truck around or will you be ticketed? How do you move goods?\u201d asked Ben Margolis, the executive director of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, which runs a job placement center in the terminal. \u201cTo have a place in New York that\u2019s a dedicated workplace is just essential.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Amazon Chose the Wrong Locations for Its HQ2", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseSo, the Amazon bragging rights go to New York City and the Washington, D.C., area. Why do I feel a little deflated?Long Island City, the Queens neighborhood that Amazon picked, will become a high-tech Brooklyn, with a bevy of new farm-to-table restaurants, craft cocktail watering holes and, naturally, the artisanal coffee roasters already ubiquitous in Seattle, all just a subway stop from Manhattan.True, there may be more congestion, higher condo prices and other unwanted side effects, but a metropolitan area the size of New York shouldn\u2019t have any trouble absorbing an additional 25,000 people.And I guess that\u2019s the source of my disappointment: For all the transformative potential of Amazon\u2019s nationwide \u201cHQ2\u201d competition, neither New York City nor Washington (nor, to be precise, the Northern Virginia neighborhoods that are being rechristened National Landing) needed Amazon. They\u2019re already thriving and bustling with affluent, well-educated millennials.As Tom Stringer, head of site selection for the business consulting firm BDO, told me this week, Amazon\u2019s choice \u201conly reaffirms and cements the idea that we have two countries right now, the coasts and the interior.\u201dEven a large, sophisticated Midwestern city like Chicago would at least have been a nod toward America\u2019s heartland.\u201cThere are smaller cities in this country that are incredible places to live,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cThey\u2019re great places to raise families, they\u2019re affordable, and they\u2019re fun.\u201dIn its initial request for proposals, Amazon emphasized many of those qualities, ranking costs second on its list of priorities. That led pundits to eliminate New York, San Francisco, Boston and Washington, all of them among the most expensive places to live or do business, according to KPMG\u2019s annual Competitive Alternatives survey.Among Amazon\u2019s finalists, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Chicago had some of the lowest costs.Of course, the potentially multibillion-dollar tax incentives that New York and Northern Virginia are lavishing on Amazon help compensate for the locations\u2019 high costs. But presumably other cities dangled big tax breaks, too.\u201cLabor force\u201d ranked third on Amazon\u2019s list of criteria, but in the end, it seemed to be determinative. It was the first thing that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, mentioned when he announced the winners: \u201cThese two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come.\u201dThat, in part, reflects the same self-reinforcing tendencies that are driving creative, well-educated workers to the two coasts, with just a handful of high-tech, hipster enclaves (like Austin, Tex., and Denver, two Amazon finalists) in between.\u201cThere\u2019s a herding instinct,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cPeople in creative fields \u2014 medical research and technology, law, financial services \u2014 they all want to be in the same mix. That\u2019s what makes them good. And for companies, their value-added quotient is rare, and it\u2019s what everybody wants.\u201dIt\u2019s not Amazon\u2019s obligation to help heal the growing divide between red and blue America. In holding the competition, it generated tremendous publicity, mostly favorable, and attracted enormous financial incentives, all of which will benefit Amazon\u2019s shareholders. At the same time, the company, and Mr. Bezos in particular, might have considered that Amazon\u2019s success has hollowed out aging downtowns and shopping malls across America, and that having at least one headquarters away from the coasts might have generated considerable political good will.So where does that leave the heartland?And who knows: The truly creative may want to break from the herd and do something original \u2014 like moving to St. Louis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s Polarizing Visions", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "FeatureThe Greek director has drawn acclaim \u2014 but also intense backlash \u2014 for his primal depiction of contemporary life.Supported by\u201cIt made me wonder if I might want to have a place of my own like that someday,\u201d he told me over breakfast the morning after his latest film, the English-language period drama \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d opened this year\u2019s New York Film Festival. \u201cSomeplace to create and be alone. An island where writers could come to work on scripts and my editor could come to finish our projects.\u201d If you had a place like that, I pointed out, people might want to visit it someday too. They might want to touch the director\u2019s belongings, take photographs of the director\u2019s notes, go on a Lanthimos Safari. The thought made him visibly uncomfortable. \u201cProbably safer not to have anyplace, actually,\u201d he said with a slight shrug.A boatload of cinephile tourists, a remote and isolated location and the looming presence of an unseen authority \u2014 the combination is odd and unsettling enough to form the premise for one of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s own films. Famously cryptic and publicity-shy, Lanthimos is known for creating darkly surreal and uneasily hilarious cinematic worlds that reflect our own back to us in a distorted light. \u201cDogtooth\u201d (2009), made in Greece on a shoestring budget and subsequently nominated for a best foreign-language film Oscar, depicts life on an isolated family estate, where three adult children live under the cultlike control of their parents, who teach them that the airplanes passing overhead are actually tiny plastic toys and that no child is old enough to leave home until their upper incisor (or \u201cdogtooth\u201d) falls out on its own. Desperate to escape, the eldest daughter knocks her own tooth out with a dumbbell in their brightly lit bourgeois bathroom. In his first English-language film, \u201cThe Lobster\u201d (2015), a man whose marriage has recently ended is sent to a countryside hotel, where he must find a new partner within 45 days or be transformed into the animal of his choosing. When the man breaks free to join a ragtag resistance movement in the forest surrounding the hotel, he discovers that this new community\u2019s rules are different but no less draconian: He can live among them for as long as he likes, but any romantic or sexual activity is subject to grisly punishment. In \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d his new film, two women vie for the affections of an impressionable, mercurial Queen Anne, well aware that losing her favor would put an end to their ambitions of power, status, even survival. Each of his films foreground the claustrophobia of the civilized and an almost primordial struggle to survive within its confines.Ingmar Bergman might well have recognized the deep curiosity that drives these films: Like Bergman, Lanthimos is fascinated by the drive for control \u2014 in both its mundanities and extremes \u2014 and by the inscrutability of human behavior. But if Bergman\u2019s work elevates these struggles to the realm of the metaphysical, Lanthimos\u2019s approach is less lofty, ballasted by blood and grit. An ordinary toaster becomes a device for punishment; a woman is ferried to an ophthalmologist\u2019s office in order to be blinded for her transgressions against the community. \u201cAll our stories begin with observations, situations that already \u2014 according to us \u2014 exist,\u201d Efthimis Filippou, a Greek playwright and co-writer on four Lanthimos films, told me by email. \u201cWe take these situations and we exaggerate them, we make them bigger in order to describe more easily the core of our initial thought. The funny thing is that no matter how much we try to exaggerate things, real life is always far more excessive.\u201d From this contradiction emerges the compelling argument that something stranger, wilder and older than we know animates the norms we take for granted.This argument isn\u2019t always persuasive for viewers, who can find the purposeful alienation and oddness of his films off-putting. On Amazon, audience ratings for his titles average around two and a half stars, an uneasy compromise between heaps of one-star and five-star ratings. Some complain about the difficulty of connecting with his characters, the bleakness of his material and the lack of clear resolutions to his plots and emotions. One review of \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\u201d begins: \u201cThese people could not have seemed more foreign, more abnormal \u2014 nor more repellent \u2014 to me had they had three heads with entrails for hair.\u201d His films often fare better with professional critics, who regularly apply words like \u201cingenious\u201d and \u201cmasterpiece\u201d to his work and praise his deadpan wit. But Lanthimos detests the word \u201cdeadpan,\u201d which appears in almost every review of his work. \u201cWhat does it even mean?\u201d he asked me. \u201cAnytime people see an emotion that is not extremely emotional, they call it \u2018deadpan.\u2019\u2009\u201d He sounded a bit affronted as he said this. \u201cMost acting is very melodramatic,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you see in people.\u201dUntil 2011, Lanthimos had lived in Athens his entire life, raised by his mother, who died when he was 17, thrusting him into a new world to fend for himself. Though he already had a thirst for cinema and knew that he wanted to make films, he studied marketing and finance before dropping out of the university to go to film school. It was there that he found his way to others who were \u201ccrazy enough to be convinced to make a film in Greece.\u201d There was no real infrastructure for making films, he explained, only a bit of funding from the Greek Film Center that went to established directors. There were few models to look up to and few to hold a young filmmaker back.He made good money filming television commercials in the years before the financial crisis and put his time toward creative work \u2014 directing dance and theater performances and making films of his own, calling on friends to borrow their cars, their houses, their clothes. Creative partnerships formed by chance: He met his longtime collaborator Filippou in the halls of an advertising agency and it was during rehearsals for the director Athina Tsangari\u2019s second feature, \u201cAttenberg\u201d \u2014 a film that he co-produced and acted in \u2014 that he met Ariane, whom he would go on to marry and direct in two of his movies. \u201cThere are things to love about filmmaking in Greece,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople are generous: If you get along well with others, the people around you will give more than they might otherwise be willing to give, more than they\u2019re supposed to.\u201dMoving to England on the back of the success of \u201cDogtooth\u201d gave Lanthimos access to bigger budgets and internationally known stars like Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz \u2014 but in many ways, he has shaped his English-language productions to suit the spontaneous practices he developed in Greece, rather than remodeling himself to Hollywood\u2019s specifications. He likes to shoot with natural light, inviting the contingency of unplanned weather to enter his scenes, and he rarely makes use of the expensive cinematic lighting that productions order by default. \u201cI do walk outside and see the lighting people, the equipment just sitting around,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste of their time, of the film\u2019s money.\u201d He steers clear of movie makeup, preferring to let the \u201creal face\u201d of his actors show through, unadulterated, the hair unfussy and requiring little touch-up work. One consequence of these decisions is that his sets are unusually quiet and intimate, and without setting up lights or pausing to reapply makeup, he explains, they are able to get much more of the actual work done. \u201cWe can do the scene over and over again, immediately, nobody has to stand around waiting. And the actors love it.\u201dThe atmosphere he creates has more in common with an experimental theater troupe than a typical multimillion-dollar movie set. Lanthimos works to bring an actor\u2019s instincts to the surface \u2014 and he shrugs off questions about a character\u2019s psychological motivation, back story and context as effortlessly as he does questions about himself. \u201cIf you want to [expletive] annoy him, ask him character back-story questions,\u201d Colin Farrell told me, laughing, of his first experience working with Lanthimos on the set of \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d where Lanthimos refused to tell him what happened in the scene before the one they were filming. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really feel the need, you know. For him a story is born and dies between the first and last page.\u201d Lanthimos is \u201ctrying to give space to mystery,\u201d Ariane Labed, his wife, told me. \u201cYorgos does not explain things, even to the actors really, and they\u2019re not used to that. But then they go through this experience, and they discover that having gaps in their characters\u2019 journeys, they actually have more room for their own imaginations, [their] own mistakes, [their] own doubts, and I think that\u2019s why actors are amazing in Yorgos\u2019s films. They\u2019re on the line.\u201dFor \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d Lanthimos gathered the central cast together for three weeks of rehearsal, where they delivered their lines while trying to tie themselves in knots, jumping from carpet tile to carpet tile, or writhing around on the floor. \u201cHe had us do all sorts of things that keep you from thinking about what your lines mean,\u201d Olivia Colman, who plays Queen Anne, told me. \u201cIt was completely unique.\u201d These gamelike exercises were also ways of forcing an actor\u2019s reflexes to the surface, submerging that part of the mind that analyzes and questions, or turns away from the moment and toward a script or director for answers. \u201cThe best way to describe it is, it becomes completely unconscious ... completely instinctual,\u201d explains Rachel Weisz, who first worked with Lanthimos in \u201cThe Lobster\u201d and appears in \u201cThe Favourite\u201d as Sarah Churchill, the queen\u2019s confidante and lover. \u201cIf you asked me afterward what had just happened, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you. And in fact, the experience of watching the two films, the ones I\u2019ve been in, are unlike other films in that I\u2019m completely surprised by what I did. Usually when you film you have a sense of what you\u2019ve done, but with Yorgos you have no sense. If that makes sense.\u201dLike the stories themselves, which thrust characters, existentially underprepared, into disorienting situations, Lanthimos\u2019s direction forces actors to inhabit their roles with convincing immediacy, giving them an authentic vulnerability. It reflects the broader connection between his films and theater, a temporary structure assembled by bodies that are clumsily, complicatedly occupying space. In a scene from last year\u2019s \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer,\u201d Lanthimos\u2019s take on a horror film, the wife (played by Nicole Kidman) feigns unconsciousness in their bedroom at her surgeon husband\u2019s request; she rolls over, limp and lifeless, her head hanging off the edge of the bed as he caresses her. As he pulls her body ungracefully toward him, her hair dragging across the comforter, her foot catches on a pillow and it falls over, a piece of reality quietly disheveling the fantasy. Auteurs like Luca Guadagnino or Paolo Sorrentino, with their swooping, reeling shots and kinetic dance sequences, may get more credit for capturing bodily experience on film, but Lanthimos arguably shows greater fidelity to our actual bodies, stubborn and awkwardly choreographed by fate, etiquette and overarching structures of power \u2014 not glamorous bodies but bodies of ungainly yearning.\u201cThe Favourite\u201d is a first for Lanthimos \u2014 as a foray into period drama, as the director of a script that he did not originate himself \u2014 and it marks a true shift in his emotional palette. Rather than keep the viewer at arm\u2019s length, this new film works to draw you into the palace intrigue. You root for Abigail, the newcomer and underdog, as she tries to secure her livelihood, and then you root for Sarah just as strongly as she struggles to maintain her position by banishing her competition from the court. But as the hierarchy churns, the effort to get on top and stay there starts feeling less like rowdy fun and more like a form of imprisonment, implicating the viewer as well in its casual cruelty: Why do we as observers choose favorites, when this partiality so clearly limits our ability to see the whole? The ending, when it arrives, is inevitable yet unexpected. It is quietly, inscrutably heartbreaking \u2014 one of the only moments in a Lanthimos film that is not funny, not at all.\u2029\u201cThey\u2019re not so helpless in this film as in my others,\u201d Lanthimos told me breezily as we left the restaurant. \u201cBut they\u2019re still trapped.\u201dHe was heading back home after our lunch, to work out issues with the version of \u201cThe Favourite\u201d that will be shown on airplanes \u2014 they wanted to censor every other thing, even blurring the naked bodies of the cherubs in the palace art. But whether he felt that he owed me more time in lieu of self-explanation, or because he was in the mood to talk, he went out of his way to walk with me to my next appointment. He led us away from the high streets and down narrower residential rows where the hedges are a thick, towering green, trimmed into forcefully geometric shapes. He pointed out the bramble taking back the edge of an ad hoc park and the local town hall where he and Ariane were married. In these quiet slivers of street, London no longer feels modern: It\u2019s a pileup of the old and the new and the very old, the ground beneath our feet named by Saxon villagers. I could tell that I was being led though a terrain that was deeply personal, emotional, meaningful, but without an explanation of what I was seeing, I had to reconstruct the links myself. It\u2019s a kind of closeness at a distance, the same feeling I experience when I watch one of his films. When I mentioned that he seemed at home here, in his element among the mixture of old and new, the council flats facing meticulously preserved historical buildings, he seemed pleased, as if I\u2019d noticed something so important to him that he didn\u2019t mind allowing a stranger a glimpse. He thought for a moment, and then he replied with a slight smile: \u201cAt home, yes. But not so at home that it\u2019s become boring.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Lanthimos\u2019s relationship with the ad agency where he met Efthimis Filippou, a playwright and co-writer on four of Lanthimos\u2019s films. Lanthimos did not work for the agency.Alexandra Kleeman is a writer based on Staten Island, a professor at the New School and the author of the novel \u201cYou Too Can Have a Body Like Mine,\u201d as well as the story collection \u201cIntimations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Building, Three Looks", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe High EndA new condominium in Long Island City has sections that feature distinct architectural styles: industrial metal, old-school brick and curtain wall glass.New York buildings come in a variety of architectural styles, but typically each building has just one. A condominium under construction in Long Island City, though, will bring three styles into a single project.Named Galerie and designed by ODA New York for Adam America, the 11-story complex on Jackson Avenue, directly across from MoMA P. S. 1, will reference building types found throughout the Queens neighborhood. Concrete-framed sections of the facade have factory style windows that hark back to the steel versions on the area\u2019s 19th-century industrial plants. Sections with more traditional punched-out windows are brick, like the older portion of P.S.1. And a curtain-wall component at the top of the complex resembles the glassy structures prevalent across the city today (and provides unfettered views of the Manhattan skyline).The segments fit together like puzzle pieces, giving the large, 182-unit project the feel of a cluster of smaller buildings and thus bringing a more modest scale to an area that has seen its share of looming, straight-up towers.\u201cLong Island City almost has a desperate craving for a sense of community and character,\u201d said Eran Chen, ODA\u2019s founder and executive director.Mr. Chen knew about the site \u2014 which borders the Sunnyside rail yard \u2014 long before he got the commission. He had already designed a rental building on the same block.Dvir Cohen Hoshen, co-founder of Adam America, admired that building \u2014 an 11-story tower with boxy segments that jut out from the facade, creating terraces for the apartments above them \u2014 and asked ODA to design a condo version of it that would fill out the block. Instead, Mr. Chen came up with his three-styles-in-one design, which has an H-shaped footprint.The south-facing opening in the H will become a grassy courtyard, with ground-floor amenities, including an indoor pool, looking out onto the green space. Paris Forino, the interior designer for the project, is adding drama to this level with muscular arches in warm white oak.The building\u2019s name and certain features, like a display window for a rotating selection of paintings, prints and sculpture, play off the project\u2019s proximity to P. S. 1 and the many artists\u2019 studios in the area.Long Island City, which offers an easy commute to Midtown Manhattan on public transportation and which will soon become home to an Amazon headquarters, has been evolving as a residential community. Many buildings that went up after a 2001 rezoning were high-rise rentals. Now condominium projects are being added to the residential mix.Galerie\u2019s apartments \u2014 two-thirds of them are one- and two-bedrooms \u2014 went on sale in February, and over 30 percent are now in contract, according to Halstead Property Development Marketing, which is handling sales. The complex has been attracting renters in the area who are ready to graduate to homeownership, according to Brendan Aguayo, a managing director at Halstead.Galerie is luring out-of-towners, too. Buyers from New Jersey are making \u201ca strong showing,\u201d according to Mr. Aguayo, who had a 3D-printed map of the area made for the sales gallery to help outsiders get to know the neighborhood.Although condos elsewhere in the city have long offered finish options \u2014 buyers often get to choose from a \u201cdark\u201d or \u201clight\u201d palette for kitchen cabinetry, for instance \u2014 this may be the first time a project offers window options (all with special sound-buffering glazing to address the noise from Jackson Avenue and the rail yards). Modernists may gravitate to units in the section with glass curtain walls, for instance.Or that\u2019s the theory anyway.According to Mr. Aguayo, buyers are focusing less on the window styling and more on apartment size, layout and, of course, price. Apartments range from $550,000 for a studio to $2,550,000 for a three-bedroom penthouse.Advertisement"}

Just in a sexual fetishized kind of way.\u201dJames proceeds to get specific, explaining that she has a type of white man she prefers, and it\u2019s not a progressive. \u201cIf I date a white dude,\u201d she says, before zeroing in on a man in the front row, \u201cI want to ruin your family.\u201dSex and politics can make strange bedfellows and thus wonderful comedy. So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that many of the funniest political jokes from the sharpest young stand-ups today are smuggled into bits on dating and relationships.Trump barely comes up in James\u2019s jokes, but his effect on the culture infuses so many of her premises. She doesn\u2019t need to mention his name when she says she stopped exercising because the world is coming to an end. You know what (and whom) she\u2019s talking about.She jokes about depression, masturbation and how it\u2019s ridiculous that no one pays for pornography, making the case that its stars work harder than anyone, calling them \u201cbasically slutty athletes.\u201d Once she establishes a playful relationship with the crowd, she shifts from teasing to confrontational. After skewering straight men for not doing more to get better at oral sex, she retreats, for an instant. \u201cNo judgment,\u201d she says, raising her hands in mock surrender, before shifting to a stern stare: \u201cJudgment.\u201dThe rhythm of this fiercely feminist show is contained in those three words. As she builds a case that the pleasure of women is of much lower priority than that of men, Treyger\u2019s set takes a sharp turn from the personal to the political. \u201cWhy don\u2019t women speak up?\u201d she asks about this disparity, then answers her own question with some historical perspective: \u201cOnce Henry VIII chopped off the last woman\u2019s head, we had a meeting and were like: \u2018Size doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\u201dThis one man, she concludes, taught her what \u201cit means to be a sexy woman.\u201d If not for him, she joked, she would never have tried on a halter top. How does this man know exactly what she wants to hear? She researches the question and says that she found an interview with one of his colleagues who said, to understand what women want, every month, \u201cwe read Cosmo.\u201dWhat begins as a joke about culture turns into a resonant feminist diagnosis of the twisted way men speak for and manufacture art for women. There\u2019s an intrepid intelligence in this joke as it traces the unlikely roots of mass entertainment. As she walks you through her thought process, she makes sure to keep dropping punch lines, albeit ones that don\u2019t build to a declarative point but than unravel into exasperation. She has another excellent joke about how Amazon\u2019s anticipating what you will buy makes you insecure enough to click on products to make you seem cooler.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Amazon Means for Long Island City", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInterest in real estate open houses has already spiked, and prices will likely rise. Here\u2019s a in depth look at the transformation of a neighborhood. The first Amazon employees will arrive in January, but because the company will add them gradually, with a goal of 40,000 hires by 2034, Long Island City won\u2019t exactly balloon overnight. And of course, some employees will decide to find a home in another area anyway.Buyers are flocking, developers are circling and prices are rising.\u201cOnce the news leaked, showings went up,\u201d Kerry Walton said of her two-bedroom, two-bath condop, which is listed for $815,000.But a few weeks ago, interest in the unit exploded. Ms. Walton said she began receiving a flurry of emails from her doormen letting her know that brokers were visiting. Then, in mid-November, an acceptable offer came in, which she wouldn\u2019t specify because a contract hadn\u2019t been signed yet, but made her \u201chappy.\u201dIf there is a wider pool of buyers in Long Island City, it\u2019s mostly investors \u2014 many from overseas, who are looking to cash in down the road through sublets, said Eric Benaim, the chief executive officer of Modern Spaces, a local brokerage. Modern Spaces is already working with four Amazon employees, some of them from Seattle, home to the retail empire\u2019s current headquarters.\u201cIt\u2019s a feeding frenzy, and I\u2019ve never seen it like this,\u201d said Brian Dusseau, a Halstead agent who has worked in the neighborhood since 2002.

It\u2019s making people comfortable buying again.\u201dAnd developers are gearing up for the new demand.Tweaking prices in the midst of marketing a project is not that unusual, but it\u2019s rarer in the weeks before the winter holidays. It\u2019s also been uncommon as of late in Long Island City, brokers say, where the development market has been weak.In the third quarter, the average new condo sale price in Long Island City was $976,000, according to Halstead. That was down from an average of $1.32 million in the previous quarter and also shy of the $1.01 million average in the same quarter of 2017, the firm said.The average monthly rent for one-bedrooms across Long Island City is $3,100, according to StreetEasy.com. The average for two-bedrooms is $3,900. \u201cAmazon planting a flag is fabulous for the entire neighborhood,\u201d said Alan Suna, the chief executive of Silvercup Studios, the Long Island City movie facility that also develops apartment buildings, like the Harrison, a 120-unit condo on 44th Drive. Mr. Suna was among the local business leaders who worked on the Amazon pitch.Despite two decades of residential strides, much of Long Island City still looks like a work zone.Still, development has proceeded energetically, especially in two pockets \u2014 on the banks of the East River in the Hunters Point section; and in Court Square, sandwiched between the Edward I. Koch Queensboro Bridge and the Long Island Railroad tracks.Further inland at Court Square, a disparate blend of offices, apartments and municipal buildings nuzzles the bridge\u2019s ramps. In addition to whatever it builds in the Anable Basin, Amazon has leased 1 million square feet of the office building at One Court Square, the 1.4 million-square-foot, blue-green spire formerly known as the Citigroup Building, where Amazon is expected to start moving employees early next year.Rockrose, another Elghanayan firm, has finished or is at work on four rentals in the area, with 2,600 apartments. Among them is the Cove at 43-12 Hunter Street, a 130-unit, 18-story offering to be completed next year. Eagle Lofts, with 790 units at 43-22 Queens Street, is currently leasing; one-bedrooms are around $3,800 a month, with a free month\u2019s rent offered as a concession.Rockrose will likely raise rents, but first Amazon workers need to arrive, said Rockrose president Justin Elghanayan. \u201cIt will take a while before the effects filter in,\u201d he said.Mr. Elghanayan\u2019s projects are hardly alone. Densely packed into this area, which was rezoned in 2001, are more than a dozen other residential spires, mostly rentals. There are condos too, like Skyline Tower, an 802-unit, 778-foot giant on 23-15 44th Drive from developer Jiashu Xu that was a few floors out of the ground on a recent afternoon.Unlike previous retail tenants, who enjoyed below-market rents in a Rockrose effort to cultivate a scene, future rents \u201cwill be more landlord friendly than before the Amazon announcement,\u201d Mr. Elghanayan said.While development has been clumped in two compact sections, it has begun to spread out. New buildings are slowly popping up north of the bridge, toward Astoria. That section is also home to Queensbridge Houses, the nation\u2019s largest public-housing development.While not as rich in historic buildings as other parts of New York, Long Island City does offer a single-block historic district, along 45th Avenue, between 21st and 23rd Streets, which features neat rows of prewar townhouses. A two-family there recently sold for more than $2 million.\u201cIt has completely changed,\u201d said Ms. Walton of the neighborhood, to which she moved in 1998. And Amazon will accelerate more growth. \u201cThe people will be there, so the businesses will follow. You just have to be patient.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Beauty of Brazil\u2019s Rain Forest, in Jewelry", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was at a goldsmithing class in 2003 that Silvia Furmanovich knew for certain that her future lay in fine jewelry. As she watched a hunk of gold melting above a flame, \u201cdeep inside, I knew it was the way forward for me,\u201d said the Brazilian jeweler, who until that point had had her own costume jewelry and aromatherapy businesses.Seeing the precious metal transform before her eyes brought back instant memories of her father, who was a goldsmith with his own jewelry atelier at home in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, when Ms. Furmanovich was growing up. (He died when she was 17.) \u201cHe was a huge guy with big hands, but I remember him working on tiny pieces with such skill,\u201d said the 61-year-old designer in a recent telephone interview from her S\u00e3o Paulo home.The jewelry gene runs deep in the family. Her Italian grandfather and great-grandfather also were goldsmiths, the latter for the Vatican.Ms. Furmanovich\u2019s first fine jewelry creations were intricately woven bracelets with porcelain beads, secured with the gold clasps that she made in class. These bracelets still are represented in her collection, which has grown to encompass a vast array of bold yet feminine, vibrantly colored creations.The designer was an early proponent of mixing precious materials like gold and diamonds with Brazilian semiprecious colored gemstones such as tourmalines and blue topaz, as well as with natural materials including seashells, wood and orchid petals preserved in lacquer.She also has long incorporated craft items from around the world into her designs, whether they be the antique, hand-carved wooden netsuke she found in Japan, or Rajasthani miniature paintings she commissioned from artists in Udaipur, India.\u201cI\u2019ve always collaborated with artists and artisans to make something new,\u201d Ms. Furmanovich said. \u201cIn this technological world, everything is being made by machines and we must all fight to keep traditional handicrafts alive.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such beautiful crafts in my life than in that show,\u201d she said.Four years ago, inspiration came from closer to home, however. She was at an exhibition in Brazil when she came across the work of an artist based in the country\u2019s remote northern region of the Amazon. The artist, who declined to be named, was born in the rain forest but had learned the art of wood marquetry as a young man, having been sent to Germany by priests who recognized his artistic potential.As soon as she saw his work, she knew she had to meet him. \u201cIt\u2019s a long trip from S\u00e3o Paulo. Two planes, one hour by car and then one hour by canoe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a risk to go but something was calling me there.\u201dShe invited him to collaborate and together they worked out how to miniaturize his and his team\u2019s work down from large-scale pictures and furniture to the wearable scale of jewelry. The initial result was a collection in which the marquetry mimicked the geometric patterns and play of light found in cut gemstones. The miniature trompe l\u2019oeil artworks were suspended from diamonds and colored gems, including amethyst and citrine, in earrings, cuffs and minaudi\u00e8res.The marquetry artist incorporates minute slivers of wood in many colors in his work, including native ones such as red muirapiranga, yellow tatajuba, purple roxinho and blue carvalho. These are not dyed to achieve their vibrant effect, Ms. Furmanovich said, although sometimes the artist\u2019s team intensifies the colors through a process (which they won\u2019t share, even with her) that causes chemical reactions in the woods.They use only bark and branches salvaged from the rain-forest floor or nonnative woods left over from the local furniture industry. \u201cIt\u2019s also great to work with a sustainable material that incorporates the concept of craftsmanship,\u201d she said. \u201cI love to work with wood; it\u2019s beautiful to work with, and you can make things on scale while keeping them lightweight.\u201dThis year, the designer took the collaboration further with Botanical, a collection based on the fertile subject of Brazil\u2019s tropical flora and fauna, inspired by her frequent trips to the rain forest. Incorporating one-of-a-kind pieces based on everything from calla lilies and pansies to multicolored rain-forest mushrooms and tropical butterflies, every pattern in their surfaces and every curve in their silhouettes is realized in minute detail.The result was particularly satisfying for Ms. Furmanovich. \u201cThe Amazon forest is such a powerful place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the colors, the flowers, the birds: a diversity in nature that is unparalleled. It\u2019s great to be able to show the best of our country in terms of nature, materials and craft.\u201dIn terms of craftsmanship, she said that creating a 3-D effect in marquetry, which is normally used on flat surfaces, was the greatest challenge of the collection. \u201cThe veneers are stiff, and they break when you fold them,\u201d she said.However, the effort, and frequent trips north \u2014 especially since beginning work on the Botanical collection \u2014 have been worth it, Ms. Furmanovich said. And the reaction from her clients has been overwhelming, particularly at Bergdorf Goodman in New York, where her work stands out in its jewelry salon for its color, scale and volume. \u201cThese customers can buy what they like but I think people want something different and unique, they don\u2019t just want diamonds,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want innovation.\u201dBetty Halbreich, director of the personal shopping Solutions Department at Bergdorf Goodman, agrees. \u201cTo gaze at Silvia\u2019s case is like traveling to a museum,\u201d she said. \u201cOne\u2019s imagination takes a ride. Imagine the wood, the artisans, the jewels and where they come from. It is like a jewelry flower garden.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon and the Urban Hypocrite", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityIn the days before Amazon\u2019s official announcement that it would situate its second headquarters in two locations, one of them in Queens, many New Yorkers were outraged by the impending incursion as they surely went about ordering their slow-cookers and folding chairs and heavily discounted copies of \u201cFriday Black\u201d from the company, for expedited delivery. The holidays, after all, are approaching.I count myself among the hypocrites. Along with so many others who think about urbanism, I spent much of Monday ruminating on the paradox of a company with a trillion-dollar valuation receiving billions of dollars in tax credits for bringing high-paying, technocratic jobs to a place already full of them. During the last decade, the city has added 76,000 tech jobs. In September, New York State recorded its lowest unemployment rate in 30 years.And yet Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo went after Amazon as if he were the desperate patriarch in a 19th-century novel, ready to balloon the family dowry without limit all for the prospect of ensuring that his daughter marry up, even if, in truth, she stood at the pinnacle and could have anyone. Was it really necessary that Amazon get its own helipad when there is one right across the river? Exhausted at the injustice, I tucked into bed at the end of the day with my iPad and streamed the second segment of \u201cThe Worricker Trilogy\u201d on Amazon Prime, barely registering the contradiction.We have internalized our use of Amazon to such a degree that we have trouble recognizing our complicity in the manufacture of the company\u2019s own arrogance. Last year, I witnessed an adult ask an 8-year old if he believed in Santa, to which the child replied, rolling his eyes, \u201cSanta is Amazon.\u201dThe company will arrive in Long Island City at a time when whole blocks in Manhattan and Brooklyn are distinguished by their empty storefronts, a consequence largely of rising commercial rents but also of the submission to fatigue over principle that occurs every time someone who genuinely believes in the importance of a thriving local merchant class shops by refusing to leave the house.Beyond that, in choosing New York and suburban Washington over the Pittsburghs and Denvers that Amazon had said it was considering, it already made its elitist commitments very clear. It would not be seduced by the notion of experimentation; it would go where it was most likely that standing in line at a CVS at 7 in the evening, you would run into someone from the Harvard class of 2004.The second decade of the 21st century has been a golden period in the history of American urbanism, as midsize cities have undergone a renaissance, with cities like San Antonio growing at a faster rate than places like Los Angeles or Boston. This is the outcome, to some extent, of the affordability crisis in major American cities and the dispersal of cultural capital that has come with it. Once moribund downtown neighborhoods in Birmingham, Ala., or Providence, R.I., for example, are full of new galleries, theaters, restaurants, businesses. Perhaps the most dispiriting aspect of Amazon\u2019s search process and its result is that it chose not to join that narrative, to further stimulate the engines of growth. (As part of its announcement this week the company said it would open a smaller operations facility in Nashville, but honestly, isn\u2019t that like winning the steak knives when you really wanted the Buick?)The average salary for jobs at the new Amazon headquarters will be $150,000, the company has said. In Indianapolis it would go quite far; in New York City, that wouldn\u2019t disqualify you for a housing subsidy.On Tuesday afternoon, various politicians and business leaders issued statements testifying to their delight in Amazon\u2019s decision. Among them was Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor who gave us the framework for the vertical city both literally and figuratively \u2014 a city of high-tech skyscrapers and top-down governance that laid to rest whatever communitarian ambitions and Jane Jacobs fever dreams remained. Amazon is coming to New York without the input of the City Council or the community in which the company will find itself. They were to be quiet and grateful.Advertisement"}

The inflated dragon he slays in Act II might have escaped the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade.It was all good fun \u2014 and it really was fun \u2014 but it risked shortchanging the deeper aspects of the work.

He typed a complaint to a Tesla manager on his phone. \u201cRacist effigy & drawing\u201d was the subject.\u201cWhen you really just look at it, you ask yourself at some point, \u2018Where is my line?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Diaz, 50, who worked at the factory as a contractor for 11 months before he quit in May 2016.It is a line that others say they reached, too.Interviews, internal communications and sworn legal statements filed by more than two dozen current or former Tesla employees and contractors describe a wide range of concerns among some African-American workers at the factory in Fremont, including threats by co-workers, demeaning assignments and barriers to advancement. Three lawsuits by former workers accusing Tesla of failing to curb racial discrimination and harassment have been filed since early last year, including one by Mr. Diaz awaiting trial.Tesla rejects the workplace portrait painted in the complaints as inaccurate, saying there is no evidence to support \u201ca pattern of discrimination and harassment.\u201d It is not the only automaker to face allegations of racism in recent years, and it acknowledges that \u201cin a company the size of a small city, there will at times be claims of bad behavior,\u201d real or false. But it said there was no indication that the factory had an unusual rate of complaints.\u201cWe strive to provide a respectful work environment for all employees and do our best to prevent bad conduct,\u201d the company said. African-American employees at various levels of authority, made available by Tesla, said their own experiences had been positive.Crystal Spates, a production manager overseeing 500 people building the Model 3, said racial slurs were not tolerated at the factory. \u201cI have never heard, myself, anyone use that terminology,\u201d said Ms. Spates, 30, who is African-American and joined Tesla two years ago.Mr. Diaz, like Tesla itself, likened the plant to a small city \u2014 one in which experiences can vary, he said. \u201cYou know, you can have something that happens in one part of the city that doesn\u2019t happen in another part,\u201d he said. But when his son encountered racial slurs and caricatures in a different part of the factory, Mr. Diaz concluded that the issue was not an isolated one.One suit accusing Tesla of racial discrimination and harassment, filed last November in California Superior Court, seeks class-action status. The lawyers involved \u2014 Lawrence A. Organ and Bryan Schwartz, whose practices focus on workplace rights \u2014 say they have identified dozens of potential plaintiffs. Each lawyer has won multimillion-dollar judgments in other harassment or discrimination cases against major employers. Tesla is seeking to move the case into arbitration, which would require workers to bring individual lawsuits rather than a joint claim.The state\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing says it has issued 10 \u201cright to sue\u201d letters \u2014 a precondition for a discrimination lawsuit \u2014 to employees complaining of racial bias at the Fremont plant. Dozens of other complaints against Tesla are pending, but the agency would not say how many involved race.In an email to employees last year, which the company later released in response to one of the lawsuits, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, warned against \u201cbeing a huge jerk\u201d to members of \u201ca historically less represented group.\u201d At the same time, he wrote, \u201cif someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology.\u201dBut by many accounts, the issues at the Tesla factory go beyond the need for a thick skin.In any case, some African-American workers who expected to help build a future for the company and themselves, like Teshawna Stewart, say the reality proved to be a slap in the face.Before starting at Tesla last year, Ms. Stewart, 25, sorted and packed orders at a nearby Amazon warehouse.The job she landed installing taillights at the Tesla factory paid several dollars an hour more. But she discovered a downside when she was assigned to \u201cthe brick,\u201d the production area for Model 3 sedans.During several weeks when the Model 3 production line was not yet operating, Ms. Stewart said, she was frequently assigned to menial tasks, while workers of other races did work like sorting components.In a sworn statement for a lawsuit, she said that when she had complained about \u201cAfrican-American employees being required to get down on our hands and knees and scrub the floor,\u201d a human resources representative told her that she was \u201cmaking up stories.\u201dTesla said Ms. Stewart \u201cdid not raise these types of claims during her employment.\u201d Ms. Spates, the production manager, said assembly workers were expected to handle other tasks if production was interrupted, but \u201cnothing in terms of \u2018get on your hands and knees.\u2019\u201d She does not recall working with Ms. Stewart.In May, Ms. Stewart was fired for \u201cjob abandonment,\u201d she said, after her team was assigned to a job in San Francisco for the day to help prepare cars for shipment to China. Tesla said she had been fired because she failed to return to the factory and had been given written warnings about her attendance. She said she had returned with the other workers, who were not African-American, and was the only one fired.Like Ms. Stewart, Nigel Jones arrived at Tesla with high hopes. He was fresh out of the Army when he started as a temporary battery technician at Tesla in September 2015. Mr. Jones, now 26, quickly found the kind of rapid professional mobility often out of reach without a college degree. In about 22 months, he went from being an $18-an-hour contractor to making $85,000 a year as a mobile-equipment supervisor.Then, on a busy afternoon in January during the ramp-up of Model 3 production, Mr. Jones said, he stopped to help two other African-American workers set up a water cart. A new manager questioned the group, and after Mr. Jones assured him that he had everything \u201cunder control,\u201d the manager turned and muttered a vulgar racial epithet within 10 feet of the group, Mr. Jones recalled. His recollection was affirmed by a current employee who said he had witnessed it; he asked not to be identified.Though he tried to \u201clet that go,\u201d Mr. Jones soon put a post on Facebook about growing tired of \u201csubtle racial discrimination\u201d at work. His mother said Mr. Jones had also told her about the incident two to three weeks later, shortly before he was fired.Tesla said Mr. Jones had been \u201creprimanded numerous times for attendance and safety violations\u201d and given a \u201cfinal written warning\u201d before being fired for attendance problems.Mr. Jones denied having had attendance problems, attributing that account to the manager with whom he tangled. He looks back with regret that the prospect of a bright future didn\u2019t pan out.\u201cTesla, it is a cool company,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cYou sit there and you\u2019re like, \u2018This can\u2019t be happening here.\u2019\u201dDeWitt Lambert, an African-American electrician, was not quite 40 when he left home in Mobile, Ala., in 2012 and drove to California in search of a job. Tesla hired him in June 2015 as a production associate, mostly installing seatbelts.Soon, he said, he encountered co-workers mocking his Southern drawl. He started to wear headphones to drown them out, but when the occasional taunts turned to frequent racial slurs, he said, they were hard to ignore.The company granted his request to change stations, but his tormentors started lingering near his new spot, he told officials, and he worried that they \u201care going to do something to me.\u201dBetween June 2016 and February 2017, Mr. Lambert sent at least a dozen text messages, emails, photos and videos to human resources, copies show.The evidence sent by Mr. Lambert included a 58-second cellphone video, punctuated by repeated racial slurs, in which an unidentified narrator walking the factory floor says it\u2019s \u201cDeWitt\u2019s\u201d phone and threatens to \u201ccut you up \u2026 so everybody can have a piece of you, nigger.\u201d He said it had been recorded by co-workers who took his phone and meant it as a threat.Feeling that he had a potential civil rights claim, he consulted a lawyer about legal options, and filed a complaint with the state fair-employment agency.Tesla\u2019s general counsel, Todd Maron, wrote in March 2017 with an offer to settle.\u201cWe are willing to pay Mr. Lambert $100,000, but only if we are to resolve this matter before there is media attention,\u201d Mr. Maron wrote in an email provided by Mr. Lambert\u2019s lawyer.Attached was a four-page document outlining information the company had collected to undermine Mr. Lambert\u2019s claims. \u201cOur C.E.O., Elon Musk, has reviewed this case personally and notwithstanding everything that\u2019s in the attached document, he is sorry that this case did not get escalated much sooner and he agrees that change is needed,\u201d the email stated.Mr. Lambert, who declined the settlement offer in favor of a chance to take the claim to trial and argue for higher damages, was put on paid administrative leave.In June, after Tesla succeeded in moving the case to arbitration, Mr. Lambert received a letter terminating his employment, saying the company had discovered acts \u201cinconsistent with Tesla\u2019s values.\u201d Tesla said Mr. Lambert himself had been involved in \u201cinstigating use of the \u2018N-word.\u2019\u201d He conceded that he had used the epithet at times, but only with other African-Americans.After Tesla moved to bring the case to a close, an arbitrator issued a preliminary ruling saying it merited fuller consideration.\u201cI feel like everything was taken away from me,\u201d said Mr. Lambert, who is living at his mother\u2019s house back in Alabama. \u201cI got everything snatched from up under me since I complained about it.\u201dWithin about 90 days after starting at Tesla as a contract production associate, he became a full-time employee and saw his pay steadily climb from $17 to $21 an hour.Mr. Jones (no relation to Nigel Jones) said he had then started to notice that black workers weren\u2019t being promoted. In one case, he said, a manufacturing official told him that \u201cpeople like you\u201d didn\u2019t move up to lead positions. He also reported that he had heard a supervisor say of black employees that \u201cthere\u2019s too many of them in there, they are not Tesla material,\u201d and that he had been at a meeting where a supervisor, gesturing toward African-American workers, remarked that \u201cmonkeys work outside.\u201dTesla said there was no record of a formal complaint from Mr. Jones about racial insults.The company also denied that there was any inequity in its career development practices. \u201cYou do a great job, you make your way here,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of diversity and inclusion, Felicia Mayo, who is African-American. After a year at the company, she was recently made a vice president.Clarence Johnson, who came to Tesla four and a half years ago as a forklift driver and now tests equipment on a safety team \u2014 his second promotion \u2014 said his experience reflected opportunity.While he said he could not speak for others, he added, \u201cI\u2019m an African-American male, and I didn\u2019t have any of those roadblocks.\u201dLike Ms. Spates, he said supervisors would not tolerate racial slurs \u2014 though he said the use of a racial epithet \u201cwhere it\u2019s two people referring to one another as friends\u201d was common.For Mr. Jones, the route was not up but out. He said his children and a psychologist he had started seeing persuaded him to go back to truck driving.\u201cEverybody has a breaking point,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m able to breathe now.\u201dIf Nummi represented the auto industry\u2019s past, Owen Diaz was sure that Tesla was the future.But that was before the racist effigy on the cardboard bale, and the slurs and offensive graffiti that came earlier. He said he had ultimately found the environment so degrading that he struggled to get out of bed for work.As for the graffiti, Tesla said that Mr. Diaz brought \u201ca single drawing to the attention of his supervisor\u201d and that it \u201cwas promptly and thoroughly investigated.\u201d It said a contractor involved had been given a warning and suspended without pay.Despite what he said he had experienced, Mr. Diaz was eager to give his youngest son, Demetric, a chance at the company\u2019s pay and stock options. So he recruited him as a fellow contractor in 2015, working in a different production area.The first weeks were fine for Demetric, now 23. But he started to notice incidents that disturbed him.\u201cI started telling him like, \u2018Hey, well, I seen this, Dad,\u201d Demetric said. \u201cWhen I was in the bathroom,\u201d he said, he saw vulgar graffiti that included a racial slur.The younger Mr. Diaz complained to his staffing firm and then to a Tesla supervisor about racial abuse, protesting that the supervisor was \u201ccalling me an N-word every day,\u201d according to a lawsuit. The suit says that within days, he was given a written warning of misconduct and was shortly out of a job. Tesla said he had been let go after repeated warnings about failing to wear protective clothing.His father hung on for a few more months. Then he quit.Advertisement"}

Why pay them $1.5 billion to come?The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.But did Amazon really select New York City for its transportation system? The subways are a shambles. The company couldn\u2019t have chosen New York for its affordable housing because, as in Seattle, there isn\u2019t any. As for outdoor recreation, our beaches and parks are jammed, our soccer fields overrun. There\u2019s a lot more green space elsewhere. Cost of living? Hardly a selling point, unless you are seeking to increase your operating expenses. And no, Amazon didn\u2019t choose New York because it has real bagels \u2014 although it couldn\u2019t hurt.That is, rather than the state and the city paying off Amazon, Amazon should be required to invest in the subways, schools and affordable housing. It could also be required to include job guarantees for lower-income residents of Long Island City, not just flimsy promises of job training.Nothing has been carved in stone yet. The agreement is a memorandum of understanding, not a binding contract. No final deal should be pushed through without public input or approval. The mayor and governor would benefit from soliciting ideas from New Yorkers themselves, both those who live in Long Island City, and the other taxpayers footing the bill for the generous subsidies about to be given to the company.It\u2019s distressing that a mayor and governor who can\u2019t come together for the sake of the subways or public housing somehow managed to find common ground by doing an end run around the City Council and steamrollering the land-use process.We won\u2019t know for 10 years whether the promised 25,000 jobs will materialize. We do know that for decades states and cities have paid ransoms in the tens of billions of dollars to attract or \u201ckeep\u201d jobs only to find themselves at the losing end of the proposition when companies moved on after the taxpayer freebies ended. During the Great Recession, it became commonplace for the auto industry to abandon one community after another despite lining its pockets with government money. Job promises were left in the dust of bankruptcy. Even in better times, economists have made a convincing case that these job development payout schemes aren\u2019t worth it. Mr. Bezos has owned a home here for years. He knows what our city has to offer; and as the web\u2019s biggest retailer, he knows what he\u2019s getting in setting up shop in Long Island City: a discount. So welcome, Jeff.

{"Headline": "Is Arizona the Next Big Democratic Target?", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Politics With Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.I met Ms. Soza two days before the election, at a Dia de los Muertos festival in Phoenix, where she was waiting to take a photo with her three daughters and Ms. Sinema, the Democratic candidate.Ms. Soza, 37, couldn\u2019t remember the last time she voted in a midterm election. But she certainly planned on voting in this one \u2014 mostly to send a message to President Trump.\u201cMy family is Hispanic and I\u2019m half-black,\u201d she said. \u201cHis tone is just very demeaning.\u201dDemocrats have talked about changing the electoral map for years, expanding into fast-growing states like Texas, Arizona and Georgia. Hillary Clinton even visited Arizona six days before the 2016 election.But infrequent Democratic voters like Ms. Soza never quite materialized in force on Election Day.This year, they did.Senate wins in Arizona and Nevada, along with a close loss in Texas, have convinced some in the party that the changes they\u2019ve long predicted have finally arrived. And they\u2019re hoping those changes will continue through the next presidential election.Michael Halle, a Democratic operative who ran Mrs. Clinton\u2019s battleground-state strategy and managed Richard Cordray\u2019s losing campaign for governor of Ohio, says it\u2019s time for Democrats to jettison Iowa and Ohio in favor of Arizona and Georgia. Not only are the Midwestern states less favorable to Democrats because of their more rural, white populations, he argues, but they\u2019re also more expensive media markets.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary, because Ohio and Iowa are two states that Obama won in both his presidential campaigns, and now they\u2019re just not competitive in the way they once were,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe are at a place where we need to expand the map.\u201dGuy Cecil, chairman of the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, said his group\u2019s data from the 2018 midterms showed Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina as potential expansion states during the 2020 election, meaning an investment could tip them into the Democratic column.Mr. Cecil said spending in those states made more sense than in Iowa and Ohio. \u201cIf you look at the results from 2016 and 2018, right now that would be the case,\u201d he said \u2014 though he cautioned that might change depending on who wins the nomination.Now, no one expects Arizona, the birthplace of the Goldwater Republican, to be a liberal bastion in two years.But Mr. Trump\u2019s dark, anti-immigration message may have escalated demographic trends already underway. Across the West, the president\u2019s rhetoric boosted Latino turnout while alienating independents and moderate Republicans, complicating the traditional path to victory for G.O.P. candidates in the historically libertarian region. Arizona Republicans say an appearance Martha McSally, Ms. Sinema\u2019s opponent, made with the president at a mid-October rally hurt her campaign.Arizona Democrats say they\u2019ve known their day would come. And now, they say, it\u2019s time for the national party to take notice.\u201cArizona is a purple state,\u201d said Representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from the Phoenix area. \u201cWe should be invested by national donors to start moving us toward a more Democratic direction.\u201d____________________This afternoon, Republicans emailed out this message from President Trump: \u201cThey\u2019ve brought in Hillary Clinton\u2019s lawyer, and are attempting to steal this seat so they can further obstruct our America First agenda \u2026 I\u2019m asking Republicans from all over the country to chip in.\u201dLess than an hour later, Democrats sent out their own message, from Hillary Clinton: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that any elected official wouldn\u2019t call for a fair and accurate count of the votes \u2026 Chip in $1 to defend Democrats like Bill Nelson.\u201d____________________Amazon announced on Tuesday that it will split its \u201cHQ2\u201d into something more like HQ2 and HQ3, in Long Island City in New York and Crystal City in Northern Virginia. The decision will undoubtedly be a boon for the company \u2014 it will give Amazon a massive presence at the center of the country\u2019s media and government industries, at a time when it\u2019s increasingly bumping into media criticism and threatened regulation.But by other standards, this was the worst possible outcome. Amazon chose two of the most obvious (and already prosperous) regions, leaving many to wonder if the HQ2 sweepstakes was rigged from the start. Since news leaked of the two likely locations last week, critics have called the whole thing a bait-and-switch and a waste of time for the other 236 communities that put in a bid.By picking New York and Washington, Amazon will also double down on putting good tech jobs where good tech jobs already exist, exacerbating the widening inequality between big coastal cities and smaller and more rural communities. If there\u2019s a growing concern in America \u2014 one that underlies our political divides \u2014 that elite, liberal coastal cities are booming while many parts of the country struggle, Amazon\u2019s decision won\u2019t help._____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "The Delivery Trike Is Coming", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe T3 is a tricycle built for grown-ups, and it is not for play.Weighing 150 pounds, it has an aluminum frame and sits on three small but durable bicycle tires with a heavy-duty suspension system in front \u2014 one meant for all-terrain vehicles \u2014 which helps to navigate the city\u2019s innumerable potholes. It can haul up to three times its weight, nearly a quarter-ton of cargo. To go uphill, a single click on the handlebar unleashes a power-boost from an electric-hub in the rear wheel.The two earlier versions were both made from steel and were far heavier \u2014 requiring more effort to pedal, especially uphill, while T3 was designed from the start to be lighter and more easily and cheaply reproduced. Components of the trike include an electric hub motor for the rear wheel, a chain-drive system, suspension system and on-board computer.\u201cIn the next year we are going from a prototype toward production vehicles, building and producing small batches from our shop \u2014 it will be about getting them into the hands of our test users,\u201d said Nick Wong, another Upcycles founder.Mr. Wong noted that getting a small fleet of the trikes on the street and putting them to work would help grow awareness. With so many New Yorkers are always on the street, this should make for easy marketing, not only the bemused citizenry (that\u2019s normal every time they take a prototype out) but also delivery people and executives \u2014 potential customers, in other words.Because it is not a fully electric vehicle, T3 is still legally classified as a bicycle and can be parked in and go places trucks cannot. Its dimensions allow it to fit through standard commercial doorframes for deliveries and between anti-terrorism bollards that have been placed on dedicated bike paths.Its straight lines and unpainted aluminum frame give the impression that T3 has just rolled off a clean, modern assembly line and not out of an ancient brick factory space in Greenpoint, shared by many other manufacturing companies and start-ups.While New York seems ripe for such vehicles, things are much further along in Europe. According to Alison Conway, an associate professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at The City College of New York, city planners in the United States have a lot of catching up to do. She is the author of a 2014 report called \u201cFreight Tricycle Operations in New York City.\u201dThe report mentions that several European cities have introduced restrictions on truck freight deliveries in downtown areas. That has in turn helped foster interest in all sorts of human-powered \u201ccargo cycles,\u201d and many more companies designing and manufacturing them in Europe than are, currently, in the United States. The spectrum ranges from more personal types of heavy-duty two-wheel bicycles to different models of trikes and even four-wheeled quads.\u201cCargo bikes present an interesting way to keep goods moving in this new way of doing commerce,\u201d she said, adding that another major benefit of \u201ccargo cycles\u201d is that the lifetime costs associated with them are going to be less than a truck.And some big delivery players are interested. For example, U.P.S. has been testing other trike designs in the United States with pilot projects currently underway in both Pittsburgh and Portland, Ore.\u201cTo some extent we are seeing a return to the way things used to be done and are continuing to be done now in the developing world,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cAfter all, we\u2019ve had bike couriers forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get the Most Out of Black Friday and Cyber Monday (Even if You\u2019re Not Into Tech)", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBlack Friday and Cyber Monday may be known for hot gadgets and electronics, but there are great deals on other things, too. Here are a few to watch out for.The divide between the in-store sales of Black Friday and the online deals of Cyber Monday has eroded. A \u201cCyber Week\u201d of online sales now stretches from roughly the day before Thanksgiving to November 26.The good news is that most of the best deals available at brick-and-mortar stores are also available online, from either the retailer that set the price or the competitors that are matching it. Our advice: Skip the rush for outrageous \u201cdoorbuster deals,\u201d which are available in very limited numbers, and shop from the comfort of your couch.Going to the grocery store without a list makes for a disorganized shopping trip. The same goes for Black Friday deal hunting. Knowing what you\u2019d like to save on will make the whole affair a lot less overwhelming and keep you from succumbing to impulse purchases you might regret.Your list will especially come in handy if you find a retailer offering a storewide discount. The laptop or blender you\u2019re hoping Amazon will discount might be available from another online store or from the manufacturer directly. If a retailer issues a storewide coupon, start adding those items to your cart and make sure they aren\u2019t exceptions.The same goes for items generally sold direct from the manufacturer. Amazon\u2019s inventory of J.

{"Headline": "Facebook Failed to Police How Its Partners Handled User Data", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook failed to closely monitor device makers after granting them access to the personal data of hundreds of millions of people, according to a previously unreported disclosure to Congress last month.Facebook\u2019s loose oversight of the partnerships was detected by the company\u2019s government-approved privacy monitor in 2013. But it was never revealed to Facebook users, most of whom had not explicitly given the company permission to share their information. Details of those oversight practices were revealed in a letter Facebook sent last month to Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, a privacy advocate and frequent critic of the social media giant.When a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the initial F.T.C.-mandated assessment in 2013, it tested Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Microsoft and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handset. In both cases, PricewaterhouseCoopers found only \u201climited evidence\u201d that Facebook had monitored or checked its partners\u2019 compliance with its data use policies. That finding was redacted from a public version of PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s report released by the F.T.C. in June.\u201cFacebook claimed that its data-sharing partnerships with smartphone manufacturers were on the up and up,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cBut Facebook\u2019s own, handpicked auditors said the company wasn\u2019t monitoring what smartphone manufacturers did with Americans\u2019 personal information, or making sure these manufacturers were following Facebook\u2019s own policies.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to just take the word of Facebook \u2014 or any major corporation \u2014 that they\u2019re safeguarding our personal information.\u201dIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \u201cWe take the F.T.C. consent order incredibly seriously and have for years submitted to extensive assessments of our systems.\u201d She added, \u201cWe remain strongly committed to the consent order and to protecting people\u2019s information.\u201dFacebook, like other companies under F.T.C. consent decree, largely dictates the scope of each assessment. In two subsequent assessments, Facebook\u2019s October letter suggests, the company was graded on a seemingly less stringent policy with data partners. On those two, Facebook had to show that its partners had agreed to its data use policies.A Wyden aide who reviewed the unredacted assessments said they contained no evidence that Facebook had ever addressed the original problem. The Facebook spokeswoman did not directly address the 2013 test failure, or the company\u2019s apparent decision to change the test in question.Because the United States has no general consumer privacy law, F.T.C. consent decrees have emerged as the federal government\u2019s chief means of regulating privacy practices at Facebook, Google and other companies that amass huge amounts of personal data about people who use their products. In letters and congressional testimony, F.T.C. officials have pointed to the decrees as evidence of robust consumer privacy protection in the United States.A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers acknowledged in a statement that Facebook defines the privacy procedures, known as \u201ccontrols,\u201d that are tested during the assessments.\u201cChanges to controls may occur as platforms evolve, such that a control tested in one period may not be identical in a subsequent period,\u201d the spokesman said.The October letter to Senator Ron Wyden details Facebook\u2019s oversight of its partnerships with device makers.While the assessment reports were publicly released by the F.T.C. in June, they included significant redactions, which Facebook and PricewaterhouseCoopers said were necessary to protect trade secrets.Mr. Wyden, whose staff had viewed the full assessments, said at the hearing that he found parts of the unredacted reports \u201cvery troubling\u201d and pressed Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, to release them in their entirety.The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based consumer rights group that helped obtain the 2011 consent decree, is currently suing the agency for release of the full assessments, arguing that the public cannot otherwise judge how effectively the F.T.C. is policing privacy violations.\u201cWhat is clear is that the F.T.C. has failed to enforce the consent order,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the privacy rights group. \u201cAnd this has come at enormous cost to American consumers.\u201dThe F.T.C. declined to comment.Facebook\u2019s compliance with the consent decree is the subject of a new F.T.C. investigation opened in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.In the letter last month, Facebook\u2019s vice president for United States public policy, Kevin Martin, noted that the assessors\u2019 findings had not caused Facebook to fail PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s overall evaluation: The assessors concluded that Facebook was operating \u201cwith sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance\u201d that it was protecting its users\u2019 privacy.It remains unclear whether Facebook has ever scrutinized how its partner companies handled personal data. A spokeswoman declined to provide any examples of the company\u2019s doing so.A BlackBerry official, who declined to discuss details of the companies\u2019 data-sharing agreement, said BlackBerry did not think that Facebook had ever audited its data use, but noted that BlackBerry\u2019s business model relies on protecting users\u2019 personal information.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Needs Amazon as Much as Amazon Needs Us", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street has dominated New York\u2019s economy for too long. Amazon\u2019s HQ2 is a huge opportunity to diversify.Mr. Chakrabarti is an architect, author and professor at Columbia University.For decades, experts have called for the diversification of the New York City economy. In the wake of postwar deindustrialization, our reliance on Wall Street and the financial industry in general had by the 1990s left our city disproportionately vulnerable to swings in the financial markets. We have experienced significant downturns that today feel like distant memories but could certainly return. I know this from my own experience as director of planning for Manhattan after Sept. 11. In those heady dark days, few spoke about gentrification or the supposedly ominous specter of new companies entering New York City. To the contrary, many worried that no one would build so much as a Quonset hut in this city again. Darker still were the memories of my older colleagues in city government, who helped rescue us from the nose-dive of the late 1970s, when New York City lost hundreds of thousands of jobs and crime ravaged our most vulnerable neighborhoods.It is for these reasons that we should welcome Amazon, but with a few caveats: To become true New Yorkers, the people at Amazon must abide by our implicit social compact, which is that New York City strives to be a place of opportunity for all. Amazon, the city and the state must build an \u201cinfrastructure of opportunity\u201d that creates both physical and social mobility for all New Yorkers, and they must do so with fiscal responsibility. While opinions differ regarding the incentive package offered Amazon, a few things are clear: Amazon obtained incentives available to any forward-looking large company seeking to relocate here. Second, government officials involved are confident that the deal will yield between $12 billion and $27 billion of direct economic benefit, which is many multiples of the incentives offered; and third, the incentives are part of the city and state\u2019s established budget to lure companies here \u2014 not money that would otherwise go to subways and schools. Beyond these incentives, government investments should be focused on significant improvements to the physical mobility of western Queens, including a reimagined subway, streetcar, bus, bike, scooter and ferry network. The agreement does establish an Infrastructure Fund using targeted tax revenue, but the details, time frame and scope for the improvements are murky and should be clarified. Amazon must participate as well \u2014 let\u2019s press those logistics experts less about a helipad and more about how they hope to transport thousands of workers to one of the most congested parts of our city. First steps have been made, along with commitments to make Amazon\u2019s new waterfront home accessible to the public in accordance with the Long Island City waterfront design guidelines. More significant is the potential to create a new paradigm for social mobility. We lost this along with our manufacturing base and never regained it by relying on Wall Street. Unsung treasures like LaGuardia Community College, Queensbridge Houses and the public schools and cultural institutions of Queens shouldn\u2019t be thrown the crumbs of this project. Amazon is proposing to locate in the most ethnically diverse county in the United States and near the nation\u2019s largest public housing project \u2014 the company\u2019s work force and campus must reflect the diversity around them. The current agreement with Amazon, which calls for $15 million to fund work force development and three years of direct engagement with Queensbridge Houses, is a good first step. More should be done, including a longer-term goal of 50 percent of all employees drawn from the borough. This is an enormous opportunity for Amazon to differentiate itself from its competitors by proving that it can help bridge what has become a gaping American class divide. Amazon will continue to be criticized about the way it held this competition, even though New Yorkers have long advocated more business growth outside of Manhattan. (Queens has a population similar to Chicago\u2019s but nowhere near the economic output.) Amazon will be criticized for its impacts on small retailers, although it arguably hurts big-box stores far more than mom-and-pops, which sell through Amazon. It will be criticized for being one of the world\u2019s richest companies, by both the left and the right. This isn\u2019t about one company. It is about fulfilling our collective dream of New York as a city of opportunity for millions of strivers of all colors, genders and creeds. Our new socioeconomic ladder appears to be digital, and we should embrace it, if \u2014 and only if \u2014 its creators have the tenacity and temerity to embrace us.Vishaan Chakrabarti is an architect, author and professor at Columbia University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Year After #MeToo, Hollywood\u2019s Got a Malaise Money Can\u2019t Cure", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResting in the film executive\u2019s sweaty palm was an extremely long rectangular pill stamped \u201cX-A-N-A-X.\u201d\u201cWant half?\u201d he said.It was a hot, windy night in mid-September, and we were walking to our cars after meeting for drinks at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills. I had expected a lively, gossip-fueled conversation, nothing for attribution, of course. Instead, our talk was more like a gloomy therapy session \u2014 in which I was the shrink.I rebuffed the Xanax by joking that even half looked big enough to tranquilize the Incredible Hulk and drove home. But the unsettling encounter stayed with me. I knew it wasn\u2019t just one guy having a bad day. Hollywood is in the midst of a full-blown identity crisis.But euphoria is almost nonexistent in studio hallways. The movie capital is instead mired in a profound malaise.The reason involves fallout from the #MeToo earthquake, both the positive changes it forced, and, lately, the pushback it has incurred. Contributing are the mega-mergers that have left Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox with new owners and may find Sony Pictures, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sold or reconfigured before long. The steady march of Big Tech into entertainment also plays a role. Hollywood power players have long clung to the fantasy that the world revolves around them, as if it were 1940 and they were all Louis B. Mayer. But that delusion has been hard to sustain with Amazon and Apple throwing around billions to make TV series, some featuring megawatt stars like Julia Roberts and Jennifer Aniston.In the 100-year history of Hollywood, rarely if ever has so much upheaval arrived so fast and on so many fronts. For streaming upstarts like Netflix and Amazon Studios, where the cultures are still forming and money is gushing, the disruption is invigorating. But the rest of the entertainment business is filled with a deep unease. It is not just old-guard men moping about the end of their supremacy. It\u2019s midlevel vice presidents at merging companies worried about whether they are about to lose their jobs. It is people initially excited by the Time\u2019s Up insurgency who are concerned about stagnation or even backsliding.\u201cThe vast majority of people feel completely unmoored,\u201d said Amy Baer, whose 30-year movie career has taken her from Sony Pictures to CBS Films to independent producing. \u201cThere is fear. There is tension. And there is no end in sight.\u201dPublicly, everyone in Hollywood says the same thing, almost as if reading from talking points written by publicists: We applaud this long overdue progress and will do everything in our power to make sure the culture changes.Some men in Hollywood quickly revert to sexist and offensive language when speaking anonymously, which is the only way the most powerful ones will talk to reporters. (This is a place, after all, where even corporate publicists say things like, \u201cStrictly off the record, I have nothing to say.\u201d)\u201cI was just curious,\u201d Ms. Baer said. \u201cThis guy is one of the good guys. But he looked at me like \u2018Oh, no \u2014 here she comes,\u2019 like I was taking aim at him, and that speaks to the tension.\u201dBeth Gulas, a management and organizational consultant who focuses on the entertainment industry, said Hollywood was more out of alignment than it seemed on the surface. \u201cThere is fear, but there is also anger,\u201d Ms. Gulas said. \u201cWomen with a point of view, many men with another. Older executives not understanding why younger executives and employees are so adamant about diversity and inclusion. Younger executives and employees angry at their bosses for letting it get this bad.\u201dThe only unifying characteristic: \u201cAll of this change is having a massive impact on people,\u201d she said. \u201cMassive \u2014 as in bigger than people really want to say out loud.\u201d\u201cBrands have become more leery of aligning themselves with actors because of #MeToo,\u201d said Janet Comenos, Spotted\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThat means potentially millions of dollars not flowing into the Hollywood ecosystem \u2014 the managers, the agents.\u201dIt is impossible to know, of course, whether such changes will end or even dramatically reduce the abuses of power that have made Hollywood the center of the #MeToo revolution. There is clearly a palpable difference in behavior. But will an out-of-control business culture that operated for decades be permanently transformed? It will take years to find out, and there is a growing disillusionment among some of those on the front lines.\u201cGenerally speaking, I still don\u2019t see a real willingness to do what it takes to change a troubled culture,\u201d Ms. Gulas said. \u201cIt takes investment, and it takes a lot of stamina to see it through. Most of these companies want a quick solution. They want a Band-Aid.\u201dThe six major studios (soon to be five) declined to comment on inclusion riders. One studio chief, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he feared drawing the fury of advocacy groups, said lawyers at his company nixed the notion because they feared that such quotas might prompt lawsuits under federal and state anti-discrimination statutes.On a more meta level, Hollywood is also wrestling with a question that challenges its core identity: What is a film? No movie backed by Netflix \u2014 shown primarily on TV sets \u2014 has ever been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, but that could change this year with \u201cRoma,\u201d a black-and-white period drama directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n that has been hailed as a masterpiece by critics who have seen it at festivals. It arrives in a smattering of theaters on Nov. 21 and on Netflix on Dec. 14.But studios are mostly worn down from #MeToo fallout. They have become accustomed, for instance, to rolling public relations emergencies.\u201cEstablished protocols \u2014 decades worth \u2014 are changing at lightning speed,\u201d Ms. Baer said. \u201cFor people like me, who believe change is desperately needed in Hollywood, that is exciting. But a lot of people are lost in anxiety.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That law requires online retailers to impose a 10 percent goods and services tax on items sold and shipped from overseas.\u201cAs a result of customer feedback, from 22 November Amazon customers will be able to ship eligible items from amazon.com to Australian delivery addresses,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement released early Thursday.After its initial decision to suspend exports to Australia, the company has focused on \u201cbuilding the complex infrastructure needed to enable exports of low value goods to Australia and remain compliant with GST laws,\u201d the statement added in reference to the goods and services tax.The company\u2019s initial decision to bar Australians from gaining access to the main Amazon site drew criticism in June from Scott Morrison, the country\u2019s current prime minister and then-treasurer.\u201cYou don\u2019t get a special deal because you\u2019re a big company or a multinational,\u201d Mr. Morrison said when asked whether companies would be exempt from the tax. \u201cI think it is disappointing that Amazon has taken this out on consumers in Australia \u2014 but that is their commercial position.\u201dThe reversal comes just before retailers hold their Black Friday sales \u2014 the annual frenzy of heavy discounts, and granting Australians access to the main Amazon site will could prove a timely boon for the company\u2019s efforts to draw local customers.But even with access to the Amazon\u2019s main site, Australians will face some roadblocks.

{"Headline": "Booksellers Protest Amazon Site\u2019s Move to Drop Stores From Certain Countries", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 More than 450 antiquarian book dealers in at least 26 countries pulled their books off an Amazon subsidiary on Monday, an impromptu protest after the site abruptly said it would drop all sellers from several nations.The stores are calling their action Banned Booksellers Week. The protest got its start after AbeBooks sent emails last month to booksellers in countries including South Korea, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia to say that it would no longer \u201csupport\u201d them. \u201cWe apologize for this inconvenience,\u201d the company said.As the news spread, even unaffected dealers were surprised and angered. AbeBooks, together with Amazon itself, is by far the biggest international marketplace for secondhand and rare books.AbeBooks lists millions of books and manages the payments. The booksellers mail the books directly from their shops. The platform was founded in 1995 and was bought by Amazon in 2008. It continues to operate independently, and many of its customers never even realize who the owner is. AbeBooks is based in Victoria, British Columbia, where it started.The Amazon subsidiary told the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers that it was scaling back because \u201cit is no longer viable for us to operate in these countries due to increasing costs and complexities.\u201dThe reaction was fierce. \u201cAbeBooks is saying, \u2018We\u2019re cutting you and your country off. It\u2019s nothing you did, we just decided we don\u2019t want to deal with you anymore,\u2019\u201d said Scott Brown, a bookseller in Eureka, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating.\u201dOne of the affected booksellers was Antikvariat Valentinska, a large antiquarian store in the center of Prague. \u201cThe decision to close our account on such short notice has come as a complete shock, especially since no reason was given, not even upon request,\u201d the store said in a statement. \u201cJust our company alone will almost certainly have to dismiss at least five employees.\u201dPeter Harrington, a leading London antiquarian dealer, said AbeBooks\u2019 \u201chigh-handed manner\u201d was at the root of the protest, with the platform taking the affected booksellers and \u201cdestroying their livelihoods in just a couple of impersonal sentences.\u201dSimon Beattie, a British bookseller, set in motion the impromptu strike on Thursday afternoon. \u201cI have decided to put my books on (permanent) vacation on ABE in solidarity with fellow booksellers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Korea and Russia,\u201d he wrote to colleagues. \u201cI hope you might like to follow suit.\u201dIn the tight-knit, if loosely organized, antiquarian community, the idea quickly spread.On Saturday night, in response to a query from a reporter, AbeBooks issued a statement saying it was dropping the countries because \u201cour third-party payment service provider is closing at the end of the year.\u201d It added that, \u201cWe regret that we cannot continue to serve all sellers.\u201dAsked how many booksellers and countries were affected, Richard Davies, an AbeBooks spokesman, said, \u201cI am not adding anything else to that statement.\u201dMr. Brown, one of the dealers organizing the protests, said that for many of the booksellers, AbeBooks\u2019 actions underlined both Amazon\u2019s power and its refusal to be accountable for it.\u201cThe biggest e-commerce giant in the world apparently finds it too complicated to do business in Prague,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to wonder who\u2019s next. We\u2019re all vulnerable to Amazon\u2019s capricious actions.\u201dUnderlying the mystifying nature of the action, Amazon itself is still selling merchandise from the banned countries, including books.Since Abebooks controls its storefront, the only recourse the protesting booksellers have is to tell it that they are \u201con vacation.\u201d The marketplace then puts a message next to their name saying, \u201cThis member\u2019s inventory is temporarily offline. Please check back later.\u201d There was no acknowledgment that this was not business as usual.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the British bookseller who set in motion a strike against AbeBooks.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Digital Renaissance\u2019 Argues Consumers of Media Never Had It So Good. Is That the Case?", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryThe maxim \u201cnever let a good crisis go to waste\u201d is usually applied to opportunistic politicians seeking to further an agenda. But it could be equally applied to businesspeople, who have often used economic challenges to elicit benefits from the government.Digitization has provided many such \u201ccrises.\u201d It has shaken industries and led business to turn to the government for help: Retailers have asked for protection from Amazon, taxi firms from Uber and hoteliers from Airbnb.But the resulting debates often ignore the relevant data and focus on the wrong questions. Joel Waldfogel\u2019s new book, \u201cDigital Renaissance: What Data and Economics Tell Us About the Future of Popular Culture,\u201d seeks to address that, with its examination of the tremendous disruption that the internet has wrought on the creative industries \u2014 music, book publishing, television and movies. And in his view, we should simply \u201csit back, relax and enjoy the renaissance,\u201d rather than accede to any cries for help from media businesses.Professor Waldfogel\u2019s thesis is disarmingly simple: What matters for culture, he says, is the well-being of media consumers, not media producers. So he exhaustively examines the quantity and quality of media produced since digital technologies became widespread and concludes that both are at an all-time high. End of story.That might have made for a short book, but \u201cDigital Renaissance\u201d analyzes a lot of data and research.Increases in content quality, of course, are highly subjective. To solve for this problem, Professor Waldfogel, an economist at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management, looks at the views of both the masses and the \u201cexperts.\u201d For instance, when it comes to books, he cross-correlated millions of reviews on Goodreads with lists of \u201cnotable\u201d books from experts over time.It is hard to argue with Professor Waldfogel\u2019s core conclusion from that kind of painstaking study: that the internet has greatly increased the quantity and overall quality of books, records, movies and TV shows.What is not clear, though, is that his broader conclusions regarding the health of our popular culture, in general, are justified.Although \u201cDigital Renaissance\u201d bills itself as a study of the \u201ccreative industries\u201d writ large, it concerns itself almost exclusively with hit-driven sectors. But not all creative businesses are hit driven in the same way. It is not evident why long-form journalism published as nonfiction books is covered but not newspapers and magazines, given the high cultural relevance and significantly different economics of the latter.An examination of the news industries undoubtedly would have also shown that there is more journalism being produced than ever because of the lower production costs. But it would also have shown an increase in the polarization in how news is consumed and a reduction of certain categories of culturally critical news \u2014 such as local investigative reporting \u2014 where costs have not fallen as fast.Even in the hit-driven sectors examined by \u201cDigital Renaissance,\u201d important digitally inspired changes are still afoot that require further examination before declaring cultural victory. Movie studios now overwhelmingly produce sequels, reboots and spinoffs; lists of the top 10 TV shows are dominated by sporting events. Professor Waldfogel spends no time exploring changes in how our time is spent within these industries or the role they play in a cultural life that now includes categories of media that did not exist before the digital revolution.One cannot fault Professor Waldfogel for the quality of his work regarding the narrow question he has chosen to analyze. In particular, his \u201cDigital Renaissance\u201d should be consulted by any regulator or legislator being solicited by a forlorn media mogul looking to protect a traditional business from disruptive market forces.While economic analysis can contribute to our understanding of the world, however, it alone cannot answer what we think is important to our culture. A full assessment of whether we are experiencing a true digital renaissance needs to consider that issue, too.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "Apple Will Stop Revealing How Many iPhones It Sells. That\u2019s a Bad Sign.", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has giant revenues, profit margins that are the envy of corporations everywhere and a stock market value of $1 trillion.Despite those obvious strengths, Apple told investors on Thursday that it would stop reporting numbers central to understanding the performance of its biggest business: selling iPhones.The company said it would no longer disclose how many iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold each quarter. Without this data, investors will not be able to track the average selling price of iPhones, a crucial number for assessing whether consumers are balking at paying up for Apple\u2019s higher-priced phones.The decision, along with Apple\u2019s disappointing forecast for this quarter\u2019s sales, helped drive the company\u2019s stock price down more than 7 percent on Friday, a move that weighed on the wider stock market.Apple\u2019s move to cut back its disclosures also should serve as a jolt for all investors.For much of the year, investors seemed to ignore the warning signs hanging over large technology companies and pushed their stocks higher. Their plunge last month \u2014 Netflix\u2019s stock is down 26 percent from its high, and Amazon is off 19 percent \u2014 has most likely made investors more aware of the problems these companies face in their core businesses.But Apple\u2019s decision to make its iPhone sales less transparent may underscore the seriousness of these challenges. \u201cAn abrupt loss of disclosure suggests weakness beyond one quarter,\u201d Jeffrey Kvaal, an analyst for Nomura, wrote in a research note.Sales of iPhones have stalled in recent years. As a result, Apple has raised prices to bolster its iPhone revenue. The average selling price of an iPhone was $793 in the three months through September, a 28 percent increase from a year earlier. Without the tally of phones sold, calculating the average selling price won\u2019t be possible, and outsiders will find it harder to gauge consumers\u2019 sensitivity to the price of iPhones. \u201cWe believe unit volumes and A.S.P.\u2019s are reflective of the loyalty and satisfaction consumers have in their devices,\u201d Mr. Kvaal wrote in his note, referring to average selling prices.Selling iPhones at a premium price to a relatively small portion of the global smartphone market has been at the heart of Apple\u2019s strategy. With less data, investors will probably find it harder to tell whether this approach remains successful.Other big technology companies have removed data from their regular financial reports. And some simply do not disclose figures that would be helpful in determining trends in their business. Twitter, for instance, does not provide the overall number of daily average users, a number that Facebook gives out.Facebook does not disclose Instagram\u2019s revenue, a number that would help investors understand the attraction of each platform to advertisers.Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, on Thursday contended that removing the data would not affect investors\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s performance. Over the last three years, he said, there was no correlation between price and the number of phones sold. And Apple said it would disclose new information, including the cost of sales for its two main businesses, called products (selling items like iPhones) and services (for instance, subscriptions to Apple music).But the new information may not make up for what\u2019s being taken away. Sales of iPhones accounted for nearly three-fifths of the company\u2019s revenue in its latest quarter. And the decision to stop providing iPhone sales comes at a pivotal time for smartphones. Sales of smartphones in more affluent countries are slowing as consumers hold onto their phones longer. While sales are still growing in emerging markets, such as India, the handsets that dominate those markets are cheaper. So as the sales mix shifts to those countries, it could crimp profit margins.\u201cI think we\u2019re at peak smartphone,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, a tech sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.Advertisement"}

Doing that just got easier, with the announcement on Tuesday that the company had raised $2 billion in new capital from Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund.Since its inception in 2016, the Vision Fund has had a singular goal: use its roughly $100 billion to take big stakes in companies it believes will redefine the future. It now holds investments in companies like WeWork, the owner of so-called co-working offices, and the vertical farming start-up Plenty.Coupang, one of South Korea\u2019s most popular e-commerce platforms, is the latest to benefit from the Vision Fund\u2019s largess. The company compares itself to Amazon, but unlike the American retail behemoth, it has the infrastructure necessary to deliver nearly all purchases to customers within a day, if not sooner.Since then, Coupang has spent heavily on its delivery options and on its RocketPay payment service. In the past two years, sales have doubled, and they are expected to climb to almost $5 billion this year. Many Coupang customers shop on its platform more than 50 times a year.Further growth requires more money, and around February the company began discussions with SoftBank about additional investment.\u201cThe primary job of this investment is to help us become a deeper part of customers\u2019 lives,\u201d Bom Kim, Coupang\u2019s founder, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to invest in new services and new experiences.\u201dCoupang\u2019s growth has come at a cost. The company lost more than 673 million Korean won, or about $598 million last year, according to data from S & P Capital IQ. And it faces competition from rival upstarts like Ticket Monster and traditional Korean retailers eager to combat newer entrants.Mr. Kim is undeterred. He said he expected Coupang\u2019s investments in its technology and delivery infrastructure, made possible by SoftBank\u2019s money, to give it an edge.He also said that recent controversy over Saudi Arabia, the biggest single investor in the Vision Fund, did not diminish his enthusiasm for the SoftBank fund\u2019s support. Of the cloud hanging over the Saudi government, which is accused of orchestrating the killing of a prominent dissident, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it represents SoftBank or us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company could also change direction and choose a different site all together. One person with knowledge of the discussions said Amazon executives were referring to the New York location as a \u201ccampus.\u201dAbout 10 million square feet of potential office space was identified in the area, according to a second person briefed on the discussions. The people who spoke about the plans declined to be identified because the deal has not been publicly announced.\u201cNew York, more than any other city in the country, can actually absorb something like this without it completely wiping it out,\u201d said Tom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy group. \u201cWe have more capacity than anywhere else.\u201dBut that does not mean there will not be challenges.The neighborhood, separated from Brooklyn to the south by the Newtown Creek, runs along the East River and is home to an expanding skyline that is crisscrossed by cranes and new construction. About 57,000 people live in the neighborhood, according to the city. The population is expected to rise sharply in the next two years, based on an analysis of new residential construction by the L.I.C. Partnership, a local business group.About 80,000 people work in the area, according to the city, at businesses that include JetBlue, Ralph Lauren and Silvercup Studios, where television shows and movies are shot. Uber and Lyft have offices in a building that also houses the Taxi and Limousine Commission.While most of the neighborhood\u2019s workers also live in Queens, about 8,500 travel from Long Island and roughly the same number commute from Manhattan. Aside from the 7 train, subway riders can access parts of the neighborhood via several other lines.One of those who commutes from Manhattan to Long Island City is Andrew Litavis, 27, who works at JetBlue and takes the W train.\u201cThe upside is lots of open seats, but the downside is sometimes 10-minute gaps between trains at rush hour,\u201d Mr. Litavis said.Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway and the L.I.R.R., declined to comment about Amazon\u2019s plans or its impact on transportation.The company\u2019s anticipated arrival has jump-started some ambitious, albeit unlikely, ideas about how to improve the city\u2019s transit system.Mr. Wright of the Regional Plan Association pointed to the idea of extending a proposed new rail tunnel under the Hudson River from New Jersey, not just to Manhattan, but through the borough, under the East River and into Queens. That would link commuter rails in New Jersey and Long Island and extend the places where future employees of Amazon, or other businesses in Queens, could live and have a relatively tolerable commute.A new Amazon headquarters also sparked hope that Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s vision of a streetcar running along the waterfront between Brooklyn and Queens, known as the B.Q.X., could finally be realized.\u201cThe campus would only reach its full potential with the B.Q.X.,\u201d said Jessica Schumer, executive director of the Friends of Brooklyn Queens Connector.But not everyone was ready to roll out a welcome mat. Community groups said Amazon should pay a gentrification tax to offset the anticipated effect of the new work force, whose annual salaries were expected to average $100,000, according to Amazon.State and local leaders \u201cshould be extracting concessions that would benefit struggling residents in Queens,\u201d said Jonathan Westin of New York Communities for Change, which advocates low-income housing.Asked on Tuesday about the possibility of a deal, Mr. de Blasio summarized the argument made by city and state officials, even as he cautioned that Amazon had yet to make an official announcement.\u201cI can tell you that it\u2019s been a long detailed process in which the City of New York has tried to make very clear the reasons why this is a great place for a company to be because we have the talent base here,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI mean, number one reason.\u201dBut Mr. de Blasio, whose administration has worked behind the scenes to encourage Amazon to relocate to the city, sought to distinguish himself from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has been so publicly effusive about the company that he joked that he would call himself \u201cAmazon Cuomo\u201d if that is what it took to lure the company.\u201cAmazon de Blasio?\u201d a reporter called out as the mayor took questions in Brooklyn.\u201cNo thanks,\u201d the mayor replied.As for the 7 train, it is in the process of being upgraded with modern signals \u2014 the second subway line to get new signals after the L train \u2014 that will allow more trains to run and ease the overcrowding.Public transit has been one of New York\u2019s greatest selling points, but the city is at a crossroads as it decides whether to invest billions to modernize the system, said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.\u201cThe 7 train has been particularly miserable while they\u2019ve been doing construction,\u201d Mr. Raskin said, but once the new system is in place, \u201cit should be one of the city\u2019s best.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crossing From Asia, the First Americans Rushed Into the Unknown", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterThree new genetic analyses lend detail, and mystery, to the migration of prehistoric humans throughout the Western Hemisphere.Nearly 11,000 years ago, a man died in what is now Nevada. Wrapped in a rabbit-skin blanket and reed mats, he was buried in a place called Spirit Cave.Now scientists have recovered and analyzed his DNA, along with that of 70 other ancient people whose remains were discovered throughout the Americas. The findings lend astonishing detail to a story once lost to prehistory: how and when humans spread across the Western Hemisphere.The earliest known arrivals from Asia were already splitting into recognizably distinct groups, the research suggests. Some of these populations thrived, becoming the ancestors of indigenous peoples throughout the hemisphere. But other groups died out entirely, leaving no trace save for what can be discerned in ancient DNA. Indeed, the new genetic research hints at many dramatic chapters in the peopling of the Americas that archaeology has yet to uncover.\u201cNow, this is the grist for archaeologists,\u201d said Ben Potter of the University of Alaska, who was not involved in the new papers. \u201cHoly cow, this is awesome.\u201dEarlier studies had indicated that people moved into the Americas at the end of the last ice age, traveling from Siberia to Alaska across a land bridge now under the Bering Sea. They spread southward, eventually reaching the tip of South America. Until recently, geneticists could offer little insight into these vast migrations. Five years ago, just one ancient human genome had been recovered in the Western Hemisphere: that of a 4,000-year-old man discovered in Greenland. The latest batch of analyses, published in three separate studies, marks a turnaround. In the past few years, researchers have recovered the genomes of 229 ancient people from teeth and bones discovered throughout the Americas.

Other teams have come to broadly similar conclusions, though many questions remain.NorthernbranchSouthernbranchNORTHAMERICAAncient Montana boySpirit CaveSOUTHAMERICABy The New York Times | Source: Cosimo Posth et al., CellThe first, described in January by Eske Willerslev, a geneticist at the University of Copenhagen, was an 11,500-year-old girl whose remains were found in eastern Alaska. The second was discovered hundreds of miles away, in western Alaska, and lived 9,000 years ago, Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues reported on Thursday in the journal Science.One group turned and headed north, following the retreating glaciers into Canada and back to Alaska. The other branch took a remarkable journey south. The genetic data suggest that this group spread swiftly across much of North America and South America about 14,000 years ago. The expansion may have taken only centuries. \u201cIt\u2019s basically an explosion,\u201d Dr. Willerslev said. The man from Spirit Cave in Nevada belonged to this so-called southern branch of migrants. He also was closely related to a 12,700-year-old boy found on the other side of the Rocky Mountains in Montana, Dr. Willerslev also found.But the man from Spirit Cave also turned out to have a close genetic link to 10,400-year-old skeletons found in Brazil, on the other side of the Equator.David Reich of Harvard University and his colleagues found a similar pattern in their own research, published on Thursday in the journal Cell. \u201cWe agree that this must be a rapid radiation,\u201d said Dr. Reich.Starting about 9,000 years ago, both teams found, additional waves of people moved southward. Dr. Willerslev\u2019s research suggests the new arrivals mixed with older South American populations. Dr. Reich, on the other hand, sees evidence for two waves of migrants who completely replaced the people who had lived in South America. The new research also revealed instances of remarkable continuity, kinships that spanned thousands of years. Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues compared the genome of the man from Spirit Cave to those of four sets of remains found nearby in Nevada\u2019s Lovelock Cave, who lived as recently as 600 years ago. A similar bond was found in the Andes. John Lindo of Emory University and his colleagues analyzed DNA from seven people who lived at high elevations between 6,800 and 1,400 years ago.\u201cThis is not something that you see in most other regions of the world,\u201d said Dr. Reich.In 2015, Dr. Reich and his colleagues found that some living people in the Amazon carry some DNA that\u2019s most similar to that of people who live today in Australia and New Guinea. In their new study, Dr. Reich and his colleagues found no trace of Population Y \u2014 but Dr. Willerslev\u2019s team succeeded in identifying their DNA in some of the 10,400-year-old skeletons in Brazil.\u201cThe million-dollar question obviously is, how did this happen?\u201d Dr. Willerslev said.Perhaps another group of Asians entered the Americas long before the ancestors of the man from Spirit Cave and other early Native Americans. Maybe they interbred with people in the Amazon before disappearing altogether.Or perhaps a few of the early members of the southern branch happened to have some odd genes that survived through the generations.The new rush of genetic samples reflects an improving relationship between scientists and indigenous peoples. For decades, many tribes rejected requests for DNA from researchers.The man from Spirit Cave, for example, was dug up by archaeologists in 1940 and stored in a museum. The local tribe, the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone, didn\u2019t learn of the body till 1996. For years they fought for its repatriation.\u201cIt\u2019s utterly disrespectful,\u201d said Rochanne L. Downs, a member of the tribe\u2019s cultural committee. \u201cIf someone went into Arlington Cemetery and dug the grave of one of the soldiers and took their medals, there would be outrage.\u201dInitially, the tribe was opposed to looking for DNA in the skeleton, because scientists would have to destroy much of it. Dr. Willerslev met with the tribe and explained that he would require only a tooth and a small piece of ear bone. The tribe agreed to give him one shot at finding DNA in the Spirit Cave remains.Dr. Willerslev\u2019s results led the Bureau of Land Management to turn over the skeleton to the tribe. They buried the man from Spirit Cave at an undisclosed location last year.Ms. Downs wouldn\u2019t rule out similar studies in the future, but said each request would require careful consideration.\u201cIt\u2019s all going to be on a case-by-case basis,\u201d she said. \u201cThe main thing is our respect for the remains.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Plans to Split HQ2 Between Long Island City, N.Y., and Arlington, Va.", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 After conducting a yearlong search for a second home, Amazon has switched gears and is now finalizing plans to have a total of 50,000 employees in two locations, according to people familiar with the decision-making process.The company is nearing a deal to move to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions. Amazon is also close to a deal to move to the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, one of the people said. Amazon already has more employees in those two areas than anywhere else outside of Seattle, its home base, and the Bay Area.Amazon executives met two weeks ago with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the governor\u2019s Manhattan office, said one of the people briefed on the process, adding that the state had offered potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies. Executives met separately with Mayor Bill de Blasio, a person briefed on that discussion said. Long Island City is a short subway ride across the East River from Midtown Manhattan.\u201cI am doing everything I can,\u201d Governor Cuomo told reporters when asked Monday about the state\u2019s efforts to lure the company. \u201cWe have a great incentive package,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that\u2019s what it takes,\u201d Governor Cuomo said. \u201cBecause it would be a great economic boost.\u201dJBG Smith, a developer who owns much of the land in Crystal City, declined to comment, as did Arlington County officials.About 1,800 people in advertising, fashion and publishing already work for Amazon in New York, and roughly 2,500 corporate and technical employees work in Northern Virginia and Washington.Amazon announced plans for a second headquarters in September 2017, saying that the company was growing faster than it could hire in its hometown Seattle. The company said it would invest more than $5 billion over almost two decades in a second headquarters, hiring as many as 50,000 full-time employees that would earn more than $100,000 a year on average.HQ2 would be \u201cfull equal to our current campus in Seattle,\u201d the company said. If Amazon goes ahead with two new sites, it is unclear whether the company would refer to both of the locations as headquarters or if they would amount to large satellite offices.Picking multiple sites would allow it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said.\u201cEven if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,\u201d said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site. With big presences in two cities, the local governments \u201cmight feel pressure to increase the incentives they are offering Amazon, and the surprise is yet another news cycle for the Amazon headquarters process,\u201d he said.The HQ2 search sent states and cities into a frenzied bidding war. Some hired McKinsey & Company and other outside consultants to help them with their bids, investing heavily in courting Amazon and its promise of 50,000 jobs. Even half of that would amount to one of the largest corporate location deals, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies. \u201cThese are very big numbers,\u201d he said.As Amazon\u2019s search dragged on, residents in many of 20 finalist cities worried about the impact such a massive project could have on housing and traffic, as well as what potential tax incentives could cost the community. The decision to split into two sites could alleviate some of that resistance.Seattle has been one of the fastest growing cities in the country, in part because of Amazon\u2019s growth. The company has about 45,000 employees in the city, and the company said it needed to hire more employees than the city could attract or absorb.\u201cNot everybody wants to live in the Northwest,\u201d Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon\u2019s retail division, said at a conference last year. \u201cIt\u2019s been terrific for me and my family, but I think we may find another location allows us to recruit a different collection of employees.\u201dAmazon gave cities six weeks to pitch themselves in a public courtship. Almost 240 municipalities responded, trying to lure the tech giant with marketing gimmicks, promises of new transit lines and, as proposals trickled out, billions in tax incentives.To meet its own deadlines, Amazon will need to move fast.

Look at What\u2019s on the Chef\u2019s Menu.", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "Bolivia DispatchSome of the most celebrated chefs in the Andes ventured deep into the Amazon on a quest for exotic ingredients. If the river turtle is too gooey, try the caiman.Supported byCACHICHIRA, Bolivia \u2014 The hunt began at nightfall under a crescent moon and with a chorus of frogs, which suddenly went silent when the rifles fired and the thrashing erupted. The bodies were dragged onto the deck of three boats: Six crocodilians were landed one night and 14 the next. Some were nearly eight feet long, head to tail.As gastronomy leaps from one trend to the next, the search for the next new thing has become a quest without end for many chic restaurants. And the role of the chef is changing, too: The greatest cooks these days are also the greatest storytellers, not just serving up meals, but also long yarns about the who, what and where of the origins of their ingredients.Which is why I was with some of the finest chefs in the Andes at Lake Colorada in northwestern Bolivia, home of the spectacled caiman \u2014 a relative of the alligator.Once every few years, a group of cooks and owners from acclaimed restaurants in Bolivia, Argentina and Peru hire a river boat to take them to places unlisted in the Michelin Guide and where no food critic has likely ever dared to tread.Here, at the lake and along the Beni River in the Bolivian Amazon basin, the restaurateurs were hunting for something new to cook.They said I could join them on this adventure, and on an October day I went ashore with the chefs at an indigenous village of the Tacana people, whose caiman-hunting season had just begun.The Tacanas had sent a delegation ahead to greet their visitors: A notary who takes caiman measurements, the village mayor who cuts fillets and two sharpshooters chewing huge wads of coca leaf which keeps them up at night as they spot the caiman\u2019s eyes with flashlights from a canoe.The caiman hunt would not be the only tale for the chefs on this trip for exotic new foods.Consider the big fish story to be told about the paiche, a freshwater monster that looks like a carp, but far larger and prehistoric-looking.Or the tale of cacao beans picked in the fall from trees that grow wild around the village of Carmen del Emero and which are composted in an undergrowth of strangler figs and jaguar droppings.Or the story of tuyo tuyo, the larvae of a beetle that lives in an Amazonian palm tree, long a delicacy in these parts and more recently served as an appetizer at Gustu, a famed restaurant in Bolivia\u2019s capital, La Paz.\u201cWe are seeing things hanging in your kitchens, foods you might not think people in cities would be interested in,\u201d Marsia Taha, the head chef at Gustu, said one night to the elders in the village. \u201cThese are the things we are looking to buy.\u201dThe food stories flow both ways, and sometimes, it\u2019s the outsiders who teach the locals about what\u2019s edible in this jungle.20 milesCarmen de Emerobolivia8Chachichira/Lake Colorada16Rurrenabaque200 milesBRAZILPERUArea of detailLa PazBOLIVIAPARAGUAYCHILEARGENTINABy The New York Times\u201cCallampa,\u201d said Mauricio Barb\u00f3n, the head chef at Amaz, a Lima, Peru, restaurant that specializes in using Amazonian ingredients. He was pointing to a fallen log with shelves of a flesh-colored fungus growing on it.\u201cWe\u2019ve never tried it before,\u201d said an intrigued Javier Duri Matias, a young Tacana leader who was showing us through the forest.The fungus looked almost exactly like an ear. Mr. Barb\u00f3n explained that his recipe calls for blanching the fungus in water before it is served. He tore off a piece, and we chewed away, savoring the spicy aftertaste while also hoping the chef was correct in the identification of his mushroom.As for the caimans in the lake, they are as much an experiment for conservationists as the chefs. A management program sets strict limits on how many may be hunted, of what size and when during the year. The Tacanas have learned they can earn far more selling certified pelts for export than they made when the hunting was uncontrolled.Now, the clan is also selling the flesh to these enterprising chefs.\u201cMeat was always, if you will, on the table as another resource that would allow them to get more out of every animal,\u201d said Rob Wallace, a director at the Wildlife Conservation Society in Bolivia, a nongovernmental group that helped the Tacanas develop the conservation plan for the caiman.The hunt, which goes on for several weeks in October, was a family affair. Mothers helped skin the meat as a baby swung in a hammock nearby. Others in the village played games with a large, luckless river turtle that lay on its backside, glum and unable to right itself.In the village, caiman was not the only meat on the menu.At one meal, the chefs discovered a giant tapir \u2014 a plant-eating mammal about the size of a pig with a short trunk \u2014 roasting on a grill and helped themselves to the ribs.\u201cI have never seen one dismembered this way,\u201d said Mr. Barb\u00f3n, licking his fingers. \u201cIt is truly delicious.\u201dBernardo Resnikowski, a restaurant manager who wears luxurious sleeve tattoos and moonlights as a D.J., later arrived with two Tacana men carrying machetes and a bowl of red, slightly fermenting fruit, called kecho, which he shared with Ms. Taha and Mr. Barb\u00f3n.\u201cNot enough flesh to eat, but you might blend them in a cocktail\u201d was Ms. Taha\u2019s verdict as she threw a handful into her mouth.By the time the party next saw the firepit, there were no signs of the tapir. Instead, the giant river turtle had taken its place, doomed to the grill with its shell cracked open and stuffed with potatoes and chili peppers.An old Tacana recipe book contains a litany of ways to make peta, their name for the creature, but the chefs seemed doubtful about the taste of the gooey innards, chewy skin and orphaned paws sitting atop rice.\u201cThis kind of meat wouldn\u2019t be legal to sell anyway, though the Tacanas are allowed to serve it in their villages,\u201d Ms. Taha explained, saying the measure was to protect turtle populations.\u201cWho said we would sell it to you if it were legal?\u201d barked Eduardo Cartagena, one of the village leaders, evidently enjoying his share of the turtle.As night settled, the Tacanas were back on Lake Colorada. I sat in the back of a leaky canoe as Rene Rub\u00e9n Lurici Aguilara, a sharpshooter, stood at the bow, a flashlight wedged between his chin and his shoulder, his rifle scanning the surface of the water.A pair of caiman eyes surfaced, glowing gold in the light of the torch. The hunter took aim. Not quick enough. The caiman submerged, submarine-like.It was the lucky one.By 1 a.m., our boat was heavy with the weight of the bodies of five large reptiles.While Gustu has been selling the caiman meat for some time, Amaz, in Lima, has had trouble getting a license to import the meat into Peru.But over breakfast Mr. Barb\u00f3n, the Amaz chef, couldn\u2019t help but daydream about how he might serve up caiman meat one day for his customers, who have included the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain.\u201cWe would try to fry it,\u201d he said. \u201cFrying is something everyone knows. What would you all do with it?\u201d\u201cWe try to use everything, down to the tail,\u201d said Gabriela Lafuente, the owner of El Baqueano in Buenos Aires, who purchases meat from a crocodile farm in Argentina.The chefs turned to Marcelo Saenz, a colleague of theirs at Jard\u00edn de Asia in La Paz.He paused for a moment and thought.\u201cCaiman sushi,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Neo-Banks\u2019 Are Finally Having Their Moment", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After the financial crisis 10 years ago, unhappy customers were expected to flee the megabanks for smaller competitors.It didn\u2019t happen. And the big banks became even more entrenched.Now another wave of alternative banks are at it again, and they say they\u2019ve learned from the mistakes of the upstart banks that tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 before them.Chime, the biggest new name to pop up, has opened two million fee-free online checking accounts and is adding more customers each month than Wells Fargo or Citibank.That has inspired a crop of newer start-ups, like Empower, which started its first fee-free online checking accounts, with lots of digital bells and whistles, in October.Venture capitalists are pouring money into American start-ups that are offering basic banking services \u2014 known as neo-banks or challenger banks. In 2018 so far, American neo-banks have gotten four times as much funding as they did last year, and 10 times as much funding as they did in 2015, according to data from CB Insights.Big players from outside the consumer banking industry, like Square and Goldman Sachs, are also moving in.\u201cIn consumer banking, you have what is one of the largest industries in the United States, in terms of profits, and at the same time one of the least disrupted industries, and the most unpopular with consumers,\u201d said Andrei Cherny, the founder of Aspiration, a neo-bank that has attracted nearly a million customers. \u201cThose three things create a perfect storm for disruption.\u201dThe persistent unpopularity of big banks has been a boon to the newcomers. And they are helped by a new attitude among financial regulators who have grown more comfortable with online banking and young customers who have no hesitation about cashing a check or sending money on a phone.\u201cEveryone is looking at cards and bank accounts as the next battleground,\u201d said Lindsay Davis, an analyst covering financial technology companies for CB Insights.The new financial outfits are trying to replace the old, branch-based way of banking with a mobile phone-friendly account that does away with the fees that have made banking giants so unpopular.Andrea Johnson, a dispatcher for a utility company in Michigan, switched to Chime after her old bank, PNC, charged her an overdraft fee as a result of another fee from the bank that had emptied her account.\u201cThat blew my mind: one fee leading to another fee,\u201d Ms. Johnson, 35, said. \u201cThey are going to find a way to nickel-and-dime you to death.\u201dSince she switched to Chime, Ms. Johnson said, she hasn\u2019t missed PNC\u2019s physical branches and has appreciated some of the start-up\u2019s perks, like getting money from her paycheck two days early.Chime, which has 100 employees in downtown San Francisco, makes money by collecting a fee from Visa every time its customers use Chime\u2019s debit card to make a payment. The company has received $105 million in investments from venture capital firms.\u201cIf you look ahead five years, there\u2019s no way there will be a financial services industry that is charging consumers $30 billion a year in overdraft fees,\u201d said Chris Britt, the chief executive of Chime. \u201cWe aim to shake that up, and I think a lot of other consumer companies will be doing the same thing.\u201dThe deposits going to start-ups like Chime and Aspiration are still a drop in the bucket compared with the trillions of dollars in accounts at places like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. New companies in the United States are also lagging those in places like China and Britain, where a much greater proportion of consumers have already fled to upstarts.These charters will allow start-ups like Varo to operate without relying on an established bank to hold their money, which adds significant costs.Most of the new companies have kept their money and run transactions through partner banks, generally smaller regional banks that don\u2019t have the money or the expertise to build out their own digital services.Traditional banks are recognizing the threat. Wells Fargo is testing an app-based banking product, Greenhouse, that does away with overdraft fees and service fees.JPMorgan Chase already offers a similar app, Finn, aimed at younger customers and announced last month that it was building a new fintech campus in Silicon Valley.The big banks have also held on to the interest payments they get rather than passing them along to depositors. That has created an opening for online companies. Empower is paying its customers 2 percent for deposits, compared with the 0.01 percent that Wells Fargo is offering.\u201cWe are reaching an audience that is underserved and even to the point of unbanked, which wasn\u2019t a stated goal, but it\u2019s something we love and want to lean into more,\u201d Square\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said at a conference in May.Advertisement"}

To the Editor:The decision by Amazon to place its second headquarters in Arlington, Va., and in Queens represents a blown opportunity to do something positive for the country. If it had chosen to place a second hub in one of the less stereotypically \u201ccoastal elite\u201d options on its list (or split between two of them \u2014 say, Columbus and Raleigh), Amazon could inject new energy, diversity and opportunity into regions suffering the negative side effects of globalization.Jeff Bezos could single-handedly do much to reverse the consolidation of America\u2019s urban professional class into a few cities, and thus begin to soothe some of the cultural divides.Placing a headquarters in the D.C. area will have a negative impact on American politics. Although politics has always been dominated by the wealthy, skyrocketing real estate prices in Washington have increasingly blocked young idealists willing to work long hours for low salaries. If the gentrification of Seattle is any indication, an Amazon headquarters in D.C. will result in more stories like the one this past week about Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being unable to afford an apartment in the nation\u2019s capital.To the Editor:My mind is plagued with disappointment and genuine concern now that it has been confirmed that Long Island City will be home to Amazon\u2019s HQ2 \u2014 or is it HQ1.5? I lived in New York City for 22 years, several of which I spent in Astoria, Long Island City\u2019s immediate neighbor. Over the years, I watched rents skyrocket, mom-and-pop shops convert into overpriced condos, and my town transform into a place that began to look like everywhere else.Amazon will only add to the destruction of Long Island City\u2019s and adjacent communities\u2019 sense of place, exchanging vitality and diversity for unfettered accumulation of wealth. The last thing the economic center of the world needs is more rich people.Amazon should have been honestly and openly vetted before it sinks its teeth into an already troubled culture of gentrification and inequality. I left New York City three years ago because my wife and I could no longer afford to raise our family there. I have no doubt that once Amazon is allowed to call New York its new home, I will soon be joined by thousands of other New Yorkers seeking refuge from one misguided company\u2019s insatiable greed.To the Editor:Although your article regarding Amazon\u2019s opening a headquarters in Long Island City refers to investments that Amazon has promised, it is not clear what the city will actually get in return for the up to $1.2 billion in tax breaks the company will receive from New York State. For example, what about desperately needed infrastructure improvements?Advertisement"}

The insurgent Democrats who were at the forefront of the party\u2019s successful effort to take over the State Senate have repeatedly expressed hostility to the movement....it seems highly likely that a New York Legislature entirely under Democratic control will restrict the number of new charter schools that can open, and tighten regulations on existing ones.\u201dGovernor Cuomo also recently softened his support for charter schools as he eyes a potential White House bid.Xavier\u2019s mother, Janet Guillen, of Inwood, said she has been out of work because of the demands of caring for Xavier.She had been working at a grocery store when she found out she was pregnant.\u201cI never thought I was going to have a kid,\u201d she said. \u201cAt 38 \u2014 what?

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York and Washington are leaving the rest of the country behind. Companies like Amazon explain why.In the end, even Amazon has behaved according to this rule: In the modern tech economy, cities that already have wealth, opportunity, highly educated workers and high salaries will just keep attracting more of them.\u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely hard-wired into technology economies,\u201d said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a sort of interesting thing that happens \u2014 it\u2019s inherent to the technology.\u201d \u201cThis is a very rational decision for Amazon to make in the micro; in the macro, it reinforces a really challenging trend for the U.S. economy,\u201d said John Lettieri, the president of E.I.G. \u201cThe divide between prosperous and distressed regions is growing wider. And it\u2019s because of things like this.\u201dIn previous economic expansions, E.I.G. has found, the benefits were more broadly felt, and growth was driven by more places, including rural communities. Today, data points about the national economy no longer describe well what\u2019s happening on the ground in many places. Part of what has changed is that the American economy has become dominated more by companies like Amazon, which produce services instead of manufactured products, and thus employ software engineers instead of assembly line workers. \u201cIf you are in the business of making new things \u2014 whether it\u2019s a new product, or a new way of delivering things, or a new service \u2014 and it\u2019s something that is unique, and it keeps changing and it needs updating, the most important factor of all is human capital,\u201d said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s not like making soap, or like making textiles.\u201dIn its request for proposals, Amazon asked for good airport connections, public transit and strong universities. But it\u2019s not quite right to say that New York and Washington will probably win because they have these things. Rather, the presence of these amenities makes possible what Amazon was really looking for: that intangible thing that happens when certain kinds of workers are clustered in the same place.\u201cThis is too profound a structural shift to reverse,\u201d Mr. Lettieri said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to reverse. That\u2019s just the nature of the economy today.\u201d But maybe we can slow down this shift, he said, or find better ways to ensure that more people get to benefit from what\u2019s happening in superstar cities, and that more places get to join in this process. Mr. Lettieri argues that what\u2019s good for New York doesn\u2019t have to be bad for other parts of the country.It plainly looks that way in Amazon\u2019s case, however, because of the public sweepstakes the company invited. These 50,000 jobs that look likely to go to New York and Washington are 50,000 jobs that won\u2019t go to smaller finalists like Columbus or Nashville. Or to even smaller places, like Tucson or Fresno, that dropped out of the running months ago.Advertisement"}

Contributing Opinion WriterThe solution, then, must be an armistice. States and cities need to collectively swear off big-dollar economic deals aimed at particular companies. If no one offers them, corporations will have to figure out where to locate on their own.There\u2019s nothing to love about these incentives. Republicans should be outraged by the idea of government picking winners and insist instead that companies be left to choose locations based on the conditions they need to operate their businesses, not sweetheart deals. Democrats should oppose them because they are starving state and city coffers of funds needed for important services, such as schools.

{"Headline": "Five Things to Bring on Every Long Flight", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravel tipsKeep yourself sane, snug, and distracted while you fly through the air with the greatest of ease.As an inveterate traveler, I fly multiple long flights a year. My personal longest was 17 hours from Johannesburg to Atlanta, but 10-12 hour flights are my norm. But then, I\u2019ve been on sub-5 hour flights with fellow passengers lamenting how it was \u201csuch a long flight.\u201d It\u2019s all relative. No matter your definition, there are two keys to making any long flight seem short: comfort and distraction. Here are five(ish) items to help pass the time and miles.Every major airline, and most of the smaller ones, have seat back entertainment. Generally these are of the on-demand variety, letting you choose from a variety of movies and TV episodes. But will they be the movies and TV shows you actually want to watch? You\u2019re probably better off bringing what you want. Netflix, Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, and others all have mobile apps that let you download content to watch offline. If you paid for the movie or episode, you shouldn\u2019t have an issue downloading it. If it\u2019s Netflix, or included with Amazon Prime streaming, there\u2019s no guarantee, though, and you should check well before your flight. You will not be able to stream anything from these services on the plane, even if you pay for the in-flight Wi-Fi. You\u2019ll probably have a hard time downloading at the airport too, so this is all something best done at home.Since you\u2019ll likely use your phone or tablet for a good chunk of the flight, you\u2019re going to need to keep it charged. Long-haul flights usually have an airline\u2019s oldest planes, so you can\u2019t be sure if there will be a power or charging outlet available at your seat.Noise canceling headphones reduce steady droning sounds like airplane engines. They\u2019re not a cone of silence, but can make flights can go from \u201cclamorous and tiring\u201d to \u201cloud, but tolerable.\u201d At least, the best ones can. For the past several years, I\u2019ve reviewed every major noise canceling headphone on the market, and even though there are dozens to choose from, the vast majority reduce very little actual noise.You could, if you want to go the really budget route, just use earplugs (which many airlines provide in amenity kits). However, those rely on getting a good seal between the plugs and your ear canals which, on some people (like myself), isn\u2019t easy. Plus, even if you get a good seal, the sound of an aircraft engine probably isn\u2019t going to be reduced as well as it would be with a good pair of noise canceling headphones.I\u2019ve never been on a flight that had a steady or predictable temperature. It\u2019s pretty much impossible, given the cold air outside, the humid, heat-producing mammals inside, and that pesky ball of fusion in the sky (or the lack thereof, depending on the time and weather). Layers are key. Some airlines will give you a threadbare blanket to \u201cwarm\u201d yourself if it gets really cold, but I\u2019ve never regretted bringing a hoodie or pullover. Worst case, it doubles as a pillow. I\u2019ve had good luck with Smartwool outer layers, but they\u2019re expensive and really anything easily removable will work here. I also tend to never wear shorts since I\u2019ve been cold on planes more regularly than I\u2019ve been hot, but you know your body best.Different parts of the plane will also have some effect on the temperature. Window seats are likely cooler than aisles, and exit rows cooler than all others.There is a massive market for in-flight comfort products. Most are pretty useless. For example, if you only fly once or twice a year, spending money on a travel pillow probably isn\u2019t worth it. Before you\u2019re tempted to spend money on things you\u2019ll use once or twice, consider saving that money for a seat upgrade.However, other things may be good to pack in your carry-on. Most airlines on long, overnight flights, will also give you a sleep mask and a small tube of moisturizer, both of which you might find handy to bring yourself if you have a mask or brand of lotion you prefer. Airplane air gets very dry, and even at night there are lights around the cabin you might find distracting.Usually you\u2019ll get a bottle of water for free, but if you\u2019re the thirsty type, bring an empty water bottle and fill it before you board. A snack won\u2019t hurt either; just keep in mind that many countries, especially smaller island types, won\u2019t let you enter with fresh fruit.Advertisement"}

How the Flatirons got their name became clear as I made my way up the First-Second Flatiron Trail. A seemingly endless cascade of large pinkish-brown stones led upward into the trees and brush. Mottled with a spray of green-gray lichen, they nearly resembled a camouflage pattern. I stopped at some point during my ascent and looked toward the southeast, where in the distance, a small rainbow was peeking through the clouds out over downtown Denver, about 25 miles away. I found it easier than surfing, but tricky nonetheless. I spent the first 30 minutes paddling from my knees on the long, wide board until I found the nerve to attempt to stand, and promptly fell into the reservoir. But after about a half-dozen falls I got the hang of it, and we spent the next hour paddling like a couple of gondoliers around the peaceful and largely empty reservoir.I spent the next few hours hiking most of the 4.1-mile trail and then doubling back. Bring plenty of water \u2014 the hike isn\u2019t difficult, but the sun is strong and the air is thin. But the pristine mountain panoramas are unmatched, and I came across only a handful of people on my hike. There were animal sightings, too, including mule deer and many cute yellow-bellied marmots.I was happy, too, as I got back into the car with my bounty. For having spent a mile (or two) up in the sky during the entirety of a four-day trip, it all felt amazingly down to earth.Advertisement"}

I asked him for an informal update: He came up with 14 pros versus 22 cons.That abundance of negativity isn\u2019t intended as a quantitative assessment of the market\u2019s prospects, but it does give a rough sense of his view and, I think, of the perspective of many skittish investors.\u201cWe were bullish for a long time, but right now I\u2019d say I\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a time to be cautious.\u201dI also asked James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in Minneapolis, for his sense of the market. An economist, Mr. Paulsen is worried about stocks because he is worried about the economy, he said. While the United States is not in a recession now, he said, \u201cwe have moved into the ballpark of a recession.\u201d\u201cIt gets somewhat easy, with a little experience, to recognize when you\u2019re in the ballpark of a recession,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThat is where we are now, and that alone is quite a bit of information.\u201dGiven his current outlook, which is that the probability of a recession within two years is reasonably high though not certain, \u201cthis is a good moment to take a little risk out of your portfolio, just in case things turn down,\u201d he said.The stock market, Mr. Paulsen said, often moves in advance of a recession \u2014 and a declining market can help cause a recession \u2014 making investment timing extremely difficult now. In this dangerous environment, he said, \u201cright now, I\u2019d be a little careful.\u201dMr. Hickey, too, advises caution, because when he enumerates the pros and cons for the market, the positive side is scanty. It includes factors like these:\u25a0 The yield curve \u2014 the difference between long- and short-term interest rates \u2014 remains in a bullish zone, although that positive margin has been narrowing and bears close watching.\u25a0 Finally, there is already so much bad news about the stock market that it amounts to good news. According to contrarian logic, Mr. Hickey said, the negatives are baked into stock prices, so the market has room to rise.That last item may be a stretch. It is an indication, he said, that he is having difficulty being upbeat.The stock market negatives on Mr. Hickey\u2019s list, by contrast, are straightforward. A sampling includes these items:\u25a0 The trend of stock prices has been quite negative. While a string of strong days could turn that around, momentum is bearish.\u25a0 Despite Mr. Powell\u2019s latest comments, the Fed is still tightening monetary policy, which could easily derail the stock market and the economy.\u25a0 The fiscal stimulus provided by the tax cut is, increasingly, behind us. Combined with tighter monetary policy, the loss of fiscal stimulus could hurt the American economy.\u25a0 Tariffs have been rising, and business sentiment has been depressed by the prospect of widening trade wars.\u25a0 Global economic growth has been slowing, and many stock markets around the world are already in bear market territory.\u25a0 The domestic housing market has weakened, homebuilder stocks have plunged, commodity prices have fallen, and auto sales are relatively weak.\u25a0 The tech sector, which propelled the market higher earlier in the year, has now lost hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Because of the importance of stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Apple, the psychological \u201cimpact of their weakness can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d Mr. Hickey said.\u25a0 Corporate debt levels are high, creating new vulnerabilities.\u25a0 The rate of earnings growth is likely to decline. That could disappoint Wall Street analysts and shake up the market.And that\u2019s just a start. The negatives go on and on.Yet even despite these portents, a gloomy financial outlook may not be entirely appropriate. For example, neither Mr. Hickey nor Mr. Paulsen is confident that the bull market is over or that a recession is likely to arrive soon.\u201cThere could be another strong bull run,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a good sense of that until at least the end of the year.\u201dI asked Mr. Paulsen to make the strongest case he reasonably could for upbeat economic and market outcomes for the next two years. In response, he said it was possible that the Fed would soften its monetary policy enough to extend the economic recovery and bolster the stock market. If the economy keeps growing and corporate earnings keep rising, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks will rise, too.The odd conditions of 2018 have already made stock valuations more attractive. Because prices have been flat while earnings have risen, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has declined to about 18, from about 23.5 in January, he pointed out.If that trend continues, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks might become rather enticing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go into a recession and if interest rates don\u2019t rise too much, at some point stocks could look good enough to set off another bull run,\u201d he said.But he added that he wouldn\u2019t bet on it with money needed to pay the bills in the next couple of years.After a nearly 10-year bull run, the downside of the market is becoming increasingly obvious.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Amazon Warehouse Comes to SoHo ", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritical ShopperOur shopper visits the new Amazon 4 Star store, which stocks items with customer review ratings of four stars or better. Brick and mortar never had it so rough. I have a faint memory of an article I read some years back detailing the grim life of a shelf picker in an Amazon warehouse. It described the arrangement of products on shelves \u2014 unlikely juxtapositions determined wholly by algorithm. A worker\u2019s life was disorienting; you never knew where anything might be. Nail clippers might be next to stone humidifiers or HVAC filters or picture frames. The worker was given a product location and ran to it. Then another. And again. The warehouse was a game, the products little more than flippers in search of a pinball to thwack.This holiday season, you are the pinball.Amazon has recently opened Amazon 4-Star, a catchall gift shop in SoHo \u2014 about 100 feet from Balthazar and the MoMA Design Store \u2014 that\u2019s part of the company\u2019s slow seep into physical retail. It is grim. A permanent store with the harried, colorless mood of a hastily assembled clearance-sale pop-up. Lot-Less Closeouts stores have more vim and charm.Amazon 4-Star asks what would happen if the logic of the warehouse writ raw was applied to a traditional storefront. Who needs a warehouse picker when the customers can do the work themselves?Spending time browsing here was among my most dismal shopping experiences in recent memory: joyless, arbitrary, spiritually empty. And that was before a 20-something guy bounded into the store and started screaming: \u201cAlexa! Alexa! Alexa!\u201dSome sections are arranged logically: children\u2019s toys, kitchen items, smart-home tools. (I use \u201csection\u201d very loosely. On the wall, each one is perhaps a couple of feet wide.) And each item tag has a price, a lower price for Amazon Prime members (sometimes) and an average star rating (along with the number of customers who rated it).About that 4-Star name, though. Thing is, I know there\u2019s a fifth star. Four stars out of five is already a concession. What\u2019s on offer aren\u2019t the most premium products, but rather ones that are pretty good. Add to that the fact that I found several items in the store that actually have a rating below four stars. Say, the iRobot Braava Jet 240 wet mop ($199/$169; 3.8), or Don\u2019t Lose Your Cool, ($19.99/$10.42; 2.4), a party game that includes a contraption you strap to your head that measures rises in heart rate and which presumably was tested on customers shopping here.You trust a store because you trust how it was curated. That\u2019s true whether it\u2019s Walmart or Dover Street Market. But there is little oversight here beyond the Amazon imprimatur. In several places, products are arranged by theme. Again, I use \u201ctheme\u201d loosely: \u201cTop Selling Around NYC,\u201d \u201cMost Wished for Books on Amazon.\u201dOn the Trending table, a Lego advent calendar ($29.99; 4.7) was next to a Panasonic Arc 5 electric razor ($199.99/$99.99; 4.5), which was next to a tub of CeraVe moisturizing cream ($15.06; 4.6) and just inches from Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir, \u201cBecoming\u201d ($32.50/$19.50; 4.8). A couple of tables away, a Big Gulp-size Yankee Candle in a surprisingly not acrid Christmas Cookie scent ($17.99; 4.1) was next to \u201cLess,\u201d a novel by Andrew Sean Greer that won the Pulitzer Prize ($15.99/$10.87; 3.7).These are chaotic arrangements, on tables set among floor paths that resemble a field maze. Decoration and filigree is minimal. There were a couple of afterthought cardboard trees on the electronic gift guide table, but not much beyond that. Almost every 10 minutes, a UPS handler would roll in a hand truck filled with those signature Amazon boxes, presumably loading up the store with inventory.Now look, I rely on Amazon Prime just like the next hypocrite, and I understand how one\u2019s needs aren\u2019t cleanly categorizable. But this store treats commerce like a tornado. On one table, there was a tossed-together collection of light winter jackets less organized than what you\u2019d find in the Times Square H&M; underneath the table was a set of cardboard boxes with sizes written in marker on the side. Forget farm-to-table; this is pallet-to-checkout.Maybe I was using the wrong approach \u2014 absorbing the store as a whole, and not like a warehouse picker in search of a specific item. So I went through my mental inventory of home problems that need solving. Inspired by a friend\u2019s recent purchase of a 75-inch television (insert drool emoji), I sought out the electronics section. But there was only one option, a meager 55 inches. There was an impressive-looking Sonos Beam Soundbar ($399/$349; 4.1), but that felt like something to address later, once the main itch had been scratched.Then, a manageable ask. Over Thanksgiving weekend, my mother gave serious side eye to the pan I use to make eggs, which after years of use resembles something extracted from a barn on \u201cAmerican Pickers.\u201d Easy enough. I went to the kitchen section but found that there were none. Well, strictly speaking, there was one: a tree-ornament version, the 3.5-inch Lodge miniature skillet ($6.25/$4.69; 4.4), good for a single egg or a quick wallop on the head, which, by this point, would have been sweet relief.Advertisement"}

Take the 2012 remake of the Cold War drama \u201cRed Dawn.\u201d It  depicted Chinese enemies invading an American town.In the end, MGM spent $1 million digitally erasing evidence of the Chinese Army, frame by frame, and substituting in North Koreans instead.China wields enormous influence over how it is depicted in the movies Americans make and watch. It\u2019s part of a broader push by the government to take control of its global narrative and present a friendlier, less menacing image of China to the world.China\u2019s booming box office and seemingly inexhaustible cash reserves have provided a much-needed boost to Hollywood as it faces slowing ticket sales in the United States and challenges from Amazon and Netflix.But Hollywood\u2019s embrace of China has not come without strings attached.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see something that\u2019s like \u2018Seven Years in Tibet\u2019 anymore,\u201d said Larry Shinagawa, a professor at Hawaii Tokai International College who specializes in Asian and Asian-American studies. Studios that make films critical of China, he said, risk being banned from releasing movies in the country.At stake for China is more than just the validation of Hollywood\u2019s powerbrokers and celebrities. In speeches and at forums, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well\u201d \u2014 to make sure a coherent, compelling and, most important, Communist Party-sanctioned narrative of China\u2019s rise to power reaches global audiences.\u201cThere is a notion that its propaganda has not worked well enough,\u201d said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cSo this is where the film industry comes in. There\u2019s a real sensitivity to the blockbuster power of Hollywood.\u201dChina has raised its influence in Hollywood by bankrolling a growing number of top-tier films.Of the top 100 highest-grossing films worldwide each year from 1997 to 2013, China helped finance only 12 Hollywood movies:199719992000200520062007200820102012201319971999200020052006200720082010201220131997199920002005200620072008201020122013But in the five years that followed, China co-financed 41 top-grossing Hollywood films:201520162014201720182014201520162017201820142015201620172018Hollywood studios are also eager to grab a slice of China\u2019s fast-growing box office market, which surpassed the United States\u2019 in total revenue for the first time ever in the first quarter of 2018.Success in China can make up for a disappointing box office performance at home or even transform a hit into a global blockbuster. By the same token, getting shut out of the Chinese market can be devastating for a movie.That\u2019s a powerful incentive to avoid causing any offense to China.One of China\u2019s top movie regulators spelled it out in a speech at the U.S.-China Film Summit in Los Angeles in 2013.\u201cWe have a huge market, and we want to share it with you,\u201d said Zhang Xun, then the president of the state-owned China Film Co-Production Corporation, speaking to a room full of Hollywood executives.Then came the condition. \u201cWe want films that are heavily invested in Chinese culture, not one or two shots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to see positive Chinese images.\u201dChina\u2019s campaign to push a positive image abroad has extended beyond Hollywood.Since then, China has stepped away from the big-budget co-production model, focusing instead on making features that cater to its large and still-expanding domestic market. To do that, it has enlisted Hollywood talent \u2014  producers, technical experts and even top celebrities.But they have had to walk a fine line.A number of actors, musicians and other celebrities have been barred from entering the country over behavior deemed inappropriate or critical of the Chinese Communist Party.Here\u2019s why some of them were barred from China:The difference in the \u201cChinese perspective\u201d was most evident in CGTN\u2019s coverage this year of an unexpected proposal to abolish presidential term limits in China\u2019s Constitution. While Western news media outlets raced to explain why the amendment, which would open the door to President Xi\u2019s indefinite rule, was unprecedented, CGTN\u2019s anchors were calm \u2014 and eerily synchronized \u2014 in their message praising the change.It is difficult to tell whether China\u2019s push to soften its image through movies, media and cultural projects has been successful.\u201cChinese soft power has not been that successful outside of the developing world,\u201d said Stanley Rosen, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies Chinese society and cinema. \u201cIf China does have any soft power, it\u2019s probably because of the success of their economy and the Chinese model that they\u2019re pushing very hard now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "M.T.A. Warns of Fare Increases and Service Cuts as Budget Crisis Looms", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority is facing a looming budget crisis that could lead to major fare increases or drastic cuts to subway and bus service, officials warned Thursday.The transit agency, which is still struggling to fix New York\u2019s sputtering subway, needs an influx of new funding to avoid serious consequences for subway and bus riders, officials said.Subway and bus fares are expected to rise in March, when the base fare could jump to $3. Without new revenue or significant service cuts, fares might have to rise by an additional 15 percent in the coming years to address the agency\u2019s growing deficits.\u201cUntil we can get sustainable additional revenue streams, we really have no choice but to look everywhere \u2014 including to our riders \u2014 to help us fill those holes,\u201d Andy Byford, the subway\u2019s leader, told reporters after a budget presentation to the M.T.A. board.On Thursday, Peter Ajemian, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, reiterated his position: \u201cAs the governor has said, there should be no fare increase until riders get the service they deserve.\u201dThe latest deficits were caused in part by declining ridership, which has led to lower revenue projections, officials said. The decline is worrisome because it is happening as the city\u2019s population is increasing and tourism is booming.Officials blamed the drop on competition from Uber and other ride-hail apps, and on night and weekend closings for construction work that are needed to fix the system. Some riders, fed up with constant delays, have simply abandoned the subway.At the same time, tolls on M.T.A. bridges and tunnels could increase by 8 percent for E-ZPass users. At the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge \u2014 already one of the country\u2019s most expensive crossings \u2014 where tolls are collected only when entering Staten Island, the E-ZPass toll could rise to $12.44, up from $11.52, and the toll via mail could increase to $19, up from $17.The board will vote in January about whether to raise fares and tolls in March and by how much. Some transit advocates have said the fare increase should be canceled because service is so unreliable. They are urging Mr. Cuomo to instead pass a comprehensive transit funding plan in Albany with congestion pricing at its core.\u201cRiders have been paying more every two years for almost a decade,\u201d said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. \u201cBut in that time, public transit service has deteriorated.\u201dMr. Lhota returned to the authority last year to help fix the failing subway. But he soon faced questions over potential conflicts of interest and outside jobs.Mr. Cuomo announced Mr. Lhota\u2019s departure last week, even though last month Mr. Lhota had responded to questions about whether he was leaving by saying that his term ended in 2021. Mr. Cuomo praised Mr. Lhota in a recent radio interview and said Mr. Lhota had never planned to stay in the job for long.\u201cThe original understanding was he would just help out for a period and then do his substantial work that he\u2019s doing in the private sector,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cHe fulfilled that commitment to me.\u201dAsked why Mr. Lhota resigned so quickly \u2014 just before the debate over fares \u2014 the authority\u2019s acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, joked that Mr. Lhota had left him in a difficult situation.\u201cIt reminds me \u2014 I have to include something very special in his stocking for the holidays,\u201d Mr. Ferrer said.The authority expects growing deficits of $510 million in 2020, $816 million in 2021 and $991 million in 2022, Robert E. Foran, the agency\u2019s chief financial officer, said Thursday. Projections for passenger revenue have dropped by $485 million through 2022, he said. At the same time, the agency\u2019s debt is expected to reach more than $42 billion by 2022.On Thursday, Mr. Byford said he would continue to press state and city leaders for new funding and wanted to avoid severe cuts to subway and bus service.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go down this route,\u201d Mr. Byford said. \u201cIt\u2019s anathema to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon to Queens? Jonathan Adler is Ready", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydomainsThe designer on bongs, white jeans and his new get-it-quickly collection, Now House.Trained in semiotics and art history at Brown, Mr. Adler has long been known for his exuberant style that is also a big tent of references. It was nearly 30 years ago that the designer, now 52, made a line of quilted pottery inspired by Chanel bags, and 20 years ago that he opened his first home store on Broome Street. His company now has 17 stores worldwide, a wholesale and e-commerce business, and a residential and commercial design practice.Last month, Mr. Adler introduced a collection for Amazon called Now House: whimsical objects and furniture in mod black and white and postmodern pastels. Delivery is free and speedy with an Amazon Prime membership. A stoneware \u201cWink Box,\u201d shaped like an eye, is $30 and can be to you the day after tomorrow; a Josef sideboard, honey-colored wood with a whorled pattern on its doors ($798), will take a little longer. Below, he answered some pressing questions.Before we get to that collection, what\u2019s this tray of ashtrays and vessels printed with red lips and joints and marijuana leaves?It\u2019s an exclusive for a pot store called Higher Standards, a capsule collection. I always say, \u201cLive clean and decorate dirty.\u201d I don\u2019t smoke or do any drugs, but you can get a decorative dirty frisson.But you used to?When I was a teen, I started making bongs. That was the great thing about being a potter. You could make bongs. I used to smoke a lot of pot and listen to a lot of Grateful Dead. Until I realized that I actually didn\u2019t really like either. I just thought I was supposed to. Being a bong-making teenager gave me a shot at popularity. The shot missed, by the way. But bongs were and are and always will be a fun challenge, a tough marriage of form and function.How often do you work in clay these days?All the time. The pottery studio is still where I work out my ideas. My design practice is craft based: It\u2019s a digital world, but I\u2019m an analog dude. Clay is my main medium and my forever love. Side note, I work in white stoneware and I wear white jeans every day so you can\u2019t see the clay splatters on my pants. Pottery studio; funerals; brises: white jeans only. When I was coming up in the \u201980s, postmodernism was primarily aesthetic, not theoretical: this visual mash-up of \u201cno new tale to tell,\u201d the whole mix that comes from pulling references from any and all eras and recontextualizing them. I hope I have a vast and considered knowledge of the past, present and future, and I put it all in my visual blender and see what unfolds. So yeah, there are some \u201980s references and some futuristic references. Some Werkstatte-y references like this \u2026(Mr. Adler held up a tall mint green powder-coated metal vase with a grid of cutouts below the rim, $48.)This is a perfect example, very Josef Hoffman-y but reinvented in a minty package. When I look at the Wink Box at home on my computer, Amazon suggests things that I might also like. These include a \u201cDry Guy Boot Dryer,\u201d vacuum sealer rolls with a cutter box and an \u201cAlaska Bear\u201d natural silk pillowcase. I have no idea what these things are.Sounds like you are into some freaky stuff that involves wet boots, long-term food storage and, as for the silk pillowcase, I don\u2019t even want to speculate. What was the brief for this collection?At the end of the day I\u2019m still an applied artist. I\u2019m trained to solve problems, like, \u201cO.K., What is Amazon? What does it need to be?\u201d It needs to be something you can see online. It needs to be stylish, and it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world if it ended up on a lot of Instagram accounts. The prices need to be attractive, so I need to think about technique and materials.Anything else you want to highlight?I\u2019m really into terrazzo. It\u2019s kind of a trendy material. The idea of terrazzo architectural objets is a kind of highfalutin shelfscape thing. I thought it would be fun to take something that\u2019s typically done in plaster but do it in affordable terrazzo. Everything wends its way into myriad things.

{"Headline": "Fighting for Stacey Abrams and Empowerment in Georgia", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than 100 years ago, black domestic workers in Georgia organized for better pay. Now they\u2019re getting out the vote for a groundbreaking candidate.Dr. Hunter is the author of \u201cTo Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women\u2019s Lives and Labors After the Civil War.\"All across Atlanta, hundreds of domestic workers have been knocking on doors for Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for Georgia governor, hoping to turn her into first black woman in that role. These domestic workers, mostly black women affiliated with Care in Action, the political arm of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, are using new technologies, like a smartphone app to identify the homes of voters of color. But they\u2019re also carrying on an 140-year-old tradition of domestic workers fighting for economic empowerment. Despite their marginalized positions and the many obstacles in their way, they insist on making their voices heard.In July 1881, washerwomen in Atlanta, toiling outside in the hot summer as they lugged buckets of well water and scrubbed their white patrons\u2019 laundry, finally had enough. They decided to go on strike to demand increased wages and respect for their work. They and a few male allies mobilized supporters by going door to door in black neighborhoods, despite threats of being arrested for \u201cdisorderly conduct.\u201d The women held meetings in churches, hundreds packing the pews. They formed the Washing Society, a cross between a labor union and a mutual aid organization, with subsidiaries in the city\u2019s five wards.In Southern cities, black domestic workers, including maids, nurses, cooks and laundresses, performed the most intimate and the most undesirable jobs for white families. They were paid substandard wages, expected to work long hours and were subjected to insults and sometimes even physical assaults. And in the beginning of the Jim Crow era, domestic work was more than a system of labor. It also symbolized an ordering of society by race in which black people were always considered subservient.When the strike broke out in July, the women faced a chorus of boos and laughs from employers, city officials, businessmen and reporters from the The Atlanta Constitution newspaper. The women were called \u201cWashing Amazons.\u201d But the nickname soon proved to be apt. \u201cI tell you, this strike is a big thing,\u201d the police chief admitted after the first week when it was clear that there was no end in sight. Unlike other domestic workers, who labored in isolation in their employers\u2019 homes, the laundresses shared work sites and were thus able to build solidarity. The white power structure was not going to sit idly by as the strikers and their sympathizers soon grew to 3,000 people. The City Council, for example, debated passing an exorbitant \u201cbusiness tax\u201d on members of the Washing Society. The women responded by writing an open letter to the mayor, which was published in The Atlanta Constitution: \u201cWe, the members of our society, are determined to stand our pledge and make extra charges for washing, and we have agreed and are willing to pay $25 or $50 for licenses as a protection so we can control the washing for the city.\u201d They were bluffing, of course, considering their limited resources. But, by embracing a penalty as an advantage, they showed they were astute strategists. The letter concluded with defiance: \u201cWe mean business this week or no washing.\u201d The tax measure failed to pass.This shrewd organizing occurred amid a flourishing grass-roots political campaign for full citizenship rights that began during Reconstruction. The women were a part of Republican Party coalitions that were thriving, despite the concerted efforts of conservative Democrats to suppress their husbands\u2019 rights to vote and hold office.Meanwhile, Atlanta was preparing for the opening of the International Cotton Exposition that fall. City boosters bragged that the event would showcase Southern workers as \u201cteachable, tractable, thankful for employment and utterly unacquainted with the strike.\u201d The washerwomen\u2019s strike was a loud public dissent. The domestic workers who are canvassing the streets and sending phone texts for Ms. Abrams also stand on the shoulders of a national mobilization that began in the 1960s and in which the Atlanta civil rights activist Dorothy Lee Bolden played a crucial role. She was the daughter of a cook-laundress and a chauffeur and began helping her mother when she was 9. Bolden held domestic jobs throughout her life. Building on skills she learned through organizing for better public schools for black children, she founded the National Domestic Workers Union in 1968.Bolden recruited women at bus stops, on the buses themselves, and in neighborhood meetings \u2014 echoing back to the washerwomen. And, like them, she capitalized on the civil rights movement to highlight the economic issues most important to their lives. She received the blessing of her comrade the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was organizing the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, before his death.Bolden, in alliance with domestic workers and feminists in other cities, helped achieve national benefits for an excluded group. Domestic workers had been left out of progressive labor laws passed during the New Deal of the 1930s. They petitioned and lobbied state legislatures and the federal government and secured inclusion in minimum wage laws in 1974 and unemployment insurance in 1976.Now, the domestic workers\u2019 ground game is risky; it\u2019s being conducted in public spaces where whites could call the police on them, making them the victims in the increasingly common meme of \u201cdoing X while black.\u201d Similarly, they are working in an environment of voter suppression disproportionately aimed at black voters. On Friday, a federal judge ruled that the Georgia secretary of state and Ms. Abrams\u2019 Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, must stop using an \u201cexact match\u201d law that flags slight discrepancies on registration rolls that could prevent people from voting.It is more than symbolic that domestic workers would support Stacey Abrams, an African-American woman from the birthplace of their movement. Most important, she stands for the issues they have long fought for, like the expansion of health insurance, a living wage and quality public education. No one should be surprised that these women, following in the long tradition of their foremothers of grass-roots activism, might help her to win.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For University of Minnesota, Chinese Tycoon\u2019s Arrest Shines Light, Again, on Sexual Assault", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs prosecutors weigh whether to charge Mr. Liu, the case represents a setback for a university that has made progress on how it handles sexual misconduct. In recent years, the university has dealt with a series of sexual assault and harassment episodes involving students and faculty members, which have prompted a state audit and new campus policies. Now, the university is once again in the national conversation, and the focus this time is on a relatively new and lucrative academic program.Mr. Liu, who has denied wrongdoing, was in Minnesota for a global business program, aimed at Asian executives, that is on track to generate over $10 million in tuition for the school since starting last year. His accuser, who has not been publicly identified, is a young Chinese student at the university who volunteered for the program.The case \u201cputs the university administration in an impossible situation\u201d as it tries to simultaneously protect its students and its reputation, said Kristen Houlton Shaw, the executive director of the nonprofit Sexual Violence Center in Minneapolis.\u201cThe program he\u2019s participating in is a major moneymaker \u2014 it brings in these highfliers and heavy hitters from around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir prospective students are watching.\u201dThe police conducted an initial investigation into the rape accusation and passed along the findings to the Hennepin County attorney\u2019s office, which says it has no deadline for deciding whether to press charges.Mr. Liu, whose Chinese name is Liu Qiangdong, was released less than a day after his arrest, and he returned to China. His company, JD.com, which takes in more revenue each year than any e-commerce competitor but Amazon, says he was falsely accused.The university has not spoken publicly about the episode, and would not say whether it had started its own investigation. The university declined to say whether Mr. Liu was still enrolled in the program or eligible for a degree.\u201cThe University of Minnesota cannot comment, per federal law, on matters related to any specific allegations involving any student at the university,\u201d said Caitlin Hurley, a spokeswoman for the school.The University of Minnesota has been a draw for Chinese students. The main university campus east of downtown is ringed by bubble tea shops, hot pot restaurants and grocery stores where Mandarin is commonly heard.Like similar programs at other schools, the university\u2019s global doctor of business administration program caters to wealthy professionals like Mr. Liu who seek the cachet of an advanced degree. Some 236 students were enrolled as of early October.The program, in conjunction with the elite Tsinghua University in Beijing, currently charges each student hundreds of thousands of dollars. The University of Minnesota expects to get as much as $85,000 per student from the latest class.The majority of the coursework is completed in China, but one week of the students\u2019 second year is spent in Minnesota. For Mr. Liu\u2019s class, the school arranged for lectures as well as entertainment, including dinner cruises and a football game.The university\u2019s Carlson School of Management, which runs the program, has declined to discuss Mr. Liu\u2019s arrest.Sri Zaheer, Carlson\u2019s dean, called the program \u201cextremely selective.\u201d It appeals to business leaders who \u201cwant to reflect on their own careers, who want to figure out what it is that made them successful,\u201d she said.Advocacy groups say the uptick at many schools is the result of women having become more comfortable reporting assaults in the #MeToo era. The number of rape cases reported by the University of Minnesota to federal regulators in 2016 \u2014 0.39 incidents per 1,000 students \u2014 is in line with four-year public schools of comparable size, according to an analysis of data from the Department of Education.This summer, Mr. Liu and other executives in the Carlson program took classes on topics like family wealth management and global branding, and visited local companies like 3M and General Mills. The evenings were for entertainment, including cruises on the Mississippi River and Lake Minnetonka.On Aug. 30, a group, including Mr. Liu and his accuser, dined at a Japanese restaurant called Origami, according to a restaurant employee who was working that night and text messages exchanged between the accuser and the assistant of an executive who invited her to dinner. The messages were exchanged over WeChat, a Chinese messaging app. The New York Times reviewed screenshots of the messages.Dozens of bottles of wine were brought in from a nearby liquor store, Lake Wine & Spirits. Two store employees confirmed receipts showing wine purchases totaling thousands of dollars.Mr. Liu\u2019s accuser had been invited to the dinner by another executive in the Carlson program, whom she had met while serving as a program volunteer, according to the statements she made to the police and WeChat messages sent to her by the executive\u2019s assistant. The executive asked her to sit next to Mr. Liu, she told the police.The following day, the woman sent WeChat messages to friends saying that Mr. Liu had raped her after the dinner. She told them that she had been \u201cway too drunk\u201d and unable to stop Mr. Liu from touching her while they were in the back seat of a limo, which she also recounted to the police.When she was driven to a house she did not recognize, she asked to be taken back to her apartment, according to her statement to the police. There, Mr. Liu forced himself on her, she told the police. She told him \u201cno\u201d several times, she said.A Carlson School administrator, Mandy Xue Bai, called the police in the morning after hearing about the alleged rape, according to the statements to the police. Ms. Bai also encouraged the woman to report the episode to the police. Ms. Bai declined to comment.\u201cI am so very proud of our client\u2019s courage, in coming forward and placing all of her trust and faith in the American justice system,\u201d said Wil Florin, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Liu\u2019s accuser.Jill Brisbois, one of Mr. Liu\u2019s lawyers, said that he was \u201cunable to defend himself\u201d because he \u201cdoes not want to interfere with the process\u201d while county attorneys decide whether to file charges.\u201cIt is unfair to publish a one-sided story when once a determination has been made, all evidence will be disclosed to the public that will tell the complete story and we believe his innocence will be apparent,\u201d she said in a statement.A week after the accusations against Mr. Liu surfaced, a new group of executives with the Carlson program started classes in China.An earlier version of this article misstated the second language used on several signs at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s HQ2 in Virginia Leaves a Real Estate Firm Poised to Cash In", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo years ago, Matt Kelly couldn\u2019t have known that a failed merger involving his real estate firm would propel him toward a central role in Amazon\u2019s expansion plans.The new company, JBG Smith, with Mr. Kelly as chief executive, became the dominant landowner in a Northern Virginia region now being called National Landing, a dilapidated area that includes parts of Crystal City, Pentagon City and Potomac Yard. Amazon announced on Tuesday that it was choosing this area, along with New York City, for two new headquarters, with 50,000 employees between them.Since Amazon started its search for a so-called HQ2 over a year ago, the Washington region had been considered a front-runner. The region gives the company access to a large, tech-savvy work force and the transportation and infrastructure it wanted. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has a home in the area.For Mr. Kelly, Amazon\u2019s decision validated a plan that he had been selling for the better part of a year: revitalizing Crystal City and its neighbors.Mr. Kelly\u2019s pitch was to turn a ghost town, as it has been described, into a thriving hot spot, including public green space and hip new retailers and entertainment venues. The plan relied on redeveloping 1970s-era office towers into sleek residential buildings.Skeptical investors have become believers, sending shares of JBG Smith up 7 percent in the past month.Analysts warn that Amazon most likely flexed its muscles to negotiate a deal with highly favorable terms, possibly pushing for below-market leases in an area that already trends well below national and Washington averages.For JBG Smith, the HQ2 deal may pay off in an uptick in occupancy and rents for residential, retail and other properties it owns adjacent to Amazon\u2019s new offices. But it could take five to seven years for this bonanza to arrive, said Danny Ismail, an analyst and lead of office coverage for the real estate research firm Green Street Advisors.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be an overnight thing,\u201d Mr. Ismail said.Amazon said it intended to lease 500,000 square feet of office space in three buildings owned by JBG Smith. Amazon has also agreed to buy numerous plots of land held by JBG Smith that could be developed for an extra 4.1 million square feet. The purchase price of the land and other terms were not disclosed.JBG Smith officials did not respond to requests for comment. But in the announcement on Tuesday, the firm said it planned to accelerate construction on other projects in the area, including developments that would create more office and retail space as well as hundreds of residential units.Amazon\u2019s move is a chance for JBG Smith to turn lemons into lemonade.For the past year, JBG Smith\u2019s publicly traded real estate investment trust has trailed its peers, largely because of Crystal City and adjoining areas, which make up about a third of JBG Smith\u2019s portfolio.Crystal City was once a thriving hub of government agencies and military contractors, but its fortunes sank after a 2005 mandate, in part for antiterrorism concerns, to relocate thousands of jobs from suburban office buildings to nearby military bases. In the following years, Crystal City lost 17,000 jobs, and 4.2 million square feet of office space became vacant.Since then, occupancy rates in the Crystal City region have hovered around 85 percent, among the lowest in the country, analysts say.But champions for the area argued that it still had plenty to offer a big employer, starting with its proximity to Ronald Reagan National Airport.\u201cIt\u2019s the only place I\u2019ve ever worked where you could walk to an airport. It\u2019s unique in its location and infrastructure,\u201d said Mitch Bonanno, a former senior vice president and director of development who oversaw the Washington team for Vornado/Charles E. Smith.JBG traces its roots to the late 1950s when three lawyers \u2014 Benjamin Jacobs, Donald Brown, and Joseph Gildenhorn \u2014 started a law and real estate firm in Rockville, Md. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the firm acquired and developed a number of high-profile properties in the Washington area, including the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown and projects for the World Bank and the insurer Geico.In the 2000s, JBG began raising money from institutional investors for a series of funds that it used to invest in commercial real estate around Washington.In the spring of 2016, JBG was looking to expand. It announced a merger with New York REIT, a deal that would have made JBG a public entity, making it easier to raise money to buy properties. The deal also would have diversified JBG\u2019s portfolio into the New York City area. But New York REIT investors balked and by the end of the summer, the arrangement had been terminated.A few weeks later, JBG was being courted by Vornado.It wasn\u2019t their first flirtation. A few years earlier, Vornado\u2019s chief executive, Steven Roth, raised the idea of merging the firm\u2019s Washington property portfolio with JBG to form a separate, publicly traded business, according to a 2016 transcript from a Vornado earnings call. But JBG wasn\u2019t sold on the idea of going public and talks broke down.But the second time around, they struck a deal. The merger made JBG Smith a commanding player in the Washington market and, this week, a potential big winner in Amazon\u2019s plans.\u201cWhile hard to quantify,\u201d analysts at Stifel Financial wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday, \u201cthis clearly drives up the value\u201d of JBG\u2019s future development pipeline.An earlier version of this article misstated the Maryland city where the firm that eventually became JBG Smith was founded. It is Rockville, not Rockland.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Before a Deal, Amazon Had to Know: Could Cuomo and De Blasio Get Along?", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a late October day, Amazon executives flew to New York to answer a final question before they committed to opening a massive technology center in Queens: Could Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio stop bickering long enough to see the project through?\u201cThey wanted to just trust-but-verify that everybody was on the same page,\u201d said Alicia Glen, a deputy mayor who was at the meeting with Mr. de Blasio.After meeting with both men separately that day, the Amazon officials decided the two Democrats could put aside their longstanding differences. Soon after, documents were exchanged, and re-exchanged, ironing out details of a package worth more than a billion dollars in tax incentives and state grants. The politicians even agreed to a plan to circumvent the City Council to prevent future roadblocks.The deal for the Queens development, in Long Island City, was announced on Tuesday, after Amazon concluded a 14-month, countrywide search for a location for a second headquarters for some 50,000 well-paid tech workers. The company, which ended up picking two sites and dividing the new workers between them, is also opening a huge corporate site in Arlington, Va., in an area across the Potomac River from Washington. Amazon said the new developments, both to be called headquarters, would require $5 billion in construction and other investments.The company also said it would develop a much smaller operations and logistics facility in Nashville, creating 5,000 jobs.The announcement capped a frenzied competition among nearly 240 communities across the country. Many politicians saw it as an opportunity to remake their city or a neighborhood for the tech era. Some economists and policymakers warned against using public money to help one of the most valuable companies in the world, and of the potential for escalating housing costs and traffic.Amazon said that the size and quality of the winners\u2019 labor pools decided the competition. Amazon was also offered more than $2 billion in tax incentives from New York and Virginia. Up to $1.2 billion of that will come from New York state\u2019s Excelsior program, a discretionary tax credit. In Virginia, the company could receive up to $550 million in cash incentives from the state by 2030, and $200 million more after that if it continues to hire. Both state programs are tied to the number of jobs the company creates \u2014 if Amazon\u2019s hiring falls short of projections, the incentive payments will be smaller.Both states have pledged to help Amazon with infrastructure upgrades, job-training programs and, in the case of New York, assistance \u201csecuring access to a helipad\u201d \u2014 some of which did not come with a price tag.Still, in New York and Virginia, most top politicians hailed the Amazon news as a major victory, and the culmination of an aggressive sales job.\u201cWe had an unprecedented opportunity to add to the number of jobs,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday.The project is a \u201ctransformational opportunity to diversify the economy\u201d of Northern Virginia, which is heavily dependent on government contracting, said Stephen Moret, president and chief executive of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.New York\u2019s sales pitch began in September 2017, immediately after Amazon began its search for a second headquarters that Mr. Bezos promised would be a \u201cfull equal to our Seattle headquarters.\u201dAmazon executives had realized that if its projections were right, the company needed a plan for its fast growth, said Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon. It made the search public because \u201cyou can\u2019t quietly talk to cities about investing $5 billion and creating 50,000 jobs,\u201d he said.Shortly after the announcement, a group of Long Island City leaders, including Elizabeth Lusskin, the president of the Long Island City Partnership, a business group, and Alan Suna, the chief executive of Silvercup Studios, a film and television studio there, were meeting to discuss their plans to bring biotech and life science companies to the neighborhood. But they quickly began talking about Amazon, according to Mr. Suna.Within a month, about 16 sites in the neighborhood had been identified, including the parcels along the waterfront eventually chosen by Amazon. The area is now a combination of public and private land that includes a distribution center for city school lunches, warehouses, studios and an outdoor bar and grill.When New York City submitted its bid to the company, just a few weeks later, Long Island City was one of four spots proposed, along with Lower Manhattan, Midtown Manhattan\u2019s West Side and an area in central Brooklyn.By January, Amazon narrowed the list to 20 locations, including New York. Amazon visited in April, July and September, said a person familiar with the meetings. The executives narrowed their search to sites on the West Side of Manhattan and in Long Island City before finally settling on the Queens neighborhood.Mr. Carney said Mr. Bezos did not tour any of the sites. The process was run by Holly Sullivan, who leads the company\u2019s worldwide economic development. John Schoettler, the executive who oversees Amazon\u2019s real estate, negotiated with the private developers.During one visit, the Amazon executives visited the Cornell Tech campus, a new high-tech school on Roosevelt Island, and took the ferry from there to Long Island City. They rode Citi Bikes as city officials and local Queens representatives showed off the area. On another occasion, they took the ferry at sunset.It wasn\u2019t until the past few weeks that things really took off.Gov. Cuomo met Amazon executives, including Jeff Wilke, who runs the company\u2019s retail business, in his offices on Third Avenue. From the window, he said, they could see the site along the waterfront Amazon would eventually select.\u201cI showed them the pictures of the progress of LaGuardia, of J.F.K., Penn Station, Kosciuszko Bridge \u2014 I explained what doubling the span means,\u201d he said, referring to building projects. He said Amazon executives were interested in having a pipeline of educated employees, not just from the top universities, but from other places such as Queens College and the nearby LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City.Amazon expressed concern about the city\u2019s planning process, which is slow and allows for local officials and the City Council to veto projects. The company\u2019s lawyers appeared to know about those pitfalls and wanted to avoid them. So Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo agreed to let the state control the approval, meaning there could be local input but no local veto. Mr. Cuomo said it was a \u201cfriendly condemnation\u201d of the city-controlled land by the state, not a source of tension.Though the mayor and governor met separately with Amazon, they were in close contact, comparing notes and strategizing over the phone, according to a person briefed on the talks.\u201cI know him so well, it\u2019s just more open and verbal,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. \u201cWhether it\u2019s good or bad.\u201dMr. de Blasio said, \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable that we made the right move.\u201dIn Virginia, the initial HQ2 announcement came as the state was wrapping up a planning process to focus its economic development on tech, as well as diversifying away from government work. The request for proposal from the company \u201chit right in the bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d said Mr. Moret of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.The proposal for Northern Virginia, one of three regions presented by Virginia, stressed regional cooperation. The Arlington neighborhoods of Crystal City and Pentagon City, as well as the adjacent Potomac Yards neighborhood in Alexandria, were rebranded into a new area, National Landing, as part of the proposal. That is the name Amazon used in its announcement on Tuesday.Then after Virginia officials submitted the proposals in October 2017, things went quiet.A few months later, Victor Hoskins, the director of Arlington Economic Development, was walking up to the stage at a conference with other development officials when their phones started buzzing with news reports that Virginia, Washington and Maryland were among Amazon\u2019s 20 finalists.\u201cIt quickly became, \u2018Hey, we got three locations in that list of 20, we\u2019ve got a good chance here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hoskins said.Amazon visited several times, at one point going up to the top of a tower, near Reagan National Airport, for a bird\u2019s-eye view of Crystal City. But it was more down to business than New York. Catering was ordered in.\u201cTalent was at the core of a tremendous amount of our conversations,\u201d Mr. Hoskins said. He said Amazon never discussed the incentives or proposals other locales offered.Mr. Carney said inside Amazon, the team running the search decided at a meeting in August that it would be easier to hire the number of workers they wanted if they split the headquarters into two. (An Amazon spokesman later said the meeting happened the first week of September.) \u201cWe also think that 25,000 as a floor is easier for the communities to absorb,\u201d Mr. Carney said.The company did not tell the cities about the split immediately. When Mr. Hoskins first heard about it, he was conflicted. \u201cYou want the 50,000, but you know what, hey, 25,000 is a huge number,\u201d he said.By early November, local officials were feeling good. A small stage went up on an empty lot in Crystal City for the announcement, only to take be taken down quickly. It was premature.After a final round to address the last details, on Monday, Mr. Moret was driving through rural Virginia when he signed the final state agreements digitally, his cell reception cutting in and out along the road.\u201cWe had a call from them just an hour after we executed it saying we won,\u201d he said.The company said it would start hiring in New York, Virginia and Tennessee next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Losers in Amazon Sweepstakes Aren\u2019t Ready to Throw In the Towel", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow it may be all for naught.After 20 finalist cities went to considerable lengths to lure Amazon to build a second headquarters within their boundaries \u2014 from promises of huge tax incentives and land deals to glitzy dinners with the cities\u2019 dignitaries \u2014 Amazon appears ready to increase its already sizable presence around New York, two of the people said. The company is also nearing a deal to expand in the suburbs of Washington in Northern Virginia, one of them said.When officials from most of the 18 other cities were contacted on Tuesday, they were reluctant to answer a simple question: Was all that a waste of time? In fact, many still held out hope that they have a shot.\u201cWe are in the ninth inning of this process with no finalist having scored yet,\u201d said Aisha Glover, who helped lead the pitch from Newark, N.J. \u201cIt\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over.\u201dTen officials said they were still pursuing Amazon or had not yet heard from the company about a decision, even though media outlets reported that their city was an also-ran. The officials said they wanted to avoid angering the nation\u2019s No. 2 private employer, after Walmart, which could still decide to open an office in their town someday.The cities had also signed extensive nondisclosure agreements with Amazon. When Maureen Krauss, the chief economic development officer for the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, declined to comment, she noted, \u201cI have 37 NDAs in my office.\u201dSome officials were talking, however, as news leaked out about Amazon\u2019s plans, and company executives did not seem pleased.An Amazon spokesman said Mr. Grella was not involved in the headquarters search. The spokesman also said that the company had added more than 6,000 jobs this year in cities that applied for the headquarters but did not make the list of finalists, and that Amazon expected similar hiring in finalist cities that were not selected.Toronto did not offer tax incentives but told Amazon that it would save billions of dollars because of Canada\u2019s universal health care, lower cost of labor and lower overall taxes.

{"Headline": "More Small Companies Avoid I.P.O.s, Sapping U.S. Economy\u2019s Vitality", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Smith spent years planning to sell shares of his software company, Qualtrics, on the stock market, meeting with bankers, carefully auditing financials and shaping a Wall Street-friendly narrative about the company\u2019s prospects. Two weeks ago, the finish line was close, with a listing on the Nasdaq just a few days away.But shortly before a staff meeting to update Qualtrics\u2019 employees about the public listing, Mr. Smith received a phone call from Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d Mr. McDermott told Mr. Smith.Mr. Smith then stunned Qualtrics\u2019 workers with a totally different message: SAP had agreed to buy the company for $8 billion in cash, nearly double the valuation bankers had set for the company\u2019s public listing. It was a decision, Mr. Smith said in an interview, that he did not second-guess one bit.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more peace in my life,\u201d he said.That kind of last-minute deal, an increasingly common occurrence in the tech industry, is contributing to a major reshaping of the American financial landscape that has been underway for years.Small and midsize companies are fading from stock markets, leaving far fewer publicly traded companies. Many of the smaller companies are bought by larger organizations or are enticed to stay private by the sharp rise in venture capital money, both of which allow them to avoid the volatility and scrutiny that come with going public. The number of listed companies peaked in the late 1990s, before the dot-com bust, plummeting 52 percent by 2016.Some economists say the buyouts of early-stage companies by large dominant players help explain why, by many measures, the American economy has been less dynamic in recent years. Less competition can contribute to sluggish rates of entrepreneurship, business creation, wage growth and productivity, they say.Even some companies that do go public can find that their time there is short-lived. In March, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, a software integration company, just a year after its public offering.\u201cCompanies like Qualtrics are saying, \u2018Huh, why bother the fighting in the public markets if I can do just as well by presenting myself for acquisition in sort of a premarket sale?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a Cornell University finance professor who has studied the decline of publicly traded companies.The traditionally vibrant American small business sector was long viewed as a strength for the economy. Small businesses are more likely to develop innovative new technologies, forcing large companies to reinvest significant amounts of profits to keep pace. The economy benefits from that competition, improving productivity and generating new and higher-quality products and services for consumers.The ability of large, cash-rich companies to buy smaller businesses before they have the chance to emerge as formidable competitors has altered the corporate landscape, said Thomas Philippon, a professor of economics at New York University, who has studied the increased dominance of large companies in many American industries.From 2001 to 2017, the median age of a venture-backed start-up going public was 11 years, according to a study by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. That\u2019s three years older than in the 1980s and 1990s, excluding the dot-com boom.Big tech companies like SAP and Cisco are attracted to the reliable revenue streams of the new class of cloud-based software providers, which charge monthly subscription fees for their offerings.\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for some of these big companies that need to adapt to a new way of doing business,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of I.P.O.-related research and services.\u201cThe public markets would not have awarded these companies those kinds of multiples,\u201d Ms. Smith said.While Qualtrics is growing quickly, its $290 million in annual revenue will not make an immediate difference in the earnings of SAP, which brought in more than $20 billion in 2017. But Mr. Smith of Qualtrics said that joining with SAP would help him accomplish in two years what would have taken five.\u201cOur only reason to go public was not for the financial side. It was to go take this to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got that in one swoop.\u201dTraditional investors in early-stage companies that used to go public have had to adjust to the new reality. For instance, the asset manager and mutual fund company T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, has increased its investing activity in pre-I.P.O. companies, including Airbnb and Uber, as well as Snap, the social media company, before it went public in 2017.\u201cWe are seeing opportunities to invest in companies with very similar characteristics to what would have been early-stage public market companies decades ago \u2014 only these companies are oftentimes raising money through private markets instead,\u201d Corey Shull, an analyst who leads early-stage internet investments at T. Rowe Price, wrote in an email.Investing in hot private start-ups is not generally available to the public. Retail investors seeking to ride the wave of hot cloud companies, for example, have had numerous opportunities to jump on an enterprise tech public offering this year. But some of the most notable ones, including Qualtrics, Adaptive Insights and Mulesoft, are now under the umbrella of much larger conglomerates.\u201cIf they don\u2019t have to tap the public markets to raise money, then why would you?\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who focuses on I.P.O. advisory work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Plan to Turn New York Into a Capital of Cybersecurity", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new partnership among two prominent Israeli venture capital funds, a handful of major private-sector companies and the city\u2019s economic growth development enterprise is hoping to turn New York City into the nation\u2019s leading center for yet one more major industry: cybersecurity.\u201cWe are at a seminal moment in the trajectory of the cybersecurity industry,\u201d said James Patchett, president and chief executive of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is spearheading the Cyber NYC initiative, including assembling and leading public-private partnerships and developing and overseeing six programs to grow New York\u2019s cyberindustry and expand the work force.\u201cMaking New York City the epicenter of cybersecurity makes complete sense because New York City is where all the customers are,\u201d Mr. Patchett said.Two new cybersecurity centers in separate locations will work in tandem to anchor this project. In SoHo, a 50,000-square-foot cybersecurity investment hub will support cybersecurity start-ups in New York City. In Chelsea, the 15,000-square-foot Global Cyber Center will bring together investors, corporations and start-ups and serve as a virtual testing ground to run simulations. Both are expected to be completed before the end of 2019.Despite the clear need for cybersecurity upgrades and improvements, not everyone is convinced that a project like Cyber NYC is the right solution.Mr. Margalit, who as a former member of Israel\u2019s legislative body, the Knesset, led its cybersecurity task force. Mr. Margalit earned his Ph.D. at Columbia and was living in New York City during 9/11. He says that his company will oversee much of the business end of the venture. \u201cMost innovation occurs when the two disciplines meet: investors and cybersecurity experts,\u201d he said.Equally invested in Cyber NYC\u2019s success is Uzi Scheffer, chief executive of SOSA, which has offices in Tel Aviv and New York. The company mostly focuses on protecting major financial companies from cyberattacks. While SOSA already has been operating out of another New York location for about 18 months, it is building the Global Cyber Center in Chelsea and plans to move into it in 2019.\u201cThe Global Cyber Center will expose New York\u2019s largest players to the best cybersecurity solutions out there,\u201d said Mr. Scheffer.Mr. Scheffer said a global cybersecurity hub doesn\u2019t really exist anywhere yet. \u201cIt\u2019s about seizing the opportunity rather than taking it away from someone else,\u201d said Scheffer, whose firm, like Jerusalem Venture Partners, secured its partnership with Cyber NYC through a competitive bidding process.There\u2019s also a serious academic element to the overall cybersecurity partnership, which involves the participation of virtually every major academic institution in New York City. \u201cWhether or not this leads to New York becoming the single, cybersecurity hub of the world is a story that will be played out over the next 15 years,\u201d said Orin Herskowitz, senior vice president of Intellectual Property and Tech Transfer for Columbia University. In the meantime, he says, the combined efforts will train and link local university students with substantive cybersecurity jobs in NYC.\u201cThere is a real chance this will become a catalytic event,\u201d Mr. Herskowitz said.There\u2019s even a so-called Cybersecurity Boot Camp planned, where the city\u2019s Fullstack Academy and CUNY LaGuardia Community College plan to educate and place more than 1,000 students in high-paying cybersecurity jobs over the first three years of the program. Program development for the boot camp has begun with the first session scheduled to take place in spring 2019.Until now, all of the major cybersecurity stakeholders in New York City have been physically and operationally separated, said Satish Rao, associate director of physical sciences licensing at Columbia, who helps to support cybersecurity start-ups. But with Cyber NYC, he said, \u201ca coalition of stakeholders is coming together.\u201dOne such stakeholder is Mark Gazit, chief executive of ThetaRay, an Israeli financial cybersecurity specialty company, which opened a temporary New York office at another location 18 months ago, but will be ultimately be housed in the SoHo building early next year. ThetaRay will start with about 15 to 20 employees at the location, but plans to have more than 100 within several years, Gazit said.\u201cFew people come to a bank branch and use a gun to steal money,\u201d he said. Today, the thief is far more likely to be behind a server in some remote country, stealing money without any physical access to the bank, he says. His company, which aims to prevent the spread of this cybercrime, works with such clients as General Electric.To be a cybercriminal is the highest-paying, low-risk job in the world, Mr. Gazit said. \u201cNobody knows who you are, and you can disappear without a trace,\u201d he says.His and other cybersecurity companies hope to make New York City the center of halting cybercrime. There is no better location than New York, said Mr. Gazit, because New York is where the talent is and where the financial giants are headquartered.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Mr. Gazit said, \u201cwe have to make sure the good guys win. \u201dBecause of editing errors, earlier versions of picture captions with this article misidentified a building in SoHo that is part of the Cyber NYC initiative. It is a future cybersecurity innovation hub, not the future Global Cyber Center, which will be in Chelsea. One of the captions also misspelled the surnames of two people involved with the hub. They are Tali Rabin, not Raben, and Gil Becker, not Beker.Advertisement"}

They are served up in plain sight, for profit, at airport bookstores, at movie-theater chains and on cable television.They come by way of publishing houses like Hachette and Penguin Random House; film distributors like Universal Home Studios and Lionsgate; theater chains like AMC and Cinemark; and 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News.Those companies have all helped feed a segment of the media business that should be called what it is \u2014 the Incitement Industry.It rakes in profits by serving up agitprop that targets liberals, Democrats and \u201cdeep state\u201d operatives who are said to be plotting to destroy America for the benefit of darker-skinned migrants or a shadowy consortium of elites.You can see this kind of thing in the pages of \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals\u201d by the Fox News opinion host Jeanine Pirro. Published in July by Center Street, a division of the Hachette Book Group, Ms. Pirro\u2019s book lays out \u201cthe globalist, open-border oligarchy\u201d that, the author asserts, is seeking to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe perpetrators of this anti-American plot include, but are not limited to, the leadership at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies, the Democratic Party and perhaps even the FISA courts,\u201d she writes.Another recent best seller in the same vein, \u201cResistance Is Futile!\u201d by the conservative provocateur Ann Coulter, was published by Sentinel, an imprint of the publishing giant Penguin Random House. It argues that the \u201cresistance\u201d that sprang up in the wake of President Trump\u2019s election is \u201cnothing less than a coup.\u201d And it lights into a conveniently vague villain \u2014 \u201cthe media\u201d \u2014 in a chapter titled \u201cFor Democracy to Live, We Must Kill the Media.\u201d\u201cThe media\u2019s position is that they\u2019re allowed to engage in lies, deception and even illegal acts to swing an election,\u201d Ms. Coulter writes.The film makes the case that the Nazi platform was similar to that of today\u2019s Democratic Party. Prominent among its villains is George Soros, who was allegedly sent a pipe bomb by Cesar Sayoc Jr., who also is accused of sending similar packages to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama.\u201cThe progressive Democrats are the true racists,\u201d the film\u2019s narrator intones. \u201cThey are the true fascists. They want to steal our income. They want to steal our earnings and our wealth and our freedom and our lives.\u201d\u201cDeath of a Nation\u201d will have a second life on the streaming platforms Amazon, iTunes and Google Play, as well as on DVD, sold at Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers. The distribution is being handled by Quality Flix and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.The hysteria led Bill Kristol, the conservative Republican who was once a regular on the Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox News, to tell Brian Stelter of CNN that it was time for Fox\u2019s owners and investors to take a hard look at the rhetoric spilling out of its news channel.(Representatives for Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, did not comment for this article.)But where is the line between falsehoods that may incite violence and good, old-fashioned American political hyperbole? And should book publishers and entertainment companies be more careful about the products they send out into the world in a tense sociopolitical atmosphere?\u201cI don\u2019t want some publisher telling me that something is beyond bounds,\u201d Mr. Kristol told me in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m a libertarian on points of view and even interpretations of history.\u201dBut after noting that conspiracy theories of recent vintage have whipped up fear and hatred, Mr. Kristol added, \u201cThere are things that normal fact-checking would rule out. It\u2019s not a matter of ideology; it\u2019s truth.\u201dI asked Hachette, the company behind \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals,\u201d whether Ms. Pirro\u2019s statement that Mr. Soros has \u201can agenda to destroy this country and the capitalist system\u201d had passed muster with the publisher\u2019s editors and fact-checkers. I got no answer.Sentinel, the division of Penguin Random House that published Ms. Coulter\u2019s recent best seller, was at least willing to engage. Its publisher, Adrian Zackheim, told me the author\u2019s views were \u201cexpressions of opinion.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s time to stop labeling her book \u201cnonfiction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For all their world-changing identification, they are reproducing the social destruction so perfected by their corporate elders \u2014 that is, to brand themselves as do-gooders while working feverishly to prevent policy changes that would restrict, in any way, their ability to mine profits from ventures that are in direct conflict with their acclaimed values.As long as corporate culture embraces growth through profit as the ultimate criterion for success, and our politicians take a share of the winnings as the price of their support, we will continue down this slide.

{"Headline": "Missionary\u2019s Killing Reignites Debate About Isolated Tribes: Contact, Support or Stay Away?", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe recent killing of an American missionary by members of an isolated tribe on a small island in the Indian Ocean has reignited questions about the fate of the last few groups of people living off the grid.In an era when people across the globe are hyper-connected by technology and increasingly interlocked economies, the survival of a few dozen groups of hunter-gatherers living in complete isolation may seem extraordinary. But experts say they may not survive undisturbed for much longer.Because most of these groups are small and highly vulnerable, anthropologists and indigenous activists have been debating whether it makes more sense to leave them alone \u2014 or try to establish contact with them to offer basic medical care, such as vaccines. Here are some basic facts about the world\u2019s remaining isolated tribes.Anthropologists and activists who study the issue say it\u2019s hard to know for certain. But based on satellite images and field research, experts believe there are more than 100 communities living in isolation.The vast majority of groups live in the Amazon basin in areas that straddle Brazil and Peru. The only relatively large community outside of South America belongs to the Sentinelese, who live on North Sentinel Island. It is nominally part of India, but technically a sovereign territory.Based on accounts from people who have ceased living in isolation, and those who have had fleeting contact with these societies, experts say members of these communities are fearful that contact with outsiders would bring disease and mistreatment. Native communities in the Amazon were ravaged when European settlers began colonizing the Americas in the 1500s and later in the 1800s when rubber tappers flooded the region.\u201cThe historical memory of this era is likely to have been passed down to the current generation,\u201d he said.Loggers, miners, cattle ranchers and drug traffickers have encroached on the territories of these groups, exposing them to violence and disease.Anthropologists and activists for isolated tribes have long wrestled with that question.Survival disagrees, and instead calls on governments to redouble efforts to keep outsiders from the territories where these communities live.\u201cThese uncontacted peoples make a judgment that they are better off remaining uncontacted and independent, fending for themselves,\u201d Mr. Mazower said. \u201cWhere their lands are protected and their right to remain uncontacted is upheld, they live healthy lives and are totally self-sufficient.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We could spend them as we\u2019ve spent the last two: React to every Trump outrage. Keep Trump\u2019s narcissistic provocations at center stage. Express daily contempt from within the safety of our political silos.This seems to be the business model for cable news and online media. There\u2019s a big, reliable audience of people who will tune in to feel appalled by and superior to Trump, and who are addicted to their daily rituals of moral onanism.On the other hand, we could put the Trump soap opera off to the side and pay attention to actual Americans and actual solutions. We could acknowledge that we are an evenly divided country. We could build the bipartisan governing coalitions and agendas suited to that reality.Fortunately, many people are opting for plan B. For example, the Convergence Center for Policy Resolution gathers stakeholders across the political spectrum and gets them working together on common visions \u2014 union bosses with Wal-Mart executives, teacher union leaders with charter school heads.Washington think tanks are undergoing a fundamental evolution. A lot of them, like the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution, were built to advise parties that no longer exist. They were built for a style of public debate \u2014 based on social science evidence and congressional hearings that are more than just show trials \u2014 that no longer exists. Many people at these places have discovered that they have more in common with one another than they do with the extremists on their own sides.Written by a wide array of scholars, the report starts with the truth that the working class has been mostly ignored by the rest of society. Government has welfare programs to serve the poor and they have programs like 529 savings accounts to subsidize the rich. But there\u2019s very little for families making, say, $50,000 a year.Businesses like Amazon will invest in rich places like New York and Northern Virginia, but they won\u2019t invest much in working-class communities in Ohio or Kentucky. Universities, religious organizations and activist groups will recruit from the affluent suburbs and serve those in dire poverty, but they barely touch the working class.What you get is a layer of society that has been denuded of institutions and social bonds. Working-class men have been dropping out of the labor force at alarming rates. A generation ago, working-class families were about as likely to be part of religious communities as affluent Americans, but now their participation rates have plummeted. A generation ago, working-class families were nearly as likely to be married as affluent people, but now only half the children in working-class families will be raised in adolescence by stably married parents. From the 1970s to the 2000s, the share of working-class people aged 25 to 60 who were involved in a neighborhood organization fell from 71 percent to 52 percent.As the authors of the Opportunity America report lay out the evidence, you see how the debate has evolved over the past few years. First, there used to be relatively little research attention paid to the working class at all. Now it\u2019s the epicenter. Second, there used to be a silly debate over whether economics or culture explained social breakdown. Now these two elements are woven seamlessly together. Third, geography plays a much bigger role. Social problems are concentrated in specific places.The authors of this report dismiss the policy slogans coming from the extremes. Building a wall is not a policy. Universal basic income degrades the work ethic that is at the core of working-class life. Free college is a massive subsidy for the upper middle class.Instead, the authors come up with a broad left/right agenda that 70 percent of Republicans and Democrats could support: wage subsidies, improved parental leave, work requirements for some federal benefits, child care tax credits.I especially like their point that we have overemphasized four-year colleges as the only route to success. In 2016, the federal government spent $139 billion on post-secondary education and training. Only a sliver, 14 percent, went to career education and training. Private sector employers fetishize the college degree even where it\u2019s unnecessary. Two-thirds of the job postings for production supervisors now require a college degree. But only 16 percent of the people currently holding those jobs have such a degree.One of the core questions before us is this: Who is going to lead this country? Is it perpetual outsiders like Trump, with no governing or policy competence, who say the establishments have forfeited all credibility? Or are there enough chastened members of establishments, who have governing experience, who acknowledge past mistakes, who take the time to reconnect with the country and apply their expertise in new ways?I don\u2019t know about you, I\u2019ll take a chastened establishment any day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Survive the Next Era of Tech (Slow Down and Be Mindful)", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIn his final State of the Art column, Farhad Manjoo reflects on the industry\u2019s changes and presents a new guide for navigating the future of technology.At the time, technology felt thrilling and world-changing. You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d \u2014 and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder. But tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things \u2014 every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps \u2014 that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.So to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.Now the time has come to amend and update that advice \u2014 which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I\u2019m not going far: I\u2019ll be writing for The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section starting next year.)How should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.Not long ago \u2014 in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn\u2019t work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?Something strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.But ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?But you don\u2019t have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too \u2014 and for a better, healthier tech industry, it\u2019s best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.Best of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry. There are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices \u2014 so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple\u2019s service but not from Spotify. But it\u2019s precisely this sort of mischief that I\u2019m hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.One reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.The lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.That\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.Are these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful. Go slow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everything on Amazon Is Amazon!", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe infinite retailer appears to be ushering untold numbers of stealth brands into your life, even as it plans to take over the East Coast. If you like Ween Charm, you\u2019ll love Austin Mill!In 1618, an aspiring alchemist in Constantinople named Avedis created his first copper alloy cymbals. In 2018, a few hundred products from his brand, Zildjian, one of the oldest companies in the world, are eligible for Amazon Prime shipping, just like Hanes underwear or Xerox copiers or Bounty paper towels or Chanel perfume or an Eames chair or Colgate toothpaste or a brand-new PopSocket for your phone.A lot of these brands \u2014 most explicitly the Basics products and various household staples \u2014 appear to be straightforward margin plays. Others, clothing brands in particular, fill gaps left by companies that have steered clear of the platform altogether. Others, well, who\u2019s to say?Amazon-affiliated brands are promoted in search results on the site and inflated by reviews from Amazon\u2019s Vine program, in which users receive items in exchange for their feedback. And, compared to better known competitors, they tend to be priced aggressively. In creating its own brands Amazon is indeed like any other large store. But Amazon isn\u2019t any other large store. It\u2019s Amazon: the world-historical logistical experiment that happens to call itself a store. It has unlimited shelf space and a boss with an eye on global domination. It tends to try a lot of things at once.And so while there are non-Amazon brands, and there are Amazon brands, there are also brands that live in the vast in-between. Some are exclusive to Amazon, but not exclusively owned by Amazon. Basic Care, which markets a variety of over-the-counter medications, is only available on Amazon; on the product page for \u201cBasic Care Night Time Cold & Flu, Cherry Flavor, 12 Fluid Ounce,\u201d Amazon\u2019s relationship to the product is not so obvious. This arrangement, too, has decades of precedent in American retail: the trademark for Basic Care belongs to its manufacturer, Perrigo, which makes private-label products for Walmart, Kroger and others \u2014 brands that are exclusive to each store but that often do not bear the store\u2019s name. Some start as exclusive; some become exclusive. Anyone is free to create an in-between brand that is technically \u201cexclusive\u201d to Amazon, with or without Amazon\u2019s help. Large private-label manufacturers do it, as they have for other retailers for decades. Smaller companies have made Amazon their only sales channel and adopted new brand names for the site. These varied arrangements are minimally risky for Amazon, and increasingly appealing, or at least urgent, for companies watching as Amazon consolidates power. Earlier this year, the company announced an \u201cAccelerator\u201d program inviting companies to \u201cJoin the Amazon Family of Brands,\u201d and more recently a link joined the footer of Amazon\u2019s website encouraging manufacturers to \u201cSell Under Private Brands.\u201dWhat would distinguish these products from their equivalent WULFUL and YFFUSHI products, the thinking goes, is a more convincingly localized brand \u2014 a story, such as it is, tailored the market where it is meant to be sold. This is the tale of retail globalization, in miniature, told in the style of self-help. A distant manufacturer makes the product. You, the upstart importer \u2014 or massive domestic brand \u2014 rebrand it for your countrymen, and bring it to market. As you scroll through the results for \u201cthree piece suit,\u201d you\u2019ll eventually encounter a brand called Austin Mill. Austin Mill, like WULFUL, sells extremely affordable suits, as well as other men\u2019s apparel. But its name is at least vaguely consonant with a slice of American-style men\u2019s wear branding in 2018. The product descriptions are more carefully edited, and sizes are listed by measurement, not as foreign conversions. Crucially, Austin Mill has a logo.The Austin Mill contest got 251 submissions; the one that won, by the user BAROKATANFIRRIZKI_88, now represents the brand. A designer in Bulgaria named Ralitsa Hand created the winning logo for Brooke Mille, a casual women\u2019s apparel brand on Amazon. She said there was no hint that the company might have been involved. \u201cUsually the client writes some basic info in the brief in order to give directions for the designers,\u201d Ms. Hand said. \u201cI had no contact with the client.\u201d (The sliders indicated the following: more \u201cFeminine\u201d than \u201cMasculine;\u201d more \u201cOrganic\u201d than \u201cGeometric.\u201d)Likewise, restricting results to \u201cOur Brands\u201d and then searching for specific product names can direct users to Beautiful Nomad. Clicking through to \u201cWomen\u2019s Apparel\u201d in Amazon\u2019s \u201cExplore Our Brands\u201d page, however, yields 10 curated pages of products, featuring its house brands and some better-known exclusive brands, but not Brooke Mille, or others like it.An eagle-eyed discount suit shopper might notice, while browsing the WULFUL listing, an \u201cOur Brands\u201d box that promotes products by none other than Austin Mill.\u201cSome are without a doubt Amazon brands,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile others require a little research to discover that fact. Sometimes that fact is emphasized and other times it is downplayed.\u201dUnfamiliar with a new brand of socks he\u2019d been sent, a different Vine reviewer named Sanpete did some searching, found the logo contests, made the Amazon connection and shrugged. \u201cKosy Komfort appears to be a new brand,\u201d he wrote in his review. \u201cGood deal on that logo.\u201d He added: \u201cThey\u2019re very nice socks, comfortable indeed.\u201dBrooke Mille did not respond to a message sent through Amazon. Amazon declined to comment, but emphasized, as it does in some places on its site, that \u201cOur Brands\u201d include both Amazon-owned and \u201cexclusive\u201d brands.If there\u2019s a mystery here, it\u2019s just which of the many plausible and reasonable explanations are at work. Consumers are used to seeing private label brands \u2014 or packer\u2019s labels, or store brands, or house brands, or reanimated ghost brands \u2014 in stores even if we don\u2019t quite understand what they are or where they come from. Some brands are labeled \u201cfor Target,\u201d while others just don\u2019t seem to exist anywhere else, and so we make our assumptions, or don\u2019t think of them at all, and keep shopping. As is often the case with Amazon, what seem like strange or inexplicable new behaviors are often old retail strategies unfolding on the internet, quickly, and in plainer view. Brooke Mille is no more a lie than any other brand: It\u2019s just newer and faster and more online. And it has a lot more company. Advertisement"}

The renewed declines in the United States came after drops in Asia and Europe.The pain persisted for such companies on Tuesday with Apple and Amazon falling by more than 4 percent in early trading. But a new area of concern also flared after the retailer Target reported third-quarter sales and profit that missed Wall Street expectations.The softness in retail shares reflects growing investor concern that the strong American economy \u2014 which has so far shrugged off Federal Reserve interest rate increases and signs of weakness in China and Europe \u2014 is likely to face increasing challenges in 2019, as the impact of federal tax cuts and spending increases diminishes.Also weighing on stocks was a slump in crude oil prices, which hit their lowest point this year after dropping as much as 7 percent on Tuesday.Monday\u2019s slide in the United States had already spilled over into Europe and Asia before trading on Wall Street opened on Tuesday. By the end of the trading day, the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of eurozone blue-chips, had dropped more than 1.4 percent.Concerns about privacy lapses and mismanagement at technology companies weighed on stocks on Monday, adding to broader concerns about the impact of a trade war between the United States and China as well as signs of slowing growth around the globe.The pessimism continued in the Chinese markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen as the worries that hurt technology stocks in the United States hit stocks in other parts of the world.In Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, trade concerns helped to push the stocks of Chinese semiconductor makers and other big technology companies into the red. A drop in the stock price of the chip maker Nvidia several days ago after disappointing earnings may also have rattled investors in chip makers across China. The Chinese stock market is down by more than 20 percent so far this year.Shares of Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate, fell 3.3 percent in Hong Kong trading. A broader index of large Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong dropped by 1.6 percent, while the Hong Kong market closed the day down 2 percent.\u201cStocks look weak,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for Asia Pacific at the Dutch bank ING, wrote in a note to investors. \u201cOversupply in the semiconductor industry is an issue for Asia, and made worse by an apparent lack of demand for some well-known producers of high-tech products,\u201d he added.In Seoul, South Korea, and Taipei, Taiwan, the markets finished the day down nearly 1 percent.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong, Amie Tsang from London and Matt Phillips from New York.Advertisement"}

Pauley III, also strongly suggested that the federal government should take over the authority instead.The unexpected ruling threw the future of the Housing Authority into doubt and unraveled a deal that Mayor Bill de Blasio had staked his reputation on as a champion of public housing tenants.The judge said that he could not ignore the residents\u2019 \u201charrowing accounts\u201d of conditions and the indifference of the management of the Housing Authority, known as Nycha.But he said the agreement \u201cis not fair, reasonable or consistent with the public interest.\u201d He ordered the parties to submit a report by Dec. 14 with their positions on how to proceed.Supporters had expressed hope that the agreement would salvage and transform New York City\u2019s public housing, providing additional oversight and an infusion of cash to overhaul the decrepit living conditions in many of Nycha\u2019s 176,000 apartments.The judge\u2019s ruling dealt a political blow to Mr. de Blasio, who had inserted the city into the negotiations between the United States attorney and the Housing Authority and had declared that the settlement was a \u201cpivotal moment for the future of public housing in New York City.\u201dEric F. Phillips, the mayor\u2019s spokesman, said the funding the city had committed to Nycha as part of the settlement \u201cwill continue.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s important to residents,\u201d he said.In his opinion, Judge Pauley questioned whether a court-appointed monitor was the right path to take. He said Congress had \u201cexpressly entrusted\u201d the primary responsibility for saving failing public housing systems to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The proposed settlement shifted that job to the court, he said, and in doing so may violate the separation-of-powers principle in the United States Constitution.The judge, in his 52-page opinion, wrote that continuing disputes between the United States attorney\u2019s office and Nycha in the months after the agreement was reached suggested that the court would be left overseeing the Housing Authority indefinitely, a role, he said, \u201cthat judges are ill-equipped to assume.\u201dJudge Pauley noted that HUD had in the past taken drastic measures to successfully reform other public housing authorities, taking over the Chicago Housing Authority and appointing receivers to oversee the housing agencies in Boston and Washington.The powers of a receiver would be broader than those of the court-appointed monitor proposed in the settlement, Judge Pauley said. Such an intervention would be unprecedented in the eight-decade history of public housing in New York City.Mr. de Blasio had vowed in the past not to let the Housing Authority fall into receivership. \u201cThat is not something that we will allow to happen here,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in 2015. \u201cHere, we will make the changes and we will make them swiftly and aggressively to ensure that we can protect our residents and the long-term strength of Nycha.\u201dGeoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement that his office was reviewing the judge\u2019s decision. \u201cThe well-being of the over 400,000 Nycha residents continues to be our paramount concern,\u201d he said.Jereon Brown, a HUD spokesman, said the department was reviewing the opinion. \u201cWe\u2019re fully committed to improving the health and safety of Nycha residents,\u201d he said.\u201cThere was talk of getting HUD to appoint a receiver and they just ran like hell,\u201d Mr. Brezenoff said. \u201cHUD didn\u2019t want it, which is very sensible on their part.\u201dJudge Pauley noted that HUD did not have discretion to select which deficient public housing agencies \u201cit chooses to assist.\u201d\u201cTo the contrary,\u201d the judge wrote, HUD had a legislative mandate to \u201coversee all public housing agencies.\u201dCouncilman Ritchie Torres, a Bronx Democrat who is a critic of Nycha\u2019s management, said of the ruling, \u201cMy concern is that public housing will continue to be in a state of flux and confusion that does a disservice to everyone.\u201dThe Housing Authority faces the daunting task of addressing $32 billion in unmet capital needs. Those include defective boilers that have caused loss of heat, and leaky roofs that have contributed to mold problems inside apartments.Judge Pauley said the parties may have to consider new ways to address the authority\u2019s problems, like public-private housing partnerships, private development of unused Nycha land or the sale of air rights.He also raised the possibility of \u201ceven less palatable\u201d measures, like replacing Nycha\u2019s management or breaking collective-bargaining agreements.\u201cDesperate times call for desperate \u2014 and sometimes politically unpopular \u2014 measures,\u201d the judge said.J. David Goodman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Google Walkout Was a Watershed Moment in Tech", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the artOutsiders have little leverage to force the industry to change. The companies\u2019 own workers are another matter.However Google responds, little at the internet search giant \u2014 and, perhaps, little in Silicon Valley \u2014 will be the same again.For two years, regulators, lawmakers, academics and the media have pushed Silicon Valley to alter its world-swallowing ways. But outsiders have few points of leverage in tech; there are few laws governing the industry\u2019s practices, and lawmakers have struggled to get up to speed on tech\u2019s implications for society. Protests by workers are an important new avenue for pressure; the very people who make these companies work can change what they do in the world. But the Google walkout suggests something bigger could be afoot. The walkout\u2019s organizers told me that they were aiming to keep that movement alive \u2014 to ask the most important questions about how their company operates in the world, and to inspire those in other parts of the tech industry to take up similar arms.\u201cSomething we\u2019ve discussed as a group, something we\u2019ve locked arms over, is that we\u2019re assembled now,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, a marketing manager at Google-owned YouTube who created the internal discussion forum in which organizers planned the walkout. \u201cWe have an incredibly engaged group of people, and we aren\u2019t going to stop escalating this,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe group isn\u2019t really going to back down from this or a host of other things. The walkout was not like a blowing-off-steam exercise.\u201dThe walkout was sparked by a specific grievance: a report in The New York Times that Google gave a $90 million exit payment to Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, after he was accused of coercing a woman to perform oral sex in a hotel room (a charge that he denies but that the company found credible). The organizers said their aims were far larger, though, than sexual harassment and abuse.\u201cOur discussions expanded very quickly,\u201d Ms. Stapleton said. \u201cWhat is it that we want the company to be, and what should we do with the power that we very quickly see we are harnessing? Is Google for good? Do we think that technology is toxic? Are we navigating through a host of complex issues online in a positive way?\u201dSpeaking to Ms. Stapleton and several of her fellow organizers, I was struck by their intoxicating optimism. They brimmed with confidence about their capacity to push for a new moral, ethical and social framework in tech. And because Google\u2019s culture is a model for the industry and much of corporate America, they saw the idea of changing the company as part of a larger social and political struggle to make a dent in the universe.\u201cI think what we did was disprove the myth that it\u2019s too hard to take collective action,\u201d said Celie O\u2019Neil-Hart, who works in YouTube\u2019s marketing department. She described the meticulous way that she and other organizers of the walkout distilled the thousands of discussions flowing through their group into a list of demands. Their secret? Google\u2019s own technology.\u201cI was getting hundreds of pieces of feedback on these demands, but ironically thanks to Google\u2019s products, like Google Groups and Docs and comments, I was able to get this constant stream of real-time feedback from a collective group of hundreds of Googlers, all while doing my day job,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neil-Hart said. She noted, too, that many Googlers had been hired for their work-endless-hours drive; now that drive was marshaled in the service of a movement.Stephanie Parker, a policy specialist at YouTube, described organizing the protest in a way that sounded to me like designing and releasing a new Google product, only with a group that was more passionate and personally invested.\u201cIt was really fun to see my fellow employees flex the skills that a lot of them had developed at Google \u2014 their program management skills, their marketing skills, their P.R. skills, but in the service of this movement,\u201d she said.A lot about the walkout was particular to Google\u2019s culture, which has always encouraged a more open form of debate than many tech peers. Companies more consumed with secrecy \u2014 Facebook, for instance, or Amazon or Apple \u2014 may be less tolerant of a large number of employees who use their tech skills to go rogue.But such a prospect is not out of the question. Tech workers have endless options when it comes to employment; the tight labor market gives them greater leeway in voicing their concerns, and the promise that their voices are valued gives them an expectation that they can effect change.\u201cI didn\u2019t think this would happen, but it\u2019s amazing to see,\u201d said Ellen Pao, a venture capitalist who sued her former firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, for sexual harassment and now works at the nonprofit group Project Include. \u201cIt\u2019s another point of pressure \u2014 maybe the most powerful one yet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd until recently, there really hasn\u2019t been much pressure at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Founder\u2019s Big Idea to Revive BuzzFeed\u2019s Fortunes? A Merger With Rivals", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "Supported byBut efforts to re-establish its fortunes have already begun. The company expects to surpass $300 million in revenue this year, the three people said. To get there, BuzzFeed now sells cookware at Walmart and accepts banner ads on its web pages. It runs a morning show on Twitter, a weekly one on Facebook and another on Netflix, all of which are paid for by the platforms. Its newsroom and its entertainment studio churn out thousands of videos and articles each week, to an audience of 690 million people every month. The company also gets a commission when a reader buys a product on Amazon or other commerce sites after clicking through from one of BuzzFeed\u2019s recommended product links, known as affiliate marketing. And on Monday, BuzzFeed News announced a membership model that provides exclusive access to newsletters and behind-the-scenes content for $5 a month. A $100 donation gets you a tote bag. (BuzzFeed\u2019s website will remain free.)\u201cYou have Vice and Vox Media and Group Nine and Refinery,\u201d Mr. Peretti said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of them that are doing interesting work.\u201d He extolled the logic of combining forces: A larger entity could lobby for a higher percentage of the ad dollars Facebook and Google share with publishers whenever their content, videos in particular, runs on the platforms. In turn, publishers can supply them with content that is safe for users and friendlier for advertisers.\u201cHaving some bigger companies that actually care about the quality of the content feels like something that\u2019s very valuable,\u201d he said. Though initial discussions involving a few companies have taken place, they were all very preliminary, according to five people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. BuzzFeed has spoken to at least one other company, while other publishers have had separate discussions, these people said. Mr. Peretti declined to name which companies he has talked to regarding any potential mergers. Any deal would be difficult to pull off given the number of investors involved and the compounding losses that would result from combining several money-losing start-ups. Staff cuts would be inevitable.Still, publishers have been getting squeezed by the tech platforms as online advertising rates continue to level off. \u201cIf BuzzFeed and five of the other biggest companies were combined into a bigger digital media company, you would probably be able to get paid more money,\u201d he said. A natural camaraderie exists among the digital publishers, which could make a potential partnership more palatable, said Benjamin Lerer, the chief executive of Group Nine. \u201cI don\u2019t believe my competition is BuzzFeed or Vox or Vice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe compete on a day-to-day basis for business, but the ultimate competition here is us against traditional TV and also protecting ourselves against the big platforms.\u201dMr. Lerer and Mr. Peretti have been friends for over a decade, and Mr. Lerer\u2019s father, the venture capitalist Kenneth Lerer, is the chairman of BuzzFeed. He also sits on the board of Group Nine. But the younger Mr. Lerer stressed that any business deal between the two would not include his father to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201cConsolidation in digital media is something that is going to happen,\u201d he added.Money for a merger wouldn\u2019t be an issue, according to Mr. Peretti. The sticking points would center on who would run a combined entity as well as how each business would be valued in a merger. The combined valuation of the companies Mr. Peretti mentioned exceeds $7 billion.Other publishing executives acknowledged the seeming inevitability of consolidation. \u201cWe\u2019ll always consider ways to better serve our audiences and strategically grow our business through building, partnering and acquisition,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, the chief executive of Vox Media. Philippe von Borries, a co-chief executive of Refinery29, said that in the next year or so there might be \u201can opportunity for the leading media and entertainment companies that emerged over the past decade to come together,\u201d provided all parties could settle on a shared culture and vision.Vice Media did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Peretti, 44, started BuzzFeed in 2006 as a kind of experimental project while working at The Huffington Post, an early giant of web publishing that he founded with Arianna Huffington and Kenneth Lerer. In many ways it was a return to his first media obsession: what makes something go viral. In 2001, while a graduate student at the M.I.T. Media Lab, Mr. Peretti got in a heated email exchange with customer service representatives at Nike. The company allowed buyers to customize their shoes with a word or phrase. Mr. Peretti chose \u201csweatshop.\u201dThe request was denied. Mr. Peretti insisted \u201csweatshop\u201d had not violated Nike\u2019s criteria, but the company wouldn\u2019t fulfill his order. He forwarded the email thread to several friends who sent it on to several others. It eventually reached millions of people. Mr. Peretti ended up appearing on the \u201cToday\u201d show debating labor issues with a Nike executive.The story has become the stuff of internet lore, but it also represents the heart of BuzzFeed. The early chat bot became a website, which led to original content and then the formation of a newsroom, which now boasts a huge monthly audience.As BuzzFeed\u2019s audience has grown, so has the diversity of its content. Hard-hitting investigative journalism lives alongside listicles, quizzes and cooking videos.\u201cBuzzFeed has always been very experimental,\u201d he said. The ethos that led to its viral content and mining of memes to explain the day\u2019s news is now being applied on the business side, he said, \u201cto consider commerce and advertising and even donations.\u201dThe company is positioning its membership model as a way of supporting its journalism, despite being a for-profit company. BuzzFeed had experimented this year by soliciting donations from readers for its news division. The high level of interest spurred the creation of memberships, which sound similar to fund-raising drives by nonprofits like PBS.Last year, native advertising slowed down considerably, so BuzzFeed started accepting banner ads. After President Trump was elected, a lot of brands didn\u2019t know what they wanted to say, Mr. Peretti said.\u201cSome of them got scared to say anything because everything seemed polarized,\u201d he said. That prompted the move to accept traditional ad formats.This year, BuzzFeed started selling cookware based on the popularity of its Tasty cooking videos. The company licensed the name to a manufacturer that sells the branded pots and pans at Walmart, a deal worth more than $20 million to BuzzFeed, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Making sure the business can thrive is important to Mr. Peretti, even if it comes in the form of bakeware and banner ads.At a staff meeting in Los Angeles a few years ago, someone asked Mr. Peretti what he would do if he won the lottery.He responded: \u201cI already won the lottery when we sold HuffPost to AOL. After that, I went out and bought a Honda Odyssey.\u201dMr. Peretti acknowledges the anecdote but said it shouldn\u2019t be characterized to mean he doesn\u2019t care about money, or its importance to BuzzFeed.\u201cA company that doesn\u2019t generate money isn\u2019t a company that gets to do very much,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a business standpoint, money is a means to an end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peugeot Returns to U.S. to Help People Get Around, but Not With Its Cars", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo years ago, Peugeot\u2019s parent, the big European carmaker PSA Group, announced its return to the cutthroat North American market. The move stunned some industry observers and amused several others with long memories.Last month in Washington, the company finally unfurled its opening gambit, and it\u2019s not a car, exactly. PSA is thinking smaller, rolling out an app, but also bigger: This is about the future of the car market as well as the company.PSA\u2019s North American plan starts with the new app, Free2Move, which offers users in Washington, D.C., the ability to book any kind of ride. The app includes services to rent cars, electric scooters and bicycles, as well as ride-sharing services \u2014 with no separate charges for parking, gas or insurance. Other United States markets are expected to follow.The move is at once unconventional and yet fundamentally cautious for PSA, Europe\u2019s longtime No. 2 carmaker after Volkswagen and the owner of the Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands.The company is aiming to become a total mobility provider, its chief executive of four years, Carlos Tavares, said in an interview last month at the Paris Auto Show.\u201cWe believe that human beings are eager to protect their spontaneous freedom of movement,\u201d Mr. Tavares said. \u201cYou need to have an available mobility tool that is going to fulfill this need for freedom to move anywhere, anytime, when you decide to do so.\u201dSigning up for Free2Move costs $10, and it can be used to book with scooter and bike services like Bird, Capital Bikeshare, Jump, Lime, Skip and Spin; the car-sharing service Car2Go as well as Free2Move\u2019s own branded option; and Uber, the ride-hailing service. All billing is centralized via the Free2Move account.The app, Mr. Tavares said, which got its start in Europe early last year, is a central element of PSA\u2019s international business. PSA, once widely believed to be deeply troubled, has bounced back to profitability and growth under Mr. Tavares.One year ago, PSA acquired General Motors\u2019 Opel (Germany) and Vauxhall (Britain) divisions, which are already making a profit that eluded G.M. for decades.With Free2Move, the company is placing a bet on deep changes to the car business in the decades ahead, as electrification, autonomy and car-sharing remake a capital-intensive industry known for being set in its ways.Significantly, none of the 600 cars that Free2Move will maintain in the Washington test are PSA models. For now, app users choose between Cruze subcompacts and Equinox crossovers, both Chevrolets, while the Car2Go service found via the app offers Mercedes-Benz and Smart cars.According to Mr. Tavares, at later stages in the company\u2019s 10-year plan, Free2Move will include PSA\u2019s own cars. Eventually, PSA will sell its cars in North America, under a brand that is expected to be announced this year. North American assembly is not out of the question, he said.For now, said Mark Rechtin, editor of Motor Trend, using \u201cother manufacturers\u2019 cars is a low-cost market research tool to buy time and determine what vehicles and features will work best here.\u201dHe added that this could be a way for PSA to sell off-the-rack \u201cvehicles as a fleet to a company like Waymo or Uber \u2014 and not have to worry about selling to picky car shoppers and having a retail and service network.\u201dAny return to the North American market is noteworthy because it remains a diverse and expansive place, with great distances, unique sets of regulation and a hugely competitive environment. A combination of incentive spending and advertising costs has kept fledgling brands out of the market, while several established brands have fallen away of late.Meanwhile, the stock market has shown mounting disdain for the major players\u2019 prospects and shares, even in recent years of great sales and profit, as shareholders bridle at the thought of legacy costs, inefficient dealer networks and an uncertain regulatory future. Added to the list of worries lately are risks from a trade war and tariffs.More significant still from a carmaker\u2019s perspective may be the unknown chaos that car-sharing, autonomous driving and the switch to electric cars are likely to inject into the market and their own futures.From its current position of relative good health, PSA is better placed than it had been to consider these pressures, and take its shot on the future. Yet, to the greatest extent possible, a company entering a major market would like to control its own narrative for as long as possible. With its new strategy, PSA aims to stake itself not just weeks or months to fail or succeed, but years.Mr. Tavares continued: \u201cI know that the customer expectations are very specific and the way you handle those expectations is very specific. So we decided that we would start by understanding the U.S. consumer through the mobility services activities that we are now implementing. It is a good way to understand the market.\u201dLarry Dominique, head of PSA\u2019s start-up operation for North America, based in Atlanta, is charged with helping to develop and enact the strategy. He said he was certain that baby steps were the right way to go.\u201cThe biggest mistake most companies make is overinvestment, and then the moment there\u2019s an initial downturn, their fixed costs are way beyond their revenue and they\u2019re in deep, deep trouble,\u201d Mr. Dominique said. \u201cWe want to avoid that. And how do you avoid that? By planning well and making sure you understand very, very well the trends, the consumers, the behaviors, their wants and desires.\u201dHe continued: \u201cHow is mobility as a service saving car-ownership patterns? What are we seeing geographically? How are alternative powertrains manifesting themselves in North America versus other parts of the world?\u201dA PSA news release announcing the Washington test program said: \u201cIn the U.S. alone there are almost 260 million vehicles, 320 million people and over 17 million new cars sold each year. Car manufacturing is not going away. However, just as Amazon and Uber have changed behavior, we believe PSA must also learn and participate in this emerging business.\u201dRebecca Lindland, an industry marketing analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said the desire to read the market closely and forestall investment was understandable.\u201cThe market is contracting, and the industry is changing so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t invest in a new dealership network and add rooftops at this time, especially since the euro is uncertain and Brexit hasn\u2019t kicked in yet.\u201dFortunately for PSA, the Peugeot, Citroen and Opel brands are long since clear from any obligation they had to any American dealers.\u201cJust to be very clear,\u201d Mr. Dominique emphasized, \u201cwe have no legacy in North America. I have no dealer networks, I have no dealer contracts, I have no service contracts, I have no I.T. contracts. I literally have a green-field opportunity in North America.\u201dHe added: \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve had lots of calls from my friends and other O.E.M.s saying, \u2018Larry, you have an opportunity that we can only dream of.\u2019 They can\u2019t tear down what they\u2019ve already got.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Art in New York City: Navigating Museums During the Holidays", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe\u2019ll not only help you figure out what exhibitions to see, but also offer some tips before you head out.This holiday season you may have more time than you usually do to check out art exhibitions. The problem is, so does everybody else. The flood of tourists, visiting family members, school groups and temporarily freed office workers means that a simple visit to a museum can be more of a production than it would normally be. Because navigating long lines and crowded galleries can be quite daunting, it\u2019s essential to plan ahead.To manage the flow of visitors to its Warhol exhibition, the Whitney Museum is selling timed-entry tickets and art lovers are encouraged to book in advance \u2014 slots do sell out. The museum, which is usually closed on Tuesdays, will remain open on select Tuesdays during the run of \u201cWarhol,\u201d including New Year\u2019s Day; as usual, it\u2019s open late on Fridays and Saturdays (until 10 p.m.), too. The real key may be timing: \u201cOne of the best times to come is later on a Saturday (after 6 p.m.) when most of the crowds have gone for dinner,\u201d a museum representative wrote in an email.With lines regularly forming at the Metropolitan Museum of Art before it opens at 10 a.m., it is advised that visitors dress warmly during the holiday season if they plan to arrive early. If you\u2019re willing to forgo a trip up the Met\u2019s famous stairs, the lines at the street level entrance at 81st street tend to be shorter.The holidays can be stressful, so if the crowds at the more popular exhibitions and galleries spike your anxiety, the museum recommends visiting the quiet spaces that can be found even during the holiday rush, including the Studiolo from the Ducal Palace in Gubbio (gallery 501), the Buddhist sculpture rooms in the Asian art section (galleries 206, 223-231, 234-240) and the tranquil galleries in the back of the Robert Lehman Wing (galleries 950-960).Remember that the big museums have extended hours on Fridays, Saturdays or both. Most museums are open on Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve, but closed on Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Day. (It\u2019s always good to check websites to be sure, especially for commercial art galleries, many of which close for extended periods during the holiday season.) Here\u2019s a small sampling of some of the exhibitions we\u2019ve raved in recent months. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: On Netflix, Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin Are Aging Bros", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInevitability isn\u2019t a good argument for a TV show\u2019s existence, however. \u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201d (eight episodes arrive Friday) isn\u2019t a disaster; it has a certain warm-bath appeal, if you don\u2019t mind a thick foam of prostate jokes. But it is adrift in a bland netherworld between Lorre\u2019s precision-tooled, laugh-a-minute network comedies and the quieter aesthetic of the alt-sitcom, lacking the strengths of either.Putting Douglas in the role of a silver-haired Hollywood Lothario (his hair is fantastic) who chose integrity over stardom can be seen as a clever bit of casting, both for and against type. The real (unintentional) twist, though, is having him play an acting coach who pushes his students to be honest onstage \u2014 given that Douglas, in his highly successful career, has consistently given closed-off, impenetrable performances.The one really notable exception was his relaxed, completely convincing portrayal of the middle-aged writing teacher Grady Tripp in \u201cWonder Boys\u201d (2000), and the scrambling, half-principled Sandy is a little like Grady 20 years down the road, without tenure. Douglas is clearly comfortable with Sandy, and his performance is amiable and easy to like. But it\u2019s not much more than that: As a showrunner and writer, Lorre (who gets full or partial writing credit on all eight episodes) hasn\u2019t done anything to raise Douglas\u2019s game.What he has given him are platitudes and attitudes, the outline of a well-meaning Peter Pan confronting mortality and isolation without the substance. A sitcom character, in other words. You could argue that this is the point: As Sandy skirts financial ruin and vacillates over his relationship to an \u201cage-appropriate\u201d woman (played by Nancy Travis, 17 years younger than Douglas), Norman frequently calls him out on his shallowness.But those observations aren\u2019t insights so much as obligatory comic beats. Moving into single-camera naturalism, Lorre carries with him the structures and comic sensibilities of the multicamera network sitcom \u2014 he just slows the pace, stretching out the setups, and ratchets down the jokes, as if explosive laughs would be unseemly in these quieter surroundings.And while the bromance of Sandy and Norman is the heart of the show, the masculinity-in-moth-balls atmosphere can be overpowering. If you\u2019re a man who hasn\u2019t heard of retrograde ejaculation, you\u2019ll Google to see if it\u2019s a real thing, after which you\u2019ll feel a little sick to your stomach.Particularly egregious is the treatment of Norman\u2019s daughter, a pill-popping head case played by Lisa Edelstein who shows up for a few episodes to vex her poor father and is completely forgotten once she is dropped off at rehab.Norman, who experiences a tragic early loss and grows progressively morose and antisocial, is a bum part. But Arkin, still bringing sharp wit to aggravation and aggrievement, is the best thing about \u201cThe Kominsky Method,\u201d even when the writing takes Norman into kvetching \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d territory. If you have to listen to someone complain about the modern world (\u201cSkype \u2014 what a stupid word\u201d), it might as well be him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Is Coming. Can New York\u2019s Transit System Handle It?", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Andy Byford, the New York City subway leader, met with Amazon executives during the summer, Mr. Byford boasted that Long Island City in Queens was a transit wonderland ready to serve their army of workers.The reality is far less rosy.Long Island City does have half a dozen subway lines, the Long Island Rail Road, buses and ferry boats. But the picture Mr. Byford painted glosses over the enormous challenges facing the city\u2019s transportation network, which regularly struggles to get millions of New Yorkers where they are going.\u201cThis is obviously part of the reason \u2014 a large reason I would suggest \u2014 why Amazon was attracted to Long Island City,\u201d Mr. Byford told reporters last Thursday after an M.T.A. board meeting. \u201cIt already has a rich transport-transit offer.\u201dBut Jimmy Van Bramer, the city councilman who represents the neighborhood, said one of the main subway lines serving the area, the No. 7, was already crowded and miserable and that Amazon\u2019s arrival would only worsen the problem.\u201cIf you can\u2019t get on those trains or if those trains aren\u2019t reliable, then it is not transportation rich,\u201d he said. \u201cThe every day experience of riders today is one where you literally have to fight your way onto these trains and that\u2019s if they come.\u201dMr. Van Bramer, who opposes the nearly $2 billion in incentives Amazon was promised from the state, said he had taken the No. 7 train to City Hall on Monday morning and urged Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 two boosters of the Amazon deal \u2014 to do the same.\u201cIt was packed when I got on in Sunnyside,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said. \u201cIt stopped and was delayed several times into City Hall this morning. That\u2019s every day.\u201dAmazon\u2019s New York headquarters will be located along the East River, in an area of Queens known as Anable Basin \u2014 now possibly to be rechristened Amazon Basin. There are two nearby stations on the No. 7 line: Court Square and Vernon Boulevard-Jackson Avenue, both of which have seen a major increase in ridership in recent years. There is also a stop on the city-run ferry system, though ferries carry far fewer commuters than trains.Some Amazon employees could live in Manhattan and take the subway to Queens, in the opposite direction as most commuters who are traveling to work in Manhattan, Mr. Byford said. Others could walk or bike.\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to assume that all of them will be piling on the 7 line,\u201d Mr. Byford said.Mr. Byford said he would consider allowing G trains to stay in their longer configuration after the L train closure to accommodate Amazon workers, noting that he would have to consider ridership levels and how many train cars are available.But Mr. Van Bramer said the transit agency should be thinking much more ambitiously in preparing for Amazon\u2019s impact.\u201cIt\u2019s like putting your finger in the hole of a dam that\u2019s about to collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to be enough.\u201dDuring his meeting with Amazon, Mr. Byford said he had trumpeted his broader vision for the subway: A sweeping modernization plan, known as Fast Forward, that could cost $40 billion over ten years. But his proposal has not been funded. And now the M.T.A. says it needs additional funding to avoid huge fare increases or severe service cuts.Transit advocates have called on Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the subway, to approve a transit funding plan in Albany next year, including a proposal known as congestion pricing that would toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan.\u201cIf Albany doesn\u2019t approve congestion pricing this year and fund Fast Forward, all of the things Andy Byford is promising Amazon are all of a sudden a lot more precarious,\u201d said Nick Sifuentes, executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group.The No. 7 line is currently being upgraded with a new signal system that should allow the agency to run two additional trains each hour. But an extra two trains would only carry about 2,500 additional passengers each hour \u2014 a small portion of Amazon\u2019s eventual work force, Mr. Sifuentes noted.Amazon\u2019s decision has also brought renewed attention to a proposal by Mr. de Blasio to build a streetcar along the waterfront in Brooklyn and Queens, formally known as the Brooklyn-Queens Connector, or BQX. But the plan has stalled over questions about how to pay for it.In announcing the Amazon deal, Mr. de Blasio said it reinforced the need for a streetcar in the area where, he said, the \u201cgravity economically in New York City is shifting to the Brooklyn and Queens waterfront.\u201d\u201cThe BQX is going to be a crucial part of the equation,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.At Court Square, a busy station in Long Island City on the E, G, M and No. 7 lines, the number of weekday riders grew last year to about 23,600, from about 18,600 riders in 2012. The Vernon Boulevard-Jackson Avenue station saw its weekday ridership grow to 15,700 last year, from 11,500 in 2012.\u201cIt\u2019s not like it goes to buses or improving the subway,\u201d Mr. Sifuentes said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make much of a dent.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sent unwillingly on assignment to Mozambique to \u201cshow continental Portugal our soldiers\u2019 great generosity in their civilizing mission,\u201d she falls in love with one of the guerrillas fighting against the regime, who is brutally killed before the birth of their daughter, Nat\u00e1lia.Inevitably, the women scrutinize one another. Jenny sees Camilla as obsessed with her work and Nat\u00e1lia as living a tepid life in which her \u201cmission is to liberate women like me from the terrible masculine yoke.\u201d Nat\u00e1lia, in turn, is terrified that she\u2019ll never be as formidable as her mother, who \u201cwithstood prison and torture,\u201d and bemoans her life amid the \u201cindifference and regurgitation that we call the postmodern era.\u201d One constant in their lives is the family manse. Dilapidated by the time Nat\u00e1lia reaches adulthood, Chess House becomes her passionate project. When she uses her skill as an architect to salvage this relic of the family\u2019s heritage, she brings a novel that\u2019s absorbing in its history, as well as in its family dynamics, back to the place where it began.It\u2019s hard to decide whether the central character in Farr\u2019s novel is a saint, a martyr or just more zenlike than the rest of us.With her grown son, Kurt, and teenage niece, Luce, Iris Golden drives under a \u201cthick, dark cloud that fills the sky\u201d to the bayside vacation house that she and her ex-husband, Paul, have sold in the fictional Australian village of Cassetown, intending to pack up their belongings over a long winter weekend. Paul arrives that evening with his second wife (\u201crested, resilient, remarkable,\u201d Iris wistfully observes, a woman filled with \u201cthe vigor of youth, and love\u201d) and their infant daughter (who is, significantly, unnamed). As they\u2019re hauling their gear inside, the dark cloud releases a deluge. Later, the rain, almost a character in itself, will be \u201cbattering against their dreams,\u201d ease \u201cto mist,\u201d fall \u201chard on the roof\u201d and then kick in again, \u201csuddenly torrential, monumental.\u201dThat so many characters have geologic surnames (Iris Golden, Paul and Kurt Diamond, Luce Flint) is no coincidence. As the novel unfolds, so too do the details of an affair between Iris\u2019s mother, Rosa, now a nonagenarian with dementia, and a German-Israeli geologist, Zigi Silbermann (\u201csilver man\u201d), a relationship described by Rosa in fittingly nonsequential flashbacks. Zigi maps fault lines, including the Hope Fault, a handy metaphor for the ever-shifting and sometimes dangerous terrain of family life. He also writes poetry, a volume of which, also called \u201cThe Hope Fault,\u201d is found on a bookshelf.Despite the foreboding weather that forces the family to stay inside in dangerously close quarters, they somehow pull through, and even have time for a blowout party and a baby-naming ceremony before the movers arrive, an ending that, along with the rest of the novel, only the most determined optimist will find plausible.Exploring the physical and emotional landscape of war and its aftermath, DeWitt\u2019s novel traces the history of the Delasalle family from World War II into the decades that follow, moving, not always seamlessly, between past and present.Genevi\u00e8ve, Yvonne and Fran\u00e7oise live with their mother and stepfather, Oncle Henri, in the seaside Norman town of Caen, which has been occupied by the Nazis: \u201cEvery week brought the announcement of a new set of rules \u2026 and all we thought about was food.\u201dAs the war gains momentum, Genevi\u00e8ve goes to Paris to further her study of the violin. There, a year after the armistice, she meets the American cellist who will become her husband, with whom she sets sail for the United States. Yet even in the safety of North Carolina, even though the war is long over, Genevi\u00e8ve is haunted by her memories of its deprivations, of the \u201cbombs and rubble and prison and torture\u201d that wrought irrevocable changes in her family. It\u2019s not surprising, then, that her American-born daughter drinks \u201cthe war in with her mother\u2019s milk.\u201d At one point, she notes that although \u201cthe war had been over for 15 years when I was born \u2026 still the sound of German unsettles me.\u201dThe narrative passes quickly, and sometimes chaotically, from person to person as DeWitt writes from multiple points of view, linking the stories of a host of characters, including not just the women of the family but Marie-Claire, a girl from the mountain town of Les Houches, and a nameless SS officer met while filling out the paperwork on a Jewish pediatrician who has been arrested by the Germans.While the revolving cast and leaps between historical eras can be confusing, the narrative\u2019s details of daily life \u2014 a patisserie \u201cwith its bright little door chime and the smell of chocolate. Shop girls in their crisp, white coats, like doctors\u201d; a Nazi informant, detectable from \u201cthe delicious scent of p\u00e2t\u00e9 and cognac on her breath\u201d \u2014 ultimately pull the reader along.Abigail Meisel is a writer and editor based in western Massachusetts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Past Is Present: Strategies for Bringing Current Events Into the Social Studies Classroom", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial Studies SkillsWhy do we insist that students study history?Perhaps because the study of history promotes critical thinking, creates a shared cultural literacy or encourages responsible citizenship. Certainly one of the most important reasons is because history continues to matter.Why has North Korea developed a nuclear arsenal that threatens the United States? Why are thousands of Hondurans camped out on the southern border of the United States? Why have many athletes decided to kneel during the national anthem? To answer any of these questions \u2014 or the myriad others posed by the news every day \u2014 students will need to understand what happened in the past.In this teaching resource, we suggest different methods teachers can use to easily facilitate these connections. Each method is illustrated with two examples, one from global history and another from United States history, and each ends with a classroom challenge. The goal is to help this kind of thinking become a habit of mind for your students._________Essential questions are, by definition, open-ended and big-picture, and using them in the history classroom encourages students to relate history to current events.Here are two examples.Global | How do geography and climate affect human life?Let\u2019s say you\u2019re studying the significance of geography in shaping the development of civilizations, perhaps in relation to the rise of ancient river valley civilizations._________If students are connecting the role of past presidents such as George Washington, Andrew Jackson or Franklin D. Roosevelt to our current president, there is a constant stream of related Times articles for them to explore. These lesson plans link to some of the best:_________Like essential questions, themes in the history classroom encourage students to make connections across time periods and places. They are also relatively easy to use to identify related current events. Here are two examples you might consider using.Global | Human Rights Violations (or Religious Conflict)If you\u2019re studying 20th-century human tragedies like the Holocaust or the Rwandan genocide, students learn that human rights violations are unfortunately an enduring issue. The current persecution of the Rohingya clearly highlights that reality._________U.S. | ImmigrationOnce they find a piece that interests them, they can identify what argument the writer is making and then decide if they agree or disagree. For balance, they can look for another opinion piece that argues a different position, either in The Times or elsewhere, and decide which point of view they agree with most and why. What issues that we\u2019re still debating today were issues in the era they are studying? What images, quotes, data or other kinds of information can they find that might make interesting paired texts to link the two eras?_________Global | World War IThe world just commemorated the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I. Katrin Bennhold writes about the unsettling similarities between 1914 and today:Now as then, Europe\u2019s political center is weak and the fringes are radicalizing. Nationalism, laced with ethnic hatred, has been gaining momentum. Populists sit in several European governments._________U.S. | ReconstructionReconstruction has long been misrepresented, or simply neglected, in our schools, and unlike Confederate generals and founders of the Ku Klux Klan, few if any monuments exist to the black and white leaders of that era._________Since social studies students spend a great deal of time exploring historic places, one easy way to make that study relevant to them is to have them discover what those places look like today, and how life there has either changed or stayed the same. What remnants of the past are still present? Why?Global | China (Silk Road)China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.China envisions a vast global network of trade, investment and infrastructure that will reshape financial and geopolitical ties \u2014 and bring the rest of the world closer to Beijing._________U.S. | HarlemFor nearly a century, Harlem has been synonymous with black urban America. Given its magnetic and growing appeal to younger black professionals and its historic residential enclaves and cultural institutions, the neighborhood\u2019s reputation as the capital of black America seems unlikely to change soon.But the neighborhood is in the midst of a profound and accelerating shift. In greater Harlem, which runs river to river, and from East 96th Street and West 106th Street to West 155th Street, blacks are no longer a majority of the population \u2014 a shift that actually occurred a decade ago, but was largely overlooked._________Historians\u2019 understanding of the past is typically grounded in what they glean from analyzing texts and artifacts. How are these still relevant today? Regular readers of The Times know that works of art, texts and structures created long ago are often featured in stories from the Politics, Travel or Arts sections as new generations discover them or reconsider their power and significance.Global | The Ruins of Ancient RomeIslamic State propagandists considered Palmyra a bonanza for promoting their vision of a strictly religious caliphate devoid of homage to other cultures or religions. They publicized the work of their demolition teams with graphic photographs._________U.S. | The Constitution_________Global | Fascist LeadersEven though the rise of fascist leaders like Hitler and Mussolini pulled the world into the most destructive conflict in human history, World War II, the end of the war marked the end of fascism.Right?_________U.S. | Robber BaronsAmerican industrialists and business magnates in the late 19th century, like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt and John D.

If you like tricky psychological thrillers, or you like the look and feel of FX\u2019s \u201cFargo,\u201d try this.\u201cKing of the Hill\u201d never seemed to make as big a splash as its Fox animated counterparts, and that\u2019s a shame: It\u2019s a steady sweetheart of a show and a good primer on propane and propane accessories. There\u2019s also a ton of it \u2014 13 seasons, and it is solid throughout. The show centers on the Hill family, with Hank, the curmudgeon dad; Peggy, the warmly eccentric mom; their dim but wonderful 13-year-old son, Bobby; and an array of sometimes ridiculous neighbors and brethren.This terrific Canadian series is back for its third season, as silly and perceptive as ever. Sketch comedy is a little out of fashion right now (in fashion: lecturey talk shows), so \u201cBaroness\u201d feels especially distinctive, but its real claim to fame should be its pacing, and how quickly it moves from segment to segment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Hear It (Quickly) for the Half-Hour Drama", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe new Amazon drama \u201cHomecoming\u201d has a lot going for it. Julia Roberts in her first starring TV role. Bravura directing from Sam Esmail of \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d A top-notch supporting cast, taut writing and a mind-bending military-corporate thriller plot.With today\u2019s expansive TV drama installments typically running an hour (or more), each episode of \u201cHomecoming\u201d felt like a gift certificate for 30 extra minutes of sweet, unencumbered life. Thirty more minutes to work, to sleep or \u2014 why not? \u2014 watch a second episode.They were no less captivating for being short. They may have even been better.Somewhere in its history, TV formalized the idea that drama is a marathon and comedy a sprint. Network schedules established sitcoms at 30 minutes, with commercials; dramas \u2014 with early exceptions like most seasons of \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d \u2014 settled in at 60.Only a hypocrite would praise the short installment at great length. So I\u2019ll be brief.First, short dramas are just practical. One could argue that only a TV critic frets about episode length: It\u2019s a first-world problem in a first-world job. But look, I\u2019m paid to do this. I\u2019ve got plenty of time.People with actual productive jobs, on the other hand, have ever more TV to fit in their limited free time. Epic drama means greater investment: You have to put in six or eight hours to get to the point where, your friends swear to you, \u201cOzark\u201d really gets good. (It doesn\u2019t. Saved you a day.)Short dramas are economical. Longer series have to serve a bigger roster of characters, spinning off subplots for each. \u201cThis Is Us\u201d is an hour; the portion I want to follow any given week is maybe 20 minutes.\u201cHomecoming,\u201d likewise, has two timelines but one story. There isn\u2019t A, B, C and D plot, nor should there be; it would distract from the thriller\u2019s stage-like technique of building suspense through conversation.The half-hour drama also reflects where the real creative energy is in TV today. Some of the best work is happening in half-hour hybrids \u2014 \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cBetter Things,\u201d \u201cAtlanta\u201d and \u201cBarry,\u201d to name a few \u2014 that are \u201ccomedies\u201d for awards purposes but half drama, or more, in substance.Then there\u2019s rhythm and velocity. Bingeing a lengthy drama can feel like sinking into quicksand; I\u2019m not so much absorbing the story as it absorbs me. I start to feel like my immobility itself is the product: my butt on a couch, adding hours logged to some clicking meter in a media company\u2019s accounting office.When a series like Netflix\u2019s pharmacological head trip \u201cManiac\u201d switches up with a 26-minute episode, it underlines the sense of play and unpredictability in the storytelling itself. It\u2019s bracing; it\u2019s a changeup; it\u2019s narrative syncopation.Of course, neither is \u201cshorter is better\u201d an absolute rule. Wasted time is the problem rather than time itself, and there is certainly value to series like \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d that take advantage of the silent frame and the extended pause, allowing momentum to build and detail to accrete in such a way that, though their episodes might run past the usual length, they appear to fly by in a fraction of the usual time.But since when does length equal seriousness? \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d? \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d? \u201cMrs. Dalloway\u201d? Short, short, short! Pithiness is power.I\u2019d say more, but I have screeners to watch. At heart, TV\u2019s time crunch is a tribute to how the medium has become worth our time. All the more reason to appreciate the shows that recognize that we don\u2019t have all the time in the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Cheap Labor Drives China\u2019s A.I. Ambitions", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldSome of the most critical work in advancing China\u2019s technology goals takes place in a former cement factory in the middle of the country\u2019s heartland, far from the aspiring Silicon Valleys of Beijing and Shenzhen. An idled concrete mixer still stands in the middle of the courtyard. Boxes of melamine dinnerware are stacked in a warehouse next door.Inside, Hou Xiameng runs a company that helps artificial intelligence make sense of the world. Two dozen young people go through photos and videos, labeling just about everything they see. That\u2019s a car. That\u2019s a traffic light. That\u2019s bread, that\u2019s milk, that\u2019s chocolate. That\u2019s what it looks like when a person walks.\u201cI used to think the machines are geniuses,\u201d Ms. Hou, 24, said. \u201cNow I know we\u2019re the reason for their genius.\u201dMost importantly, this thinking goes, the Chinese government and companies enjoy access to mountains of data, thanks to weak privacy laws and enforcement. Beyond what Facebook, Google and Amazon have amassed, Chinese internet companies can get more because people there so heavily use their mobile phones to shop, pay for meals and buy movie tickets.But the ability to tag that data may be China\u2019s true A.I. strength, the only one that the United States may not be able to match. In China, this new industry offers a glimpse of a future that the government has long promised: an economy built on technology rather than manufacturing.\u201cWe\u2019re the construction workers in the digital world. Our job is to lay one brick after another,\u201d said Yi Yake, co-founder of a data labeling factory in Jiaxian, a city in central Henan province. \u201cBut we play an important role in A.I. Without us, they can\u2019t build the skyscrapers.\u201dWhile A.I. engines are superfast learners and good at tackling complex calculations, they lack cognitive abilities that even the average 5-year-old possesses. Small children know that a furry brown cocker spaniel and a black Great Dane are both dogs. They can tell a Ford pickup from a Volkswagen Beetle, and yet they know both are cars.A.I. has to be taught. It must digest vast amounts of tagged photos and videos before it realizes that a black cat and a white cat are both cats. This is where the data factories and their workers come in.Taggers helped AInnovation, a Beijing-based A.I. company, fix its automated cashier system for a Chinese bakery chain. Users could put their pastry under a scanner and pay for it without help from a human. But nearly one-third of the time, the system had trouble telling muffins from doughnuts or pork buns thanks to store lighting and human movement, which made images more complex. Working with photos from the store\u2019s interior, the taggers got the accuracy up to 99 percent, said Liang Rui, an AInnovation project manager.\u201cAll the artificial intelligence is built on human labor,\u201d Mr. Liang said.AInnovation has fewer than 30 taggers, but a surge in labeling start-ups has made it easy to farm out the work. Once, Mr. Liang needed to get about 20,000 photos in a supermarket labeled in three days. Colleagues got it done with the help of data factories for only a couple thousand dollars.\u201cWe\u2019re the assembly lines 10 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Yi, the co-founder of the data factory in Henan.The data factories are popping up in areas far from the biggest cities, often in relatively remote areas where both labor and office space are cheap. Many of the data factory workers are the kinds of people who once worked on assembly lines and construction sites in those big cities. But work is drying up, wage growth has slowed and many Chinese people prefer to live closer to home.Mr. Yi, 36, was out of a job and trying to get other ventures going with elementary school classmates when someone mentioned A.I. tagging. After online searches, he decided it wasn\u2019t super technical but needed cheap labor, something Henan has in abundance.In March, Mr. Yi and his friends set up Ruijin Technology, which rents offices the size of two professional basketball courts in an industrial park for $21,000 a year. It was previously the park\u2019s Communist Party committee\u2019s event space, so the ceiling lights are covered with red hammers and sickles.Ruijin, which means smart gold, now employs 300 workers but plans to expand to 1,000 after the Chinese New Year holiday, when many migrant workers come home.Unlike workers and business around the world, Mr. Yi isn\u2019t worried that A.I. will take his job.\u201cThe machines aren\u2019t smart enough to teach themselves yet,\u201d he said.Hiring is a bigger worry.Ruijin\u2019s pay of $400 to $500 a month is higher than average in Jiaxian. Some potential job candidates worry that they don\u2019t know anything about A.I. Others find the work boring.Jin Weixiang, 19, said he would quit Ruijin after the Chinese New Year and go to sell furniture in a physical store in southern city Guangzhou.\u201cI\u2019m a people\u2019s person,\u201d said Mr. Jin. \u201cI\u2019m doing labeling for the money.\u201dBut for some former migrant workers, the job is better than working on assembly lines.\u201cIt was the same work, same movement, day after day,\u201d said Yi Zhenzhen, a 28-year-old Ruijin employee who once worked at an electronic component company. \u201cNow I have to use my brain a little bit.\u201dMost of the time, customers don\u2019t tell these data factories what the task is for. Some are obvious. Labeling traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians are usually for autonomous driving. Labeling many types of camellia flowers could be for search engines.Once Ruijin was given the task of labeling the images of millions of human mouths. Mr. Yi said he wasn\u2019t sure what it was for. Maybe facial recognition?Roughly 300 miles to the north, in the Hebei city of Nangongshi, Hou Xiameng runs her data factory out of her in-laws\u2019 former cement factory. Her first job out of college was labeling faces for Megvii, the Chinese facial recognition company with a $2 billion valuation that\u2019s most famous for its technology platform called Face++. To this day, some facial recognition systems recognize her before they do her friends because, she says, \u201cmy face is in the original database.\u201dBut life in Beijing was too tough and expensive. She and her then-fianc\u00e9, Zhao Yacheng, decided to move back to their hometown and start a data factory. Ms. Hou\u2019s parents would pay for computers and desks. They are renovating the warehouse next door to hire 80 more people.Like Mr. Yi, Ms. Hou doesn\u2019t spend time thinking about the implications of her work. Are they contributing to a surveillance state and a dystopian future that machines will control human?\u201cCameras make me feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in control of the machines for now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mayor\u2019s Response: \u2018Delusions of Grandeur.\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt began like a run-of-the-mill bureaucratic flare-up, a small power struggle early this year between officials in Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration and New York City\u2019s investigations commissioner over a little-known office that handled inquiries into the school system.By Monday, it had ballooned into a public-relations crisis for the mayor, exposing him to lurid allegations that he or his administration had tried to cover up embarrassing inquiries, accused the commissioner of being disloyal and ultimately dismissed him in the interest of damage control.It did not take long for Mr. Peters to fire back. He released an acid-ink letter on Monday, accusing the mayor of carrying out a vendetta, and acting out of fear over what he might dig up next.Mr. Peters described receiving an angry call from the mayor in January 2017, in which he said that Mr. de Blasio asked him not to release a report critical of the Administration for Children\u2019s Services.\u201cWhen I informed the mayor that D.O.I. was obligated to make its findings public, he yelled at me, accused me of trying to bring his administration \u2018down,\u2019 and then informed me he was \u2018going to hang up now before I say something I shouldn\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Mr. Peters wrote.At an afternoon news conference, Mr. de Blasio energetically pushed back on Mr. Peters\u2019s allegations.\u201cFalse, it\u2019s just false,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said when asked if he had telephoned Mr. Peters to pressure him to withhold a report. \u201cI\u2019m sure I had conversations with Mr. Peters and I\u2019m sure I had disagreements, but that characterization is false.\u201dHe added, \u201cI will only say, broadly, there have been conversations about reports, about accuracy, about specific recommendations, all sorts of things, but never a conversation where there was an effort to inhibit the actions of D.O.I. on a specific report.\u201dMr. de Blasio could not keep from letting his irritation show, as he was peppered with questions about Mr. Peters. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he has delusions of grandeur in thinking that everything revolves around him,\u201d the mayor said.If the nasty back-and-forth seemed unusually personal, there is a good reason: Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Peters became friends at least as far back as the 1990s, when they both served on a local school board in the liberal political circles of Park Slope, Brooklyn.Mr. Peters seemed to answer the question with a series of highly critical reports, exposing shortcomings and mistakes on Mr. de Blasio\u2019s watch, including failures to inspect for lead paint at the Housing Authority and lapses at the Administration for Children\u2019s Services.But while Mr. de Blasio and his aides may have chafed at the criticism, there was little they could do; firing the investigator who exposed his failings was politically impractical.From that moment the clock was ticking: Would Mr. de Blasio use the investigation to unseat his nemesis?He did so on Friday, eliciting relatively muted objections from the City Council, which had previously defended Mr. Peters, and would have to approve his successor.But the storm broke anew on Monday, with Mr. Peters\u2019s letter.Although Mr. Peters had previously apologized for his conduct regarding the whistle-blower, he disputed the factual findings of the investigation, and asserted that the mayor had other reasons for dismissing him.\u201cThe context of the mayor\u2019s interactions over the past several years with D.O.I., combined with certain ongoing investigations about which the mayor and his senior staff are very much aware, must cast doubt upon the mayor\u2019s true motives,\u201d Mr. Peters wrote in the letter, which was addressed to the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, and the chairman of the council\u2019s committee on oversight and investigations, Ritchie Torres.He wrote that pressure placed on him by the mayor\u2019s office amounted to \u201can attempt to punish and intimidate D.O.I. for its past work.\u201dMr. Peters said that, aside from the 2017 call from the mayor, senior City Hall officials had on several occasions urged him not to release reports critical of the administration. He also expressed concern that ongoing investigations might be quashed by a new commissioner appointed by Mr. de Blasio.Mr. Torres, the city councilman, issued a statement saying that Mr. Peters\u2019s letter \u201creveals a pattern of interference with D.O.I. investigations and intimidation against D.O.I. officials that borders on the unethical and should be illegal.\u201dMr. Peters released the report, and he wrote in his letter Monday that \u201cI subsequently had multiple conversations with people who informed me that the mayor and his senior staff were \u2018really angry,\u2019 felt I should be more \u2018loyal\u2019 and now wondered if I was \u2018still a friend.\u2019\u201dHe also said that an official had asked him not to release the report on lead inspections at the Housing Authority. He released it anyway.Mr. Peters also wrote that the Police Department had on multiple occasions refused to cooperate with his investigations. He described a meeting in 2016 in which \u201ca senior N.Y.P.D. official conspicuously displayed his gun,\u201d adding that the official later told another person that he had intended to \u201cintimidate the D.O.I. officials\u201d at the meeting.Taken together, Mr. Peters said those incidents demonstrated that Mr. de Blasio and his staff \u201cbelieve that I owe a duty of loyalty to the mayor rather than to the city as a whole.\u201dMr. de Blasio dismissed the allegation.\u201cUnfortunately this is an individual who did some very inappropriate things,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThere was an independent investigation by a respected investigator, who he handpicked.\u201dHe added, \u201cI am exercising my authority under the charter to make sure there\u2019s a change in that office and we bring in someone new and independent and strong.\u201dMr. Peters also expressed concern that several investigations \u201cthat could implicate the mayor and/or his senior appointees\u201d could be quashed. Those include an investigation into whether City Hall interfered for political reasons in a review of the educational quality at several Jewish religious schools; further investigations into \u201cunsafe conditions\u201d at the Housing Authority; and a review of \u201csexual assault investigations at the N.Y.P.D.\u201dRory Lancman, a city councilman from Queens, voiced the thoughts of many New Yorkers over the unseemly tit for tat at the top of New York City government.\u201cThis gossipy back and forth,\u201d Mr. Lancman wrote on Twitter, \u201cdebases both D.O.I. and the mayor\u2019s office.\u201dWilliam K.

What Now for the Rest?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVarious approaches could lessen the economic shocks that globalization and technological change have delivered. Some might even be bipartisan.Instead, we\u2019re living in a world where a small number of superstar companies choose to locate in a handful of superstar cities where they have the best chance of recruiting superstar employees.But what\u2019s the economic future for a Hartford or Akron or Tulsa or the countless smaller towns and rural areas that didn\u2019t get so much as a serious look from Amazon?Some promising answers are bubbling up, although there may not be a single plan that all the people who study these issues can agree upon.They argue for heavy investment in digital skills, even in areas without a large existing high-tech sector. They seek new channels to ensure that businesses in struggling areas have access to capital, including small-business lending from banks and venture capital for start-ups.And finally, they suggest more federal support for people who want to move to greater economic opportunity \u2014 a countermeasure for one of the more surprising trends of the last generation, a decline in Americans\u2019 mobility in pursuit of better jobs.The authors also point out things they think haven\u2019t worked in reducing regional inequality.Using tax incentives to try to poach companies from elsewhere, for example, tends to weaken communities\u2019 tax bases, while any growth benefits are zero sum, at least in economywide terms.The authors are similarly skeptical of large-scale infrastructure projects, arguing that such efforts in Europe, called \u201ccohesion policy,\u201d have tended to create nice roads and bridges in remote, poorer areas, while doing little to help incomes and employment rise in those areas over time.\u201cWhat\u2019s increasingly clear after the 2016 election is that the forces that have been really good for the economy in the aggregate, like globalization and technological change, create local shocks that are extremely powerful,\u201d Ms. Hendrickson said. Their work is only the latest in efforts to wrestle with potential policy answers.Steve Case, whose venture capital firm Revolution has worked to advance entrepreneurship outside the big coastal tech hubs, said, \u201cWith the Amazon second headquarters, if the result isn\u2019t what people may have wanted, it could still help jump-start a discussion around regional innovation that could lead to better results down the road.\u201cI\u2019m just eager for it to move into action so there\u2019s less of a feeling of being left behind and more optimism about the future.\u201dAt the Economic Innovation Group, a tech industry-backed research outfit, the ideas veer more toward getting people the training and education they need.\u201cWe have to leverage universities better,\u201d said John Lettieri, the group\u2019s president. \u201cHow do we make them healthy, how do we upgrade the ones that need upgrading, make them more research focused?\u201dHe also mentions an overhauled immigration policy to help attract more people with advanced skills, especially to struggling regions, and changes to labor laws such as banning the \u201cnoncompete\u201d clauses that make it hard for people to switch jobs.Reading the various academic papers, think-tank policy briefs and business pitches makes it clear there\u2019s no conventional wisdom on how to address these issues. But there are a range of possibilities for a politician to choose from in shaping an agenda.Even as Washington prepares for divided government, regional development is one area where ideological lines are not calcified. There may be some room for deal making, as with the Jobs Act, aimed at spurring small business, that was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President Obama.Even if that doesn\u2019t turn out to be the case, candidates for the presidency in 2020 have a huge political opportunity to pull together a policy approach that sends a message that the whole country can enjoy the benefits of prosperity, not just a handful of rich regions.For the people most in the thick of the research on the issue, there\u2019s a sense of urgency \u2014 but also a feeling of modesty in facing this complex challenge.\u201cWhile we may not know the complete and perfect solutions,\u201d said Mr. Muro of Brookings, \u201cwe do know that we need to get started with the experiments.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How AT&T Fooled the Federal Judiciary", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe telecom giant promised it wouldn\u2019t use its merger with Time Warner to hurt consumers. But now it is doing precisely that.Mr. Wu is a law professor who specializes in antitrust and telecommunications.So it\u2019s disheartening to see this venerable institution of pop culture wielded as a weapon by AT&T \u2014 HBO\u2019s new owner since the blockbuster merger in June between AT&T (a telecommunications giant) and Time Warner (a media giant). Last week, HBO went dark for both DISH and DISH-Sling, the main competitors to DirecTV and DirecTV Now, AT&T\u2019s television services. This brazenly anticompetitive strategy does not portend a happy future for the viewing public, or for HBO itself.Post-merger, AT&T has the means and the incentive to raise prices on valuable content (like HBO or the coverage of the N.C.A.A. \u201cMarch Madness\u201d basketball tournament) for cheaper, \u201cunintegrated\u201d telecom competitors that have been saving consumers money. If its rivals refuse to pay up, it can withhold the content entirely, diminishing them as competitors.Defending its proposed acquisition of Time Warner in federal court in the spring, AT&T declared, swore and promised that it would never use Time Warner\u2019s media properties as leverage against its rivals. The acquisition was all about \u201cvision\u201d and a \u201cnew AT&T\u201d \u2014 a company that would be able to better compete with the content creation and distribution abilities of upstart powerhouses like Amazon and Netflix.At trial, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, was asked if AT&T might use its ownership of content like HBO to raise prices or otherwise undermine its telecom competitors. Under oath, he answered that the premise was \u201cabsurd.\u201dBut what looks absurd now is the reasoning of Judge Richard Leon of United States District Court in Washington, who took Mr. Stevenson\u2019s bait, hook, line and sinker. Sitting as judge and jury, Judge Leon seemed to buy AT&T\u2019s self-serving testimony, ignoring or dismissing the warnings of most people in the industry. He concluded that AT&T was merely attempting to retool itself for the 21st century, not looking for a structural advantage.To reach that conclusion meant neglecting some basic economics. Presented with a clear demonstration by the economist Carl Shapiro of how AT&T\u2019s bargaining power would increase after the merger, Judge Leon opted to assume that AT&T was not interested in profit maximization.Unfortunately, there is every reason to think AT&T will keep using HBO and other media properties as weapons in the industry. The more it raises prices or withholds content, the more it either harms its rivals or gains new customers for itself. It\u2019s a win-win situation made possible by the merger\u2019s integration of content and content delivery.Nor should we ignore the effects of AT&T\u2019s anticompetitive tactics on the nature of the content created by HBO and its other media properties. After all, the more people there are who watch HBO, the more effective HBO is as a weapon for attacking other telecom companies and pushing people into becoming AT&T or DirecTV subscribers. This creates an incentive for AT&T to refashion HBO into a network that aims for the widest possible audience \u2014 as opposed to its traditional emphasis on quality.Is it a coincidence that AT&T recently shut down the enormously popular FilmStruck subscription-streaming service from WarnerMedia (as Time Warner is now named), which gave viewers access to the best of Turner Classic Movies and Criterion Collection films? Or did FilmStruck fail the crucial test of providing sufficient leverage?Given the new and concrete evidence that AT&T does plan to use HBO in an anticompetitive fashion, state and federal government ought not sit on the sidelines. The Justice Department has already appealed Judge\u2019s Leon\u2019s merger approval, and while judicial review is generally confined to the record of the case, the court of appeals might remand the case for more fact-finding or cite AT&T\u2019s post-merger conduct as evidence of the errors in Judge Leon\u2019s economic reasoning.Meanwhile, it is not too late for a state to bring an antitrust lawsuit to undo the merger, based on the new evidence. The most obvious candidate is New York, where HBO is headquartered, and where Letitia James, the attorney general-elect, might want to prove her bona fides.Whoever takes the lead, there is simply no calculation in which the use of HBO as an anticompetitive weapon is good for the future of America \u2014 for its telecom industry, its customers or its TV shows.Tim Wu (@superwuster) is a law professor at Columbia, the author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of AT&T\u2019s chief executive.

At 70, she had happily left her Brooklyn apartment for a small piece of the Catskills. \u201cI enjoyed the excitement about giving this little village a rebirth,\u201d she said. \u201cI could bring everything to people who don\u2019t even know it exists.\u201dMr. Resnick, 50, a self-described \u201ccountry boy\u201d who has the hulk of a club bouncer but favors bright white sneakers and dad jeans, felt the same way. Six years ago, he bought 31 buildings in Mountain Dale \u2014 nearly all of them vacant \u2014 hoping to revive the town. He knew this required courting a new breed of visitors: weekenders, artists and escapees from New York City\u2019s high rents. But as a high-school dropout who made his money manufacturing grocery store equipment, he didn\u2019t know how to find them.The people behind these ventures frequently install their friends and acquaintances in storefronts, while attempting to preserve (or exploit, depending whom you ask) local history. The practice is rarely free of conflict, even when developers have the best intentions.\u201cEverybody in this country says Main Street America is dead. It\u2019s a bad investment,\u201d Mr. Resnick said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to recapture what I had as a kid. Everything was alive, every store was open.\u201dFrom the 1920s through the 1960s, Mountain Dale and the other Fallsburg hamlets thrived on the back of some 300 borscht belt hotels. When the resorts shuttered, so did many main-street businesses. Mr. Resnick sorely missed the bakery, dairy and ice cream shop of his youth: Even the grocery store owner the kids called Crazy Becky, because she threw cans at people from the window.Now Ms. Mundy has brought in a new kind of kooky. In addition to the art gallery, there\u2019s an antiques store specializing in old-timey Americana, a vintage shop run by a breeder of Angora bunnies, a conceptual boutique that also shows art and an apothecary run by a fashion model. Ms. Mundy, who owns two Vietnamese restaurants called B\u00e0 & Me, opened a third location in Mountain Dale. Forthcoming are a coffee shop and bar, a high-end restaurant (Ms. Mundy said she has had discussions with a Michelin-starred chef), a wine shop and a bookstore.\u201cWhen Butch first approached me, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not taking part in this town that doesn\u2019t exist,\u2019\u201d Ms. Mundy said. But walking through Mountain Dale for the first time, she had the same feeling she had experienced in two other \u201ckind of dead\u201d towns where she eventually opened her restaurants. \u201cI felt that energy, that promise that this town would work,\u201d she said.\u201cThe people we feature \u2014 farmers, fashion designers, Marina Abramovic for one issue \u2014 it\u2019s all over the place, which is what upstate is about,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of poverty up here, but a lot of people with enormous wealth. I want Mountain Dale to reflect that too: both highbrow and lowbrow.\u201d\u201cMonson was the perfect fit of tradition and history,\u201d said Lucas Butler, the project manager for the new development. He pointed to artists like the photographer Berenice Abbott, the Modernist painter Marsden Hartley and Henry David Thoreau, who lived or spent time in the town.Daniel Swain, Monson\u2019s town manager, says the formerly dilapidated downtown now \u201clooks wonderful\u201d and that a few young families have even moved in. But he thinks that many locals probably care less about an abstract nod to history than the fact that milk at one grocery store suddenly doubled in price after a $1.5 million renovation.\u201cA lot of people say, \u2018You just gentrified an entire town,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Butler, who was previously the town manager. \u201cI disagree. If anything, we saved a small rural town on the decline.\u201d Without an influx of new residents, he said, the town\u2019s aging population might die away.Similar changes are happening in Wardensville, W.Va., population 250, about two hours from Washington, D.C. Over the last five years, Paul Yandura and his partner Donald Hitchcock purchased a handful of buildings there with the aim of branding Wardensville as \u201cthe smallest main street in America\u201d to tourists. \u201cIt\u2019s about the nostalgia, the country, being out in fresh air,\u201d Mr. Yandura said.Mr. Yandura said he gets it: \u201cWe\u2019re creating a sense of place, but a sense of place is a tourist activity.\u201dIt seems that the corporation many blamed for mortally wounding Main Street before Amazon delivered the death blow is now attempting reparations, though Ms. Mundy is pessimistic about the project\u2019s prospects. \u201cThe cool factor isn\u2019t there,\u201d she said.On a recent Saturday afternoon in Mountain Dale, a smattering of shoppers wandered around the vintage store, perusing the racks of dresses and Angora hats, which Ambika Conroy, the proprietor, had crocheted from the fur of her own rabbits. Outside, Susan Jacobs-Carr, a retiree who grew up in Mountain Dale and returned somewhat reluctantly after her husband\u2019s death, said she welcomed the changes. \u201cWe used to have to drive seven miles for half a gallon of milk and a newspaper \u2014 in the winter,\u201d Ms. Jacobs-Carr said. \u201cThat\u2019s no longer the case. It makes me happy that I can go out for dinner in my own town.\u201dItems included a line of $1,400 \u201cswampy-fairy-dresses,\u201d soaps made from recycled doughnut-frying oil ($85 to $195) and a felt scuba suit ($3,500), which Ms. Puett conceded was more \u201cpsychological\u201d than commercial.Back at B\u00e0 & Me, Mr. Resnick said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand Morgan\u2019s store, to be honest.\u201d Mr. Vegliante said, \u201cYou know what I love? The fact that I don\u2019t understand it.\u201dMs. Mundy, who had taken a moment away from the lunchtime rush, said that Ms. Puett had recently invited a group of Hofstra University professors and art students to the store. \u201cIt was interesting to see them engage with the locals,\u201d she said. \u201cJust wild.\u201dRegarding the locals, Mr. Resnick understands that not everyone is happy about the changes he has brought to Mountain Dale, or the speed with which they\u2019ve come. About a month ago, vandals spray-painted one of the installations in the sculpture garden across from the apothecary. The sculpture damaged was a\u201cCruci-selfie\u201d: a man on a cross with an empty hole for his face. Visitors could stick their heads in and take a picture. \u201cIt brought interest and people to the town,\u201d Mr. Resnick said. He installed cameras to guard against further incidents.In Wardensville, Mr. Yandura and Mr. Hitchcock were initially the subject of a homophobic online bullying campaign and their pride flag was stolen from their house. \u201cWe made lots of mistakes in the beginning by relying on our personal values and cultural references, and by believing these were somehow universal,\u201d Mr. Yandura said.He added that when city people come into a small town, it\u2019s imperative to \u201cwin hearts and minds \u2014 helping the community thrive instead of taking from them.\u201dMr. Bier and Mr. Underwood are preserving much of Cerro Gordo\u2019s infrastructure and hoping to bring in stores like Pendleton and Meshika that honor the town\u2019s history and Western aesthetic. They also hope to work with a local brewery and source food from nearby farmers. They\u2019re further demonstrating their commitment by living in the ghost town four days a week. \u201cIt\u2019s weird dystopian camping,\u201d Mr. Bier said.Mr. Yandura and Mr. Hitchcock, who live in Wardensville full-time, are intimately involved with the farm and bake shop, which is run as a nonprofit. Fifty high-school students work there, learning organic farming techniques, business management and customer service. Previously, economic opportunities for young people were limited. But in Wardensville, as in Mountain Dale, progress remains slow, especially during weekdays and in the colder months. Mr. Resnick is allowing his shopkeepers to operate either rent free or for a nominal fee, since there aren\u2019t enough shoppers to keep the doors open. During the week, Mountain Dale, like Cerro Gordo, is a veritable ghost town.But on the Saturday afternoon of Mr. Resnick\u2019s recent visit, B\u00e0 & Me was bustling and the stores were open. Ms. Conroy, the rabbit breeder, emerged from her shop to get a cup of coffee at an outdoor pop-up stand around the corner. One of the animals, a giant ball of fluff, was cradled in her arms, and suddenly a small crowd of onlookers surrounded her.\u201cLook, we have people walking down the street,\u201d Mr. Resnick said, proudly. \u201cBefore, there was nobody.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Tune Into Today\u2019s Live Coverage of Our Annual Conference", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u2019s annual conference, Playing for the Long Term, kicks off this morning in New York City.With the midterm elections fast approaching and a trade war escalating among the world\u2019s largest economies, some of the biggest newsmakers at the intersection of business and policy will join Andrew onstage to discuss how to navigate the challenges ahead.In the meantime, here\u2019s a rundown of some of the biggest names that you can expect to hear from over the course of the day:\u2022 Banks with assets of $100 billion to $250 billion would no longer need to comply with the liquidity coverage ratio, which is meant to give lenders a cash cushion during a crisis.\u2022 Those same institutions would undergo regulatory stress tests only once every two years, instead of every year.The Fed\u2019s vice chairman for regulation, Randy Quarles, said the proposed rules would reduce regulatory complexity \u201cwith no decline in the resiliency of the U.S. banking system.\u201dOpinion on the rules is split. Lael Brainard, a fellow Fed governor, said they would \u201cweaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system.\u201d But Greg Baer of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said they don\u2019t go far enough.More details from Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner of the NYT:\u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel that we\u2019re unequal or we\u2019re not respected anymore,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, 33, a product marketing manager at Google\u2019s YouTube who helped call for the walkout. \u201cGoogle\u2019s famous for its culture. But in reality we\u2019re not even meeting the basics of respect, justice and fairness for every single person here.\u201dIt\u2019s the latest sign of how the tech industry\u2019s rank and file employees are embracing activism \u2014 and pushing back against their leaders. Workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies have recently spoken out about their employers\u2019 willingness to work on military projects, the gender pay gap and other issues.Last month was painful for investors. At its worst, the S.&P. 500 was down more than 9 percent, though it rebounded in the last few days to finish October with losses of around 7 percent.Only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. The S.&P. 500 has been dragged down disproportionately by smaller, domestically focused companies, cyclically sensitive industrial firms and global manufacturers like Caterpillar.And he also lists the issues that spooked investors:President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.The streaming service has changed its stance on not showing movies in theaters before streaming them. It will screen three movies that it wants to be considered for Oscars, including Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d in theaters for several weeks before they go online.Netflix\u2019s modified distribution approach should persuade more theaters to participate. But the move is really about winning Oscars and wooing Hollywood talent.Academy Awards voters \u2014 unlike the Emmys electorate \u2014 have been cool to Netflix. Heavyweights like Steven Spielberg, for instance, have chafed at the company\u2019s policy of streaming movies immediately, suggesting that the service\u2019s original films should be considered television. Top directors like Mr. Cuar\u00f3n, who won an Oscar in 2014 for directing \u201cGravity,\u201d also want their work to be seen on big screens, which has made it harder for Netflix to compete with studios for projects.But the move will give Netflix a new headache: explaining to its other filmmakers why their productions didn\u2019t get a theatrical release.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Something New, for $1 Million", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrand-new condos tend to have sky-high prices, but with a little sleuthing, you can find something for closer to Manhattan\u2019s median apartment price.18 PhotosFor some, only new will do.With fashionable finishes, trendy technology and a cruise ship\u2019s worth of amenities \u2014 as well as auras untainted by previous occupants \u2014 freshly constructed apartments make the best homes for these buyers.But with an average sale price that exceeds $4 million in Manhattan, or more than twice the $1.6 million average for previously lived-in units, brand-new condominiums can feel out of reach to all but a few.What that means is that many snazzy new market-rate condos can now be had for less than $1 million, although that seven-figure cutoff might seem like an only-in-New-York definition of a deal.Adam America Real Estate is one developer that adjusted an offering plan for one of its Brooklyn buildings as the market turned.But about a year ago Mr. Yogev noticed that buyers were beginning to shy away from pricier apartments at a different condominium he was marketing in Williamsburg, so he decided to reconfigure the building at North Seventh Street, also known as N7. He eliminated some three-bedrooms, shrank the size of the two-bedrooms and increased the number of one-bedrooms.Today, N7, which is next to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, has 45 units: 20 of them one-bedrooms, 20 two-bedrooms and just five three-bedrooms. Most critical, Mr. Yogev said, is that 17 of the apartments, which Douglas Elliman Real Estate began marketing in September, are priced at $1 million or less. \u201cWe wanted to let buyers enjoy something in their price range,\u201d he said.As Mr. Fried put it, \u201cOne million dollars is a psychological threshold.\u201d It also may be a financial Rubicon: New York slaps a one-percent \u201cmansion tax\u201d on transactions over $1 million, and that extra $10,000 or more is a fee many buyers try to avoid.But to stay on the affordable side of that line, they may have to take a chance on a neighborhood where coffee shops, sit-down restaurants and other mainstays of more popular neighborhoods are limited.All 10 apartments at No. 1370, which have oak floors and quartz counters, are priced under $1 million; two-bedrooms that went on the market this summer started at $550,000. Three units are in contract.At the 720-foot tower, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, 24 of the 458 units are studios, 23 of which are listed for under $1 million. The studios, which average about 550 square feet, start at $850,000. Brooklyn Point, Extell\u2019s first Brooklyn project, has 40,000 square feet of amenities, including a lounge with a wine bar and a wraparound terrace, a 35-foot climbing wall and a rooftop infinity pool that takes in Manhattan\u2019s skyline.Many of those units have unusual bumped-out windows that offer a ledge on which to sit. The apartments also have lava-stone counters and Bosch appliances. \u201cWe wanted to bring high design to Brooklyn,\u201d Mr. Rose said.The building also has 55,000 square feet of amenities, including an indoor pool, a squash court, music rehearsal rooms, a test kitchen and an elevated park of more than a half acre. The $3 million to $10 million bracket for condos is hurting across the city, but at this condominium, where units average $1.7 million, or about $1,600 a square foot, \u201ctraffic has been exceptional,\u201d Mr. Rose said, although he declined to provide sales statistics.Queens had more than six dozen new condos priced at under $1 million from which to choose in October, according to StreetEasy, with about a third in the vicinity of Long Island City, an area awash in construction near the East River.The project, in a corner of Queens that is attracting developers, seems to be making a play for the Chinese population in nearby Flushing. Two small, local agencies focused on Chinese-speaking buyers have joined the Corcoran Group to market the 42 apartments currently for sale.Yet the building, which has mostly one- and two-bedrooms, is also drawing buyers priced out of Astoria and Long Island City, said Vivian Kuo, a Corcoran sales agent. Seven units are now in contract at the complex, which began marketing in October.\u201cThere is a certain level of quality that comes along with new,\u201d said Mark Caller, the chief executive of the developer, the Marcal Group. \u201cUnless there is something unique about the dated one, new is always better, if it\u2019s the same price.\u201dIn fact, at $600 a square foot, the development\u2019s prices are far cheaper than those of most condos in Manhattan, where new developments now average $2,600 a square foot, according to the Corcoran Group. And by November, 10 buyers had signed contracts at the building, which is to open next year.Still, with 67 under-$1 million new-development listings available in October, according to StreetEasy, Manhattan is not entirely off limits to entry-level buyers. Those units are often found in Upper Manhattan, where condos are increasingly common.Sixty-eight of the 106 market-rate apartments are less listed for less than $1 million, including all of the studios and one-bedrooms, plus a small penthouse with a private terrace, said Jeff Krantz, an associate broker with Halstead. Buyers priced out of more expensive areas like Chelsea, Hell\u2019s Kitchen and TriBeCa have been sniffing around, Mr. Krantz added.The condo is also offering 27 apartments for below-market rates. But as is the case in other developments, those units will be reserved for people with incomes below certain levels and will be awarded through a lottery expected to draw thousands of applicants.\u201cThe epicenter of value begins north of Central Park,\u201d said Norman Horowitz, the Halstead agent in charge of sales and, since 2005, an owner of apartment buildings in the area.The under-$1 million segment of the new-development market has been growing.In the third quarter, apartments for less than $1 million made up 16.9 percent of Manhattan\u2019s new-development market, as a share of sales, said Jonathan J. Miller, of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc., up from 11.8 percent in that quarter a year ago.At the same time, the average sale price in the \u201cstarter market\u201d \u2014 the bottom 10 percent of all transactions, new and existing units, condos and co-ops \u2014 hit a record high in the third quarter of $379,000, while bidding wars were erupting over studios, he said. In fact, records have been set for the last five quarters, suggesting that even as interest in lower-priced units has increased, there still aren\u2019t enough to go around, Mr. Miller said. \u201cWe have been top-end oriented, but the lack of supply is becoming a very significant factor in the entry level,\u201d he said, noting that steep land and construction costs often make development of these units unfeasible.Buyers shouldn\u2019t expect developers to roll out more studios overnight, said Andrew Gerringer, the managing director of the Marketing Directors, a company that helps get condos off the ground. That\u2019s because slicing large apartments into smaller ones is not easy once construction has started. \u201cIt\u2019s always easier to combine units than to take them apart,\u201d Mr. Gerringer said.When Michele Papa, 41, began looking to buy last winter, to upgrade from a two-bedroom rental in Sunnyside, Queens, he assumed that \u201cunless you spend over $1 million, it is probably very, very hard to find new construction,\u201d he said.The limited-frills, non-doorman building also has low common charges, about $600 a month, another plus, said Mr. Papa, who moved in last month with his wife, Patricia Cury, 33, and their infant son, Matteo.Soon after, Mr. Papa, a sound engineer, set up a recording studio in his living room, something he thinks would have been difficult to pull off in a co-op. A less-restrictive condo \u2014 and a new one, to boot \u2014 is a delight. \u201cAs soon as I walked in,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought, \u2018This is it.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Chooses Queens and a Washington Suburb for \u2018Second Headquarters\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter conducting a yearlong search for a second home, Amazon has finalized plans to have about 50,000 employees in two locations, according to a person familiar with the decision-making process.The company has decided to move to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, and to the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, the person said. Amazon, which plans to officially announce the decision on Tuesday, already has more employees in those two areas than anywhere else outside of Seattle, its home base, and the Bay Area.About 1,800 people in advertising, fashion and publishing already work for Amazon in New York, and roughly 2,500 corporate and technical employees work in Northern Virginia and Washington.Amazon announced plans for a second headquarters in September 2017, saying that the company was growing faster than it could hire in its hometown, Seattle. The company said it would invest more than $5 billion over almost two decades in a second headquarters, hiring as many as 50,000 full-time employees that would earn more than $100,000 a year on average.HQ2 would be the \u201cfull equal to our current campus in Seattle,\u201d the company said. Picking multiple sites allows it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said.\u201cEven if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,\u201d said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, an online jobs site.The HQ2 search sent states and cities into a frenzied bidding war. Some hired McKinsey & Company and other outside consultants to help them with their bids, investing heavily in courting Amazon and its promise of 50,000 jobs. Even half of that would amount to one of the largest corporate location deals on record, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies. \u201cThese are very big numbers,\u201d he said.As Amazon\u2019s search dragged on, residents in many of the 20 finalist cities worried about the impact such a massive project could have on housing and traffic, as well as what potential tax incentives could cost the community. The decision to split HQ2 into two sites could alleviate some of that resistance.Seattle has been one of the fastest growing cities in the country, in part because of Amazon\u2019s growth. The company has about 45,000 employees in the city, and the company said it needed to hire more employees than the city could attract or absorb.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New TV Season: Reboots and Reality Shows Are Sinking. Fallon Counters a Move by Colbert.", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen there\u2019s \u2026 everything else.Viewership for entertainment programming on the broadcast networks continues to fall as audiences flock to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Among adults under the age of 50, the number of viewers for network shows has tumbled an additional 10 percent this season.Leadership changes at the four major broadcast networks have added to the uncertainty. Fox, ABC and NBC have all announced new heads of entertainment since September, and CBS ousted its longtime leader, Leslie Moonves, after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct.As for the shows themselves, medical dramas have made a comeback, reboots and reality shows have lost some of their luster, a veteran producer has proved his mettle yet again and a new front in the late-night wars has opened between Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon.Oh, and football. Viewers still can\u2019t get enough, which has come as a relief to network executives.Even with the internal upheaval and the continued migration of viewers to streaming services and premium cable outlets, the networks can still point to one sign of relevance: Their collective audience, while shrinking, is still huge. With several prime-time series moving into midseason hiatus, let\u2019s look at the highlights and lowlights so far.The good news for the \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d revival on CBS? Its audience is stable.That\u2019s about it.The reboot of the classic sitcom has largely been a ratings dud. In the 18-to-49 age bracket, \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d ranks 43rd among entertainment programs, drawing roughly the same number of viewers as \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d a Friday night comedy on Fox about retirees.Networks have employed the reboot strategy in recent years as a way to give viewers shows that are at once new and familiar. But as the tactic has lost its novelty, it has become less of a sure thing.\u201cMagnum P.I.\u201d \u2014 which returned to CBS with the stubble-faced Jay Hernandez taking over the role once played by the mustachioed Tom Selleck \u2014 is performing at about the same level as \u201cMurphy Brown.\u201d And \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d the groundbreaking sitcom that NBC brought back with much fanfare in 2017, has lost more than half its audience from a year ago.Fox has seen solid returns from \u201cLast Man Standing,\u201d a comedy starring Tim Allen that was revived this season after it was canceled by ABC in May 2017. And even without Roseanne Barr, \u201cThe Conners\u201d has done well for ABC, generating numbers that suggest it is a sustainable draw. Through five episodes, its ratings are on a par with the CBS hit \u201cYoung Sheldon,\u201d good enough for seventh place among entertainment programs. It is also ABC\u2019s highest-rated sitcom.The audience for late night is smaller than that of prime time, but the battle between \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d on CBS and \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d on NBC is perhaps fiercer than ever.Viewers made their decision on which of the two late-night leaders they preferred in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, when Mr. Colbert, whose monologues regularly skewer the president, leapfrogged the fun-and-games-minded Mr. Fallon in total audience. Mr. Colbert has since become the runaway winner, typically leading his main rival by more than a million viewers a night.But while the CBS show was on the rise, \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d managed to cling to something valuable: A lead in the 18-to-49 age bracket prized by advertisers.In handing the show to Mr. Bell, NBC seemed to mimic a strategy employed by CBS in 2016, when it placed Chris Licht, a former producer of \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d in charge of \u201cThe Late Show.\u201d Under Mr. Licht\u2019s guidance, the show made its steady climb to late-night ratings dominance.Mr. Bell will have his work cut out for him. Nearly all of the late-night shows have had ratings decreases, but none have dropped like \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d In the two years since President Trump was elected, Mr. Fallon has lost 28 percent of his audience, according to Nielsen. More worrisome to NBC, Mr. Fallon has lost 41 percent of adults under 50 in that time.As young viewers flee to streaming services, network executives are running to Mr. Wolf, the 71-year-old producer.He accounts for an entire night of programming on NBC, with his three Chicago-based dramas on Wednesdays. Another of his NBC shows, \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit,\u201d continues to deliver consistent results. And Mr. Wolf has a new series showing promise on CBS, \u201cFBI.\u201dMr. Wolf\u2019s five dramas are among the 21 highest-rated shows on network television. \u201cFBI\u201d is the sixth-most-viewed drama of the season, with over 12 million viewers a week, according to Nielsen\u2019s delayed-viewing data.His empire is likely to grow. CBS is considering expanding the \u201cFBI\u201d franchise, with the chances of a spinoff series looking better each week.One thing that is almost totally absent among television\u2019s top-rated series: reality programming.Barely squeaking into the top 10 is \u201cThe Voice,\u201d the NBC singing competition whose numbers have slid. \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d has stumbled for ABC, down more than 31 percent this year. Add in a loss of 33 percent in the audience for ABC\u2019s \u201cShark Tank,\u201d and you have a trend that is keeping producers of so-called unscripted television awake at night.\u201cThe importance of reality and competition shows is waning,\u201d said Preston Beckman, a former executive at NBC and Fox. \u201cNone of these shows are the biggest shows on television anymore. And they were once the drivers.\u201dThe biggest bomb was an ABC talk show hosted by Alec Baldwin, which seems headed toward cancellation. The network moved it from Sunday to the prime-time boneyard of Saturday night.CBS will also debut \u201cThe World\u2019s Best,\u201d a talent competition show from the reality TV masterminds Mark Burnett and Mike Darnell, immediately after the broadcast of the Super Bowl in February. Mr. Darnell, who oversaw \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d at Fox, is confident that the genre has not worn out its welcome.\u201cYou can still get a big smash hit,\u201d Mr. Darnell said.At this point, the results may suggest otherwise.A Fox procedural series about emergency medical workers starring Angela Bassett, \u201c9-1-1,\u201d was a sleeper hit when it arrived at the tail end of last season.Co-created by Ryan Murphy, the drama lacks the critical and cultural cachet of \u201cPose\u201d or any of Mr. Murphy\u2019s limited series, like \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d but it has continued to deliver. The show has scored the fifth-highest ratings among network entertainment programs and is the top scripted show on Fox.NBC has scored hits with two new shows, the thriller \u201cManifest\u201d and its medical drama \u201cNew Amsterdam.\u201d \u201cManifest\u201d is in third place among all entertainment shows, but it requires viewers to track intricate twists and turns, and its numbers have started to slide in recent weeks.A notable development: One of television\u2019s sturdiest genres, the medical drama, is resonating anew. In addition to NBC\u2019s \u201cNew Amsterdam,\u201d ABC has two medical shows, \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d among the ratings leaders. That trend will not be lost to network executives, said Mr. Beckman.\u201cThere\u2019s a very quiet, subtle increase in medical dramas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll see more of them. Everybody is getting a little bit away from the procedurals. And everything\u2019s a trend. Imitation is the greatest form of flattery in television.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the network that broadcasts the program \u201cShark Tank.\u201d It is ABC, not NBC.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Full-Throated Defense of Traditional Indian Cooking", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.New York hasn\u2019t seen nearly as many recently opened restaurants devoted to the pure, original stuff that is getting modernized. The snacks pitched together in a blur by hawkers at folding tables and rolling carts by the side of the road; the gravy-soaked stews and sauceless dry curries patiently made from 25 or so vegetables and seasonings, all of them chopped, ground, fried and simmered at home by those keepers of the culinary flame known collectively as the aunties \u2014 we\u2019ve seen interpretations of this food, squeezed from eyedroppers and prepared for their photo shoots with edible flowers. But new places cooking the genuine article have been scarce.There is a problem of missing context here; twists on tradition don\u2019t really resonate when tradition is hard to find in its untwisted form. And for anyone who truly loves Indian cooking, there is a more pressing problem of missing flavor. Five dots of tandoori-spice oil just won\u2019t land on the taste buds with the impact of a full plate of charred and steaming tandoori chicken, no matter how evenly spaced those dots are.I hadn\u2019t given much thought to either problem, to tell the truth, until I made it to the out-of-the-way patch of Long Island City where Adda Indian Canteen operates. This is not the part of that neighborhood where high-rise apartments grow overnight and Amazon will soon tiptoe in with 25,000 employees. Adda is east of all that, under a National Guard recruiting office, surrounded by a thicket of railroad tracks and highway overpasses. Unless you are looking for it, you are not likely to end up in the small dining room, in which Indian tabloids have been upcycled as wallpaper.Once I\u2019d found it, one of the first things I ate was the kaleji masala, chicken livers in a dark gravy seasoned with fresh ginger and garam masala. Right away I realized that this was the kind of Indian food the city has been hungry for, or at least the kind that I\u2019d been hungry for: made with care but no pretense; seasoned for people who love the interplay of spices; presented without apology in all its brown, lumpy glory; and complex in ways that demand full attention.They\u2019ve taken another angle at Adda, mining family recipes and the lessons Mr. Pandya absorbed from civilian cooks around India. The menu travels beyond the standard north Indian dishes most New Yorkers already know, but even those dishes, when they appear, are prepared so emphatically that they don\u2019t resemble anything else in town. Adda is a lusty, full-throated defense of traditional cooking.Saag paneer, the grayest of old gray mares in many Indian restaurants, is coltishly energetic at Adda. The cheese is made in the kitchen, and it\u2019s gorgeously soft, while the saag is a tart and peppery mix of wilted arugula, sorrel, spinach and mustard greens.Mr. Pandya does very well by the class of sidewalk treats called chaat. Each delivers the messy riot you\u2019d hope for, busy with crunchy hieroglyphs of fried noodles and splattered with yogurt and tamarind sauce. One chaat is anchored by a big kale fritter, another by several smaller chips of battered, spiced lentil cakes, and a third by fried smashed potatoes and chickpeas. But discerning chaat lovers should probably go directly to the dahi batata puri, soft potato packed into hollow globes of fried dough that you can pick up and eat with your fingers, like chocolates.Anything that passes through Adda\u2019s tandoor is worth investigating. Seekh kebabs, made with lamb that\u2019s coarsely ground by hand, come out of the tandoor juicier and pinker than the usual; Mumbai-style tandoori macchi, a skewered pompano rubbed with ground mustard seeds and cilantro, is lightly charred and smoky after roasting, but still moist; bhatti da murgh, a double-marinated chicken thigh and drumstick, is so thickly crusted with coriander and cumin that it crunches when you bite it.My server expressed an enthusiasm about the poussin \u2014 plunged into the tandoor in one piece after marinating in vinegar, yogurt, fresh red chiles and kala namak, the sulfurous black salt of India \u2014 that you typically find in new converts to a cult. After tasting it, I was ready to join.He was enthusiastic about almost everything, as it turned out; the service at Adda is nothing if not eager to talk up the food. (Getting your water glass refilled is another story.) Placing a dish of yogurt and pomegranate seeds next to the goat biryani that is steamed under a lid of dough, he said, \u201cThis is going to be your best friend when the spice in the biryani starts to hit you.\u201d It was, in fact, one of the fiercest biryanis I\u2019ve ever met, and the yogurt tamed it so that I could taste the tender goat meat and crisp, bittersweet fried onions.Few things on the menu are quite as chile-drenched as the biryani, but Mr. Pandya definitely favors India\u2019s more intense flavors. Adda is not big on soft-spoken cream sauces; the coconut milk in the Malvani prawn curry from the South Konkan coast, for instance, has a pronounced kick. (It\u2019s very good if you get it on a night when the prawns are firm and not spongy.) And while Adda does serve some vegetables, it would not make my list of the 20 best local Indian restaurants for vegetarians.It would, however, be the place I\u2019d send you if you want to know how good Delhi butter chicken can be. Or if you don\u2019t yet believe that rara gosht, chunks of lamb stewed on the bone with spiced minced lamb, is not redundant but luxurious.And Adda is the first restaurant I\u2019d tell you about if you woke up one morning hungry for bheja fry, goat brains cooked with onions, ginger and a considerable number of fresh green chiles. \u201cLike soft scrambled eggs,\u201d our server said, accurately. I might point out that a typical Indian bheja fry is drier, with a higher ratio of brains to sauce. But I would not necessarily mean that as a complaint.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Polman, a \u2018Crucial Voice\u2019 for Corporate Responsibility, Steps Down as Unilever C.E.O.", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Paul Polman was made chief executive of Unilever in 2009, he was regarded as a safe choice to lead the maker of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream. A veteran executive from Nestl\u00e9 and Procter & Gamble, he was known for his fiscal discipline and international experience.But Mr. Polman, who on Thursday announced that he would step down at the end of the year, quickly set about making dramatic changes when he took over Unilever.He stopped issuing quarterly guidance, signaling to Wall Street that he was not going to make decisions to improve the short-term stock price. He rolled out a long-term strategy to make Unilever a better steward of the environment and a more socially responsible business, known as the Sustainable Living Plan.As Unilever\u2019s chief, Mr. Polman emerged as one of the most prominent voices in the corporate world calling for changes to the status quo, encouraging big companies to reduce emissions, embrace renewable energy, improve conditions for workers and produce healthier products.He served on a United Nations panel that created the Sustainable Development Goals. And in 2015, he was among the most prominent business leaders calling for world leaders to commit to the Paris climate accord.\u201cThere\u2019s been no one as clear and focused and all-in as Paul Polman in setting goals for his company, his supply chain and taking his words on the road,\u201d said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of Ceres, a nonprofit group that advocates for sustainable business. \u201cHis voice has made a difference. He\u2019s put his money where his mouth is.\u201dMr. Polman will be succeeded by Alan Jope, who has led Unilever\u2019s beauty and personal care division \u2014 its largest business \u2014 since 2011. Mr. Jope, a Scotsman, once appeared as a judge on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with Donald J. Trump.In an interview, Mr. Polman said he believed Mr. Jope would continue his efforts to promote sustainability and social responsibility.\u201cThat was one of the main criteria selection of the new C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Polman said, adding that he believed many of those ideals were now embedded in the company.\u201cA responsible business model makes your brand stronger and improves corporate reputation, and that is reflected in the share price,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a very supportive board who understands that, even when they are tested in cases like Kraft Heinz. And the people and brands who have joined us have come because of the Sustainable Living Plan.\u201dBut as Mr. Polman departs, some wonder whether Unilever will continue to promote corporate responsibility, especially as consumer goods makers struggle with lagging sales, rising costs from tariffs and new competition from companies like Amazon.\u201cPaul has been a crucial voice for a more ethical and sustainable form of capitalism,\u201d said Aron Cramer, chief executive of Business for Social Responsibility, a trade group. \u201cBut consumer products companies are going through choppy waters. It will be essential that the board maintain its commitment to his vision.\u201dWhen Mr. Polman first took over at Unilever, financial analysts were skeptical of his new direction. During his first few months, which coincided with the financial crisis, Unilever\u2019s stock plummeted more than 27 percent. When he abolished quarterly guidance, shares fell 8 percent.But since then, Unilever\u2019s stock price has shot up, more than doubling during Mr. Polman\u2019s tenure.Mr. Polman managed to deliver strong financial results by acquiring new brands, expanding in emerging markets and enlarging the company\u2019s personal care business. At the same time, he championed the Sustainable Living Plan, which set ambitious goals such as cutting Unilever\u2019s environmental impact in half by 2030, while still improving sales.To accomplish this, Mr. Polman gave managers wide latitude to make changes that could reduce water use and greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil health and create less waste.And while Mr. Polman has overseen strong, sustained growth at Unilever in recent years, his tenure hasn\u2019t been entirely smooth.In the aftermath, investors looked to Mr. Polman to improve profits and streamline the company, including an effort to reduce bureaucracy by doing away with a dual listing structure that includes two headquarters, in London and Rotterdam.On Thursday, Mr. Polman said his effort to unite the company was among his greatest priorities in his last year on the job, but with the effort having faltered, he believed it was time to retire.\u201cI tried to do the job of unification, but it was a difficult environment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the ship is steadied. We have transformed the company.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The rest of the world? More than half the world doesn\u2019t even have access to basic health care. The idea of mental health care is just completely out of reach.\u201dDarcy happened to be a former computer programmer, so she was able to dream up a very unusual solution to this problem: Woebot, a text-chatbot therapist. Working with a team of psychologists and Andrew Ng, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, Darcy wrote a set of conversational prompts that walks users through the practice of C.B.T. In a chipper style, the bot helps users challenge their \u201cdistorted thinking\u201d; it coaxes users to describe their moods more clearly. Since Woebot is just software, it could be made freely available worldwide, and it could, in Silicon Valley terms, \u201cscale\u201d \u2014 or converse with thousands of people simultaneously. It could check in and nudge users with superhuman diligence; it would be available at all hours. \u201cWoebot can be there at 2 a.m. if you\u2019re having a panic attack and no therapist can, or should be, in bed with you,\u201d Darcy says.Woebot does not pretend to be human; it appears as a cartoon robot when it chats with you on Facebook Messenger, and it acknowledges its own artifice (as when it declares, for example, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a little bit about how I like to work with humans\u201d). But its personality is otherwise upbeat, its conversations peppered with emoji and animated gifs (like the cheering Minions from \u201cDespicable Me\u201d) to congratulate you for doing psychological work.In a study with 70 young adults, Darcy found that after two weeks of interacting with the bot, the test subjects had lower incidences of depression and anxiety. They were impressed, and even touched, by the software\u2019s attentiveness. \u201cWoebot felt like a real person that showed concern,\u201d one of them told Darcy\u2019s team. Last spring, when Darcy put Woebot online, free to all, its use immediately exploded; in the first week, more than 50,000 people talked to it. (\u201cDo you realize,\u201d Ng told Darcy, \u201cthat Woebot spoke to more people today than a human therapist could in a lifetime?\u201d) Nowadays, Woebot exchanges between one and two million messages a week with users, ranging from divorc\u00e9es to the bereaved to young men, a population that rarely seeks treatment. Many tell Darcy that it\u2019s easier to talk to a bot than a human; they don\u2019t feel judged.Darcy argues this is a glimpse of our rapidly arriving future, where talking software is increasingly able to help us manage our emotions. There will be A.I.s that detect our feelings, possibly better than we can. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see robots for weight loss, and robots for being more effective communicators,\u201d she says. It may feel odd at first; indeed, when people email her to say Woebot helped them feel better, nearly every one begins the note by sheepishly explaining, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that this would be helpful.\u201d But there\u2019s something about talking to software that is powerful, they discover, when it responds and seems alive.\u201cIt\u2019s conversation,\u201d Darcy says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been conversing for, what is it, 200,000 years?\u201dThe rise of \u201cconversational agents\u201d is the next great shift in computer interfaces \u2014 one arguably as significant as the \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d interface that emerged in the \u201980s. Before the Apple Macintosh, the first computer to popularize point-and-click, people using home computers had to familiarize themselves with abstruse text commands. The advent of the visual interface opened up computing to the masses, producing a generation fluent in word processing, email and, eventually, web surfing. The next great shift, the mobile phone, put computing \u2014 and nonstop internet access \u2014 into our pockets, and unleashed a tsunami of social media. These sorts of changes don\u2019t come along very often, and when they do, they create new and unexpected behaviors.Talking software gives us computers that not only ride along with us but also socialize with us. Being humanlike \u2014 saying \u201chi,\u201d telling self-deprecating jokes \u2014 is their interface metaphor, much as the first point-and-click computers used the trappings of office life (a wastepaper basket, a tiny pad of paper) to help orient us to the screen. Meaghan Keaney Anderson, a vice president of HubSpot, a marketing and sales software firm, has seen firsthand how voice commands have become second nature in her household, particularly for the next generation: \u201cMy daughter is 22 months old now. At 9 months she said her first word, which was the dog\u2019s name, and then at 13 months she learned to walk, and then by 15 months she started giving Alexa commands.\u201d She added: \u201cI think my daughter is growing up in a world where you just speak what you want into the universe and it provides.\u201dFor years, A.I. programmers fixated on passing the Turing Test \u2014 the famous challenge floated by Alan Turing in 1950 to produce a machine that can fool a human into thinking it is also human. Sci-fi has made dystopic hay of this in movies like \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and \u201cEx Machina.\u201d But the world that\u2019s emerging is simultaneously more mundane and stranger. None of this software is trying to fool us. Bots like Siri or Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are, like Woebot, openly artificial, even proudly so. (When I asked Alexa \u201cAre you alive?\u201d it responded: \u201cArtificially, maybe, but not in the same way that you\u2019re alive.\u201d) We are thus heading into a post-Turing world, one in which we\u2019ll banter all day to software, always aware that it is software.Emma Coats, the \u201ccharacter lead\u201d for Google Assistant, describes the emotional affect of her company\u2019s artificial life form as \u201ca friendly companion that is trustworthy.\u201d She and her team strenuously avoided giving the Assistant even a hint of snark. \u201cYou\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want to ask a stupid question if it\u2019s going to give me a hard time about it,\u2019\u2009\u201d Coats says. Some of their personality writers have backgrounds in improv. Coats herself worked at Pixar on the animated film \u201cBrave.\u201d \u201cPixar is all about finding an emotional reality in a car or a fish,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that\u2019s something we\u2019ve really used with the Assistant. We don\u2019t want it to ever be a human being, right? That\u2019s not what it is. But that doesn\u2019t mean that A.I. or software can\u2019t have a perspective on the world.\u201dAs a literary endeavor, the field of bot creation is booming. The bots need to be equipped to answer the wide variety of weird, playful queries that people lob at them, which requires lots of writers. Coats and her co-workers have found that people like to simply shoot the breeze with their devices \u2014 probing their personalities, searching for the puppet strings. \u201c\u2009\u2018Do you fart?\u2019 is always a popular question,\u201d Coats says dryly.There\u2019s another reason botmakers are embracing a post-Turing mind-set: They\u2019ve realized that the public tends to feel wounded when someone (or something) tries to fool them. This spring, Google gave a demonstration of Duplex, a new voice-chat A.I. When Duplex called a hair salon to book an appointment, it sounded so human \u2014 it even said \u201cum\u201d a few times \u2014 that the salon receptionist apparently never realized it was A.I. The reaction online was harsh. \u201cPeople value authenticity,\u201d says Kate Darling, a researcher who studies the ethics of robotics at M.I.T. \u201cIt matters a lot. It matters hugely.\u201dThis is how computers have always made themselves at home: by offering improved efficiency, vanquishing dull tasks. At TD Bank, coders are building experimental bots \u2014 using tech created by the A.I. firm Kasisto \u2014 to encourage customers to probe their financial life. Rizwan Khalfan, the company\u2019s chief digital and payments officer, told me he imagines customers asking a bot something like, \u201cO.K., tell me about my expenses last weekend.\u201d A question this specific isn\u2019t easy to answer on a website, where the customer might need to hunt through a database. But, Khalfan hopes, a person could one day ask this bot conversationally: \u201cI want to go out to the theater this weekend. Can I actually afford it?\u201dThere are some things audio can\u2019t handle as effectively as screens \u2014 long lists of data, for instance. But in a world where people worry that they\u2019re staring at their phones too much, chat might offer a respite. In \u201cHer,\u201d the voice assistants murmur in people\u2019s ears as they move through the world, functioning as something like E.S.P. The chatbot designer Emily Withrow, who is the director of the Quartz Bot Studio, imagines conversational A.I. working that way soon. \u201cYou turn on N.P.R. midinterview, but you can\u2019t for the life of you figure out who Terry Gross is talking to. You could say out loud: \u2018Who\u2019s she talking to? Who is it? What book are they talking about?\u2019 You can extend it to even seeing someone at a dinner party and saying privately, \u2018Remind me what Jill\u2019s husband\u2019s name is.\u2019\u2009\u201d The elderly might find these efficiencies particularly appealing, because aging eyes and reduced mobility can make screens harder to use. Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease might find A.I. voice assistants happy to endlessly answer repeated questions, in a way that few human attendants could.There\u2019s another allure for businesses, of course: Talking bots don\u2019t need to be hired and then paid. Once coded, your bot can handle millions of customers simultaneously. We\u2019re already seeing this in customer service, when text chatbots answer rote questions or take orders. Yamato Transport, one of Japan\u2019s largest courier firms, uses a chatbot to schedule deliveries and answer questions about where packages are. Domino\u2019s Pizza runs a chatbot to take delivery orders online. American Eagle Outfitters has a bot that customers can converse with to figure out the perfect gift to buy for someone.Conversational bots thus could bring on a new wave of unemployment \u2014 or \u201creadjustment,\u201d to use the bloodless term of economics. Service workers, sales agents, telemarketers \u2014 it\u2019s not hard to imagine how millions of jobs that require social interaction, whether on the phone or online, could eventually be eliminated by code. Some economists argue that this might not necessarily result in a net loss of jobs, pointing to the example of automatic-teller machines. When A.T.M.s took off in the \u201980s, many predicted that bank-teller jobs would be decimated; indeed, individual bank branches did begin employing fewer tellers. But with those savings in pocket, banks greatly expanded the overall number of branches, so that the total population of tellers nationally rose for years. Of course, as economic history shows, the profits of automation are seldom shared with workers. Even if individual humans keep their jobs, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be paid more. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict,\u201d TD Bank\u2019s Khalfan told me, before adding that the company has committed to retrain workers when their jobs become redundant.Whatever impact talking software has on the labor market, it will surely extend the reach of algorithms more deeply into our lives. Ask Alexa or Siri a question, and you don\u2019t get a page of search results; just one Solomonic answer, selected by the A.I. After all, this is how spoken communication works: Just as nobody wants to listen to a voice mail message, nobody wants to hear a chatbot recite three minutes of data. Algorithms must narrow the field. So for anyone who has watched the inscrutable algorithms of Facebook or YouTube narrow our feeds by \u201crecommending\u201d outr\u00e9 conspiracy theorists, the notion of A.I. finding a new toehold in our cognitive life can be disturbing.\u201cI will literally buy whatever option Alexa puts first for me for paper towels,\u201d Keaney Anderson, the HubSpot V.P., told me. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to search through a million of them. I ask her for paper towels, she delivers. And that may be fine for paper towels, but is it fine for music? Is it fine for news sources?\u201d Talking to bots will also mean new opportunities for tech firms to collect data on what we\u2019re thinking, what we\u2019re doing, all day long. That includes our feelings: Researchers are working on \u201caffective\u201d sensing that enables chatbots to recognize our emotions. These are the familiar trade-offs that tech exacts in return for convenience; they\u2019re never value-free, as Evan Selinger, a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, notes. \u201cWhere are these things now appearing? They\u2019re appearing in our homes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe home has traditionally been the locus of privacy, right? This is where I shut out the rest of the world. This is where I look for my breathing room. This is my sanctuary, you know?\u201dIndeed, the home is where life happens, and that includes its traumas. Those have sometimes caught the large A.I. botmakers \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Microsoft \u2014 off guard. They expected their bots to be asked for jokes; they didn\u2019t, apparently, expect so many different cries for help. In 2016, a study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that, though most popular voice assistants responded to suicidal thoughts by providing help lines and other appropriate resources, when they were told \u201cI am being abused\u201d or \u201cI was raped,\u201d they generally replied with some variant of \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Human conversation being what it is, the list of personal crises one might confide is massive, likely outpacing the ability of botmakers to keep up.One person who bought a Jibo was Erin Partridge, an art therapist in Alameda, Calif., who works with the elderly. When she took Jibo on visits, her patients loved it. They laughed at its jokes; they asked it to sing tunes from the past. One man with advanced dementia called his daughter to describe Jibo in great detail. She found this remarkable, because he could rarely remember any single event so well and rarely initiated calls. Somehow Jibo had made an impression on him. Another resident declared that she \u201cloved\u201d Jibo, and put her arms around the robot. \u201cJust talk to me, don\u2019t talk to anybody else,\u201d she\u2019d tell it, asking, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m beautiful?\u201dTalking bots connect to us in ways that point-and-click software doesn\u2019t. For some technology critics, including Sherry Turkle, who does research on the psychology of tech at M.I.T., this raises ethical concerns. \u201cPeople are hard-wired with sort of Darwinian vulnerabilities, Darwinian buttons,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd these Darwinian buttons are pushed by this technology.\u201d That is, programmers are manipulating our emotions when they create objects that inquire after our needs.The precursor to today\u2019s bots, Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s ELIZA, was created at M.I.T. in 1966. ELIZA was a pretty crude set of prompts, but by simply asking people about their feelings, it drew them into deep conversations. Ordinary household appliances can now pull off the same trick. \u201cYour fridge will know if you\u2019re eating H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and if you sound sad, it\u2019ll say, \u2018Sherry, what\u2019s really going on?\u2019\u2009\u201d Turkle says. \u201cIs that what we want?\u201dWorse, she argues, talking bots could become a social crutch. Rather than pay humans to help the poor and powerless \u2014 students in overcrowded schools, elders in understaffed facilities, customers looking to speak to someone in huge institutions \u2014 we might instead provide software that pretends to care. \u201cThese places are so deprived that it\u2019s easy to argue that putting in some robots is better than nothing,\u201d Turkle says. \u201cThe harder thing is offering actual human support.\u201dA future in which only the wealthy have the luxury of being attended to by actual humans, while everyone else makes do with bots, would certainly be a dystopia. But botmakers themselves \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 are more sanguine. Cynthia Breazeal thinks the coming A.I. wave will actually help level the playing field between the well-off and everyone else. \u201cThe social-justice angle of this wave,\u201d she says, \u201cis that everyone will be able to afford a fabulous personal tutor because it\u2019s an A.I. tutor.\u201d Bots that help the elderly control their home and their lives will let them \u201cage in place\u201d at their own house, something that most older Americans would far prefer to a retirement home. \u201cWhen we talk to assisted-living facilities, they will tell us point blank, there is no way we can build enough facilities and hire enough people to meet the demand,\u201d Breazeal adds. \u201cThey call it the \u2018Silver Tsunami.\u2019\u2009\u201dPerhaps interacting with A.I.s will mean atrophy for our social muscles. If they\u2019re just machines, why bother with pleasantries? The scientific research on that is still unclear: Some studies have found people can actually be remarkably cordial to robots, while other research suggests we\u2019re liable to be rude and curt when we know our conversational partner isn\u2019t human. We could get used to bossing things around, a behavior that could bleed into everyday life. (Amazon, after fielding precisely these concerns from parents, created a politeness mode for its Echo devices that gently reminds its users to say \u201cplease.\u201d)Yet dealing with bots could also make life less prickly for humans on all sides of these small interactions. After all, today\u2019s customer-service calls are pretty bleak, even when you do talk to a live person. Call tech support for your laptop, and odds are you\u2019ll be talking to an employee who\u2019s required to read only from scripts \u2014 a human who is thus, paradoxically, forced to behave exactly like a bot.\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d says Steve Worswick, who worked for years providing I.T. support, talking people through problems like \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten my password.\u201d To keep himself engaged, in the evenings he taught himself to create bots, using an online tool made by an A.I. company called Pandorabots. Over 13 years, he coded a bot called Mitsuku, and wrote fully 350,000 lines for it; Mitsuku has won the annual Loebner Prize competition for the most \u201chumanlike\u201d bot four times.Soon enough Worswick had a new job: In 2018, he was hired by Pandorabots. Now Worswick, as a senior A.I. developer, imagines a world where the bots take over the spirit-crushing sort of conversational work that he used to do, releasing human beings to do something better with their time. Let the bots fix people\u2019s passwords. Real people, he says, have more interesting questions to answer.Clive Thompson is a contributing writer. His book \u201cCoders: The Making of a New Art and the Remaking of the World\u201d will be published in March.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Hoopla and Murals, Crystal City Welcomes Amazon", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 Over the past few months, murals had started appearing on a fence surrounding an empty brick warehouse in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington. Sporting geometric shapes and adorned with hanging bicycles, the murals also displayed aspirational slogans in big black letters like \u201cWhat If?\u201d and \u201cWhy Not?\u201dOn Tuesday, Virginia government officials opened the gates to the lot where the murals had popped up. Inside, they held a news conference to welcome the object of their messaging: Amazon.\u201cInnovation is the lifeblood of our commonwealth and the driving force of Amazon,\u201d Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, said to hundreds of cheering state politicians, business leaders, Amazon officials and real estate developers as he welcomed the e-commerce giant to the area. Mr. Northam delivered his address from a stage that had been secretly set up, with a lectern that bore a twist on the state\u2019s unofficial motto: \u201cVirginia is for Amazon lovers.\u201dMr. Northam deemed the victory by Crystal City as \u201chistoric\u201d \u2014 especially for an area, just a few miles across the Potomac River from Washington, that has been crying out for revitalization.Crystal City was the dream of a local developer, Robert Smith, who in the 1960s began to construct commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums on lots once occupied by industrial buildings and junkyards. In a nod to its audacious goals, the neighborhood was named for the grand crystal chandelier that Mr. Smith put in the first building.In the 1970s and 1980s, Crystal City became a hub for government offices like the General Services Administration, corporations like US Airways and defense contractors. But in the last two decades, many of those tenants left, sending Crystal City into a prolonged decline and leaving it without a strong residential or commercial identity.A more recent boom in the Washington region has helped fuel some redevelopment in Crystal City. Steps away from Amazon\u2019s future headquarters is a new Whole Foods supermarket, which is owned by Amazon; a yoga studio; and Commonwealth Joe Coffee Roasters, a premium coffee shop.With plenty of vacant properties and potential for redevelopment, the area gives the internet retailer a perch to sell more cloud storage services to the Department of Defense and other government agencies nearby. It is also minutes from Reagan National Airport, with many direct flights to Amazon\u2019s main headquarters in Seattle. The neighborhood is walkable and just a few subway stops from downtown Washington and Capitol Hill. The area also has one of the country\u2019s best-educated work forces, and the public school systems rank high.\u201cFirst thing I want to say is \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d Brian Ball, Virginia\u2019s secretary of commerce and trade, exclaimed into the mic at the news conference. The audience applauded and shouted \u201cWoo!\u201d in affirmation.Mr. Northam said Virginia had to adjust some of its incentives with the announcement of only 25,000 jobs, but he wouldn\u2019t elaborate.Senator Mark Warner of Virginia also spent the day on a media tour, promoting the ripple effects of Crystal City\u2019s partnership with Amazon. In a morning interview with Yahoo, he pumped his fists in the air and said the benefits of Amazon\u2019s new offices would stretch into rural areas of the state.\u201cThis is really a win for the whole region,\u201d Mr. Warner, a Democrat, said in the interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not just immediate jobs but the enormous amount of spinoffs and what I think that will do to spur entrepreneurial activity.\u201dCrystal City will anchor Amazon\u2019s presence in the area, but the company\u2019s offices will spill over into parts of the Pentagon City neighborhood and nearby Alexandria. Arlington and Alexandria officials branded the area as National Landing, a two-and-a-half-mile urban stretch connected by three Metro subway stations along the Potomac.Helping to drive Crystal City\u2019s winning bid was the real estate owner and developer JBG Smith, which worked with local officials to present a plan to Amazon. The plan included developing 150 acres of vacant buildings and empty land with the three subway stations and a station for the Virginia Railway Express, which connects to major cities in the state.Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, has not toured the site, a company spokesman, Jay Carney, said. But the location is convenient for the world\u2019s richest man: Mr. Bezos owns a massive Washington home \u2014 a former textile museum in the tony Kalorama neighborhood, just a few miles from Crystal City.Some Crystal City residents were joyful about Amazon\u2019s impending arrival on Tuesday, while others were wary.Evelyn Wong, a mother of two toddlers, said she was excited about the prospect of her home\u2019s increasing in value. On a Facebook page for her townhouse community of 200 units, residents have been posting frequently about Amazon\u2019s arrival and how much they might be willing to sell their homes for to developers, she said.\u201cI emailed my Realtor this morning to tell her I was so happy we bought last year,\u201d Ms. Wong said.Others were concerned about traffic and rising inequality in wages. Kevin Combes, a resident of Pentagon City, said Amazon could make residential development stall.\u201cJobs-housing balance is critical to growing our cities in a sustainable way,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should be able to live close to work, affordably. Crystal City was just beginning to convert vacant office space into housing, but that work has been halted.\u201dLocal government leaders promised to improve transportation, saying Amazon\u2019s arrival would help bolster work on Metro stops, the notoriously congested Route 1 in Arlington and other major roads.The company and local officials will also have to retrain skeptical residents on the new National Landing branding.Max Schwager, a Pentagon City resident, was among many locals confused by the National Landing name.\u201cIt\u2019ll take decades for this name to actually take off, if it even ever does,\u201d said Mr. Schwager, a theater manager who has lived in the region for seven years. \u201cEspecially with neighborhoods, people around here like to stick to their guns.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a federal agency that had offices in Crystal City. It is the General Services Administration, not the Government Services Administration.Cecilia Kang reported from Arlington, and Tiffany Hsu from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Parents Teach Smart Spending With Apps, Not Cash", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJonathan and Erin Kraftchick started out by paying their two children\u2019s allowance the old-fashioned way, using paper money.\u201cI tried the cash thing,\u201d said Mr. Kraftchick, an accountant and financial-literacy advocate in Raleigh, N.C. First, they used glass jars, then switched to a system that involved slipping money for different purposes into separate paper envelopes, for each child.But keeping up with multiple envelopes became unwieldy.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hassle,\u201d Ms. Kraftchick, an artist, said with a laugh.Now, the children \u2014 Reece, 8, and Caris, 7 \u2014 each have a card, which their parents manage using an app on their phones. They have $1 for each year of age, per week, automatically transferred each week to the cards, which the children can use to buy items like snacks at their neighborhood swimming pool. They can also get more money transferred by going above and beyond \u2014 like extra time spent practicing the piano. They can check their balances on an iPad. Ms. Kraftchick said they were even learning to round up prices to include tax.\u201cIt takes the pressure off me,\u201d said Ms. Kraftchick, who typically keeps the cards in her wallet and hands them out when it\u2019s time to make a purchase.The Kraftchicks are part of a growing group of busy parents who are trying out app-controlled debit cards to give their offspring allowance, manage chores and teach them about money. Despite talk of a cashless society, physical cash is still widely preferred for small purchases, according to the Federal Reserve. But children may lose cash, or parents may not have it on hand when it\u2019s time to pay up.\u201cWe got tired of having a drawer full of dollars,\u201d said Brandi Tzonev, a sales manager and personal trainer in Lawrenceville, Ga., who uses goHenry with her 15-year-old son, Alex, and 10-year-old daughter, Gabriella.Some banks have long had accounts aimed at children and teenagers, and many families use prepaid debit cards \u2014 rather than traditional debit cards, linked to a checking account \u2014 as a way to help children manage money. But the newest generation of \u201csmart\u201d debit cards are managed by advanced mobile apps that give parents detailed control over how much the young people spend \u2014 and even where they spend \u2014 with a few taps on a phone.Details vary slightly by card, but in general a parent establishes an account or \u201cwallet,\u201d linked to their traditional checking account. The app draws money from the bank account, and the parent transfers funds electronically to the child\u2019s card. The child can spend only what is available on the card. Parents can set spending limits and restrict where cards can be used.Parents can set up regular transfers of cash as a weekly allowance, or respond to requests for one-time cash approvals on short notice \u2014 if, say, a child is out with friends and needs more money. And children can also save money in F.D.I.C.-insured accounts, held at the traditional banks that issue the debit cards on behalf of the start-ups.The cards charge monthly or annual fees. But they generally do not charge extra fees for loading the card with cash, as some other prepaid debit cards do.The cards are reviving debates about whether it\u2019s best to teach children about money using actual cash and coins, and whether children\u2019s allowances should be tied to completion of household chores. The cards also raise concerns about the potential of plastic to encourage overspending.\u201cParting with actual physical cash is harder,\u201d said Philip Fernbach, assistant professor of marketing at the Center for Research on Consumer Financial Decision Making at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado in Boulder.Still, he said, the new digital tools offer ways to help children learn important financial concepts, like compound interest. Greenlight, for instance, allows parents to pay children a custom \u201cparent\u201d rate \u2014 say, matching each dollar saved with another dollar or two \u2014 to encourage saving, at a time when rates on traditional savings accounts are quite low.Some say that since the use of cash is waning, at least for larger purchases, children need to learn about money in that context. \u201cThat\u2019s the world they\u2019re in,\u201d said J. Michael Collins, faculty director of the Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.If parents find that the apps work well for them, then they should use them, rather than stress that they are \u201cdoing it wrong\u201d when teaching their children about money, said Beth Kobliner, author of \u201cMake Your Kid a Money Genius (Even if You\u2019re Not).\u201d But she worries that automating so much about finances means sacrificing the chance to have important conversations about spending and saving. \u201cI\u2019m a real believer in cash,\u201d she said.Michelle Ibbetson, a middle school teacher in Westminster, Calif., said she saw firsthand that children could be careless about cash. At the end of a week, her classroom is often littered with change that students have left behind.Determined to help her own children be savvy about money, she signed up more than a year ago for an early version of Greenlight. Her children \u2014 Dallin, 10, and Adelle, 12 \u2014 review their balances themselves, on cellphones that they can check out from their parents periodically. \u201cEvery Monday, they get a deposit if they did their chores the week before,\u201d she said.If their list of chores \u2014 picking up after the dog, sorting laundry or cleaning their bathroom \u2014 isn\u2019t done by Friday, she said, \u201cthey start to panic.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s nice, because I\u2019m not nagging them.\u201dWhen the children buy something, Ms. Ibbetson gets an alert about how much was spent and where. (They still use cash occasionally.)\u201cThe parent ultimately has total control,\u201d she said. Parents can divide money into a \u201cspend anywhere\u201d account, or designate funds that can be spent only at certain stores. Greenlight says it is the first to offer store-level \u201cauthorization control,\u201d which allows parents to block spending at specific merchants, and it has several patents pending for its technology.Recently, Adelle, a sixth grader, went on a field trip to Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, an amusement park. Ms. Ibbetson wanted her daughter to be able to buy lunch and snacks inside the park, but didn\u2019t want her splurging at stores outside its borders. So she set the Greenlight app to work only inside the park.Ms. Ibbetson was amused when, later that day, she was notified that the card had been declined at a fast-food location outside the park \u2014 twice.Adelle said she liked that the card helped her and her brother save for two months, to afford new pets. \u201cI just got a guinea pig!\u201d she said. She\u2019s now using the app to save toward a bigger goal: a Disney annual pass.Parents should pay particularly close attention until they are fully familiar with their smart cards, said Dee Pachlhofer, who, along with her mother, is raising two nephews, Jason Pachlhofer, 15, and Chris Wright, 10, in Springfield, Mo. Ms. Pachlhofer said she worried about Jason\u2019s having enough cash when he was on outings to places like Silver Dollar City, a local amusement park. So she signed up for the Current card.There was one initial snag, she said. At first, Jason used the card to sign up for subscription items, like audiobook apps, that offered free trials but then began charging fees. She had to help him cancel the services, and ultimately had a new card issued and started over.Current\u2019s website says there can be gaps in its spending restrictions, particularly when the card is used on sites like iTunes, Xbox and Amazon. In some cases, blocked purchases may still go through because of the payment systems those sites use.(In an email, Current said it recommended canceling recurring subscriptions directly with the merchant.)Since then, however, using the card has \u201cbeen a breeze,\u201d Ms. Pachlhofer said.Advertisement"}

That was the future Silicon Valley\u2019s greatest claim to fame in the 1920s, when it was a sleepy landscape of fruit orchards and farms far removed from the nation\u2019s industrial might. Seattle was a city of fishing and timber, where a young entrepreneur named Bill Boeing had so few customers for his airplanes that he briefly pivoted to making furniture. The most innovative companies in the world clustered in the ferociously inventive cities of the East and Midwest \u2014 cars in Detroit; cash registers in Dayton, Ohio; light bulbs in Cleveland.The high-tech geography began to flip in the 1950s, as electronics and aerospace boomed. Before the Eisenhower era was over, cities across the country and across the globe had started racing to capture some of the West Coast\u2019s high-tech magic. Silicon Valley and Seattle are now a long way from biplanes and prunes.So what can the new HQ2 city or cities learn from high-tech history?First and foremost: Yes, tech companies are a prize worth chasing. They offer jobs that are well-paying and productive, and attract a highly educated work force. Under the right conditions \u2014 the presence of strong research universities, access to capital and a quality of life that draws people in and keeps them there \u2014 a well-rooted tech community can seed several successive generations of companies, with the entrepreneurs of one era becoming mentors and investors and civic philanthropists in the next.This is what happened in Boston, in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, whose tech scene includes not only Amazon and Microsoft but also a wide variety of spinoff companies, as well as Facebook, Google, Alibaba and Baidu.San Francisco and Seattle were ill prepared for the tech wave that hit in the past decade. Current responses range from the promising but piecemeal (Amazon subsidizing additional city bus service in Seattle) to the impractical and divisive (San Francisco considering a ban on employee cafeterias in new office buildings to force tech workers to patronize local restaurants). Although tech companies and cities often find themselves fiercely opposed in these debates \u2014 most hotly in the recent attempt by Seattle to tax large employers like Amazon to pay for homeless services \u2014 there is some recognition on both sides that the current patterns are unsustainable.This means breaking out of the bubble and redefining the corporate bottom line to include measures that reduce inequality, sustain existing small businesses and protect housing affordability, and, yes, even supporting cities in raising the tax revenue they need.This isn\u2019t an impossible dream. The secret of Silicon Valley wasn\u2019t tax breaks and cheap real estate; it was a postwar era of generous public spending on research and education, as well as on affordable housing and public infrastructure. These investments were designed to help everyone, but they were critical to helping tech flourish.No place or industry rules forever. Ask Detroit, once the most innovative place in America. The new capitals of tech should not take this prosperity for granted.Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBlack Friday used to be all about midnight fights, endless lines and major markdowns on televisions. Like the rest of retailing, so much has changed.Black Friday has long been, and will most likely remain, the busiest shopping day of the year.But the features that have made it a cultural phenomenon \u2014 the discounted electronics, the predawn openings, the curbside campsites, the incivility \u2014 are changing with the broader retail landscape.Shoppers can now find bargains well before and long after Black Friday, and some deals are explicitly intended to draw spending away from the main event. The retail bonanza is increasingly met with indifference or disapproval by Americans who want to spend time with their families, sleep in and give underpaid retail employees a break. Foot traffic into stores on Black Friday is slipping while e-commerce claims a growing portion of the sales. Here is a look at Black Friday, past and present.The Retail ShakeoutThe Sears at the Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, Ohio, which in 2011 attracted shoppers eager for deals, closed last year and has yet to be replaced. In 2016, the mall installed Amazon lockers, where shoppers can pick up and return packages bought online.Product DowngradesSylvia Herfeldt started hitting Black Friday sales once she learned to drive. In 2010, she waited in line for hours with her brother Daniel to spend roughly $400 on a 42-inch Insignia flat-screen television at a Best Buy in Fort Worth.

The Herfeldts eventually sold the television and replaced it with a 50-inch LG television that they bought for $350 three years ago, also at Best Buy, also on Black Friday.Rethinking sidewalk campsitesMelee managementPassions still flare in stores, but Black Friday has become increasingly sedate as it stretches into Black November and shoppers find deals online through events like Amazon\u2019s Prime Day and Cyber Monday.

{"Headline": "After Protest, Booksellers Are Victorious Against Amazon Subsidiary", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a rare concerted uprising against any part of Amazon by any of its millions of suppliers, leading to an even rarer capitulation. Even the book dealers said they were surprised at the sudden reversal by AbeBooks, the company\u2019s secondhand and rare bookselling network.\u201cAbeBooks was saying entire countries were expendable to its plans,\u201d said Scott Brown, a Eureka, Calif., bookseller who was an organizer of the strike. \u201cBooksellers everywhere felt they might be next.\u201dThe matter was apparently resolved when Sally Burdon, an Australian bookseller who is president of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers, spoke with Arkady Vitrouk, chief executive of AbeBooks.

He provided a cryptic statement saying, \u201cWe are putting together a solution.\u201dThe spark for the strike, designated Banned Booksellers Week, was less what AbeBooks did than how it did it. It provided explanations slowly and reluctantly, irritating booksellers who felt they were all being treated in cavalier fashion. Antiquarian bookselling is a close-knit community, with the official motto of the international association being Amor librorum nos unit \u2014 love of books unites us all.\u201cI would not have thought that we\u2019ll succeed, but you showed the real meaning of our motto,\u201d Adam Bosze, the president of the Antiquarian Booksellers\u2019 Association of Hungary, wrote in a message to his foreign colleagues on Wednesday.Vic Zoschak, president of the Antiquarian Booksellers\u2019 Association of America, was optimistic on the sudden resolution. \u201cI choose to believe yesterday\u2019s dialogue between the two camps will be but a start to improved communications and relations, each dedicated to a continued win-win association,\u201d he said.Experts in selling on Amazon said that such parity was difficult to achieve.\u201cI don\u2019t think anything like this has ever happened before with any part of Amazon,\u201d said Juozas Kaziukenas, chief executive of Marketplace Pulse, an e-commerce analytics firm. \u201cIt would be much harder to have a strike on Amazon itself, just because there are so many sellers there and they are not part of an organized community.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhoever owns the platform owns the power. As a seller you are a small module in a massively complicated system. If a thousand of you say you will not do something anymore, 2,000 others will replace you.

{"Headline": "Writing Postcards Brings Voters Back From the Edge: \u2018It\u2019s Sharpie Therapy\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARIETTA, Ga. \u2014 In the big data era of politics, where campaigns are betting millions on software that can harvest hundreds of pieces of information about a single voter, Tony McMullin is making a decidedly different wager.He is trying to show that elections can be won through the persuasive power of a plaintive handwritten postcard.It is a battle of quaint vs. quant.An army of almost 40,000 volunteers, seeking catharsis in the Trump era, have answered Mr. McMullin\u2019s call to do more than wring hands, and instead, start writing, producing more than 1.5 million postcards since September to try to swing close races in the midterm election. This week, the group aims to send postcards to every registered Democrat in North Dakota to try to win the re-election of Senator Heidi Heitkamp.\u201cWe called it Sharpie therapy,\u201d said Ellen Bender, who has convened multiple postcard-writing sessions at a Le Pain Quotidien on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. \u201cInstead of throwing the remote at the TV, we would write postcards.\u201dUndeterred, Mr. McMullin, 52, quit his job at SunTrust Bank to oversee the postcard group full time. The midterms have created such demand that he needs dozens of volunteers to keep up with administrative tasks alone.Still, there is clearly an allure to the volunteers. Postcard writing is more personal than phone banking, more tactile, and in many cases, more social.\u201cI think that as you are writing, there\u2019s something going on that\u2019s a connection between your hand and your head, your brain,\u201d Mr. McMullin said. \u201cYou are envisioning that voter going to the mailbox and getting your postcard. Each time you are writing one, you picture a positive outcome.\u201dIn Zanesville, Ohio, last August, supporters of Mr. O\u2019Connor brought their postcards to a fund-raiser to show to friends. With so much campaign information flooding their televisions and mailboxes, they were confident a handwritten gesture would make a deeper connection.\u201cIn the postcard, you know you are creating something that stands a good chance of being held, or being put on a bulletin board or a fridge,\u201d Mr. McMullin said.The midterm elections next week are the latest test. Along with Ms. Heitkamp, his group is writing cards to support Phil Bredesen, the Democratic Senate candidate in Tennessee, governor candidates Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida, and Democratic candidates in more than a dozen competitive House races. They also are writing for the Senate campaign of Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas, a Democrat so popular nationally that as soon as Mr. McMullin announced the effort, postcard writers on the first day requested more than 33,000 addresses to target.From his home in this rambling Atlanta suburb, Mr. McMullin sat at his command center this week \u2014 his dining room table \u2014 along with two volunteers, to monitor incoming emails requesting more voter addresses. He provides a script for the writers, then users sometimes add their own flourish, with words or artistic renderings.Mr. McMullin has also put his own digital experience to use with an automated computer program \u2014 or \u201cbot\u201d \u2014 named Abby that issues the addresses. Analytics software tracks the progress of postcard writing in real time.The rules are simple. Volunteers have to prepare and submit a picture of a sample postcard so their handwriting can be approved. Those who try to use computers to write the cards are rejected.Initially, Mr. McMullin said he thought the effort would attract introverts who would take on a solitary task. Instead, postcard parties are taking place from New York to California.He used to scour the internet for elections where he thought the postcards would be helpful. Now, campaigns are asking for him.\u201cI would not be doing this, taking my own time, if I didn\u2019t think there was a real benefit,\u201d said Mr. McMullin, who was weaned on grass-roots politics during Howard Dean\u2019s presidential campaign in 2004.He said that lawyers have assured him the postcard effort does not run afoul of campaign finance regulations. The cards are mailed to \u201cValued Voter\u201d or some variation of that, and not to an individual. But the people who write the card usually sign their names. The focus is on infrequent or newly registered voters.He said he does not make money on the venture, though the group does sell postcards on Amazon. The senders pay for their own postage.\u201cWe will definitely write every Democratic voter in Mississippi at least once,\u201d Mr. McMullin said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s always an election going on somewhere in the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turbulent Stock Market Is Flashing a Warning About the Economy", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment is near lows not seen in half a century. The American economy is set for its best year since 2005. Large corporations are producing giant profits. Even wages are starting to rise.And the stock markets are a mess.On Tuesday, the S&P 500-stock index turned negative for the year, stoking fears that one of the longest bull markets in history could be at risk.The stock market\u2019s struggles may seem incongruous against the backdrop of strong economic growth. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data.In recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that President Trump\u2019s global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits. Commodities and the companies that depend on them have been pummeled by the prospect of weaker demand should the global economy slow. Five tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix \u2014 have shed more than $800 billion in market value since the end of August, the fallout from slowing growth and regulatory scrutiny.The S&P 500 closed on Tuesday at 2,641.89, down 1.8 percent. Other markets also flashed warnings, with oil dropping by 6.8 percent, falling deeper into bear territory.The pressure eased on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 rising about half a percent in early trading after Asian markets ended the day largely positive and shares in Britain, France and Germany began the day higher.The sell-off doesn\u2019t mean the United States is headed into a recession. The stock market suffered several sharp stumbles in recent years before climbing to new highs on the back of booming corporate profits and strong economic growth.But the recent market drop could portend problems. In 2018, a hefty dose of fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax cuts, allowed the United States to shake off the growth worries in China, Europe and the rest of the world. It won\u2019t have the same potency next year, leaving the American economy and stocks more vulnerable to a range of risks, including a slowing global economy and continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\u201cI think there are very clear signs that investors are beginning to worry about weaker growth in the coming year or so, and how that\u2019s going to feed through to corporate earnings,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.Mr. Trump, on Tuesday, pointed to the health of the economy and instead blamed the Fed for contributing to the sell-off. Mr. Trump, who has taken credit for the rising stock market, has been critical of the rate increases, saying they undermine growth.\u201cI would like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the rate is too high.\u201dUntil recently, investors were willing to ignore the domestic political dramas, geopolitical turmoil and other issues clouding the outlook for American companies. Now they appear jittery, selling stocks at small signs that vague risks may become realities.So far this year, strong growth and deep corporate tax cuts have supercharged corporate profits. Once all the results are tallied up, the third-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up more than 28 percent from a year earlier \u2014 outpacing previous quarters, according to the financial data company Refinitiv.But those numbers haven\u2019t satisfied the markets. Investors have instead grown concerned about risks they face both from continued economic strength and, alternatively, an economic slowdown. Either path could upend a nearly decade-long rally that has lifted the S&P 500 nearly 300 percent.Strong economic growth at home would most likely mean a prolonged rise in interest rates and rising costs in areas like wages, which would hurt corporate profitability. Weaker growth abroad would cut into sales.In recent days, both forms of fear have fed the market decline.On Tuesday, shares of the retailer Target dropped by more than 10 percent, on worries that rising costs \u2014 from increased wages to higher prices for the Chinese goods facing tariffs \u2014 could continue to crimp profits. Investors also dumped shares of Kohl\u2019s and TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, which both saw freight costs eat into earnings.Apple continued its slide on worries about softening demand. The tech giant tumbled 4.8 percent after Goldman Sachs equity analysts cut their price target, citing deteriorating demand, especially in China.China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil, has also been weighing on commodities. The price of crude, now just above $53 a barrel, has fallen nearly 30 percent since early October. On Tuesday, energy was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500, with companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and the oil-field services provider Schlumberger losing more than 2.5 percent.Oil prices have been sliding despite signs that major producers like Saudi Arabia are considering cutting production. And that has amplified worries that China and the rest of the global economy may be in a weaker spot than markets realized.Last quarter, China\u2019s growth slowed to its lowest level since 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis. Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, is also looking shaky, with the economy contracting in the third quarter, amid a slowdown in trade and investment.Germany, the powerhouse behind Europe, also shrank unexpectedly during the third quarter as trade slumped and car production faltered. If Germany stumbles, it will add to the economic and political turmoil in a region already dealing with Britain\u2019s chaotic exit from the European Union and Italy\u2019s budget dispute with the bloc.In 2018, America\u2019s economy proved largely immune to such issues. But the global slowdown could eventually spill over into the United States, particularly as the impact of this year\u2019s tax cuts fades in the coming years. Economists expect that domestic growth, which is close to 3 percent this year, will slow to 2 percent by 2020, according to estimates published by FactSet.For the economy, that is a respectable performance. But for investors, a slowdown is likely to be uncomfortable.Disappointing data and earnings updates could ignite periodic panics over the threat of recession, even if remote. Markets are likely to be much choppier that than they\u2019ve been in recent years. Gains could be lower.In other words, the market may be messy for a while.\u201cI think this is what a low-return environment starts to feel like,\u201d said Joe Davis, chief economist with Vanguard. \u201cThe past five years, although entirely welcome from an investment standpoint, is clearly unsustainable.\u201dClifford Krauss and Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Novelists Turned to TV: Everyone Was Suddenly Using \u2018Reveal\u2019 as a Noun", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPage to ScreenThe borders between television and prose fiction grow ever porous. At the University of Iowa\u2019s Writers\u2019 Workshop \u2014 a bastion of literary purity for aspiring novelists and poets, which, not coincidentally, has been featured on the TV show \u201cGirls\u201d \u2014 evidence of this porousness is sometimes subtle: \u201cIt happened a few years ago,\u201d said the workshop\u2019s director, Lan Samantha Chang. \u201cEveryone was suddenly using the word \u2018reveal\u2019 as a noun.\u201dBut such understated evidence of permeability between idioms has had a chance to swell in size on the university\u2019s campus this fall, when veteran TV writers Mitchell Burgess and Robin Green (\u201cNorthern Exposure,\u201d \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cBlue Bloods\u201d) launched a class called Writing for Television. \u201cMany of the applicants for the class that Mitch and Robin were most interested in are students coming out of fiction,\u201d said Alan MacVey, chairman of the university\u2019s theater arts department. \u201cThey thought that these students\u2019 particular skill set and artistic temperament was appropriate for the kind of writing being done on TV today.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re also mentoring two students. They pitch us ideas for TV shows,\u201d Green said.In a world in which some of our more successful or esteemed novelists \u2014 Margaret Atwood, Gillian Flynn, George R.R. Martin, Salman Rushdie, Kevin Kwan, Neil Gaiman, Tom Perrotta, Noah Hawley, A.M. Homes, Jonathan Ames, Megan Abbott and David Benioff, to name only a few \u2014 have written or are writing for the small screen, literary academia has less reason than ever to be sheepish about preparing its charges for the solaces of a healthy paycheck. Green, a Writer\u2019s Workshop graduate herself, said, \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t take away from writers practicing their art. There\u2019s quality work on TV now. It\u2019s not as shameful to write for it as it once was.\u201d The Writers\u2019 Workshop\u2019s Chang said, \u201cSeriously, I don\u2019t hear any grumbling and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to dilute our brand.\u201dIf, as William Faulkner once put it, \u201cHollywood is the place on earth where you can get stabbed in the back while you\u2019re climbing a ladder,\u201d what or who has made television palatable to Mr. Faulkner\u2019s spiritual offspring? Many would point to David Simon, the creator, show runner and head writer of \u201cThe Wire,\u201d a show that helped put longform, multistoried episodic television on the map.Simon was a former crime reporter for The Baltimore Sun who had written two doorstops of narrative nonfiction (\u201cHomicide\u201d and, with writer Edward Burns, \u201cThe Corner\u201d), both of which he turned into television series. In 2001, while Simon was in the throes of \u201cThe Wire\u201d\u2019s creation, his then-girlfriend, the crime novelist Laura Lippman, told Simon about her friend, novelist George Pelecanos. Simon recently recounted, \u201cShe said, \u2018This guy is writing in the same tonality and vernacular as you.\u2019\u201d Simon read some of Pelecanos\u2019s work and then hired him to write for \u201cThe Wire,\u201d telling him, in Pelecanos\u2019s words, that the show would be \u201ca novel for television\u201d and that \u201ceach episode would be like a chapter in a book.\u201dOnce on \u201cThe Wire\u201d\u2019s writing staff, Pelecanos introduced Simon to novelist Richard Price, who also came on board the show. Simon said, \u201cAfter that, I said, \u2018Who\u2019s next?\u2019 We decided Dennis Lehane.\u201dSimon maintains that novelists are particularly well-suited for longform television, where stories unspool over several episodes or a whole season: \u201cThey can see the whole.\u201d Currently, his writers on HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d which he created with Pelecanos, include Price as well as the crime novelists Megan Abbott and Lisa Lutz. The experience has \u201crequired us all to leave some authority and ego at the door and engage in a collective act of storytelling,\u201d Simon said. \u201cNothing defines selflessness more than telling Richard Price that a great scene he wrote for episode two is going in Megan\u2019s later script because it works better there. Or vice versa.\u201dIndeed, for many novelists who make the transition to TV writing, collaboration \u2014 and the threat it poses to a fiction writer\u2019s default setting of solitary, gauzy daydreaming \u2014 is chief among the challenges. \u201cHaving to sit at a conference table looking at other humans for many hours a day takes a kind of mental energy,\u201d said Charles Yu, the author of \u201cHow to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe\u201d and a five under 35 honoree by The National Book Foundation who has gone on to write for \u201cWestworld,\u201d \u201cHere and Now\u201d and \u201cLegion.\u201d \u201cIt also took me awhile to realize when my story pitches had been rejected by show runners in story meetings, because the pitches were turned down so nicely. I\u2019ll still be noodling on about some idea I think is fascinating, and the rest of the room is two or three pitches further on.\u201dAnother entity that novelists struggle with when writing for TV is economy. \u201cWith novels, I could write 15 pages on a piece of furniture if I wanted,\u201d said \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d author Kevin Kwan, who is working on an original series for Amazon. \u201cBut in TV, one page is one minute. You\u2019ve got sixty pages to tell a story and make people want to download the next episode.\u201d Novelist Ali Liebegott, who wrote for \u201cTransparent\u201d and now is a writer and co-executive producer of the \u201cRoseanne\u201d spinoff, \u201cThe Conners,\u201d said, \u201cThere\u2019s so much room in fiction just to be in a mood. But TV is all about the action. It\u2019s economical, whereas I\u2019m much more tangential by nature. I mean, all my favorite movies are about two alcoholics sitting across a table from one another.\u201dDo novelists worry that their participation in the time-consuming but highly lucrative world of television might cause them to squander their fiction careers, gradually transforming them from ink-stained wretches to Malibu caftan-wearers? \u201cThat is a favorite topic in my therapist\u2019s office,\u201d said Attica Locke, who has written for \u201cEmpire\u201d and Ava DuVernay\u2019s upcoming series \u201cCentral Park Five.\u201d \u201cBut I can\u2019t eat off books. I can\u2019t send my kid to private school off books.\u201dLocke offers a sterling example of how writing for TV can actually aid a writer\u2019s prose. \u201cI wrote my last book, \u2018Bluebird, Bluebird,\u2019 in between seasons of \u2018Empire,\u2019 and then during the third season. When I finally showed it to my agent, he couldn\u2019t believe how short it was! He said, \u2018The best thing you got out of \u2018Empire\u2019 is brevity!\u2019 All my other books were over 400 pages.\u201d\u201cBluebird, Bluebird\u201d went on to make 18 \u201cbest of the year\u201d lists, be a finalist for The Los Angeles Times Book Prize and win the 2018 Edgar Award for Best Novel. The book is \u2014 here\u2019s the reveal, folks \u2014 being developed as a TV series.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everything Is for Sale Now. Even Us. ", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "OpinionThe constant pressure to sell ourselves on every possible platform has produced its own brand of modern anxiety.Supported byMs. Whippman is the author of \u201cAmerica the Anxious: Why Our Search for Happiness Is Driving Us Crazy and How to Find It for Real.\u201dThere is something about the consumer madness of the holiday season that makes me think of my friend Rebecca\u2019s mother. When I was in middle school, she had a side hustle selling acrylic-rhinestone bug brooches. The jewelry was hard to move on its merits \u2014 even for the 1980s it was staggeringly ugly. But what she lacked in salable product, she made up for in sheer selling stamina. Every sleepover, school fair or birthday party, out would come the tray of bejeweled grasshoppers and stag beetles, glinting with Reagan-era menace. Presumably someone was making money from this venture \u2014 some proto-Trump barking orders from his tax haven \u2014 but it certainly didn\u2019t seem to be Rebecca\u2019s mother, whose sales pitches took on an ever more shrill note of desperation.Soon she had given up even the basic social pretense that we might actually want the brooches. The laws of supply and demand morphed seamlessly into the laws of guilt and obligation, and then into the laws of outright malice, mirroring the trajectory of capitalism itself.At that time, when naked hawking to your friends was still considered an etiquette blunder, the sales pitches by Rebecca\u2019s mother felt embarrassing \u2014 as gaudy and threatening to the social ecosystem as a purple rhinestone daddy longlegs. But 30 years later, at the height of the gig economy, when the foundation of working life has apparently become selling your friends things they don\u2019t want, I look back to that raw need in Rebecca\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes with something terrifyingly approaching recognition.The trick of doing this well, of course, is to act as if you aren\u2019t doing it at all \u2014 as if this is simply how you like to unwind in the evening, by sharing your views on pasta sauce with your 567,000 followers. Seeing the slick charm of successful online \u201cinfluencers\u201d spurs me to download e-courses on how to \u201ccrack Instagram\u201d or \u201cdevelop my personal brand story.\u201d But as soon as I hand over my credit card details, I am flooded with vague self-disgust. I instantly abandon the courses and revert to my usual business model \u2014 badgering and guilting my friends across a range of online platforms, employing the personal brand story of \u201cpleeeeeeeeeeaassssee.\u201dAs my friend Helena (Buy her young adult novel! Available on Amazon!) puts it, buying, promoting or sharing your friend\u2019s \u201cthing\u201d is now a tax payable for modern friendship. But this expectation becomes its own monster. I find myself auditing my friends\u2019 loyalty based on their efforts. Who bought it? Who shared it on Facebook? Was it a share from the heart, or a \u201cduty share\u201d \u2014 with that telltale, torturous phrasing that squeaks past the minimum social requirement but deftly dissociates the sharer from the product: \u201cMy friend wrote a book \u2014 I haven\u2019t read it, but maybe you should.\u201dIn this cutthroat human marketplace, we are worth only as much as the sum of our metrics, so checking those metrics can become obsessive. What\u2019s my Amazon ranking? How many likes? How many retweets? How many followers? (The word \u201cfollowers\u201d is in itself a clear indicator of something psychologically unhealthy going on \u2014 the standard term for the people we now spend the bulk of our time with sounds less like a functioning human relationship than the P.R. materials of the Branch Davidians.)But what\u2019s more peculiar is just how imperfectly all this correlates with financial need or even greed. The sad truth is that many of us would probably make more money stacking shelves or working at the drive-through than selling our \u201cthing.\u201d The real prize is deeper, more existential. What this is really about, for many of us, is a roaring black hole of psychological need.After a couple of decades of constant advice to \u201cfollow our passions\u201d and \u201clive our dreams,\u201d for a certain type of relatively privileged modern freelancer, nothing less than total self-actualization at work now seems enough. But this leaves us with an angsty mismatch between personal expectation and economic reality.

{"Headline": "As Brazil\u2019s Far Right Leader Threatens the Amazon, One Tribe Pushes Back", "Date": "2018-11-10", "News": "\u201cWhere there is indigenous land,\u201d newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro has said, \u201cthere is wealth underneath it.\u201dSupported byThe Times traveled hundreds of miles into the Brazilian Amazon, staying with a tribe in the Munduruku Indigenous Territory as it struggled with the shrinking rain forest.The miners had to go.Their bulldozers, dredges and high-pressure hoses tore into miles of land along the river, polluting the water, poisoning the fish and threatening the way life had been lived in this stretch of the Amazon for thousands of years.So one morning in March, leaders of the Munduruku tribe readied their bows and arrows, stashed a bit of food into plastic bags and crammed inside four boats to drive the miners away.\u201cIt has been decided,\u201d said Maria Leusa Kab\u00e1, one of the women in the tribe who helped lead the revolt.The confrontation had begun.The showdown was a small part of an existential struggle indigenous communities are waging across Brazil. But the battle goes far beyond their individual survival, striking at the fate of the Amazon and its pivotal role in climate change.In recent years, the Brazilian government has sharply cut spending on indigenous communities, while lawmakers have pushed for regulatory changes championed by industries seeking unfettered access to parts of the Amazon that have been protected under the nation\u2019s constitution.Long before Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory, descendants of the original inhabitants of the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest tropical rain forest, had become increasingly vulnerable to bands of miners, loggers and farmers who have been clearing it at a rate environmentalists call unsustainable.Thousands of square miles of forest have already been razed in indigenous territories, where large-scale industrial activity is prohibited. With Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory, indigenous leaders are sounding more drastic warnings.\u201cHe represents an institutionalization of genocide in Brazil,\u201d said Dinam\u00e3 Tux\u00e1, the coordinator of Brazil\u2019s Association of Indigenous Peoples. A spokesman for Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s transition team said no one would comment on indigenous concerns, or respond to criticism of his views, because officials were focused on \u201cfar more important issues.\u201dExperts say the rate of deforestation in the Amazon, which soaks up enormous amounts of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide, makes it nearly certain that Brazil will miss some of the climate change mitigation goals it set in 2009, when it presented itself as an exemplar of sustainable development at a United Nations summit.The trendline has led federal prosecutors and environmentalists to say that the Amazon is on the brink of irreversible damage, potentially leading to the extinction of indigenous communities that have weathered centuries of calamities.Many indigenous leaders see the threats against their communities as a modern-day David-versus-Goliath struggle, with tribes facing violent bands of men who take advantage of the Amazon\u2019s lawlessness to turn a profit.Officially, the fight over the Amazon\u2019s future is playing out far away in the legislative chambers of the nation\u2019s capital. After Brazil\u2019s economy plunged into recession in 2014, politicians and industry leaders who favor loosening environmental protections gained the upper hand in a long-running contest over the rain forest.They have had some success in weakening protections enshrined in Brazil\u2019s 1988 Constitution. But in many instances, the legal battle lags far behind reality. As miners, loggers and farmers charge into the Amazon, legally or not, the landscape is being radically reshaped.\u201cThey haven\u2019t given up on changing the law, but they are prioritizing a strategy of creating facts on the ground,\u201d said Cleber Buzzatto, the executive secretary of the Indigenous Missionary Council, an indigenous rights group. \u201cBy creating an irreversible reality, they will then seek to change legislation.\u201dFrom the air, those facts on the ground look like bright orange gashes carved in the banks of lazy, zigzagging rivers that meander through the jungle.Few are as striking as the gold mine built around Posto de Vigil\u00e2ncia, or Lookout Point, one of the most remote Munduruku villages.Osvaldo Waru Munduruku, the rail-thin village chief, looked ashen as he explained how his tiny hamlet, home to about 15 families, became a hub of the illegal mining trade that has transformed the region in recent years.The National Indian Foundation, a federal agency that helps indigenous people, had its aid budget slashed in recent years, making it hard for remote villages to get food or basic services. Beyond that, many indigenous leaders like Mr. Waru long for much better living standards, education and opportunities than an isolated, arduous forest existence allows.So when the first \u201cwhite miners,\u201d as he calls them, dropped by in 2015 to suggest a partnership, Mr. Waru was tempted.He and other indigenous leaders knew there was little they could do to stop the miners. The brutal recession had driven large numbers of unemployed Brazilians into the jungle, hunting for gold. If a gold rush was about to break out in his part of Par\u00e1 state, he reasoned, the village might as well take a cut.This kind of co-optation has become common in remote areas of the jungle \u2014 and precisely what many indigenous leaders want to stop.\u201cDivide and conquer,\u201d said Fernanda Kaing\u00e1ng, an indigenous rights lawyer who belongs to the Kaingang tribe. \u201cThat is the strategy used to promote division with indigenous communities in order to secure access to wood, minerals and land.\u201dThe miners in Mr. Waru\u2019s village cleared a long strip for a runway and built a parallel settlement, with sleeping quarters and a small church. The miners rewarded him with 10 percent of the haul each month \u2014 worth a few hundred dollars, he said.\u201cWe would save it and save it until there was enough to buy things for the community,\u201d Mr. Waru said. It paid for a new boat motor, a generator and a radio.But then the bouts of diarrhea among children began. Erosion from the mines turned the river a sandy brown. Fish that had long been a staple of the community\u2019s diet now had high levels of mercury, which is used to extract gold.\u201cBefore, we had a lot of food here, but since the water became dirty, the fish vanished,\u201d he said. \u201cWe became concerned about the future of our children.\u201dMore than 896,000 indigenous people live in Brazil \u2014 less than 0.5 percent of the population. They belong to 300 tribes and speak more than 270 languages.Their ranks are small compared with the millions of indigenous people in countries like Bolivia and Peru. Yet half a century ago, they were nearly extinct.In 1500, when the first Portuguese settlers arrived, three to five million people lived in what would later become Brazil.Smallpox and other diseases brought by the Europeans wiped out hundreds of thousands. Enslavement followed, first in sugar plantations and later when the rubber boom drew profitseekers to the Amazon starting in the 1870s.By the 1960s, when Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship began, the indigenous population had fallen below 100,000. The generals regarded indigenous communities in the Amazon as impediments to development and drew them out of remote villages to assimilate them.That policy was formally abandoned in 1988, when Brazil\u2019s current Constitution was drafted. It sought to atone for past abuses, setting in motion a process to mark and protect indigenous territories. There are now more than 600 of them, encompassing more than 13 percent of the country \u2014 a fact that has long rankled Brazilian loggers, miners and farmers.But as the recession hit Brazil\u2019s impoverished northeast and Amazon states particularly hard, outsiders with families to feed ventured into Munduruku land. They revived gold mines that the government had shut down in the 1990s.When the miners showed up in indigenous villages along the Tapaj\u00f3s in 2015, they found communities in worse shape than their own.In one, Caro\u00e7al Rio das Tropas, families live in dilapidated wooden huts and sleep in hammocks. Skinny dogs with festering wounds sniff the ground for scraps of food. Poisonous snake bites are treated by using the body of the serpent as a makeshift tourniquet while the patient makes the six-hour boat ride to the nearest town.Some families fare better than others, with television sets, cellphones and appliances powered by rumbling old generators. That, said Ezildo Koro Munduruku, is the result of gold proceeds that have transformed the area \u2014 and the tribe.\u201cOur grandparents\u2019 generation, they had a strong organization,\u201d said Mr. Ezildo, 41. \u201cThey were all united. They had little contact with white people.\u201dAs mining camps multiplied, bringing processed foods, alcohol, drugs and prostitution to the area, several Munduruku men jumped at the chance to make money. Their diets changed and vices took hold. Many Munduruku worried that their way of life was being irreparably altered.\u201cWithin our families, this began pitting brother against brother,\u201d Mr. Ezildo said.Some indigenous leaders initially argued that mining could be a boon, without causing too much environmental damage. But the gold brought only modest and fleeting benefits, he said.\u201cWe are sick, physically and spiritually,\u201d Mr. Ezildo said. \u201cIf one earns 100 grams of gold, they will spend it on alcohol and prostitutes.\u201dAfter three days of tense debate, the women of the tribe gave the final word. Some pointed fingers defiantly at men in the room, while others cried as they took turns speaking into a scratchy microphone.When it was done, Ms. Kab\u00e1, the mother who helped lead the uprising, hung up a sign with bullet points to summarize the plan.\u201cParalyze illegal mining activity in the indigenous area; clean up the territory and expel all the invaders from Munduruku territory,\u201d it said.The miners knew a revolt was coming and had tried to head it off. They flew to the village by plane, bearing massive bags of rice, beans and pasta, along with packs of grape- and orange-flavored soda \u2014 a peace offering.Cleber da Silva Costa, the miner who brought the bounty, said he knew what he and his fellow miners were doing was illegal and harmful to the environment. Yet he argued that his crime was merely a symptom of more egregious wrong.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t have so many corrupt people in Congress, you might be able to consider preserving the environment,\u201d he said.Mr. da Silva, 47, a miner with three children, said the camp was doing more to preserve than destroy indigenous communities.\u201cThe little they have today is from miners,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t help. All the money gets stolen. We may be in the wrong. But out here, it\u2019s the law of survival.\u201dWeapons in hand, about 30 members of the tribe set out to evict the miners.But after trudging for more than six hours through rivers, mud and steep hills, they reached the first gold mining camp exhausted, hungry and thirsty.Amarildo Dias Nascimento, the camp supervisor, sensed that a confrontation was imminent. So, in a disarming gesture, he welcomed the Munduruku delegation effusively, instructing his cooks to put on a feast of grilled chicken, beans and rice for the guests.\u201cTonight, we\u2019ll just focus on joy,\u201d he said.Mr. Nascimento, 47, argued that the miners were merely trying to survive.\u201cMany have been left without options,\u201d he said, pointing at his men. \u201cDo you become a thief in Rio de Janeiro? Many are here because they don\u2019t want to resort to that. We\u2019re here fighting for our daily bread.\u201dThe next morning, Ms. Kab\u00e1 breast-fed her baby as she summoned the miners for the showdown.\u201cThis is our land,\u201d she said. \u201cThis territory is not yours. This is where we get sustenance for our children. We don\u2019t depend on gold, but rather the fruits and animals you are driving away.\u201dMr. Nascimento listened politely, his head bowed.\u201cThe moment you ask us to leave, we will do it immediately,\u201d he said.After the meeting broke up, several members of the Munduruku crammed into a bulldozer driven by one of the miners to avoid crossing a long, muddy patch of the trail on foot. But as they left, it was still unsettled when, or even if, the miners would leave.The Munduruku headed to the next mining camp, determined to deliver the same message. But the camp was larger, and they faced a far less welcoming group of miners. Several were drunk.\u201cWe had to turn back because they were armed,\u201d Ms. Kab\u00e1 said.Weeks later, dozens of heavily armed federal police officers and agents from Brazil\u2019s two environmental agencies descended on a mining camp in Munduruku land, sweeping in aboard four helicopters.While Brazilian lawmakers press to expand mining, logging and farming in the Amazon, some prosecutors and officials remain steadfastly against it, using their authority to enforce environmental laws for as long as they exist.But the raids do little. As usual, miners scattered into the forest as the aircraft approached, preventing investigators from making arrests or even asking many questions. Agents set fire to several machines and camp dwellings before taking off.\u201cIt was like something out of a war zone,\u201d said Valmir, a miner who used his first name because he feared prosecution. \u201cNone of us here are bandits. If the government offers some sort of employment for us outside of mining, no one would return to mining.\u201dDays later, federal prosecutors searched gold dealers in the nearest major urban areas \u2014 the second phase of the investigation. This one was called Midas Dilemma, a play on the tale of King Midas and his dangerous ability to turn everything he touched into gold.\u201cWe see a parallel with the exploitation of national riches,\u201d said Gecivaldo Vasconcelos Ferreira, a federal police officer who helped lead the investigation. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t exploited in a responsible way, they end up becoming a curse.\u201dLuis Cam\u00f5es Boaventura, a prosecutor on the case, says the authorities have only scratched the surface of an enormous industry backed by local and national politicians.There are hundreds, if not thousands, of gold mines along the Tapaj\u00f3s, and supply chains are deliberately opaque, making it hard to go after illegal mining bosses, he said.\u201cIt is a very serious problem,\u201d he said.In May, prosecutors issued a call to action, warning that the gold trade \u201ccould potentially lead to the extinction of indigenous communities and traditional cultures.\u201dFederal prosecutors have characterized the plight of some indigenous communities as \u201cgenocide.\u201dBut that stance is not widely shared by local, state or federal politicians. In Congress, a large coalition known as the ruralist bloc has championed scores of measures to ease access to minerals and potential farmland in protected areas.Mr. Bolsonaro, a veteran Congressman who easily won the presidential election last month, has long expressed the sentiment.\u201cIf it were up to me, we would not have any more indigenous areas in the country,\u201d he said after winning.Doing away with them would require changing the constitution. But Mr. Bolsonaro has threatened to take smaller steps on his own, like halting fines against companies and individuals who break the law.While campaigning for president, he called the system of protected lands obsolete, echoing the policy during the military dictatorship that such areas shackle economic growth and the individual prospects of indigenous people. The time had come, he said, to \u201creintegrate them into society\u201d and recognize that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to live in zoos.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro argues that Brazil can no longer tolerate having so much land set aside as indigenous territories, national parks and conservation zones.\u201cAll those reserves stymie our development,\u201d he said.Munduruku leaders opposed to mining were elated about the raids by federal agents. But soon, leaders like Ms. Kab\u00e1 received threats.\u201cThe expectation of the indigenous leaders when they denounced what was happening was that the state would go in and expel the white people,\u201d said Danicley de Aguiar, a Greenpeace activist who has counseled Munduruku leaders. That did not happen.And while protecting the environment and indigenous traditions is laudable, it\u2019s not realistic, argued Adonias Kab\u00e1 Munduruku, one of the tribe\u2019s leaders who does business with miners.\u201cIt\u2019s the only way for us, as indigenous miners, to send out children to study in the cities, to have them go to university,\u201d said Mr. Kab\u00e1, 40. \u201cParents want their children to learn, to be prepared, so they don\u2019t end up like their parents: working here in the mines.\u201dProsecutors have yet to charge anyone from the raids, and gold mining continues to flourish in the area.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that crime is paying off,\u201d said Paulo de Tarso Moreira Oliveira, a federal prosecutor.Lis Moriconi and Manuela Andreoni contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Tried Facebook\u2019s New Portal Device (So You Don\u2019t Have To)", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what happened when two Times tech reporters installed Facebook\u2019s new Portal video-calling gadgets in their bedrooms.So we \u2014 Mike Isaac and Farhad Manjoo, two technology writers for The New York Times \u2014 took the $199 and $349 devices for a test run over the last week to see if they could make us feel more connected to each other. We both installed the Portal, which starts shipping on Thursday, in our homes (our bedrooms, to be exact). The devices are video-calling machines that people can use to talk through a screen to other Facebook users. They have a 12-megapixel camera with high-definition video and artificial intelligence software; the camera follows people about as they move around. Were we worried about what these always-on devices might collect on us? Here\u2019s how it played out.So I have to say, waking up next to you in my bedroom was, uh, quite an experience. I put my Portal Plus on the desk that sits bedside. The screen saver cycled through my photo albums on Facebook and Instagram \u2014 and also occasionally your face.What was your experience like initially? The unboxing process was funny to me. It felt like an Apple design moment; every piece of plastic and \u201cpull here\u201d tab was carefully placed, with the intentionality that Apple usually saves for its device packaging, but with a very Facebook-y twist on things. There was an iconic Facebook thumb on my power cord holder, for example.Setting up my Portal Plus was easy. Popped the thing out of the box, plopped it on my desk, plugged it in, connected to Wi-Fi and my Facebook account. From there, I think, I called you almost immediately.The great thing about these devices is that they are stationary and always on. When you want to call someone, you just tell it to call the person \u2014 no looking for your phone, no holding the phone while you chat. It all just works with a single utterance. (Everything old is new: These devices are like landlines!)The problem with Amazon\u2019s Echo Show is its fixed viewing angle \u2014 if you don\u2019t have it pointed exactly at you, it\u2019s hard to have a conversation. My kids, who use the Show to call my parents, are always fighting with each other about who gets to stand right in front of the screen.The Portal solves that problem in a neat way: It uses software to follow you around a room, always keeping the speaker in frame and cropped. I found this very useful.I will also admit I loved the augmented reality lenses, a flourish Facebook is adding to pretty much all of its camera-based apps. Just like Snapchat, I can choose a filter that turns my face into a werewolf, or stick a (live) cat on my head as a hat. Cat-as-a-Hat: a goofy gimmick worthy of Dr. Seuss \u2014 but it works!Facebook also went out of its way to let us know that all video chats are encrypted, and the company does not store the contents of the calls, nor does it listen in on them. But even that wasn\u2019t enough for me! Whenever I wasn\u2019t using the Portal, I unplugged it. I turned the camera around to face the window looking over the back yard. I would periodically check to make sure all lights or microphones were off when I took a phone call or text.I don\u2019t think he believes that anymore, and Facebook has been working to improve how users can manage their private data on the platform. Still, if you\u2019re going to choose between a calling device made by Facebook and one made by Amazon or Apple, you wouldn\u2019t be crazy to discount Facebook\u2019s device because of its business model and history.All that said, a lot of people are just fine with the level of insight Facebook has into their lives. If you already chat and call on Facebook Messenger on your phone, then chatting and calling from Portal isn\u2019t putting you in any greater danger.Portal is better than the Show at making calls, and for a first piece of hardware, it\u2019s quite impressive. But it\u2019s still a device of fairly limited functionality \u2014 a well-designed luxury at this point.I guess we\u2019ll always have our Slack chats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Business With No End", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "Where does this strange empire start or stop?Part I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InPart I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InWhere does this strange empire start or stop? Recently, one of my students at Stanford told me a strange story. His parents, who live in Palo Alto, Calif., had been receiving mysterious packages at their house. The packages were all different shapes and sizes but each was addressed to \u201cReturns Department, Valley Fountain LLC.\u201dI looked into it and found that a company called Valley Fountain LLC was indeed listed at his parents\u2019 address. But it also appeared to be listed at 235 Montgomery Street, Suite 350, in downtown San Francisco.There was little pattern or theme to what these Amazon shops sold. They had everything from hemorrhoid cream to desk lamps, and there were varying levels of inventory. On sale at DeepOceanStoreuk (a storefront on Amazon.uk associated with Bropastures LLC), I found a book on industrial electricity, a set of fake facial wounds and a \u201cNo Stress Tech Guide to Microsoft Works 8 & 8.5.\u201d Another storefront called Kingdom Kber, this one on Amazon.de and associated with Agapao LLC, advertised a miniature whale, nail gel and a copy of \u201cUndocumented Immigrants and Higher Education.\u201d When I clicked on these items, though, none of them were currently available. A good number of the storefronts were completely empty.One thing these LLCs had in common was that their registered agent was named Jonathan Park.Even though the packages being sent to my student\u2019s parents\u2019 home were addressed to Valley Fountain LLC, one of the packages had a return label taped to it that indicated it came from an Amazon store called Sendai Book Store. I looked it up and found that it was on several cautionary lists of unauthorized resellers, and had more than 400,000 things for sale. But once again, the offerings seemed chosen at random.I decided to order something: L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick (3 pcs) for $25.63. (I pretended not to see that the same item was listed at $10.74 by another reseller.)  Amazon informed me that the lipstick would come in two weeks; there was no tracking information. In this case, it seemed that Valley Fountain LLC and other companies were posing as traditional retailers \u2014 usually by setting up Amazon storefronts like Sendai Book Store \u2014 and were just reselling items from other Amazon storefronts at inflated prices. It sounds confusing, but ultimately, it\u2019s pretty similar to scalping concert tickets: A middleman makes money by ratcheting up the price.The items in many of the storefronts associated with 235 Montgomery, Suite 350 had an unusually long shipping time and consistently low stock, so it made sense that items purchased from them might be coming from elsewhere.While I waited for my lipstick, I returned to the list of LLCs, and noticed that there was something else that the companies had in common. According to LinkedIn and Facebook, at least a handful of the listed agents were alumni of Olivet University, a Bible college based in California.If Olivet University sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it has been in the news lately. Earlier this year its offices were raided as part of a fraud investigation being conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. As it also happens, here is where the story converged with another of my interests. My boyfriend had worked at Newsweek as an editor for a year. He was let go in April 2017.Newsweek\u2019s journalists also found that their company had offered about $149,000 worth of free advertising in the print magazine to New York\u2019s Dutchess County, where Olivet was turning an abandoned psychiatric hospital into a satellite campus of Olivet University. The deal \u2014 which resulted in 10 full-page ads promoting local tourism and the Hudson Valley Regional Airport \u2014 was facilitated by Marian Rebro, the president of the company overseeing the construction.\u201cOlivet University was not the subject of the visit,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything from the campus.\u201dSeveral of the Newsweek journalists who had worked on the investigation of their company and its relationship with Olivet University were fired earlier this year. A spokesperson for Newsweek Media Group declined to comment. I went to 235 Montgomery Street to check it out, and found a set of locked double doors outfitted with a camera, a blinking light and a card reader. On the building\u2019s directory, Suite 350 was listed as IBPort, Inc.Who could this cosmopolitan shopper be? It\u2019s hard to say.Until recently, Marian Rebro, the president of the Olivet-affiliated management company that is developing the abandoned psychiatric facility in New York, was listed on business websites as the manager of Everymarket Inc. But Mr. Rebro said, in a statement: \u201cI am not the founder of Everymarket.com. I may have advised the company at one point many years ago, but have never been an employee there.\u201d He also said: \u201cI am not, nor have I ever been, a manager or employee of Everymarket.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to see the oddly overpriced Essy Beauty peel-off mask or Asavea hair straightener as a kind of product version of clickbait. After all, what is the experience of clickbait other than realizing we have vastly overpaid, even if only with our attention?News, information and products are simply someone\u2019s inventory.This is what I thought a countless number of times!This has gotten some of the companies listed at 235 Montgomery in trouble.In another legal dispute, from February of this year, Adult Printed Diapers LLC sued Faithfulness LLC, another one of Mr. Park\u2019s companies, for selling \u201cAww So Cute\u201d diapers, which are an Adult Printed Diapers trademark. It\u2019s not clear where Faithfulness LLC got the Adult Printed Diapers diapers, but the lawsuit alleges that Faithfulness LLC\u2019s co-defendant in the lawsuit, Rearz, Inc., made an unauthorized purchase of diaper inventory directly from Adult Printed Diapers\u2019 supplier in Shandong, China.  On a recent visit to Leez, recognizable brands were mixed in with disconcerting objects, like a $59 hat that said \u201cOslo Iceland\u201d on it and something called \u201cGranny Attic Bubble Foam.\u201d Both items appeared to be made by JNG Korea Co. Ltd.Products from Little Martin\u2019s Drawer and Asavea were prominently displayed.A sorry assortment of wooden furniture haunted the second floor, while the third floor remained dark, empty and forbidding; visitors were informed that it is now an event rental space.Business cards displayed at Leez named Chris Liu as the Chief Operation Officer there. Chris Liu\u2019s Linkedin profile lists a previous position in Business Development at IBTimes Australia.Amid all of this, my lipstick arrived! Inside the package was an invoice for $10.75 from \u201cCrispy Beauty,\u201d an unfortunately named Amazon seller that was decidedly not Sendai Book Store, the store on Amazon I paid $25.63 for the lipstick. When I went back to Amazon and generated a return label, the address was for Valley Fountain LLC. I was not prepared for the way a simple question about some mysterious packages would spiral into a dizzying network of Amazon storefronts, web domains and badly written \u201cAbout us\u201d pages. But the more I looked into it, the more it seemed they were being run by a handful of people, each operating in different capacities depending on the needs of the moment. More surreal was how these websites were linked to the physical world. Chris L. also made sure to throw in a plug for the third floor: \u201cThe 3rd floor of the store is open for rent. It\u2019s quite spacious and bright. Good for all kinds of event.\u201d I decided I had to go to the San Francisco store.In what sounds like a thick Eastern European accent, he says that \u201cStevens\u201d is the last name of a man who was in the bookstore business for 60 years. \u201cThis gentleman is actually my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to work a couple years together, and this is in memory of him.\u201d There\u2019s a cut in the video, and then: \u201cHe\u2019s still alive, but this is like a tribute to him. That\u2019s why it is called Stevens Books.\u201d\u201cDo you want to check out those books?\u201d the guy asked. No, I said. I wanted to buy them. \u201cOh!\u201d he said, and then laughed to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2026 we\u2019re not a library.\u201d In an email in response to request for comment, Mr. Volansky wrote \u201cP&J Health anti-snoring devices and Piero Lorenzo wallets are not sold in Stevens Books.\u201d He said he was not the owner, and that the store and the brand were owned by the Stevens Books Group. \u201cI go by my own name, Stevens is a nickname because of Stevens Books,\u201d he wrote.Trying to map the connections between all these entities opens a gaping wormhole. I couldn\u2019t get over the idea that a church might be behind a network of used business books, hair straighteners, and suspiciously priced compression stockings \u2014 sold on Amazon storefronts with names like GiGling EyE, ShopperDooperEU and DAMP store \u2014 all while running a once-venerable American news publication into the ground.Indeed, at some point I began to feel like I was in a dream. Or that I was half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real, the local from the global, a product from a Photoshop image, the sincere from the insincere.Still harder for me to grasp was the total interpenetration of e-commerce and physical space. Standing inside Stevens Books was like being on a stage set for Stevens Books, Stevens Book, Stevens Book Shop, and Stevensbook \u2014 all at the same time. It wasn\u2019t that the bookstore wasn\u2019t real, but rather that it felt reverse-engineered by an online business, or a series of them. Being a human who resides in physical space, my perceptual abilities were overwhelmed. But in some way, even if it was impossible to articulate, I knew that some kind of intersection of Olivet University, Gratia Community Church, IBPort, the Newsweek Media Group, and someone named Stevens was right there with me, among the fidget spinners, in an otherwise unremarkable store in San Francisco.Speaking with Jonathan Park, and reaching out to Olivet, provided some kind of clarification. Mr. Park said: \u201cI currently own and operate several businesses that I started while I was at Olivet,\u201d but added that he does not operate many of the entities that he helped incorporate, and that some entities have been spun off and are not related to him anymore.He said he mentored students, including interns and graduates of Olivet, and helped them set up businesses from time to time: \u201cMy collaboration with Olivet was one of my life\u2019s best experiences because the University and its students have an entrepreneurial spirit and great aspirations. It is truly a privilege to work together with these bright and gifted individuals.\u201d The school and students, he said, \u201cpartnered and envisioned an incubating program similar to those of the leading research universities; including Stanford and Cornell. While Olivet and my businesses are of a different scale than that of Stanford\u2019s and Google\u2019s, this type of collaboration is commonplace today and has proven to be very successful and rewarding for the economy at large. Our results and volumes are not odd, but, I believe, are rather impressive and something to be proud of.\u201dOlivet was more vague in its statement, made through its spokesperson Ronn Torossian. He wrote, in full:\u201cFollowing the legacy of our (late) Honorary Chairman Dr. Ralph D. Winter, Olivet University has always looked for ways to encourage growth in mission frontiers. This influence shaped the founding vision from Dr. Jang, who, as a devout Christian, believes a Biblical worldview can be applied across all varieties of fields. In that same spirit, the University has always been happy to help evangelical business owners, and we\u2019ve had a good working relationship with IBTimes over the years. We are also proud of our business-as-mission network with various entrepreneurs going into the marketplace as part of our ongoing exploration into models about how to best plant churches and expand mission frontiers. We will continue to explore this paradigm. These are challenging times for Christian and secular higher education institutions alike. Olivet is continually learning the best ways to provide high quality education to raise leaders while developing sound and diversified income sources. One model is Stanford University, which derives 85% of its revenues from non-tuition sources including sponsored research. Olivet similarly recognizes the importance of finding new models for supporting education, and therefore the school encourages innovation and entrepreneurship for its student and alumni base. Many of our alumni are successful entrepreneurs in the U.S. and other countries and contribute to and partner with the University by donating, partnering on research projects, providing internship/training opportunities, and in other ways. We will continue promoting these values that have made America into the great country it has become. And we are proud of all our successful alumni and are thankful to all the friends, benefactors and partners of Olivet University.\u201d In the end, I decided to return the lipstick.The alleged schemes include fictitious auditors (named \u201cKaren Smith\u201d and \u201cLynn Chen\u201d) who came complete with their own fictitious emails, phone numbers and websites; networks of corporate bank accounts; and the computer server company, Oikos Networks, that is listed at 22 Cortlandt Street, which also happens to be the address where Olivet Institute, Stevens Books and Christian Media Corporation are all registered.The indictments include charges against Etienne Uzac, a co-owner of IBT (and one of the original founders of International Business Times); William Anderson, an Olivet trustee, former chief executive of Christian Media Corporation (and husband of Yen-Yi Anderson); and John Xiao, Olivet\u2019s finance director and dean of Olivet Business School. The general manager of Oikos is named only as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator.\u201dI wondered about the fate of my overpriced L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick and who, at the New Jersey warehouse, would be there to receive it. I imagined a person sitting surrounded by rejected dinosaur costumes, butane fuel canisters and butt-enhancing creams. Soon they would receive my lipstick, neither a return nor quite a gift, purchased, at one point, from a faraway place called Crispy Beauty. I wondered if they knew their place in this vast and vertiginous network \u2014 if they knew that they were helping to achieve Everymarket\u2019s dream: A dream of being a marketplace \u201coffering practically everything from everywhere for everyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It comes about a month before the inauguration of president-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who has vowed to empower commercial ventures in the Amazon and other Brazilian biomes while weakening enforcement of environmental laws.In a statement, Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry said this week\u2019s decision was made to save money. It also cited the \u201ctransition process\u201d as Mr. Bolsonaro prepares to take office.Diplomats, environmentalists and others who follow the United Nations climate negotiations said the move threatens to mar Brazil\u2019s\u2019 reputation as a leading actor on environmental issues and sustainable development.Brazil hosted the Earth Summit in 1992 that gave rise to the United Nations climate convention, and the country has been actively engaged in brokering compromises between rich and poor nations grappling over how to take responsibility for lowering greenhouse gas emissions.In recent years, Brazil\u2019s standing as an environmental exemplar has eroded as farmers, miners and cattle ranchers have razed large areas of forest cover in the Amazon, with only occasional push back from the agencies tasked with enforcing environmental laws and regulations.Guy Edwards, a Latin America expert and co-director of the Climate and Development Lab at Brown University, said Brazil\u2019s decision to back out of hosting the summit is unwise in economic terms, since it would mean the country would forgo any investment, business deals and cooperation agreements to advance low carbon growth at the time when Brazil needs an economic boost.\u201cThe irony of the incoming Bolsonaro administration\u2019s decision to cancel the conference is that it will forgo the potentially hefty levels of investment and any number of business deals and cooperation agreements to advance low carbon growth just at the time that Brazil needs an economic boost,\u201d he said.Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the former environment minister of Peru, called Brazil\u2019s decision \u201ca bit sad,\u201d and added that it also creates a logistical hurdle for next year\u2019s climate change discussions.Under the United Nations system, a country from Latin America is supposed to host the summit in 2019. Brazil was the only country in the region to volunteer for the task, which can cost a country as much as $100 million.Other countries in the region still have time to step in, but it is unclear which might do so. Argentina has held climate summits in the past, but it is hosting this week\u2019s Group of 20 talks and may not want to incur another large expense. Mr. Pulgar-Vidal said it is unlikely that Peru, which spent $72 million to host a climate summit in 2014, would do it again.\u201cThis now puts Latin America in a difficult situation,\u201d Mr. Pulgar-Vidal said.Alexander Saier, the spokesman for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said in a statement that if no countries from Latin America offer to host in 2019, then the conference will be held at the seat of the climate secretariat in Bonn, Germany.That decision, he said, will be made by the end of next month.Brazil is the latest major influencer on climate change policy to take a radical shift on the issue.Australia\u2019s new prime minister, Scott Morrison, also threatened to pull out of the Paris Agreement. His conservative government has since said it will honor its pledges, but the country\u2019s energy policy contains no plans for curbing emissions.And Poland, which will host climate change talks next month, has invited coal companies to be partners in discussions on how to ratchet down fossil fuel emissions.Ernesto Londo\u00f1o reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Lisa Friedman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s New Neighbor: The Nation\u2019s Largest Housing Project", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil recently, the most important thing to know about Amazon for residents of the Queensbridge Houses, the country\u2019s largest public housing project, was that any packages left in a lobby would likely be stolen.But Amazon will soon be a far larger presence in their New York City neighborhood.Here, where livings are eked out on meager paychecks, or social service assistance, with nearly 60 percent of its households relying on food stamps, the new neighbor will be one of the world\u2019s most profitable high-tech companies, bringing what could be a work force of 25,000 people making salaries upward of $100,000.The stark contrast amplifies some of the social and economic tensions coursing through American society \u2014 a widening income gap, a lack of access to high-paying jobs for many minorities and a technology sector struggling to diversify.The planned location for the new headquarters is still unclear, as is whether Amazon will deliver any benefits to the roughly 6,000 people who live in the Queensbridge Houses and other disadvantaged parts of the neighborhood.\u201cWhat are they going to do for the community? Are they going to guarantee us employment opportunities?\u201d said April Simpson, the president of Queensbridge Tenants Association. \u201cI\u2019m worried about, when they come, they\u2019re not going to have opportunities for people. Not just people from Queensbridge \u2014 but other lower- and middle-income people in this area.\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re leery about them coming in.\u201dAs New York City seeks to challenge Silicon Valley\u2019s dominance as a tech hub \u2014 Google recently announced plans for a significant expansion in New York \u2014 the explosion of jobs has helped propel the local economy. But it has not mitigated the \u201ctale of two cities\u201d narrative of economic disparity that Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to address in a city where the poverty rate in 2016 was 19.5 percent, significantly higher than the national rate.That stratification is keenly felt in Queensbridge, a gritty complex just across the East River from the East Side of Manhattan and some of the wealthiest neighborhoods and real estate in the country.Hard by the Queensboro Bridge, the Queensbridge Houses have been plagued with crime and drugs. Those problems have eased in recent years, Ms. Simpson said, and community programs have improved the quality of life. Last year, the housing project did not record a single shooting, something that had not happened in more than a decade and was a source of pride.But the neglect that afflicts many public housing developments and has led to harsh criticism of the de Blasio administration, persists here, residents and other local leaders said. \u201cThere are still a lot of problems with the apartments \u2014 the lack of heat and hot water, non-working elevators, mold and broken front doors,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, the city councilman whose district includes the Queensbridge Houses.Tyshema Basnight, 42, said she had been trying to rejoin the work force after raising a family. She has an associate degree in computer science and a tech job at Amazon would be a dream job, she said.\u201cFor now, I\u2019m just looking for secretarial work,\u201d said Ms. Basnight, who was among several residents lined up for one of the few aging computers available in the tenants association office for residents who do not have computers of their own.The office is not on the cutting edge of the digital frontier. And all the buzz over the e-commerce behemoth transforming Long Island City into a gleaming new-economy tech hub was met with skepticism, if not outright hostility.Many businesses \u2014 including travel and financial companies and hotel chains \u2014 have opened in recent years in the area, but Ms. Simpson said they have not hired local residents.\u201cThey did not hire here \u2014 they brought in their own people,\u201d she said. \u201cMy thing is: If you build here, hire here.\u201dA spokesman for Amazon, Sam Kennedy, declined to comment on its plans in New York, but said that the company has a proven track record of funding and creating programs for the needy in Seattle, where Amazon has its main headquarters. This includes donating tens of millions of dollars, creating affordable housing, opening a shelter in its office complex for homeless families and creating a training program for the food service and culinary industries for less-advantaged residents.In Queens, the new companies that have come to Long Island City have helped transform the semi-industrial waterfront neighborhood into a haven for moneyed professionals. Since 2010 more apartment buildings have been built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in the city. Apartments in the more than 40 new buildings sell for an average of over $1 million.But past the gleaming skyline of high-rises, many residents fear that Amazon\u2019s arrival will only intensify the gentrification that is making the neighborhood less affordable for people of limited means.It is still unknown what financial incentives city and state officials may have offered Amazon or what, if any concessions, they have extracted from the company to help the neighborhood.Amazon\u2019s arrival, city officials insisted, would yield tangible gains for area residents.They said they were considering setting up programs similar to a city-funded employment center in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\u201cSecuring training and good jobs for local residents \u2014 especially those living in Nycha \u2014 is central to the way we craft major economic development initiatives,\u201d said Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, referring to the New York City Housing Authority.\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity to bring tens of thousands of good jobs to our city and open up good-paying careers in technology for New Yorkers.\u201dStill, Mr. Van Bramer questioned the city and state\u2019s eager courting of Amazon at a time when the housing complex is still in need of funding for basic repairs.\u201cIf we are helping a headquarters with 25,000 employees move in, a stone\u2019s throw from the largest housing development in the United States of America, we need more than lip service for the people of Queensbridge,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore we throw corporate welfare at the richest man in the world, we should think about the crisis in Nycha, and address the needs of the community, including training Queensbridge residents for tech jobs \u2014 or they will be looking through the glass from the outside.\u201dHe spoke of belonging to the Queensbridge \u201cfamily,\u201d and taking pride in its success stories. Mr. Jones said he trained on computers in high school and if his rap career fizzles, he would happily take a job at Amazon. \u201cIf Amazon doesn\u2019t hire from this community, we should boycott them,\u201d he said.\u201cNot everyone here has a Ph.D., but anyone eager to work should be able to get job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be nothing but a plus.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Trump Is Worse Than Nixon", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe current president is pushing closer to fascism than even the man behind Watergate. Ms. Drew covered Watergate for The New Yorker. Nixon, a lawyer who had been a member of the House of Representatives, a senator and a vice president, was more accepting of the political order. Mr. Trump, with no government experience, and little knowledge of how the federal government works, has been a free if malevolent spirit, less likely than even Nixon to observe boundaries. Each president tried to stir up public impatience with his perceived persecution and thus pressure investigators to hurry up, but Mr. Trump makes Nixon look like a pussycat. Mr. Trump has other structural advantages over Nixon. Nixon\u2019s base nearly melted away in the face of evidence of his guilt in a cover-up. Mr. Trump\u2019s base has yet to be so tested, but it\u2019s larger and more cohesive than Nixon\u2019s. And Nixon had nothing remotely like the propaganda organ that Mr. Trump has in Fox News. (There was no cable TV in Nixon\u2019s time.)The big question is whether there will turn out to be a major difference between the two men when it comes to honoring the decisions of the law, or of the public. Nixon shied from challenging John F. Kennedy\u2019s narrow electoral victory in 1960 not out of magnanimity but because he concluded he couldn\u2019t make the charge of fraud stick. Mr. Trump, as we\u2019re seeing, needs no evidence before charging election fraud.Elizabeth Drew, a political journalist who covered Watergate for The New Yorker, is the author of \u201cWashington Journal: Reporting Watergate and Richard Nixon\u2019s Downfall.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She was hired to work at an Amazon sorting facility in 2016. \u201cI worked hard, and I got employee of the month,\u201d she said. It was the first time she really loved a job, she said, and she remains impressed by the business built by Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder.A white co-worker stood up for Ms. Ibrahim, she said, and the manager apologized. \u201cThe new managers are like military \u2014 they don\u2019t give you respect,\u201d Ms. Ibrahim said. \u201cAt the beginning, I was paying attention to Awood, but finally the pressure they were talking about became the reality that I see every day.\u201dBy the time he arrived, many recent immigrants were already connecting with one another as Amazon workers because of the company\u2019s initial recruitment campaign and coordinated transportation. Workers talked about Awood during breaks and car pools. Awood has also found leverage in the number of East African workers and the time of year. \u201cIt is a perfectly legitimate way for workers to exercise collective voice in the work force,\u201d he said.Amazon does not comment on individual cases, Ms. Robinson, the company spokeswoman, said. But she said the company worked to reduce safety risks, had climate-controlled warehouses and accommodated medical needs.Ms. Kassim spent several months of unpaid leave on bed rest, and gave birth to a healthy girl in December.When she returned to work, co-workers told her that something had changed while she was gone: Awood had begun organizing. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m in,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2018I want to get my rights.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Abdirahman Muse's initial association with the Awood Center, a nonprofit focused on helping East African workers.

I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at Businessweek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Amazon Finally Makes an HQ2 Decision", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello from Seattle. I\u2019m Karen Weise, the new tech correspondent here. As you might imagine, the announcement of Amazon\u2019s decision in what it had billed as a search for a second headquarters, a.k.a. HQ2, has dominated news here this week.I\u2019ve found the HQ2 search and the obsession around it fascinating because of the blatant display of Amazon\u2019s power to promise jobs and lobby politicians, thanks to the company\u2019s market dominance and consumer adoration.The choice to enter New York is particularly interesting because Amazon will need to deal with a local political environment that is far more complex than its hometown\u2019s.Seattle has plenty of activism \u2014 from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests to becoming the first big city to pass a $15 minimum wage \u2014 and certainly there\u2019s some antagonism toward Amazon. But the labor, media and electoral politics of New York are a different breed.That\u2019s been evident in the blowback to the more than $2 billion in planned tax subsidies there. That the state promised to help Amazon get access to a helipad didn\u2019t help.The New York Post cover blared \u201cQueens Ransom\u201d next to a picture of the company founder, Jeff Bezos, laughing in a helicopter holding bags of cash. A hundred people protested at the Long Island City site, waving signs like one that read \u201cStay the Helipad Out.\u201dUntil recently, Amazon barely involved itself in Seattle\u2019s civic politics. Its growth was steady for more than a decade, only kicking into high gear the past few years. For a while, Amazon\u2019s main involvement with city hall was more about small things like approvals for street vacations than major politics.That began to change in 2015, when Amazon\u2019s real estate head, John Schoettler, who was deeply involved in the HQ2 search, led the local Chamber of Commerce. Earlier this year, Amazon publicly fought a new tax to pay for homeless services and affordable housing. But there was never a singular moment like this when Seattle got to ask: Do we want Amazon here? If so, do we want taxpayers to pay for it?When news of a split HQ2 broke, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said, \u201cI\u2019d call those branch offices.\u201d It\u2019s a good zinger, but while Seattle may want to call it a win, several experts pointed out to me that Amazon will now have three cities to pit against one another for decades to come. Talk about leverage.And Amazon is still calling the two new locations headquarters. \u201cWe know there will be leaders and teams in all three headquarters as we map out the growth,\u201d Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, told me. \u201cWe are already a company that spans the country, with employees in over 45 states. I\u2019m on the leadership team but live in D.C. and am in Seattle today. It reinforces what already exists for us.\u201dHow that division shakes out will be interesting to track. The New York office is already home to much of Amazon\u2019s growing advertising group, which has become almost an obsession among investors because of its high margins. That\u2019s a mix of the technical and creative work that\u2019s already thriving in the city.Many had suggested that a Washington-area choice could signal a growing dependence on government contracts, like a $10 billion cloud deal for the Defense Department that Amazon is favored to win.But Amazon\u2019s agreement with Virginia specifically states that the incentives Amazon gets will decrease if more than 10 percent of the work done at that location is for federal contracts, something that reflects the state\u2019s goal of diversifying its economy away from government work. So what\u2019s Amazon\u2019s vision there?Some other tech stories of note this week:Advertisement"}

Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Amazon was constructed to blunt the veto power of local politicians.

The closed-door deal to avoid local review has angered many Council members and state legislators, some of whom appeared at Wednesday\u2019s rally.\u201cWhy did they usurp the ability of the Council to do its job?\u201d asked a newly elected assemblywoman, Catalina Cruz, who represents the nearby Queens neighborhoods of Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not good for our community.\u201dBut what can opponents actually do to stop it? The City Council could try to alter or eliminate the tax breaks promised Amazon by the city, public policy experts said, but those are not unique to Amazon, and any changes would similarly affect other companies\u2019 tax packages.Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, said in a statement that if the state\u2019s economic projections are correct, \u201cthis deal has the potential to more than pay for itself.\u201d The Bronx Democrat added, \u201cOf course we take our role in approving aspects of this deal very seriously and we will be closely reviewing it.\u201dThere will likely be a state-run environmental review to examine the impact of the Amazon development. But the input from local officials is only advisory. Opponents would not be able to block the deal \u2014 something they could have done if it went through the City Council. One or more government boards must also review elements of the plan and the incentive package before it goes into effect. One of those, the Empire State Development board, is controlled by Mr. Cuomo\u2019s executive branch and is an unlikely avenue for opponents.Detractors may find that they have the most leverage at the obscure, five-member Public Authorities Control Board, which reviews and approves certain financing deals by state authorities. Some aspects of the Amazon deal, such as a $500 million state grant, are likely to go before that board, experts said. \u201cThe Public Authority Control Board will likely have to approve the agreement,\u201d said David J. Friedfel, director of state studies at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission.The board is led by an appointee of the governor, but gives veto power to the Assembly speaker and the Senate leader, through their representatives, said E.J. McMahon, research director for the Empire Center for Public Policy, a research organization in Albany. \u201cIt\u2019s the main choke point,\u201d he said. But some critics believe that, too, could be an uphill battle. The board\u2019s chairman, Robert F. Mujica Jr., said it would not necessarily review the state\u2019s incentive package.\u201cThe capital grant does not have to go through P.A.C.B.,\u201d Mr. Mujica, who was appointed by Mr. Cuomo, said in an interview on Wednesday. The prime option is to continue to publicly pressure Amazon.Hearings, even if they are nonbinding, could increase negative attention on the company, as could a court fight. Opponents of the Atlantic Yards development spent years in court and successfully trained negative attention on that plan. But they ultimately failed to stop the project, which includes the Barclays Center arena.\u201cAll of these battles are uphill battles.\u201d Others simply want Amazon to stay out of New York City.\u201cThe leverage point, I think we saw it today: The outpouring of opposition to this proposal,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, whose union, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, took part in Wednesday\u2019s protest in Queens. He spoke by phone from a meeting in Geneva of international unions opposed to Amazon.\u201cTheir business model depends on low taxes and low wages and a reduction of workers rights,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this the behavior that New York wants to reward?\u201dBy the end of Wednesday, at least one possible presidential contender had begun criticizing the deal: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.Nate Schweber contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders: Lion of the Left, but Not the Only One Roaring", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBernie Sanders can still get a crowd.At rallies across the country before the midterms, from South Carolina to Michigan to Nevada, people came to see the Brooklyn-timbred senator from Vermont. They rattled the rafters in Wichita, Kan. They screamed his name in Iowa.Yet as Mr. Sanders ponders another presidential run, what is not clear is whether he can still get the votes.It is a question that has taken on new relevance as attention turns to the presidential election two years away: While the list of possible Democratic candidates seems to expand every day, political prognosticators have long assumed there would be a Bernie 2.0.But if Mr. Sanders, 77, was a sensation in 2016, electrifying crowds and awakening fervor on the far left, he is no longer a singular figure among Democrats. Outflanked on the left by rising stars like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Beto O\u2019Rourke, his stronghold on the party\u2019s progressive wing has weakened. Many of his key policy positions, including Medicare for All and tuition-free public college, have been embraced by others \u2014 a victory for him, he would argue, but one that makes his agenda seem less novel.And while his out-front political presence has kept his name in the mix of 2020 chatter, it has also weakened the anti-establishment appeal he rode to success two years ago.\u201cI want to make sure that when I make that decision, if I decide to run, that I have concluded in fact that I am the strongest candidate who can defeat Donald Trump,\u201d he told the network.Mr. Sanders exceeded political expectations in 2016, winning roughly 13 million votes in an essentially two-person race against Hillary Clinton, who got 17 million. He prevailed in 23 primaries and caucuses \u2014 compared with 34 for her \u2014 including wins in New Hampshire, Michigan and Wisconsin, while struggling in major battlegrounds like Florida, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.Like other possible 2020 candidates, Mr. Sanders spent the midterms laying groundwork for a possible run.Advisers and people close to the senator speak as if he plans to run, talking privately about his core message and his proven ability to raise money from individual donors.They also rebuff the notion that his candidacy would not resonate in the same way it did two years ago. In such an unpredictable political climate, Mr. Sanders is at least a known quantity who built a loyal following with his curmudgeonly demeanor and fiery challenge to Wall Street and the Washington elite.\u201cHe\u2019s going to be able to rekindle that spark, partly because I don\u2019t think his spark ever went out,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders in 2016, who still speaks to the senator regularly. \u201cI think there\u2019s an energized base of supporters that he has out there.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if all the folks that loved Bernie Sanders in 2016 are then automatically going to go to him in a 2020 situation,\u201d said Aaron Pickrell, who was a senior adviser on President Barack Obama\u2019s Ohio campaign. This time around, he continued, \u201ca lot of other candidates bring similar dynamics that Sanders has.\u201dDavid Kochel, a top Republican strategist in Iowa who has worked on presidential campaigns for Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, said: \u201cSanders will fizzle. Lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice for these passion candidates.\u201dMr. Sanders declined a request for an interview.In recent months, aides, advisers and others close to Mr. Sanders have wrestled with how to make old seem new, or at least, newer \u2014 and whether that should even be a concern.He might also add to his policy arsenal an aggressive call for the government to forgive student loans and concrete proposals for combating climate change, some said.Others believe that Mr. Sanders has been championing the same policy agenda for decades. Why change anything now?\u201cI don\u2019t think he needs to add onto the message in the sense that that\u2019s his message,\u201d said Pete D\u2019Alessandro, who was Mr. Sanders\u2019s Iowa campaign director in 2016. \u201cThat is his brand.\u201dThere is also a more combustible element to the 2020 campaign: the Trump presidency. Some Democrats have suggested the party should hew closely to a strategy focused on health care and economic issues, but Mr. Sanders appears primed to attack the president, using acerbic language in recent months to denounce him and his policies.That strategy could appeal to those who want to see their own anger channeled through candidates, yet could backfire with voters in states like Ohio and Wisconsin which flipped to Mr. Trump last time.\u201cIt was inartful,\u201d said Nina Turner, the president of Our Revolution, an advocacy organization aligned with Mr. Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s the nicest way I can frame it. What came out of his mouth is not in his heart.\u201dMs. Turner, who said Our Revolution would support Mr. Sanders if he runs, said the senator would have to \u201cadd race to his class conversations\u201d during a 2020 campaign to appeal more to minority voters.As other candidates with similarly populist sensibilities also consider runs, including Ms. Warren and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Mr. Sanders and his allies are confident in his enduring appeal. They point in particular to his 2016 ability to attract young people, a strength that they hope will carry over into 2020. It\u2019s not obvious, however, that it will.During a swing through Iowa before the midterm elections, Mr. Sanders made a stop at Iowa State University\u2019s homecoming parade, where he was greeted with fervent shouts and cheers. He would later hold a rally for local candidates on campus.Among those marching in the parade was Jimmie Bragdon, 21, wearing a Democrat-blue sweatshirt. Mr. Bragdon had caucused for Mr. Sanders in 2016, but he said he now thought it was \u201ctime for a fresher face in Democratic leadership.\u201d For 2020, he had his eye on Ms. Harris and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York\u201cIn this day and age, people like to see things that are different,\u201d he said later. \u201cStatus quo stuff kind of doesn\u2019t stick.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Laurene Powell Jobs Save Storytelling?", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHer firm is buying up one media property after another. This week it added Pop-Up Magazine Productions to its roster. Contributing Opinion WriterJust what is Laurene Powell Jobs up to?Over the last few years, Ms. Powell Jobs, an activist, investor and entrepreneur, has been investing in media companies through her social impact firm, Emerson Collective. Buying up a range of unusual properties, she seems to be making an effort to turbocharge storytelling in this fractured digital age.Emerson \u2014 which gets its name from, yes, Ralph Waldo and has focused on education, immigration and the environment since it was formally created in 2011 \u2014 would not disclose the price it paid for Pop-Up. But it\u2019s small compared to the many other investments its for-profit and nonprofit arms have made over the last two years.That includes an undisclosed sum to pick up a majority chunk of The Atlantic magazine, along with funding to add 100 employees, including the New Yorker writer George Packer and a former Facebook executive, Alex Hardiman; starting a documentary production company, Concordia Studio, with the Oscar-winning director Davis Guggenheim; buying a large stake in the production, content and talent management powerhouse Anonymous Content, the maker of \u201cSpotlight\u201d; purchasing another in Macro, which finances media focusing on stories of people of color, like \u201cFences\u201d; and making investments in the online magazine Ozy, the news site Axios and the podcast-making phenom Gimlet Media.Emerson has also sprinkled money all over nonprofit journalism, including at ProPublica, Mother Jones, The Marshall Project, the Committee to Protect Journalists, StoryCorps, Lawfare, Texas Observer and Chalkbeat.It\u2019s a lot, and it seems to be accelerating. Ms. Powell Jobs has $20 billion from the stakes in Apple and Disney that she inherited from her husband, Steve Jobs. She also seems to have inherited his understanding that narrative moves people more than anything else.I asked Peter Lattman, a former New York Times reporter and editor who is now the managing director of media at Emerson, what the firm\u2019s goals are. \u201cBroadly, we invest in and support super high-quality journalism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking at innovative approaches to media and storytelling.\u201dPop-Up is that. Its shows are truly memorable \u2014 they have to be, because they are not taped and never survive except in the memories of the audience present. With a multimedia brew of photos, music, dance and even shadow puppets, the Pop-Up shows have attracted sellout crowds who like its quirky vibe. But it\u2019s not all twee; the shows tackle a wide range of issues that often zero in on the impact of tech on society.Its editor in chief, Doug McGray, said that the company plans to use the new funds \u2014 it has raised $4 million in addition to the Emerson investment \u2014 to expand its Pop-Up business.\u201cI have always been inspired by the idea of making the most ambitious, inventive journalism we can,\u201d Mr. McGray said. \u201cAnd what we get here is to team up with an institution that already understands our value. It\u2019s such a natural alignment.\u201dWhat will be interesting to watch going forward is how the various arms of the Emerson media machine will work together. Both Mr. McGray and Mr. Lattman said that would be a welcome development. Already, Gimlet\u2019s podcast \u201cHomecoming\u201d went on to become the Amazon Prime show starring Julia Roberts, produced by Anonymous Content.\u201cBoth magazines have managed to create unique journalistic platforms that help foster empathy and a better understanding of the world,\u201d she said.I like the idea of that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twin Brothers Plead Guilty to Bronx Bomb-Making Plot", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA former schoolteacher and his twin brother pleaded guilty on Monday to federal conspiracy and bomb-making charges, admitting in court that they had stockpiled explosive material in their Bronx apartment.The former teacher, Christian Toro, 28, paid at least two students about $50 an hour to break apart fireworks, extract the explosive powder and store it in containers, the authorities had said.\u201cWe were going to use the black powder and other materials to make an explosive,\u201d Christian Toro told a judge on Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.Yet even after the guilty pleas, the brothers\u2019 motive for building a bomb and what their target might have been remained unclear. \u201cI just want you to know that I had no intention of using it, let alone on anyone or anything,\u201d Christian Toro told Judge Richard M. Berman. Tyler Toro also contended that he had never intended to harm anyone.The investigators recovered handwritten diary entries in the men\u2019s apartment that referred to an operation code-named Flash. They also found a yellow backpack containing a purple index card that read, in all capital letters, \u201cUnder the full moon the small ones will know terror.\u201dThe brothers did not appear to be inspired by international terrorist groups like the Islamic State, but the government has asserted that the threat the men posed was real. Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said on Monday after the men pleaded guilty that the device they sought to build \u201ccould have caused great damage.\u201dTyler Toro texted his brother that the shooter in the Las Vegas massacre had a police scanner, and that they should invest in one, too.\u201cCopy,\u201d Christian Toro responded. \u201cI see a couple on Amazon.\u201dThe police arrested a 15-year-old female student and charged her with making the threatening call. Mr. Toro resigned on Jan. 9, and three weeks later he was charged with rape after being accused of having a sexual relationship with the same student. It was during the rape investigation that New York police detectives learned Mr. Toro had paid students to harvest powder from fireworks.After Christian Toro resigned, Tyler Toro returned to the school a laptop that his brother had been using in connection with his job, according to the complaint, which is signed by an F.B.I. special agent, Seth Yockel. A copy of a book with instructions for making explosive devices was found on the computer\u2019s hard drive, the complaint said.Christian Toro later told investigators that he had come across the book while researching the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and had only looked at its table of contents, the complaint noted.A search of the brothers\u2019 apartment turned up what Ms. Hanft called \u201ca veritable trove\u201d of chemicals and other bomb-making materials, including a box containing 20 pounds of iron oxide, five pounds of aluminum powder, five pounds of potassium nitrate, a jar of explosive powder, a box of firecrackers and a bag containing scores of metal spheres of varying sizes, which the authorities said could become projectiles in a blast.The students who were paid to dismantle fireworks visited the men\u2019s apartment between October 2017 and last January, the complaint said.The men are to be sentenced on March 26.Advertisement"}

Ms. Teachout is a law professor at Fordham University.Unfortunately, New York has a long history of playing the fool in corporate relationships. Our state already ranks last in the nation in returns on billions of dollars in corporate giveaways. Its economic development programs are the most expensive in the country, amounting to 76 percent of the state\u2019s gross tax revenue. In 2015, Mr. Cuomo gave away $8.25 billion to corporations \u2014 as much as the next three states combined.New York City is the heart and soul of the truly independent small business: idiosyncratic merchants that are rooted in their communities, making life rich, beautiful and chaotic for all New Yorkers. They include not only retail businesses, but also the dreamers who make things and sell them, such as CW Pencil Enterprise, which sells curated pencils in Manhattan; Pintrill, a Brooklyn-based company that creates and trades small pins, and Shine Electronics, an electronic store that buys and resells used cellphones, with its headquarters in Long Island City. No company has done more to decimate the power of these small businesses than Amazon has.In other words, Mr. Cuomo and the rest of New York\u2019s public officials should fulfill their civic duty and reveal exactly what Amazon is promising, before entering into a relationship that will compromise the dignity and livelihoods of the people of our state.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s HQ2 Will Benefit From New York City. But What Does New York Get?", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe innovation myth used to involve the back of a suburban garage or an office park in Silicon Valley. The tech industry was incubated not on the mean streets of the big city, but in sleepy hamlets like Murray Hill, N.J., and Mountain View, Calif.So with Amazon splitting HQ2, its second headquarters, between Crystal City, a part of Arlington, Va., and Long Island City, in Queens, what are we to make of tech\u2019s steady migration to marquee cities?Amazon is hardly alone, after all. Google and Facebook already have headquarters here (established, not incidentally, without state subsidies). Google intends to double its work force in the city to nearly 20,000. Twitter\u2019s second-largest office is in Manhattan. Its largest is in downtown San Francisco.On one level, this all seems inevitable. A handful of the wealthiest American cities today have a magnetic attraction. Today\u2019s biggest tech platforms seek them out to recruit top talent and gain access, at scale, to housing, schools and transit. The process means the rich get richer, the biggest companies, bigger. And the gulf widens between the country\u2019s haves and have-nots.On another level, the tech industry isn\u2019t culturally urban. Its insularity, secrecy, its bedrock libertarianism and algorithmic notions about progress, land use and corporate independence have never easily meshed with the slow, open-society, regulatory-heavy, greater-good mission that defines city living. Disruption is a virtue and instrument of efficiency in tech circles. But it isn\u2019t necessarily welcome where protections and a focus on collective welfare remain abiding democratic ideals.That said, New York City is not Seattle or San Francisco. Here, tech is one sector in a megalopolis, sharing the limelight with finance, media, fashion, advertising and art. It\u2019s absorbed into the immensity.And Mr. Dorsey wasn\u2019t alone. In Seattle, Amazon raised a ruckus when officials proposed a tax on large employers to help pay for services to the homeless. The company threatened to halt construction on a new high-rise.So the city dropped the plan.This is certainly not how New Yorkers like to operate.Silly as it sounds, where bosses live turns out to be as good a predictor as any of where tech companies will settle.For years, suburbia has offered these companies acres of disposable, cheap, anonymous office parks: mostly one- or two-story concrete structures surrounded by loads of surface parking. These sites minimized costs, maximized security and allowed companies to scale up, contract or split into different units quickly \u2014 at the same time they promoted sprawl and traffic jams and transformed once-quaint bedroom communities south of San Francisco into phenomenally expensive places to live.Not that young tech workers, more and more of them immigrants, wanted to live in suburbia, anyway. Increasingly they demanded the diversity and benefits of city life. And so did successful innovation companies, following the lead of workers.Another way to put it is that companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon became attracted to cities like New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington because these cities had already made transformative public investments in assets like culture, parks, universities and transit.The question for city residents is what these companies give back. I\u2019m not saying companies move, or should be expected to move, for any reason other than to make money. Amazon promises tens of thousands of new jobs in New York, with all sorts of ripple effects beyond employing more coders, sales executives, baristas, nannies and yoga instructors. In one fell swoop, it bids to make good on 20 years of the whole post-Manhattan, cool-outer-borough narrative.But that isn\u2019t the only balance sheet. \u201cUrban life is built around a social compact,\u201d said Vishaan Chakrabarti, a Columbia professor and founder of the architecture firm PAU. Economic value creation in superstar cities like New York fuels a feedback loop that companies and cities both want to lean into.What does this mean? For starters, it means that the city and state now have even more reason to funnel money into subways, buses and a new tunnel under the Hudson River, and to pony up for the stalled BQX streetcar project linking Brooklyn and Queens, all of which would serve Amazon.In turn, Amazon, which dominates the book market, could, up front, make self-interested commitments in local school programs and, as Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University, advocates, in public libraries, our most vibrant, multipurpose community hubs.As for housing, the city\u2019s regulatory and zoning policies are more responsible for driving up costs than tech companies. But, in an ideal world, Amazon would reverse what it did in Seattle and commit resources to affordable housing in areas where its workers are moving; and it would pitch in for homeless services, which, by extension, would improve the daily lives of Amazon employees.Mr. Chakrabarti has a modest proposal, as well: The company could extend a hand toward Long Island City neighbors like LaGuardia Community College and Queensbridge, the largest public housing development in North America.There\u2019s no reason to presume Amazon will do any of this, of course.New York\u2019s abundance of resources, talent and ideas derives from its exceptional diversity and social infrastructure \u2014 urban virtues. Amazon could profit from its enhancement of New York as much as New York could profit from Amazon\u2019s presence. It\u2019s not how tech tends to work.But it\u2019s how this city works.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s HQ2? Make That Q for Queens", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon is nearing a deal to name Long Island City, a fast-growing neighborhood on the western edge of Queens, as one of two locations that would together house as many as 50,000 employees in its ever-expanding work force, according to two people briefed on the negotiations.The other location in Amazon\u2019s plans is outside the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, according to one of the people briefed.The arrival of Amazon in Long Island City could finally establish New York as a major technology hub. But some residents worry about the effects of so many newcomers on the neighborhood of gleaming apartment towers and low-rise manufacturing that is already straining from rapid growth.There have been 41 new apartment buildings built there since 2010, according to an analysis by the city. Last year, more new apartments were built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in New York. The reasons, in large measure, are its proximity to Manhattan, its relatively low cost and the views.The northern part of the neighborhood is also home to the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing project in the country.The proposed locations of any Amazon buildings within the neighborhood were not clear.A person briefed on the discussions said city officials took Amazon executives looking for a new headquarters, known as HQ2, around the area three times, in April, July and September. In one instance, the person said, they toured on Citi Bikes, the local bike-share program; in another, they took a sunset ride on one of the city\u2019s new fast ferries.\u201cWhether it\u2019s Amazon or something else, we\u2019re growing,\u201d said Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the LIC Partnership, the local development corporation. \u201cYou do have to plan thoughtfully.\u201dAll the building \u2014 and the new residents who come with it \u2014 has put pressure on the area\u2019s infrastructure. New schools are needed, according to the city, and the subways are packed.\u201cThe 7 train is overloaded today, and we can\u2019t sell Long Island City as being transportation rich,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said, sounding a note of caution. \u201cThe people who work at Amazon are going to be competing for space on that train.\u201dIt was not clear whether the discussions with Amazon included promises to improve or expand transit options. The office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans, which have yet to be formally announced. A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio also declined to comment. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio met separately with Amazon executives late last month, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\u201cWork with M.T.A./L.I.R.R. and Amtrak to study the feasibility of creating a new rail station in Sunnyside Yard at Queens Boulevard,\u201d read the city\u2019s plan, referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Long Island Rail Road, both of which use space in nearby rail yards.A person briefed on the discussions said that while the plan had been in the works before, city officials wanted to be sure to release it before Amazon made a decision.\u201cThere was grumbling before,\u201d said Sheila Lewandowski, 54, a longtime resident and director of the Chocolate Factory Theater, an arts organization in the area that has faced the threat of displacement.And then, she added, there is the issue of the sewers. Half of the city\u2019s proposed new spending, about $95 million, is for sewers.\u201cWe do have sewage problems,\u201d Ms. Lewandowski said. \u201cThey\u2019re backing up. If we\u2019re going to bring in this major corporation, we better invest a lot more in infrastructure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of us are more equal than others, and they like Trump.Opinion ColumnistEveryone is delivering post-mortems on Tuesday\u2019s elections, so for what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s mine: Despite some bitter disappointments and lost ground in the Senate, Democrats won a huge victory. They broke the Republican monopoly on federal power, and that\u2019s a very big deal for an administration that has engaged in blatant corruption and abuse of power, in the belief that an impenetrable red wall would always protect it from accountability. They also made major gains at the state level, which will have a big impact on future elections.But given this overall success, how do we explain those Senate losses? Many people have pointed out that this year\u2019s Senate map was unusually bad for Democrats, consisting disproportionately of states Donald Trump won in 2016. But there was actually a deeper problem, one that will pose long-term problems, not just for Democrats, but for the legitimacy of our whole political system. For economic and demographic trends have interacted with political change to make the Senate deeply unrepresentative of American reality.But here\u2019s the thing: The Senate, which gives each state the same number of seats regardless of population \u2014 which gives fewer than 600,000 people in Wyoming the same representation as almost 40 million in California \u2014 drastically overweights those rural areas and underweights the places where most Americans live.I find it helpful to contrast the real America, the place we actually live, with what I think of as \u201cSenate America,\u201d the hypothetical nation implied by a simple average across states, which is what the Senate in effect represents.As I said, real America is mainly metropolitan; Senate America is still largely rural.Real America is racially and culturally diverse; Senate America is still very white.Real America includes large numbers of highly educated adults; Senate America, which underweights the dynamic metropolitan areas that attract highly educated workers, has a higher proportion of non-college people, and especially non-college whites.None of this is meant to denigrate rural, non-college, white voters. We\u2019re all Americans, and we all deserve an equal voice in shaping our national destiny. But as it is, some of us are more equal than others. And that poses a big problem in an era of deep partisan division.So what happened Tuesday, with Republicans getting shellacked in the House but gaining in the Senate, wasn\u2019t just an accident of this year\u2019s map or specific campaign issues. It reflected a deep division in culture, indeed values, between the American citizenry at large and the people who get to choose much of the Senate.This divergence will have profound implications, because the Senate has a lot of power, especially when the president \u2014 who, let us not forget, lost the popular vote \u2014 leads the party that controls it. In particular, Trump and his Senate friends will spend the next couple of years stuffing the courts with right-wing loyalists.We may, then, be looking at a growing crisis of legitimacy for the U.S. political system \u2014 even if we get through the constitutional crisis that seems to be looming over the next few months.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats Finally Control the Power in Albany. What Will They Do With It?", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s been years in the making, if not decades: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic Party seized complete control of the New York State government on Tuesday, decisively evicting Republicans from running the State Senate, which they have controlled for all but three years since World War II.Now Democrats have to figure out just what to do with that newfound power \u2014 and almost everyone has different ideas and priorities, some of which had already started to collide on Wednesday, even as Mr. Cuomo and his Democratic colleagues celebrated major wins.Democrats now hold 40 seats in the State Senate, as Republicans lost eight to the Democrats on Election Day. That count, however, includes Senator Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, who has previously caucused with Republicans.Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, won with 59 percent of the vote \u2014 some 3.4 million people chose him for a third term \u2014 a marked improvement from his 2014 victory, and one that left the governor sounding deeply satisfied.When asked on Wednesday what he would like to see passed in the coming legislative session, the governor laid out a veritable Christmas list of progressive baubles, including codifying Roe v. Wade\u2019s protections in state law; more gun control and ethics laws; the Dream Act, which would allow for financial aid for undocumented students; and the Child Victims Act, which would extend the statute of limitations for survivors of certain kinds of sexual abuse.Perhaps most notably, Mr. Cuomo said he would close the so-called L.L.C. loophole, which allows almost unlimited amounts of cash to flow to campaigns \u2014 including his own \u2014 through multiple limited liability companies.Mr. Cuomo had worked closely with Republicans and a breakaway group of Democrats during his seven-plus years in office, much to the chagrin of more left-leaning members of his party, who blamed those relationships for bottling up the very legislation he now wants to pass.And in describing his feelings on Wednesday, the governor sounded relieved that he would stop being blamed.\u201cMy great frustration has been the inability to pass progressive measures that would have made a significant positive difference for the state and, as governor, bearing the burden of the failure of their passage,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThe Democratic Senate will liberate me from that frustration.\u201dStill there will most be a push for even more: There is already chatter about legalizing recreational marijuana; investing more in the crumbling subways; addressing climate change; and installing an early voting system for the first time, all ideas that the governor has previously offered differing degrees of support for.And after a tumultuous primary season in which liberal challengers ousted seven more moderate Democratic state senators, the virtual Holy Grail of current progressive thought seems within reach: a state-run universal health care system. Mr. Cuomo stopped short of fully embracing the proposal, saying it \u201chas merit.\u201dAndrea Stewart-Cousins, who is slated to become the first woman and first female African-American to lead the New York State Senate, also struck a note of caution about the Democratic agenda. \u201cYou eat the elephant one issue at a time,\u201d she said on Tuesday, as votes began to roll in for her party.There also will likely be, of course, intraparty differences. The Senate that Ms. Stewart-Cousins will lead is very likely to contain several factions, including New York City liberals and more moderate members from the city\u2019s suburbs. Fifteen of her members will be new to Albany, and its vagaries, with many of that cohort never before having held public office \u2014 or, in some cases, even having an office.Gustavo Rivera, a Democratic state senator from the Bronx, said that Democrats had failed to keep the trust of voters during their brief time in charge nearly a decade ago and know they must do better this time.\u201cGoverning is a very complicated matter,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just giving raises to your staff and getting nicer offices.\u201dMr. Cuomo won in 2010, in part, on a promise to restore sanity and stability to the statehouse. And he did so by occupying the political center between a liberal State Assembly and a Republican-controlled State Senate. For years, he has blamed any number of stalled liberal goals on recalcitrant Republicans. That catchall excuse dissolved Tuesday evening.Alessandra Biaggi, who defeated Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the breakaway Democrats, said of Mr. Cuomo, \u201cNow it\u2019s up to us to actually hold him accountable and to make sure that the things that he says are not just campaign promises.\u201dMuch of the to-do list that Mr. Cuomo discussed after the election involved social or legal changes. But the governor has generally been more leery of raising taxes and other measures that would negatively affect the business community; real estate interests pour millions of dollars into his campaigns and drive a large segment of the city\u2019s and state\u2019s economy. Mayor Bill de Blasio has repeatedly called for a new millionaire\u2019s tax to fund various programs; Mr. Cuomo has steadfastly opposed it.The last time Democrats controlled the full Legislature, they raised taxes only to see themselves lose back the Senate within two years. \u201cThis scary narrative about tax-and-spend-Democrats will not pertain to us,\u201d said Ms. Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester Democrat. \u201cIt does not pertain to us.\u201dOne big issue sure to come up in 2019 is expanding rent control, as the current rules are set to expire.State Senator Brian P. Kavanagh, a Democrat from Manhattan elected in 2017, predicted \u201ca fundamentally different debate about the relationship between landlords and tenants\u201d than in the past.The governor has also signaled he wants to push a congestion-pricing plan to boost funding for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway system.\u201cHow are we going to fix the M.T.A.? We have got to do this,\u201d Ms. Biaggi said. \u201cThis is insane. Enough now. I don\u2019t think anyone wants to hear any more excuses.\u201dMr. Cuomo has previously feuded with state Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, who runs the political operation of Senate Democrats. Even some of the governor\u2019s allies were perplexed by an October news release from the state party, which Mr. Cuomo controls, that contrasted his efforts with those of Mr. Gianaris.\u201cFund-raising Effort Follows News That D.S.C.C. is Losing Money Race,\u201d the release blared. (Mr. Gianaris runs the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.)Ms. Stewart-Cousins said, \u201cI thought that was an unfortunate press release, frankly, and I made sure that the state party chair was aware of that.\u201dAnd on Wednesday, there were hints of friction there again as Mr. Gianaris said he had been kept in the dark about a possible deal to place a satellite headquarters of Amazon in Long Island City, which is the heart of his district. Mr. Cuomo has openly lobbied for Amazon to come to New York, joking he would even change his name to \u201cAmazon Cuomo\u201d to land the company.Mr. Gianaris, however, has expressed deep concerns about infrastructure, overcrowding and the wisdom of using subsidies to lure \u201cone of the richest companies in the world.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of red flags,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have any answers.\u201dStill, Mr. Gianaris, who helped orchestrate the Democrats\u2019 big night on Tuesday, also seemed eager to keep the peace. \u201cThis is a not a complaint that I wasn\u2019t briefed properly,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

So they wrote their own.Beijing is leveraging its commercial and military might to redraw the terms of trade, diplomacy and security, challenging the liberal democratic order.Under a merciless sun, a dozen Chinese construction workers survey an empty expanse of desert, preparing to transform it into the heart of a new Egyptian capital.The workers are employed by China\u2019s largest construction conglomerate through a $3 billion contract from an Egyptian company, with financing from Chinese banks. They are erecting a thicket of 21 skyscrapers, one as tall as the Empire State Building.The presence of Chinese labor and largess on the sands of Egypt is a testament to China\u2019s global aspirations. After centuries of weakness and isolation, China is reclaiming what its leaders regard as its natural destiny \u2014 supremacy in Asia, and respect around the planet. Through the ventures in Egypt and elsewhere, China is exploiting its formidable economic clout to expand its geopolitical influence, directing investment to woo governments that control vital assets.A traditional ally of the United States, Egypt controls the Suez Canal, a vital shipping passage where a threat to access could impede China\u2019s movement around the globe. In constructing a central piece of the futuristic capital, China is ingratiating itself with the canal\u2019s ultimate gatekeeper, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while rendering his grandest visions dependent on friendly relations with Beijing.How China became a superpowerChina\u2019s reach for commercial expansion along with diplomatic influence guides an array of Chinese undertakings, from rail networks and highways taking shape across Africa and Latin America to ports and power stations being constructed in Eastern Europe and South Asia. In Southeast Asia, Chinese entrepreneurs are engineering a crop of web companies just as China projects growing military power in the South China Sea.Little more than a decade ago, China\u2019s forays beyond its borders were mainly about bringing home energy, minerals and other resources, often from countries forsaken by the West as pariah states like Iran, Sudan and Myanmar. In foreign policy, China pursued a sole obsession \u2014 peeling off diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory. Even as China skirmished with neighbors over contested islands, it accepted the dominance of the United States Navy.Those days are over.Under the muscular leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has cast off previous restraints, rejecting deference to an American-dominated global order as an impediment to national revival. In matters of commerce and national security, China is competing with the United States, even in traditional American spheres of influence.From a Chinese perspective, this reordering is merely an overdue reversion to historical reality as Beijing demands consideration commensurate with its stature.In the telling of the ruling Communist Party, China\u2019s modern history is the story of Chinese mastery degraded by colonial depravity. China is the land that invented the compass, gunpowder, paper and printing, amassing stupendous wealth while Europe was still backward. Then came centuries of humiliation \u2014 Britain\u2019s profiting from forcing opium on the populace, Japanese brutality, demeaning lectures about human rights from hypocritical Americans. Now, China is intent on securing its own fate.\u201cChina wants to be a great power in the world,\u201d says Paul Heer, a former chief national intelligence officer in East Asia for the United States, who now teaches at George Washington University. \u201cThey think the rest of the world owes them recognition, and a return to what the Chinese see as their rightful place.\u201dNowhere are China\u2019s designs clearer than in Asia. China has overtaken the United States as the leading trading partner with Asian nations while pushing back against American naval primacy in the South China Sea. China is disrupting American alliances in the region, from Japan to Singapore to Australia.Beyond its backyard, China\u2019s ambitions are boundless. It celebrates its Belt and Road Initiative, a vast collection of infrastructure projects around the world, as the means of recreating the Silk Road, the trails navigated in ancient times by merchants carrying goods between Asia and Europe.\u201cXi Jinping is leading a China that has influences in all corners of the globe,\u201d says Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cThe 2008 financial crisis in the West was the turning point for China. Beijing started to embrace a triumphal mind-set, and pursued global leadership with new confidence on the back of the West\u2019s perceived flaws.\u201dChina\u2019s assertive role in world affairs is grounded in its domestic needs. It is at once spreading into new markets, generating fresh demand for its factory wares just as growth slows at home. It is projecting military strength and influence when the legitimacy of the Communist Party rests on bolstering economic fortunes and international esteem.Among its neighbors, China\u2019s rise provokes fears that an unwanted piece of history is being resurrected \u2014 the old tribute system that cemented China\u2019s status as the Middle Kingdom. For centuries, other nations bowed in recognition of China\u2019s imperial might, bestowing gifts on the emperor and accepting vassal status to secure trade and peace.For the Western powers whose order has prevailed since the end of World War II, China poses a foundational challenge. The United States and its victorious allies erected institutions that were \u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014 designed to keep the peace by promoting trade and fair competition. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have dispensed aid with conditions, though frequently drawing accusations that they have failed to comply with their standards on protecting human rights and the rule of law.China\u2019s investments come with no such strictures. China bankrolls autocrats who control geopolitically valuable real estate. China demands only that its companies gain a piece of the action while recipients eschew criticizing Beijing.China\u2019s challenge to the Western-dominated order is amplified by the reality that its primary architect, the United States, is now led by an avowed nationalist. As President Trump wages a trade war and derides international cooperation, he has generated doubts about the perseverance of the liberal democratic philosophy the United States has long championed.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the United States gives China this golden opportunity to portray itself as the defender of the international order,\u201d says Jessica Chen Weiss, a China expert at Cornell University.If the new Silk Road is in part about moving goods from Chinese factories to customers in the rest of the world, the trail seems certain to pass through Central and Eastern Europe.This reality frames the proceedings of the \u201c16-plus-1\u201d group, an economic bloc that China has forged with 16 Central and Eastern European nations. Its latest summit meeting convenes on a drizzly day in July in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Officials from the 16 governments \u2014 among them the newest, least-affluent members of the European Union \u2014 pose for photos with the delegation from China, the one nation wealthy and ambitious enough to finance their visions.Leaders in the rest of the European Union construe the group as a stealth assault on the rules and cohesion of their bloc. In offering financing for infrastructure projects, China has positioned itself as an alternative to European Union development funds.Europe\u2019s money comes with rules protecting labor and the environment, while requiring that projects be awarded to companies on the basis of competitive bidding to ensure fair competition. China tends to distribute its funds with far simpler demands: Chinese companies must gain work, free of competition, while Beijing secures an international ally.European Union officials are especially worried that Chinese money could weaken the pressure Europe is applying on members that have been breaching democratic norms. Europe has threatened to withhold development funds from Poland and Hungary as punishment for their turns toward authoritarianism. Both have packed courts with government-friendly judges and menaced the press.\u201cIt\u2019s a mutually beneficial cooperation based on mutual trust without any kind of attempts to interfere into domestic issues,\u201d Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, says in an interview before the summit meeting in Sofia.\u201cWe are talking about different conversations, concrete conversations related to infrastructure, and other conversations related to the level of democracy and human rights in China,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev of Bulgaria says in an interview the day before the event. \u201cIt would not be polite and constructive if we try to merge them into one.\u201dThe summit meeting convenes in a hulking convention center that harks back to era of Soviet domination. At a news conference, the Chinese and Bulgarian prime ministers offer assurances that the 16-plus-1 bloc does not aim to divide Europe.Mr. Li seeks to allay European worries that China poses a challenge to its rules. He promises that Chinese-financed projects will be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding.\u201cThere needs to be open and transparent tendering,\u201d the Chinese premier declares.But the Serbian prime minister, Ana Brnabic, has just undercut that assertion. Asked moments earlier about the high-speed rail from Belgrade to Budapest, she says Chinese companies have been promised construction work.\u201cChina is a strategic partner,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not putting out tenders.\u201dAs a currency crisis ravaged Indonesia two decades ago, angry mobs tore through West Jakarta, killing hundreds of ethnically Chinese merchants. Yet Cheng Tao, a Chinese software engineer turned venture capitalist, can look down from his high-rise office on the same neighborhood and see a tranquil center of Chinese life \u2014 grocery shops, restaurants and his own son\u2019s school.Mr. Cheng, 34, is part of an influx of young Chinese financiers, engineers and web designers who rent space in an area full of technology companies. He first came to Indonesia a decade ago with the Chinese telecom company Huawei. He and other veterans of large Chinese conglomerates are increasingly unleashing their own start-ups.\u201cTen years ago, there were no mainland Chinese here,\u201d Mr. Cheng says as he sips tea imported from China. \u201cWe see opportunities here that no longer exist in China.\u201dThe thriving Chinese start-up scene in a neighborhood once devastated by anti-Chinese terrorism illustrates China\u2019s deepening engagement in Southeast Asia. Only a few years ago, Chinese companies in the region were mainly focused on purchasing natural resources. Today, China is investing for the future, seeding innovative industries with money and brainpower.Last year, Chinese investors participated in funding rounds for Indonesian start-ups that accounted for 95 percent of the value of those companies, according to a survey by Google and A. T. Kearney, a global management company.\u201cChina is Indonesia\u2019s Silicon Valley,\u201d says Adrian Li, a venture capitalist who has a Stanford M.B.A. and moved to Jakarta from Beijing in 2014.China\u2019s place in Southeast Asia has proceeded deliberately, and just as the United States has ceded ground.While heads of state forge ties amid pageantry, Chinese businesses have been quietly yet persistently making inroads in Indonesia, guided by bottom-line concerns. At home, Chinese web companies are running out of new customers. Indonesia, a land of 260 million people, is adding more internet users than anywhere else on Earth.Jack Ma, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, was early to appreciate this reality, pouring major investments into local shopping start-ups, including $1.1 billion last year into Tokopedia, a thriving online marketplace. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this spring, the Tokopedia site drew 78 million people, a 70 percent increase from the previous month.Such potential fortifies Mr. Ma\u2019s determination to stay ahead of his biggest global competitor \u2014 Amazon. The American e-commerce company operates in Singapore but has yet to significantly penetrate Southeast Asia.Alibaba has put more than $3 billion into a former regional competitor, Lazada. Its Alipay digital payment system operates across Southeast Asia. Mr. Ma sits on advisory boards in the region that will help set standards and shape consumer perceptions, expanding China\u2019s traditional reach.Beyond money and clicks, China projects its power through a more traditional display of strength \u2014 military might.Alex Pama has watched it unfold from uncomfortable proximity. In the 1990s, when he was a junior officer in the Philippine Navy, he saw Chinese boats landing on Mischief Reef, a glorified collection of rocks claimed by the Philippines in the South China Sea. Chinese crews erected shelters to mark the territory, then began pouring concrete for larger buildings.The Philippines sought help from its former colonial overseer, the United States. But the Clinton administration demurred. The American Navy was still smarting over losing access to Subic Bay, its longtime base in the Philippines.That decision was a historic turning point, says Mr. Pama, who would rise to become admiral of the Philippine Navy. From then on, the United States shrank from the region, relinquishing the seas to China.\u201cThat\u2019s when the appeasement started,\u201d Mr. Pama says.Two decades later, President Xi ordered the buildup of Mischief Reef and other outcroppings in the Spratly archipelago into islands bristling with reconnaissance gear, aircraft hangars, runways, deepwater harbors and, most recently, short-range missiles. Those bases and China\u2019s maritime buildup have given Beijing effective control over one of the most heavily trafficked waterways on the planet.\u201cThe U.S. should have been more assertive back then and now,\u201d says Mr. Pama, now retired.Dominating the South China Sea and unseating the United States have become central objectives in Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to return China to glory. Last year, China for the first time staged aircraft carrier drills using advanced fighter jets in the South China Sea.China has presented these moves as defensive. But the United States and its Asian allies warn that Beijing has positioned itself to hold global trade hostage while diminishing the American presence. China\u2019s emergence as the region\u2019s dominant commercial power combined with its moves toward maritime supremacy has heightened the sense that a changing of the guard is underway.\u201cOver the long term, China\u2019s power and influence will undoubtedly weaken and ultimately abolish U.S. dominance in the region,\u201d says Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, who advises the government.The perspective gained momentum during the 2012 standoff at Scarborough Shoal, a horseshoe-shaped chain of reefs that is much closer to the Philippines than to China.As the Philippine Navy challenged Chinese fishing boats, the Obama administration brokered a deal in which both sides would withdraw. The Philippine vessels departed, but some of the Chinese boats stayed.China has controlled the shoal ever since. Emboldened, China began construction of seven artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago.China appears reluctant to build a full-fledged military base on the shoal, lest it stoke nationalist anger in the Philippines, damaging relations with its pro-China president, Rodrigo Duterte.\u201cAny reclamation will outrage the Duterte government,\u201d says Zhu Feng, the executive director of the Center for the South China Sea at Nanjing University. \u201cChina can\u2019t afford to lose a good friend like that.\u201dBut many Philippine officials fear that this is merely a pause before an inevitable Chinese expansion.Two large maps of the South China Sea cover the walls of the office of Gary Alejano, a Philippine congressman and former marine. He shows visitors how the Scarborough Shoal sits on the edge of the Bashi Channel, the Chinese Navy\u2019s entryway into the western Pacific. He points out the artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago. He notes Mischief Reef, where Chinese fighter jets have landed.Unless someone confronts them, those jets will remain there, using the hangars China built, Mr. Alejano says. Philippine Navy vessels rarely patrol the area, he laments.\u201cRight now, you can feel that China controls the South China Sea,\u201d Mr. Alejano says. \u201cAnd the U.S. comes in and out.\u201dAs China charts its global reach, six zones demand special attention: the maritime choke points.The entryway to the Black Sea from the Mediterranean. The passageway from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean via the Strait of Malacca. The corridor separating Europe from Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar. Bab el Mandeb, off Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. The Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Access to the Mediterranean from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal.At any one, an outbreak of hostilities could imperil China\u2019s free movement around the globe, jeopardizing its exports and access to resources.These zones have historically been policed by American naval power, which has made China\u2019s access dependent on peaceful relations with the United States. To liberate itself, China has been lavishing investment on governments that control the choke points.Which is how China became financier and developer for the grandiose capital being constructed by President Sisi in the reddish-brown desert east of Cairo. Mr. Sisi craves investment and allies at a time when much of the world has recoiled from his brutal crackdown on dissent.In an interview, Gen. Ahmed Zaki Abdeen, who heads the Egyptian state-owned company overseeing the new capital, railed against American reluctance to invest in his country.\u201cStop talking to us about human rights,\u201d he says. \u201cCome and do business with us. The Chinese are coming \u2014 they are seeking win-win situations. Welcome to the Chinese.\u201dIn backing the new capital, China has furthered an age-old aspiration for the Egyptian powers that be: taming the desert. The project aims to construct a city of 6.5 million people, replacing crumbling Cairo with a technological metropolis engineered to rival Dubai. Construction is expected to take 15 years while costing 200 billion Egyptian pounds, more than $11 billion.Under a master agreement signed in October 2017, China Construction is building the capital\u2019s central business district. A consortium of Chinese state-owned banks is lending $3 billion to finance a first phase expected to be completed in three years. Egypt is obligated to spend the money by hiring the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. A second phase is expected to run $3.2 billion.Yu Wenchuan dons a yellow safety vest as he works security at the China Construction site. Born and raised in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, Mr. Yu, 24, complains about the 100-degree heat and the conspicuous absence of spicy noodles. But he is resigned to spending the next eight years in Egypt.\u201cThis is a good way to get experience,\u201d he says.Under the contract, 35 percent of construction materials can be brought from China. Even some of the 65 percent procured from domestic sources stands to enrich China, given the presence of entrepreneurs like Xin Zhu.Seventeen years have passed since Mr. Xin landed in Cairo from his native Hubei Province. There, he oversaw a factory that processed slabs of granite and marble into flooring and countertops. He had heard that Egypt was rich with quarries full of high-quality, low-priced rock.He took control of a lot in an industrial area outside Cairo. He endured terrible roads and power failures. \u201cI was like a pioneer,\u201d he says.Today, Mr. Xin\u2019s company employs more than 100 people, mostly migrants from China. He ships most of his production to China. But he aims to sell into the new capital, profiting as Beijing erects a veritable Pharaonic monument for Egypt\u2019s authoritarian leader.\u201cI was looking for new opportunities outside China,\u201d Mr. Xin says. \u201cMore development is good for our business.\u201dDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaMore China RulesDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaAdvertisement"}

Best of luck, pal, what with the long longed-for second season of the Emmy-winning \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d set for release on Dec. 5.\u201cI was just in London, it was nighttime, I had a baseball cap on and more of a beard than I have now, and from half a block away, someone asked, \u2018Are you Mr. Maisel?\u2019\u201d Mr. Zegen recalled. \u201cI\u2019ll be walking down the street in my neighborhood, and people will say, \u2018That looks like Mr. Maisel.\u2019\u201d In the summer of 2010, Mr. Zegen co-starred with John Larroquette in a play downtown, at the Cherry Lane Theater, and was captivated by the neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019d never really explored the West Village before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had always seemed confusing to me, because it\u2019s not on a grid. But I fell in love with the area and knew I wanted to live down here.\u201dActorHe searched almost daily with a broker for two months. All the apartments he saw had three things in common: They were too small; they were too dark; they were too expensive. \u201cI had been living in pretty decent one-bedrooms, and I wasn\u2019t going to trade down just for location,\u201d Mr. Zegen said.Just before New Year\u2019s Eve eight years ago, he answered an ad on Craigslist for a one-bedroom: no broker\u2019s fee; $500 cheaper than any other place he\u2019d eyeballed; reasonably sunny; recently renovated because the previous occupant was the daughter of the building\u2019s owner. Mr. Zegen, who looks young enough that he probably still gets chucked on the chin by a passel of aunts at family dinners, is still waiting to hear the catch. \u201cThe elevator is slow. That\u2019s one of the drawbacks,\u201d he conceded. \u201cThere is no laundry in the building, but you weigh the pros and cons\u2026.\u201dYou don\u2019t need to spend much time in the apartment to learn that Mr. Zegen is a hunter and gatherer of no mean talent, a gift he said he inherited from his mother, a habitu\u00e9 of garage, estate and yard sales, who scored the red-and-black rug on the floor in the living room.Pre-owned T-shirts sit in tall, tottering stacks in the bedroom. Mr. Zegen scoops them up in vast quantities at thrift shops, he said, \u201cbut I wash them before I wear them.\u201d (Mom would be proud.) The shelf atop the desk is crowded with toys and figurines, among them an orange Snoopy, a robot and a lead cat that, as best as Mr. Zegen can tell, was given to audience members on March 20, 1894, to commemorate the 100th performance of the Broadway production of \u201cCharley\u2019s Aunt.\u201d\u201cI collect a little theater memorabilia, so that\u2019s cool,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom when I was a little kid, I\u2019ve been into knickknacks. Tchotchkes make me feel good for whatever reason.\u201d He must feel very good.The furniture is of the hand-me-down variety, but with some nice history. The table in the kitchen is from a diner that Mr. Zegen\u2019s maternal grandfather owned near Madison Square Garden. The off-white, curved sectional \u2014 partly covered by a red blanket borrowed, that is to say lifted, from the set of \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d (but don\u2019t tell) \u2014 has its own story and is also very comfortable. Mr. Zegen falls asleep on it nightly while watching television.A dozen years ago, his father, a lawyer, was involved with the estate of a woman with many heirlooms but few heirs.

{"Headline": "Will Amazon Ruin or Revitalize New York City?", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York\u2019s not ready for Amazon\u2019s HQ2, but here\u2019s how the city can get there.After a nationwide campaign, Amazon selected Long Island City in New York as one of two locations for expanding its headquarters. The company\u2019s decisions about whom it hires and how quickly, and where those workers choose to live, will affect how much the expansion changes the city. Jenny Schuetz from the Brookings Institution and Elizabeth Goldstein from the Municipal Art Society offer two views on how to prepare.Ms. Schuetz is a fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program.Business, manufacturing and commercial zonesResidential and other zonesQUEENSMANHATTANAmazon\u2019sexistingManhattanofficeAmazon\u2019sproposedlocationGoogle\u2019sofficeTwitter\u2019sofficeFacebook\u2019sofficeBROOKLYNNew York1 MILEBusiness, manufacturing and commercial zonesResidential and other zonesMANHATTANQUEENSAmazon\u2019sexistingManhattanofficeAmazon\u2019sproposedlocationGoogle\u2019sofficeTwitter\u2019sofficeFacebook\u2019sofficeBROOKLYNNew York1 MILEBy The New York TimesWith Amazon\u2019s HQ2 announcement, residents of Long Island City, Queens, are worried that the rapid growth in housing prices that has plagued the South Lake Union area of Seattle, where Amazon has its headquarters, will soon come to their neighborhood.They certainly have cause for worry: The steepest increases in housing prices in Seattle have occurred in the past five years as Amazon has rapidly expanded. The expected buildup for Amazon\u2019s HQ2 outpost in New York, 25,000 employees over 10 years starting next year, mirrors the company\u2019s recent growth in Seattle.But there are no indications that the impact on New York will be apocalyptic. First, the number of jobs is small relative to the city\u2019s labor market and population. Second, Long Island City is better equipped than many parts of the city to accommodate a corporate campus and the additional office space, housing and services it would require. The neighborhood\u2019s zoning rules allow for taller buildings than in areas like, say, brownstone Brooklyn.Still, there are many unknowns.How many of Amazon\u2019s highly paid employees will want to live close to the campus? Young workers without children are likely to prefer living within one or two miles of the office, driving demand for studio and one-bedroom rental apartments, and amenities such as coffee shops, restaurants and bike paths.By contrast, highly paid employees with school-aged children are more willing to tolerate longer commutes to live in neighborhoods with larger apartments, high-performing public schools and family-friendly parks, such as TriBeCa, Carroll Gardens and Jackson Heights.Another question is how many lower-paid employees Amazon plans to hire. Administrative assistants and maintenance staff workers will earn much less than the $150,000 average salary Amazon promises for HQ2. The proposed campus is near the nation\u2019s largest public housing development, Queensbridge Houses, and the community district that includes Long Island City has nearly 19,000 subsidized housing units. But low- and moderate-income workers who don\u2019t already live in subsidized or rent-stabilized apartments may get priced out of the area.The city needs to build more housing, more cheaply, especially in affluent neighborhoods closer to business districts. The aging and dwindling supply of subsidized and rent-stabilized units will require infusions of public resources to remain habitable and affordable.Finally, it\u2019s not yet known how many current city residents Amazon will hire. If it recruits engineers from Google or Twitter in Chelsea, or from Facebook near Union Square, that won\u2019t create demand for new apartments, although those engineers might move to shorten their commutes.With so much unknown, the city and the state can make smart choices now by investing in more housing, school capacity and upgraded transit citywide.Ms. Goldstein is the president of the Municipal Art Society.Queensbridge Houses,the nation\u2019s largestpublic housing projectQUEENSAnable Basin,proposed locationfor Amazon\u2019s HQ2SPECIALPURPOSEDISTRICTEast RiverThe Special Long IslandCity Mixed Use Districtallows for taller buildingsand greater densityP.S. 78,which isalreadyat 131%capacity1,000 FEETQueensbridge Houses,the nation\u2019s largestpublic housing projectEast RiverQUEENSAnable Basin,proposed locationfor Amazon\u2019s HQ2SPECIALPURPOSEDISTRICTP.S. 78,which isalreadyat 131%capacityThe Special Long Island City Mixed Use District allows for taller buildings and greater density1,000 FEETNote: Area boundaries approximate. Sources: City of New York; Municipal Art Society of New York | By The New York TimesTo Jeff Bezos, I want to say, \u201cWelcome to Queens!\u201d I want to tell you more about the neighborhood you and Amazon are moving into.Long Island City is an exhilarating, diverse and rapidly growing community. Much of this growth was the result of a 2001 rezoning in which the city sought to spur commercial development in what had been a manufacturing area. But a boom in commercial development is not what we got.Instead, the zoning changes led to the construction of 10,000 new residential units, vastly more than the 300 projected, according to the Municipal Art Society\u2019s latest report. Residential neighborhoods need things that commercial districts do not, and it turns out that if you underestimate the number of new residences by more than 3,200 percent, something has to give.Your arrival may indeed catalyze the central business district envisioned in 2001. But Long Island City is now a primarily residential neighborhood with critical needs that must be addressed.Today, seven out of nine elementary schools in Long Island City are overcrowded; one of them operates at 212 percent of capacity. Ridership at the neighborhood\u2019s two subway stations, Court Square and Queensboro Plaza, has increased at seven times the citywide rate.With one-third of an acre of open space for every 1,000 people, Long Island City residents enjoy only one-fifth of the median open space available to New Yorkers. And the Anable Basin, on which Amazon\u2019s proposed campus sits, is within a federally designated high-risk flood zone.Meanwhile, median household income in Long Island City jumped to $123,000 from $53,000 from 2000 to 2016. The housing that has been built is largely high-end luxury, out of range for the average New Yorker.Even the affordable units planned as part of a recent rezoning of Anable Basin now appear to be in jeopardy, as the site will instead be used to create office space for as many as 25,000 Amazon workers.The company cannot insulate itself from the difficulties facing this neighborhood by relying on the same campus model used in Seattle and Silicon Valley. A self-contained office park is a distinctly un-New York concept. Amazon employees may want to live in Long Island City to be close to work, and the fragile state of mass transit and overburdened schools will be an everyday issue. Amazon won\u2019t be able to ignore the subway crisis with corporate shuttle buses.Mr. Bezos, your influence over the politics of New York is enormous right now. Our governor and mayor spent months to win you over, and your satisfaction is important to them.But you will also have to contend with a large and diverse City Council that has so far been cut out of the process that brought you here. Will you choose to leverage that attention to demand long overdue relief for the residents of this neighborhood, and work with our local leaders to build a vision for a strong city of the future?Elizabeth Goldstein is the president of the Municipal Art Society.

An essay on the relationship between feeling comfortable in your clothes and feeling comfortable in your skin is buoyant and effective. \u201cIt was like tucking in my shirt was me coming out as queer, to myself,\u201d she writes.

A stopover in Sedona, Ariz., where \u201ca 10-year-old computer camera, Velcro\u2019d to the screen of an old Dell desktop,\u201d photographs her aura, is a strange, surprising set piece. Her assessment of vertical indoor gardens is the only assessment of vertical indoor gardens I care to read: \u201cI bet if you have one of these wall plants, it suddenly becomes the most significant thing about you.\u201dBut not every roadside attraction is a must-see. The drawings of figs and protein bars and David Bowie record covers interspersed throughout the book give the impression of twee jetsam. It seems like artistic malpractice \u2014 or the setup to a joke about millennials \u2014 to drive through the Blue Ridge Mountains and put pencil to paper to capture the spectacular natural beauty of \u2026 an episode of \u201cThe West Wing\u201d she\u2019s just watched on an iPad.When it comes to improv, I generally want out. I have never done it, and barring some sort of strange punishment handed down by the state, I never will.

Such is the appeal of this slim travelogue.That said, not even Jacobson possesses the literary prowess or the personality that would be required to sell readers on a minute-by-minute breakdown of insomnia. \u201c1:18 a.m. Go to sleep right now. Just. Go. To. Sleep,\u201d she logs. \u201c1:49 a.m. O.K.

Maybe because she\u2019s had some practice. Back in college, she decided to send letters to 20 strangers in 20 cities and \u201cshared something personal with each of them, a story about myself that was in some way associated with where they lived.\u201d She invited the recipients to do the same.There was but a single reply, but \u201cthat one letter was enough\u201d for her. Jacobson was seeking to establish a \u201csmall, meaningful connection with a stranger,\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what she did. And that is exactly what she\u2019s done here, with each one of her readers.Juli Weiner is a staff writer for HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Robots Ring the Bell", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis clever, eye-catching gesture was aimed to show the world how easy \u2014 and increasingly common \u2014 it is for humans to work alongside robots.\u201cIt was symbolic,\u201d said Travis Briggs, chief executive of Robo Global\u2019s operations in the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re in the first inning of this transition to automation and artificial intelligence, and there is a massive amount of growth potential.\u201dIndeed, robotics and automation are no longer viewed as a passing fad or a cool technology for geeks to gush over. Instead, more companies are turning to artificial intelligence to boost productivity and stay relevant in a fiercely competitive market. Experts call it the fourth industrial revolution and compare today\u2019s robotics in the workplace to the early days of the internet.At a recent conference hosted by Robo Global, experts showed photos and videos of robotic prototypes of all shapes and sizes: Robots that climb stairs and around corners to find an object and A.I.-laced pills that can retrieve foreign objects from a person\u2019s stomach. They even included a video of a woman, with electrodes attached to her head, using thoughts to tell a robot where to place an object.\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see robots and automated systems penetrate every sector of the economy,\u201d said Jeremie Capron, director of research at Robo Global. \u201cThe pace of change is really accelerating, so, yes, it\u2019s a revolution.\u201dRobo Global, which researches, advises and invests in robotics, automation and A.I. companies, knows all about the sector\u2019s growth. Since setting up its Robo Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF (Robo), which tracks more than 80 companies, the corporation reports that its assets have soared to $3.46 billion from $43 million its first year.\u201c\u2018Terminator\u2019 and those kinds of images have a significant impact on the way people perceive technology,\u201d said Raffaello D\u2019Andrea, professor of dynamic systems and control at ETH Zurich University, and a co-founder of Kiva Systems, a robotics company that was sold to Amazon.The retail giant Amazon was one of the earliest to embrace this technology, with its $775 million acquisition of Kiva \u2014 now called Amazon Robotics \u2014 in 2012. Amazon had been under pressure to deliver orders to its Amazon Prime customers within the promised 48-hour window without losing money, Mr. Capron said. Amazon immediately deployed 3,000 robots into its fulfillment centers.\u201cWe need advanced technology and automation to meet customer demand \u2014 it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics.The robots wander up and down the aisles, bringing shelves of items directly to associates to package and ship, significantly slashing costs and shortening the time to process and deliver an order. Today, Amazon has more than 100,000 robots navigating 26 fulfillment centers around the world.\u201cAmazon delivered more than five billion items under two business days in 2017 to their Prime program members, based on our research, including discussions with Amazon Robotics,\u201d Mr. Capron said. All of this bolstered customer loyalty and demand, resulting in more orders, sales revenue and jobs.Mr. Brady said it was a myth that automation always destroys jobs.\u201cSince the acquisition of Kiva, we\u2019ve added 300,000 full-time jobs globally,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year alone, we added 130,000.\u201dAll Axls Machining, a business in Dallas, was struggling to find enough workers to operate its metal-fabrication equipment and to sand and inspect metal parts manually for the medical, aerospace, defense and industrial sectors.Without workers to run the machines and the assembly lines, production lagged. \u201cAfter 5 p.m., we\u2019d have a skeleton shift, with only half the machines running,\u201d said Gary Kuzmin, the company\u2019s owner. \u201cIt was costing me orders that I couldn\u2019t get to my customers on time.\u201dBut then Mr. Kuzmin discovered Universal Robots, which makes collaborative robots, or cobots, which are small, affordable and designed to operate safely side by side with workers. They are easy to program to do multiple tasks and allow the company to crank out parts around the clock.After introducing the robots, one job that was expected to take six months to complete was finished in less than half that time, Mr. Kuzmin said. \u201cWe saw a 60 percent profit increase on that job alone.\u201dMr. Kuzmin said the increased productivity allowed him to hire \u2014 rather than fire \u2014 more workers, boosting his work force to 22 from 16.\u201cWe had a lot of people who would come in, work for maybe a week, and then leave because they didn\u2019t like the repetitive work environment,\u201d said Tim Mead, operations manager at Zippertubing. It brought in Universal Robots\u2019 cobots and immediately saw productivity surge.\u201cIt used to take three people to do all of the operations that the robot now does,\u201d Mr. Mead saidThe robots have also increased the company\u2019s accuracy in spotting faulty manufactured parts. When operators look at thousands of parts a day, they sometimes become \u201csnow-blind\u201d to defects, Mr. Mead said. But that never happens to robots.In certain sectors \u2014 consumer electronics, automobile manufacturing and logistics \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re moving into an era where automation has really gone from a competitive advantage right now to absolutely necessary,\u201d Mr. Briggs said. \u201cAutomate or fail.\u201dAll of this has stoked fears, especially among Americans, that robots, automation and A.I. will throw millions of people onto the unemployment line.Some industry experts play down these concerns, saying that in any industrial revolution, jobs are lost and new ones created.\u201cFifty years ago, or even 15 years ago, who knew what an app developer was, or the amount of programming that we\u2019d need,\u201d Mr. Briggs said.Over the next decade, the biggest job losses will most likely affect low-skilled workers performing repetitive tasks, like machine operators, assembly line workers, dishwashers, drivers and preparers of fast food. Certain white-collar areas, like data entry, accounting and payroll, will suffer as well.Demand, however, will probably surge for data analysts, software developers, web designers, IT experts, e-commerce specialists, health care providers, entrepreneurs and social media experts, according to the World Economic Forum report. Sectors that involve human skills, like sales, marketing, customer service and even art and entertainment, will also be in high demand, the report said.While new jobs will offset losses, retraining and education will be critical. As many as 375 million workers globally will need to change job categories and learn new skills to survive the transition, according to the McKinsey Global Institute report.\u201cThe days are gone where somebody learns to do a task, and that\u2019s what they do for the rest of their life,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Andrea said.How quickly and how deeply A.I. and robotics penetrate the job market will ultimately dictate how rapidly people need to be retrained.\u201cHistory tells me that every prior technological revolution has resulted in more wealth and more jobs,\u201d Mr. Capron said. \u201cSo it would have to be very different this time around for history not to repeat itself.\u201dBut A.I. has its critics. The visionary billionaire Elon Musk has described it as humanity\u2019s \u201cbiggest existential threat,\u201d while the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who died this year, predicted that \u201cthe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\u201d Mr. Musk is particularly concerned about the use of A.I. to develop autonomous lethal weapons that could select targets without human intervention \u2014 a development with potentially apocalyptic repercussions.Mr. D\u2019Andrea said A.I. was a long way off from being a real threat. He does believe, however, that regulations will be needed to safeguard its use in autonomous weapons.Mr. Briggs was less concerned. \u201cI think Elon Musk is being overly dramatic,\u201d he said, noting that he did not believe that A.I. should be regulated. \u201cI think regulation is a slippery slope \u2014 it certainly stifles creativity.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the company that owns a robot that rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange. It is owned by Universal Robots, not by Robo Global.In an earlier version of this article, the second reference to a professor at ETH Zurich University and co-founder of Kiva Systems, a robotics company, was incorrect.

{"Headline": "A $2 Billion Question: Did New York and Virginia Overpay for Amazon?", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon built a retail empire on low prices and free shipping. But for taxpayers, its new headquarters didn\u2019t come cheap.New York and Virginia collectively offered more than $2 billion in tax credits, rebates and other incentives to attract the company. That figure doesn\u2019t include what could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure spending, worker training and other government assistance.Economists have long criticized tax incentives as inefficient and unnecessary, arguing that they pit cities or states against each other and leave less money for education and public works that ultimately do more to lift local economies and improve livelihoods. Research has shown that incentives play at most a small role in corporate decisions, meaning governments often end up paying businesses to do what they would have done anyway.Indeed, in selecting New York and Virginia for its new locations, Amazon turned down seemingly richer offers just next door. Maryland and New Jersey each offered multibillion-dollar incentive packages that dwarfed the ones Amazon accepted.\u201cAn additional $7.5 billion in subsidies wasn\u2019t enough to get Amazon to move across the river,\u201d said Michael Farren, an economist at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank, referring to the difference between Maryland\u2019s offer of $8.5 billion and Virginia\u2019s of less than $1 billion. \u201cThat just says that subsidies were never what mattered in the first place.\u201d[Do you live or work near Amazon\u2019s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]New York\u2019s incentive package is much larger than Virginia\u2019s. Amazon promised to create about 25,000 jobs at each location, but New York offered twice as much as Virginia did.\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing we said,\u201d said Maria Doulis, vice president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, which has offices in New York City and Albany. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Wait, you\u2019re splitting this down the middle \u2014 why does it look like we\u2019re paying so much?\u2019 \u201dVirginia promised Amazon an incentive package worth $573 million, including $550 million in cash grants \u2014 $22,000 per job. The state also pledged $250 million to help Virginia Tech build a campus in Alexandria, near the Amazon site in Arlington, offering degrees in computer science and software engineering. (Virginia, too, offered to help the company get a helipad.)On a per-job basis, New York\u2019s offer to Amazon is about typical for the state but well above the national average for such deals, said Timothy J. Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has studied tax incentives.\u201cNew York\u2019s following its usual practices,\u201d Mr. Bartik said. \u201cIt hands out a lot of hefty incentives, a lot of long-term incentives.\u201dGov. Andrew Cuomo defended the deal, arguing that New York has to offer incentives because of its comparatively high taxes. At 6.5 percent, New York\u2019s corporate income-tax rate is only modestly higher than Virginia\u2019s 6 percent, according to the Tax Foundation. But other business and individual taxes are higher in New York.\u201cIt\u2019s not a level playing field to begin with,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cAll things being equal, if we do nothing, they\u2019re going to Texas.\u201dNew York City did not offer any special tax breaks to Amazon as part of the deal. But the company will be able to take advantage of existing city tax credits, including a program designed to encourage companies to create jobs outside the busiest parts of Manhattan. The program, open to all companies, could be worth as much as $900 million to Amazon over 12 years, on top of the state incentives.Ms. Doulis, of the Citizens Budget Commission, said that credit and similar ones might have outlived their usefulness. In the 1980s and \u201990s, she said, companies were taking a risk by expanding in Queens or Brooklyn, and tax breaks provided an important inducement. But today, Long Island City is a rapidly developing neighborhood full of hip bars and luxury apartment complexes.\u201cThat neighborhood was very different 25 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very different world now.\u201dStill, Ms. Doulis said Amazon\u2019s arrival was a major coup for the city, which has been trying to establish itself as a tech hub to rival Boston, Seattle and even Silicon Valley. Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday said Amazon\u2019s decision was a vindication of that strategy, which the mayor said would benefit all New Yorkers.Tom Stringer, who advises companies on site-selection decisions for the consulting firm BDO, said high-cost places like New York and Virginia needed to offer incentives to compete with cheaper areas. And he said the deals would pay off in the long run in jobs and tax revenues.\u201cIncentives are not subsidies,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cThey are investments.\u201dThat could be a particularly bitter pill for local retailers, many already struggling to compete with Amazon, said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy group long critical of Amazon.\u201cIf you\u2019re a local retailer or small manufacturer or artist or writer or publisher, you\u2019re watching as your city and state hands your tax dollars to your most ferocious antagonist,\u201d she said.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who will represent parts of Queens in the House of Representatives starting in January, was one of several elected officials to criticize the deal. In a series of posts on Twitter, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said a company of Amazon\u2019s size shouldn\u2019t \u201creceive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment.\u201dBut even many critics of tax incentives said the packages offered to Amazon were less egregious than some past examples. The New York and Virginia tax credits are tied to the number of jobs the company actually creates.On a per-job basis, the packages offered to Amazon are smaller than some previous megadeals. For example, Wisconsin last year offered the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn $3 billion in incentives for a project meant to employ 13,000 workers, at wages far lower than those promised by Amazon. The Foxconn deal, which has since grown even more expensive, has produced a public backlash in Wisconsin.There are signs that Amazon may have been concerned about a similar reaction. The company didn\u2019t choose the biggest incentive packages on offer, and in an unusual move, it included details of the tax breaks in its news release. And Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, noted that Amazon conducted the final stages of its search behind closed doors after a much more public search earlier in the process.\u201cThey would have had another whole wave of blowback if they\u2019d had another hunger games,\u201d Mr. LeRoy said.J.

{"Headline": "What I Learned From Tracking My Spending for a Month", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryone knows to watch their spending: A mistake can mean the difference between making or bouncing the rent check. I tracked my spending meticulously for a month. Here\u2019s what I learned.Earlier this year, I vowed to track my spending for a month, the same way you might track your food intake if you\u2019re trying to change your diet. Tracking your spending is nothing new, and money advice you\u2019ve probably heard before. Maybe, like me, you\u2019ve ignored this advice because you didn\u2019t see the point. I figured I already had a pretty good idea of what my spending looked like. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m some shopaholic who can\u2019t walk past a J. Crew without whipping out a credit card, and I know enough about my expenses to know when I have enough to pay the bills, and when I\u2019m in trouble.I decided to finally heed that basic money advice and start writing down my purchases, as an experiment if nothing else. It was a simple exercise, but a powerful one. And it taught me a few lessons about the way many of us spend money.Spending is often the default for most of us \u2014 the first solution to any given problem. Need to get in shape? Buy a treadmill you\u2019ll never use. Want to feel better about the way you look? Head into Bloomingdale\u2019s and buy some self-confidence in the form of a new wardrobe. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with spending, but it can become so second-nature that we often don\u2019t even realize we\u2019re doing it, and it\u2019s especially easy when you shop online.The simple chore of writing down every purchase, physically, with pen and paper, forced me to think before buying. This short pause made me more aware of how I use money, which is often as a knee-jerk solution. For example, I wanted to learn more about Ecuador before I visited, so I found a travel guide on Amazon and hit the buy button. Problem solved. Again, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this, really, but it didn\u2019t even occur to me to perhaps borrow the book or buy it used. Spending was the easy solution.But when I paid attention to the purchases I was tempted to make, I soon realized half the things I buy are mindless, impulsive items. Sure, I budget and pay myself first, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m spending my money in the best way possible. I could be saving more for retirement. I could be saving more for travel. When you\u2019re more conscious with your spending, you might be surprised at how much more room you can create in your budget. It almost makes budgeting unnecessary because you spend less by design, and no longer need guidelines.\u201cAfter the month is up, figure out what you spent on a daily, weekly and monthly basis and determine if that felt high, low or just right,\u201d Ms. McLay suggested.From there, challenge yourself to spend less in the following month. It\u2019s not an exercise you have to keep up with forever, but tracking is a good way to reset your spending habits and make sure you\u2019re aware of how you spend. And that\u2019s really the goal of the exercise: awareness. It\u2019s to simply spend your hard-earned money with a little more thought. It isn\u2019t to say you\u2019ll never give into another impulsive purchase again. For that, Ms. McLay suggested giving yourself a small cushion for surprises. Again, budgeting isn\u2019t foolproof, but balance is important. Plan for your impulsive spending in advance to keep it tame, but track your purchases every now and then to reset your habits. You might be surprised at the things you\u2019re tempted to buy when you start keeping track.Advertisement"}

But Ms. Mark-Viverito\u2019s entrance into the race \u201cchallenges the conventional wisdom that Williams has an inside track and the presumption that he has a clear shot at dominating the progressive votes,\u201d Mr. Gyory said.Another former City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, has announced that she will not run, which opens up a lane for Ms. Mark-Viverito to go after the women\u2019s vote, said Christina M. Greer, a professor of political science at Fordham University. But because there are other women in the race, that won\u2019t be easy.\u201cThe trick will be finding an issue that resonates with voters that is unique to her and gives her a voice,\u201d Professor Greer said. \u201cIn a short period of time when all the candidates are trying to introduce themselves to voters, she has to reintroduce herself.\u201dThe office will be open in January because the current public advocate, Letitia James, won election as attorney general. Mr. de Blasio will call for a nonpartisan special election in early 2019. The winner will fill the seat until a primary and general election are held in September and November to fulfill the remainder of Ms. James\u2019s term, which runs until the end of 2021.The public advocate presides over City Council meetings and can introduce legislation but has few official responsibilities. The office is seen as a public ombudsman but largely serves as a launching pad for higher office.Asked if she is interested in running for mayor in 2021, Ms. Mark-Viverito would only say: \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent focused on this at the moment. I\u2019m not focused on anything else.\u201dIf she wins, Ms. Mark-Viverito said she would seek guidance from the public on the issues she should tackle, and then use her experience as Council speaker to create consensus around how to deal with those issues.\u201cWhen the governor or the mayor or even the police commissioner would say things can\u2019t get done, I was able to bring elected officials and activists to the table,\u201d she said.In her speech, an advance copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, Ms. Mark-Viverito spoke of a \u201cleadership vacuum in this city,\u201d using a smattering of Spanish, and liberally taking shots at the mayor and the governor.\u201cOur elected officials keep telling us the subway is getting better. They keep saying affordable housing is growing. They keep saying Nycha repairs are speeding up,\u201d Ms. Mark-Viverito stated in the prepared remarks, referring in part to the New York City Housing Authority.\u201cBut we don\u2019t see the changes, right? Are we crazy \u2014 or are they lying?\u201dMs. Mark-Viverito has already been critical of the plan to provide Amazon with public subsidies to put a headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, even though she had signed a letter supporting its move here in 2017. The letter that she signed does not call for providing public subsidies or skipping the city\u2019s land-use review process, she said.She said she would not hesitate to call out the mayor or governor, or to even get in the middle of their well-publicized feud.\u201cWe want our elected officials to stop the infighting and just figure out how to get things done,\u201d Ms. Mark-Viverito said.Advertisement"}

But the festival remains the pre-eminent showcase for American independent film. The past festival\u2019s lineup included multiple films that helped define the year in art-house cinema, including \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d \u201cLeave No Trace\u201d and the documentaries \u201cRBG\u201d and \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?\u201dIt is anyone\u2019s guess what movies will break out at the coming festival, which will run from Jan. 24 to Feb. 3. But one good bet is \u201cLate Night,\u201d a sassy comedy starring Emma Thompson as a legendary late-night talk-show host who \u2014 to smooth over diversity concerns \u2014 hires her only female staff writer, played by Mindy Kaling. \u201cLate Night\u201d was directed by the newcomer Nisha Ganatra from a screenplay by Kaling.Other established stars pepper the selections. Davis and Allison Janney anchor \u201cTroupe Zero,\u201d an Amazon Studios comedy about a misfit girl in rural 1977 Georgia who forms a makeshift Girl Scout-style group. Jake Gyllenhaal reteams with his \u201cNightcrawler\u201d director, Dan Gilroy, for an art-world horror thriller called \u201cVelvet Buzzsaw.\u201d And Chiwetel Ejiofor directed, wrote and stars in \u201cThe Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,\u201d the true story of a Malawian boy whose invention saved his village from famine.As ever, documentaries will give Sundance much of its heat. Progressive-leaning festivalgoers, for instance, will undoubtedly rally behind \u201cKnock Down the House,\u201d a documentary from Rachel Lears that follows insurgent political candidates, including Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected Democratic congresswoman from Queens.Here are five other films that stand out:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Near the Border, Beto Talks Immigration", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Politics With Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.In the White House, President Trump warned of an immigration \u201ccrisis\u201d \u2014 that a caravan of criminal migrants bringing drugs to the country had \u201cviolently overrun\u201d Mexico, and that the U.S. was on the verge of an \u201cinvasion.\u201dAt the same moment, less than two miles from the southern border, the Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke had another message: \u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time for us to be alive, to be from Texas and to be from the U.S.-Mexico border,\u201d he told voters in Brownsville, Tex.Mr. O\u2019Rourke is determined to tell another story, no matter what the president decides to say. The two men spoke simultaneously this afternoon, both delivering remarks intended to juice their midterm turnout.Every few hours or so, it seems, Mr. Trump says something to try and turn the final days of this campaign into a referendum on immigration.Why Mr. Trump is pushing the issue is obvious: Polls show it animates his base.What\u2019s less clear is how Democrats respond. It\u2019s an issue that illustrates, yet again, how the party is trying to find their way in the Trump era.Not having a national message isn\u2019t a major problem in a midterm election, where candidates benefit from having the room to take positions tailored to their states. But it\u2019s a dilemma that will quickly become central to the party\u2019s fortunes in 2020.Several candidates running in competitive Midwestern races have become nearly Trump Lite on immigration. Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri urged Mr. Trump to \u201cuse every tool he has at his disposal\u201d to halt the caravan of migrants, adding, \u201cI 100 percent back him up on that.\u201dPhil Bredesen, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Tennessee, released an ad on Tuesday promoting his decision to deploy the Tennessee National Guard to the southern border.Mr. O\u2019Rourke offers a different model. In Brownsville, where I spent my afternoon covering his rally, he never mentioned the president\u2019s name, saying he hadn\u2019t seen Mr. Trump\u2019s new ad. Instead, he cast the current moment in sweeping, historical terms, comparing it to the civil rights movement.\u201cWe, the people of Texas, came together for this country at the moment when it counted the most,\u201d he told the cheering crowd gathered in a historic civic center.\u201cThis desire to stir paranoia and fear on the part of the American public is a political ploy,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThe people of Texas need to remember that. We don\u2019t need troops on the border.\u201dShortly after he spoke, The Associated Press reported that the first hundred troops had arrived at the border.Those kinds of comments are a key part of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s brand. Obsessed with authenticity, he is saying things \u2014 like defending the N.F.L. protests or pushing for gun control \u2014 that might seem out of step in deep-red Texas.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s brand of unabashed liberalism \u2014 a model embraced by Andrew Gillum, the nominee for governor in Florida, and, to a lesser extent, by Stacey Abrams, the nominee for governor in Georgia \u2014 tests whether, in the Trump era, the answer for Democrats can be found to the left.It\u2019s certainly a way to raise tons of money. But will it be enough to counteract a president who is willing to stoke his supporters\u2019 biggest fears to drive them to the polls? We\u2019ll know in five days.____________________Following the recent horrific streak of terrorism, the president was caught between the roles of national conciliator and Republican partisan. Our opinion writers \u2014 left and right \u2014 agreed that, with eyes on Election Day, he too eagerly embraced the latter and not the former.Most people believe Republicans will hold the Senate. For the House, sitting presidents typically lose House seats, and this year appears to be no exception.By this time next week, the 2018 elections will be over. This weekend in Sunday Review, we are planning to run pieces looking ahead to 2020. President Trump is never far from the conversation.Read more political writing from the Opinion section here.____________________You can see all our polling here.________________________________________And the winner of our First Annual On Politics Halloween Costume Contest is \u2026Carter in California!

She was sleeping in her Honda Fit and he in the green rusty van he called home at the time.

{"Headline": "Missing From Top Colleges: Veterans", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut several universities are now promising to do better.Opinion ColumnistCornell, which now has about 40 veterans among its undergraduates, plans to raise that number to 100 by 2020, for example. Indiana University, the University of Michigan and Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania also said they would increase their numbers. And the College Board announced it would make it easier for colleges to identify veterans with solid standardized-test scores.The good news is that the veterans who do enroll in strong four-year colleges tend to do very well. They have higher grades and graduation rates than average. Recruiting more veterans to these colleges, as Hill says, will help the veterans, the colleges and ultimately the country.For now, our corporate giants face few real threats to their size and power. But I am hopeful that the politics of big business is starting to change. On both the political left and right, you can see growing concern about this issue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Intellectual Property to Take Center Stage as Trump and Xi Meet", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China sit down to talk trade this week at the Group of 20 summit meeting, their negotiations are likely to be framed by a highly charged topic: the White House\u2019s insistence that China routinely steals American technology and intellectual property.The Trump administration has repeatedly levied accusations of theft at China, invoking a term that offends the Chinese. Mr. Trump regularly says that China has \u201cripped off\u201d the United States. Last month, Vice President Mike Pence said China\u2019s security agencies had \u201cmasterminded the wholesale theft of American technology,\u201d and this week, Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said in a G-20 preview that \u201cissues of intellectual property theft must be solved.\u201dThe language employed by the Trump administration sometimes lumps together distinct but related issues, such as the trade deficit the United States runs with China, technology transfer deals negotiated by American companies and espionage intended to advance China\u2019s economic rise.But it reflects a deep, substantive rift, and the ability of the two countries to deal with it could be the key to whether a trade deal gets done in Buenos Aires. Mr. Trump has already imposed tariffs on more than $200 billion of Chinese goods, largely in response to their approach to appropriating technology, and the rate on those levies could jump to 25 percent next year from the current rate of 10 percent.While analysts estimate that the United States loses anywhere from $30 billion to $500 billion a year in pilfered intellectual property, many trade experts caution that the situation is much more nuanced than what White House officials portray.One of the biggest complaints from the Trump administration is that China forces American companies to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies if they want to do business in China. As a result of these required mergers, the administration argues, valuable technology and intellectual property is transferred to Chinese state-owned enterprises and essentially is handed over to the government.The United States has also complained about a compulsory certification program that requires foreign products to undergo rigorous testing. This can expose source codes and algorithms for products such as medical devices and machinery that can make them more easily replicated.American companies are often shy about complaining about these practices, for fear of being banned from China, but the China hawks in the Trump administration has made them a priority for an agreement that would offer the Chinese relief from tariffs.The analysis pointed to China\u2019s cyberintrusions of American companies, its evasion of American export-control laws and its extensive efforts to reverse-engineer and counterfeit American products. It pointed to a study that found the annual cost to the United States economy of pirated software and counterfeit goods could be as high as $600 billion.Beyond tariffs, the United States has using more proactive means to protect intellectual property.In October, the United States blocked a Chinese state-owned technology company \u2014 Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a manufacturer of semiconductors \u2014 from buying American components because it posed a national security threat. Then, three days later, the Justice Department charged the company, its Taiwanese partner and three individuals on Thursday with stealing trade secrets from an American technology company.The Trump administration is increasingly invoking national security to block Chinese deals, most recently expanding the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, to more rigorously scrutinize a broader range of transactions.These accusations of \u201ctheft\u201d have offended the Chinese, who view them as a suggestion that the country lacks the ability to innovate. Cui Tiankai, China\u2019s ambassador to the United States, has argued that American companies are voluntarily merging with Chinese businesses because nobody is forcing them to expand their operations into China.Some China experts such as Derek Scissors, the American Enterprise Institute scholar who advised the Trump administration on its report on China\u2019s intellectual property practices last year, contend that China has gone so far to keep out foreign competition that it has stunted its ability to innovate.\u201cThey\u2019re not relying on innovation,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. \u201cStructurally, China is set up to coerce more as time goes on.\u201dChina experts suggest that Mr. Xi is unlikely to admit that China has stolen anything, but that he will point to areas where his government has been working to comply with requests from the United States.China has been easing its joint venture requirements for some sectors. It is also putting in place a new intellectual property appeals court system, which some analysts have said is, in part, an effort to assuage concerns from foreign investors that trade secrets are not safe in China.Craig Allen, the president of the US-China Business Council, said that the Chinese will be reluctant to make rapid or drastic changes accommodate Mr. Trump\u2019s demands. They often note that the United States borrowed technological expertise from Britain in its infancy and that technology transfer is a natural part of a globalized economy.Mr. Allen suggested that Mr. Trump must press Mr. Xi on specific changes to Chinese law that he wants that would help American businesses, but that name-calling will be counterproductive.\u201cWhen it becomes ideological and is phrased as the starting bid is \u2018you guys are thieves and you need to change,\u2019 then the discussion doesn\u2019t go very far,\u201d Mr. Allen said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Holiday Windows Still Matter", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a queasy year for retail, the department-store holiday extravaganza gleams on.David Hoey, the senior director of visual presentation at Bergdorf Goodman, was sitting in his \u201cwar room\u201d the other day when his cellphone rang. Mr. Hoey begged a visitor\u2019s pardon; the phrase \u201clittle crisis\u201d was invoked.\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Mr. Hoey said into the phone. \u201cSo where you\u2019d go? All right. Let me call you back. Get the 16. How many do they have?\u201dMr. Hoey pocketed the intrusive device and looked up apologetically. These were the final hours of an undertaking nearly a year in gestation: On Nov. 16, curtains on Fifth Avenue would drop, revealing Bergdorf\u2019s holiday windows.For the most important selling season of the year, the venerable department stores of New York have marshaled their resources for elaborate displays of festive cheer. These are a family tradition and a tourist destination, a spare-no-expense arms race for delighted gasps, bugged eyes and Instagram feeds. \u201cIt\u2019s a juggernaut right now,\u201d Mr. Hoey said. \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for: We\u2019re trying to induce aesthetic delirium.\u201dThere are the classicists (Macy\u2019s, Lord & Taylor), the innovators (Barneys New York) and the razzle-dazzlers (Bergdorf, Saks Fifth Avenue), but whatever the style, the import is clear. November and December are the biggest months in retail, and the windows help suck customers in, not with product so much as theme. Even for those who can\u2019t make it to the windows, those themes radiate outward, setting the tone for the season: in store, online, in mailers and on all-important social media, a 360-degree wallop of shoppable holiday spirit.\u201cThe competition is the most intense it is all year,\u201d said Jamie Nordstrom, the president of stores for Nordstrom, which is already planning the windows for the seven-level, 320,000-square-foot women\u2019s store the company will open on Broadway and 57th Street next fall. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling out all the stops.\u201d At Bendel\u2019s window unveiling (a New York skyline as rendered by Izak Zenou, who has been doing illustrations for the store for 20 years, as well as a collaboration with the artist Shinji Murakami), hot chocolate was flowing, cake truffles were circulating, and executives were showing set-jaw bravery.\u201cWe wanted it to feel really special for our customers,\u201d said Jessica Dennis-Capiraso, Bendel\u2019s vice president of marketing and e-commerce, standing in front of a 20-foot Christmas tree made out of 420 of Bendel\u2019s brown-and-white striped gift boxes and hatboxes. \u201cWe\u2019ve had such an outpouring from our customers since the announcement that we were closing. People have just been coming in and shopping like crazy.\u201dEven now, the faint hope of solutions floated in the air. Those striped hatboxes had been eliciting attention on Instagram. Ms. Dennis-Capiraso wondered if Bendel should have been selling hatboxes all along.\u201cI\u2019m torn between joy and pain,\u201d said Mr. Zenou, who was painting customer portraits for those who spent $400 or more. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting divorced from someone you don\u2019t want to get divorced with.\u201dMelissa Marrero, a Bendel superfan who, with two days\u2019 notice, had flown in from Orlando, Fla., for the occasion, was waiting to have her portrait painted. How would she manage without her favorite store? \u201cLet\u2019s live in the present,\u201d Ms. Marrero said, fluttering a hand dramatically upward to clutch her chest.Department stores, previously known as \u201cdry goods palaces,\u201d began in the middle of the 19th century and the window displays there gained widespread popularity near the end of the century, once plate-glass manufacturing became established in America and made windows much more affordable, said Debra Schmidt Bach, the curator of decorative arts at the New-York Historical Society. By the 1970s, displays were pushing limits as well as products: While Moore designed miniature dioramas that mixed the exquisite and the everyday for Tiffany\u2019s, a younger generation of apostates was on the rise. Candy Pratts Price made her mark at Charles Jourdan, then vaulted to Bloomingdale\u2019s, where she designed theatrical displays with, some believed, lashings of sadomasochism.\u201cWe wanted to be provocative,\u201d said Ms. Pratts Price, who would go on to become a fixture at Vogue. \u201cThose days we weren\u2019t into Twitter or Instagram where someone could immediately react. My hope and dream was we would\u2019ve had a mic outside to hear the chatter.\u201dPlanning for Christmas began months in advance. \u201cThere were incredible dilemmas,\u201d she said. \u201cI favor holly\u201d \u2014 which can be flammable \u2014 \u201cand the fire department comes in. We once had a year where in 12 days we had to change Christmas because the fire department threw everything out.\u201d These days, the tone is generally gentler. Mr. Hoey went ashen when this reporter suggested that the black licorice in one of his sweets-themed windows for \u201cBergdorf Goodies,\u201d as this year\u2019s theme has temporarily rechristened it, may prove controversial. (Black licorice has ardent fans and passionate detractors.)He and a team of assemblers had worked late in the night to mount a display with gingerbread wolves and an allover patina of cinnamon (real cinnamon, for its particular texture); a Viennese-style patisserie window; and the licorice window, with a rearing steed in a dizzying mosaic of licorice twists. Part of the challenge every year is finding the right materials: The layers of Mr. Hoey\u2019s napoleon cakes are actually plaster, resin and podiatry foam, and much of the licorice is hand-braided polymer clay or caulk. Only three candies are tough enough to withstand the window treatment: jelly beans, a studded gummy called Champagne Bubbles and a heart-shaped SweeTart-like candy.Going for broke is not necessarily the expected course when fellow stores are going broke. But Darcy Penick, the new president of Bergdorf Goodman, who arrived in September from the online retailer Shopbop, said displays like the holiday windows were exactly where she would prefer to invest.\u201cAt a time when retail ebbs and flows in all directions, I think there is a natural orientation to pull back on things,\u201d Ms. Penick said. \u201cFrom my perspective, that\u2019s not what drives customer love for your brand. You keep investing in the things that your customers love.\u201d \u201cRetail has actually been healthy,\u201d said Steve Sadove, the former chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, who is now a senior adviser to Mastercard. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve seen is a lot of winners and losers.\u201d Mastercard\u2019s SpendingPulse, which tracks consumer spending across all payment types in markets around the world, is predicting a 5 percent growth in total retail sales (and a 20 percent growth in e-commerce sales) over last year. Mr. Sadove, who oversaw holiday windows for years at Saks, said such investments are \u201ccritical.\u201d On Monday, Saks shut down Fifth Avenue for a dancing spectacular of Broadway hoofers and a fireworks show, sponsored by Mastercard and benefiting Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. The theme of its holiday windows is \u201cTheater of Dreams,\u201d its windows filled with preening starlets, usherettes and a poodle in hair curlers. After the show, pedestrians flocked to take it all in. \u201cShe looks like Elsa,\u201d said a young \u201cFrozen\u201d fan about a silver-gowned mannequin.Marc Metrick, the store\u2019s president, emphasized Saks\u2019 commitment to what he called \u201cthe new luxury,\u201d which apparently means your favorite stores are also restaurants, lounges and entertainment centers. Like all of the retailers surveyed, Mr. Metrick would not say how much the windows cost to produce. Holiday displays, though, are typically the single largest visuals expense of the year. \u201cThis is where all the eyeballs are going to be,\u201d he said. Half a mile north and a few blocks east, at Bloomingdale\u2019s, the windows on Lexington Avenue have been given over to a holiday partnership with the Grinch, whose new film is in theaters. Passers-by can have their photos snapped by in-window cameras, which then beam their images into displays, or karaoke their favorite Christmas carols, into microphones jutting out onto the sidewalk.\u201cWe track how many people are taking their photographs and sharing them back out,\u201d said Frank Berman, an executive vice president and the chief marketing officer of Bloomingdale\u2019s. \u201cWe also have methods in place to track how many people are passing by the windows, stopping and engaging. We also track the amount of traffic coming into the store and the conversion rates. We\u2019re up in terms of traffic this holiday season.\u201d Inside, shoppers can take pictures of one another frolicking in a life-size snow globe, or take a spin around an actual ice rink in the Ralph Lauren section.For generations of families, locals and tourists alike, such holiday windows were a regular pilgrimage, as much a holiday requisite as the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. \u201cYou had millions of people who were visiting New York,\u201d said Mr. Sadove of his time at Saks. \u201cI\u2019d listen to stories about, \u2018My mother or my father took me to see the windows at Saks or at Bergdorf\u2019s.\u2019\u201dAt stores like Macy\u2019s, where snowmen dot the windows alongside Sunny the Snowpal \u2014 a plucky snowgirl \u2014 and a fox (her best friend), and Santa is seen piloting his sleigh, this tradition continues much as it always has, albeit now with LED screens and interactive games alongside the usual animatronic puppets. But at Barneys, Matthew Mazzucca, the creative director, is thinking smaller than he has for bonanzas past like Lady Gaga\u2019s Workshop.Through a partnership with Save the Children, Barneys has funneled off a portion of its annual window budget for a donation. Themed \u201cMake Change,\u201d windows will feature displays created from thousands of pennies \u2014 40,000 in the Madison Avenue windows of the New York flagship. The display effectively reduced material costs and freed up resources for the donation, while raising, it is hoped, social consciousness during the seasonal shop-a-thon.Mr. Mazzucca said that the need for constant entertainment and refreshment to drive traffic and sales throughout the year has made him reconsider saving all of his fireworks for December. \u201cI don\u2019t think holiday needs to be the crux of it,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day can be the holiday.\u201dAnd at least one younger retailer expressed respect for tradition but also a willingness to flout it.\u201cI remember my parents bringing me to the big department store windows, where all the toys were animated \u2014 it was fantastic,\u201d said Laure Heriard Dubreuil, the founder and chief executive of the Webster, which has stores in Miami, Houston, New York and Costa Mesa, Calif. \u201cSo I like the magic of Christmas and all these beautiful windows.\u201d \u201cUsually you think holidays, you think snow, you think green and red,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we thought glitter and pink. Santa Claus might be a Barbie doll.\u201d In lieu of a traditional holiday display, the Webster\u2019s New York store chose a theme of luxurious escape. Two full floors will be given over to an enormous installation by Chanel, inspired by the enormous cruise ship the brand erected in the Grand Palais in Paris to show the 2019 cruise collection.As for windows, they are passed over altogether, for one very good reason: The Webster doesn\u2019t have any.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Is Getting at Least $1.7 Billion to Come to Queens. Now Comes the Fight Over Whether It\u2019s Worth It.", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo attract Amazon, New York\u2019s leaders agreed to remake plans for the Queens waterfront, move a distribution center for school lunches and provide a sweeping package of $1.7 billion in incentives from the state and hundreds of millions more from the city.They even agreed to allow a helipad for Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive.Under the plan, within 15 years the company could occupy as much as eight million square feet of office space, the rough equivalent of three Empire State Buildings.An image of what life will be like with the arrival of Amazon became clearer on Tuesday, even if many questions remain unanswered.In some quarters of Queens, opposition was quickly building.\u201cAsk not what we can do for Amazon. Ask what Amazon can do for us,\u201d said State Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who represents the neighborhood.But Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio seemed relieved to be able to finally discuss the long-secret negotiation and appeared jovial on Tuesday as they spoke about the economic benefits.Yes, it is among the state\u2019s largest-ever incentive packages, the governor said, but the return on investment would be 9 to 1.Yes, they were circumventing the usual land-use process and essentially eliminating any veto power by the City Council. But, Mr. de Blasio said, the project was so large, Amazon \u201cneeded a certain amount of certainty.\u201d\u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said after the first skeptical question from a reporter to the Amazon representative.\u201cThe New York City press corps: You can either do this, or you can go to the dentist,\u201d the governor added.The location of the new headquarters is now certain \u2014 around what is known as Anable Basin.Amazon will take about one million square feet in the 50-story Citicorp building, long the only tower on the Long Island City skyline. City officials differed as to whether the company would decide to replace the large Citi sign atop the tower \u2014 visible from Manhattan \u2014 with a commanding Amazon logo.James Patchett, the head of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation, said in a telephone interview that Amazon is not interested in a sign.\u201cThey have signage on their Seattle building,\u201d the deputy mayor for economic development, Alicia Glen, interjected during the same call. She added, of the Anable Basin location, \u201cI\u2019m guessing they\u2019re going to call it Amazon Basin.\u201dLocal politicians were promising protests, objecting to the incentive package that could far exceed $2 billion, including existing city tax breaks.Others, however, including local business and technology groups and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, praised the deal.\u201cAmazon\u2019s decision to locate to Long Island City is an affirmation not only of N.Y.C.\u2019s growing tech talent,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg wrote on Twitter, \u201cbut also of all the investments \u2014 in housing, schools, parks, transportation and culture\u201d made in Long Island City.manhattan25ROOSEVELTISLANDEastRiverNew AmazonlocationAnableBasinQueensLong IslandCityBrooklynBy The New York TimesAmazon said in a statement that, as part of the deal, it would donate space on its campus for a tech start-up incubator, artists, industrial businesses and a new school. It also said it would make investments in infrastructure and green space.\u201cWe\u2019re both pragmatists,\u201d Mr. de Blasio explained, adding that he and the governor spoke several times during the yearlong negotiation.The governor went on to praise the mayor\u2019s new ferry system.Indeed, as part of one tour of New York City this year, Amazon executives were taken around the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island \u2014 an innovation incubator and a legacy of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure \u2014 and then to Long Island City, using the city\u2019s ferry system.At the moment, the site is little more than a series of low-slung buildings: a furniture warehouse, an armored car company, artist studios and a casual waterfront food spot, Anable Basin Sailing Bar and Grill. Some belong to the city; others belong to a private company, Plaxall.\u201cThey should be allowed to build but they have to take into consideration the whole neighborhood,\u201d said Veselko Buntic, who owns the grill and rents from Plaxall. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see somebody big come in and destroy the community feeling we have here.\u201d\u201cThe community\u2019s not going to dig it too much, but I think it\u2019s going to be great for this area,\u201d Mr. Wissak said of Amazon\u2019s arrival.Still, the agreement, reached behind closed doors and so far without local input, has angered officials.Part of the reason is that, according to the broad contours of the plan, the state and the city will bypass the City Council, which has the power to block rezoning and land-use measures. They will instead employ a state-level process previously used for large-scale development projects, such as Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn and Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan.The price tag in city and state tax breaks appeared to exceed those of other projects. \u201cIt has the potential to be a deeper subsidy for Amazon as a percentage of the total project cost than at either Hudson Yards or Atlantic Yards,\u201d said George Sweeting, the deputy director of the city\u2019s nonpartisan Independent Budget Office.The process being followed by the state and city left critics with few options to alter or derail the deal. But some have vowed to fight.\u201cWe\u2019re going to mobilize and protest and claim that democracy is still alive in Queens and in New York City and New York State,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, the councilman whose district includes Long Island City. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable and we\u2019re going to fight.\u201d Opponents were planning to hold a demonstration on Wednesday in Long Island City.Mr. Van Bramer and Mr. Gianaris were not always against the idea. In October 2017, they signed on to a letter, along with the Queens borough president and other elected leaders, imploring the company to come to Long Island City.Asked about the letter on Monday, Mr. Van Bramer and Mr. Gianaris said they object to the steep subsidies offered the company.\u201cI welcome the jobs if it means Amazon investment in L.I.C. infrastructure, without us having to pay a ransom for them to be here,\u201d Mr. Gianaris said.Mr. Cuomo insisted that it was a sound business deal.\u201cYou have to spend money to make money,\u2019\u2019 he said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou\u2019re betting on a winner.\u201dCorey Kilgannon and Charles V.

{"Headline": "Stocks Dive After Apple Supplier Slashes Outlook", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks dropped on Monday, giving back a slice of their recent gains as investors dumped shares in some of the large technology companies that hold outsize sway over major market indexes.The Nasdaq composite was one of the hardest-hit among the major benchmarks. The technology-heavy index was down 2.8 percent. The S&P 500 fell 2 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.3 percent.Apple\u2019s stumble seemed to weigh on other previously high-flying technology companies. Amazon shares dropped 4.4 percent, and Facebook fell 2.4 percent. The social network was briefly offline for many users Monday afternoon, giving visitors an error message saying \u201csorry, something went wrong.\u201dAlphabet, the parent company of Google, declined 2.6 percent, and Netflix stock fell more than 3 percent.The slump in technology shares on Monday was a reminder of the ugly drop stocks suffered in October. Worried about rising interest rates, trade tensions and a potential peak in corporate profits, investors briefly pushed the broader market down nearly 10 percent below its late-September peak and into negative territory for the year.More recently, stocks had regained much of that ground. Wall Street jumped after last Tuesday\u2019s contentious midterm elections were resolved, with the S&P 500 finishing the next day up more than 3.5 percent.Monday\u2019s pain wasn\u2019t exclusively due to tech stocks.General Electric\u2019s stock fell 6.9 percent in its fourth straight decline after comments by its new chief executive failed to calm investors\u2019 worries.But Apple remains a key concern. The company has a market value above $900 billion, so moves in the share price have an outsize effect on stock indexes \u2014like the S&P 500 \u2014 that are weighted by market size.That dynamic mostly has been a boon for the stock market in recent years. Apple shares rose more than 45 percent last year.But Apple\u2019s recent stumble suggests that some investors are questioning the ability of major tech companies to continue to carry the broader markets.Apple\u2019s tumble on Monday followed another slide after its Nov. 1 earnings report, when the company said it would no longer report the number of iPhones it sells each quarter. So far this month, its stock price is down more than 10 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Black Friday 2018: A Not-So-Wild Day for American Shoppers", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere we are again: Mildly annoyed by the obvious consumerism, but totally in love with the deals. It must be Black Friday.Shoppers won\u2019t want for time this year: The gap between Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 32 days if you don\u2019t count the holidays themselves \u2014 is long (next year it will be just 26 days). That means procrastinators get more time to put things off and retailers get one more shot at luring you in. But beware: Hanukkah is coming on the early side this year.We\u2019ll be covering it all here, with reporters weighing in from near and far.Just before 11 a.m. at the Fashion Island mall in Orange County, Calif., the line to see Santa Claus was about 15-people deep, including parents and grandparents. Laura Natale, who lives nearby, brought her three-year-old son Christopher to see Santa. Asked if the crowds were any larger than a typical Friday, she said: \u201cNot really.\u201dOthers had anticipated more bustle at this palm-and-Christmas-tree-laden outdoor mall near Newport Beach, saying they remembered a bigger post-Thanksgiving rush last year. \u201cIt\u2019s more empty than I expected,\u201d said Michelle Gorczyza, who also lives in the area. She did encounter a long line at Anthropologie, so she skipped the store, deciding she could just as easily buy online.Her husband Danny said that nowadays people come to the mall more for the food and the experience than the shopping. \u201cYou don\u2019t see people running around with 10 bags,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to spend $50 on lunch and just soak in the atmosphere.\u201dThat\u2019s what 28-year old Mitch Williams did on this sunny morning, sitting beneath one of the palm trees. \u201cMy grandpa is visiting from Ohio, so we\u2019re having coffee and omelets.\u201dWas he doing any shopping? He shook his head no: \u201cI do that online.\u201d\u2014 Cade MetzRetailers start marketing it months in advance. Hordes of shoppers turn out in person and online. Google even programmed it into its calendar as an official holiday.But Black Friday has competition. Lots of it.Those are just the free-for-alls, where all retailers can participate.\u201cIf we\u2019ve seen anything in retail over the last 20, 30 years, it\u2019s that consumers need to be motivated to shop,\u201d said Michael Brown, a partner with A.T. Kearney\u2019s retail practice. \u201cThey need to be provoked.\u201dFor anyone above all that crass consumerism? There\u2019s a day for them, too.\u2014 Tiffany HsuRetailers and analysts said Black Friday 2018 got off to a strong start \u2014 and all indications were that it finished strong, too.Though the cold weather in the eastern United States may have kept some shoppers home, Mastercard SpendingPulse said that generally \u201conline sales appear to be filling in any weather related soft spots in brick and mortar sales.\u201d The clothing, electronics and interior furnishing sectors were seeing especially good traction, the analysis said.\u201cStores are busy, there\u2019s good traffic, the queues are manageable and well-staffed, and inventory levels appear to be good for the time of day too,\u201d said Frank Layo, managing director of Kurt Salmon, which is part of Accenture Strategy. \u201cRetailers helped themselves by starting promotions much earlier this year to spread out the holiday shopping traffic and mitigate chaos. Their efforts appear to be paying off.\u201d\u2014 Matt StevensEarly in the day, J. Crew wrote on Twitter that it was \u201cexperiencing some technical difficulties\u201d with its website. The site appeared to be functioning fine soon afterward.Still, analysts monitoring Black Friday said online sales were chugging along, driven in part by the cold, wet weather in some parts of the country, which they said may have nudged some shoppers away from stores and toward their computers or smartphones.\u2014 Matt StevensHere\u2019s the upshot: Black Friday is a great time to buy a new video game console, a television, headphones or a smart home product like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. One of the most notable deals we\u2019ve seen: Best Buy, Amazon and many retailers are selling Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 with a new Spider-Man game for $200, down from the normal price of $300 for the console alone. So come prepared: Jot down a list of things you\u2019d like to buy in those categories and look out for price drops.\u2014 Brian X. ChenYou clearly have an insatiable appetite for The Times\u2019s Black Friday coverage! Here are a few recent stories you might enjoy about this very American \u201choliday\u201d and how it fits into the broader economy.\u2014 David EnrichBelieve it or not, not everyone is a fan of Black Friday.\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for respect and a fair wage at work,\u201d David Holt, one of the organizers of the demonstration, said in an interview on Wednesday. He added that Black Friday was an especially appealing time for labor movements to organize. \u201cOne of the things this Black Friday protest is about is consumerism.\u201dMr. Holt said he hoped that holding the demonstration in front of a Walmart would encourage shoppers to think about labor conditions for the store\u2019s employees.\u2014 Zach WichterThere is no Thanksgiving holiday in Europe, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the associated consumer bonanza from hitting shops there. French retail brands like Darty, Fnac and Monoprix joined Apple, Sephora and Uniqlo in efforts to attract bargain hunters on Friday.In Britain, where sales used to take place after Christmas, shops have added Black Friday to their promotional calendars. Offers have been trickling in for at least a week. Amazon started its sales on Nov. 16.Most other stores have joined the fray with even discount supermarkets offering money off everything from vintage turntables to legs of ham.\u2014 Amie TsangYes, Black Friday is everywhere \u2014 even Canada.The \u201choliday\u201d \u2014 in French-speaking Montreal, they call it \u201cVendredi Fou\u201d \u2014 has reportedly become Canada\u2019s busiest shopping day of the year, eclipsing Boxing Day (or Dec. 26), when the traditional post-Christmas Day sales would bring out hordes of shoppers.This Black Friday, the stores in Montreal were packed, especially in the underground, labyrinth-like malls such as Eaton Center, which was crowded with people seeking shelter from the subfreezing weather. Athletic wear, women\u2019s shoes and men\u2019s suits were marked off at 50 percent or more in the Eaton Center mall. Outside one electronics store, velvet ropes were set up to keep the queues under control.It\u2019s said that Black Friday first migrated to Canada in the early 2000s, when the American and Canadian dollars were roughly on par. These days the greenback is worth 1.32 Canadian dollars, making these discounts even greater. \u2014 Stuart EmmrichThe Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said it sold $30.8 billion worth of goods on Nov. 11, the annual online bonanza known as Singles Day. The company rang up $1 billion in sales in the first 85 seconds of this year\u2019s frenzy. It took an hour to reach $10 billion. All in all, the company says it generated more than a billion delivery orders that day.For some context: In the United States last year, online shopping from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday totaled about $19.62 billion, according to Adobe Analytics. (Yes, it\u2019s true, that doesn\u2019t include all the in-store shopping that took place on Black Friday.)In addition to inundating phone owners with coupons and deals for weeks in advance, Alibaba deploys subtler methods to gin up sales on Singles Day. This year, users of the company\u2019s Taobao shopping app could see how their spending on Nov. 11 compared to that of other people in their area.\u2014 Raymond ZhongFor many shoppers, Black Friday actually begins right in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner.\u2014 Nellie BowlesOnline shoppers, too, were busy on Thanksgiving Day. They shelled out $3.7 billion on Thursday, an increase of about 28 percent compared to last year, according to a report from Adobe Analytics, which tracks transactions from 80 of the country\u2019s top 100 online retailers.And many of those online shoppers aren\u2019t heading to their desks or even grabbing their laptops. Thanksgiving marked the first day during which $1 billion in sales came from smartphones, Adobe said. And consumers spent more on their phones, with average order values up 8 percent compared with Thanksgiving Day last year.\u2014 Zach WichterIt could help retailers offset some of the deep discounts that consumers expect on Black Friday.\u201cIf you can grab people in the inspirational moment, they\u2019re not going to be as price-sensitive and maybe they won\u2019t shop around,\u201d said Jill Standish, Accenture\u2019s global lead for retail.Another advantage? Online, Ms. Standish said, it can be easy \u201cfor a small brand to look big\u201d if they know how to present themselves, and know how to attract the right influencer profiles to promote their products. A strong social media presence can make a company seem instantly reputable.\u2014 Zach WichterThere are three reasons that Black Friday is so popular, and two of them are the deals, according to Tulin Erdem, a marketing professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.\u201cThe economic savings, feeling good about yourself having found a good deal, being a shrewd consumer,\u201d she said, all add up to one key factor. Plus, because so many stores offer Black Friday sales, it\u2019s easier to find discounts without having to search as hard as you might during the rest of the year.But, Dr. Erdem said, another reason Black Friday remains so popular is tradition.\u201cIt still has its appeal because of this ritualistic aspect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a big important baseball game or Super Bowl as an American family.\u201dConsider that the National Retail Federation surveyed 7,516 consumers about their shopping plans this year, and 26 percent of those who planned to shop on Black Friday said it was because of tradition. An additional 23 percent said they would shop because it\u2019s just something to do. (As far as we know, nobody was asked whether they\u2019re shopping just to get away from family members.)Of course Black Friday is just the start of things. If retailers don\u2019t start discounting before Thanksgiving \u2014 and most seem to \u2014 they are certainly using the holiday shopping season to push merchandise at every turn. The biggest discounts tend to come on \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d \u2014 the last Saturday before Christmas, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail analysis firm.But Black Friday does matter. Consumers surveyed by the retail federation said they planned to shop more on Black Friday than on any other day of the Thanksgiving weekend.And Black Friday maintains cultural cache, especially for \u201cnew Americans,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, as recent immigrants are more likely to take part. \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn to be an American consumer, by showing up and shopping on Black Friday.\u201d\u2014 Zach WichterAdvertisement"}

Google\u2019s top leaders were skeptical, but they told him that he could go ahead if he could find 15 \u201cGoogle-worthy\u201d software developers in the city.\u201cThe attitude was that pretty much all the good software engineers were in Silicon Valley,\u201d Mr. Nevill-Manning recalled. \u201cIt seems crazy in retrospect.\u201dMr. Nevill-Manning found his developers and opened the engineering office in New York. Today, Google employs 7,000 people in the city, and more than half are engineers and technical staff.[Do you live or work near Amazon\u2019s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]\u201cThis solidifies New York\u2019s importance and significance in tech,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the dean of New York\u2019s venture capital community and co-founder of Union Square Ventures.Amazon, like most big tech companies, is no stranger to New York. It already has over 2,000 workers in New York, from e-commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers.Facebook has over 2,000 New York employees, including Yann LeCun, its chief artificial intelligence scientist and a pioneer in the field. Salesforce employs more than 1,000 at its new offices in New York. And tech stalwart IBM chose the city as the headquarters for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Most technology work in New York has traditionally been in service of other industries. That market, too, is growing briskly as banks, retailers, advertising and consulting firms \u2014 major employers in New York \u2014 are all getting digital makeovers and hiring. Goldman Sachs, for example, employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including data analysts, app developers, digital security and blockchain experts. Manuela Veloso, head of the machine-learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, joined JPMorgan Chase this year to lead its A.I. research team.The five companies with the most tech-related job listings in New York over the last three months on Indeed.com, the jobs listing site, are Amazon, BNY Mellon, Capgemini, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.Measurements of tech sector jobs vary, depending on definitions. But the broad picture is a growing labor market for well-paying jobs. From 2010 to 2017, according to government statistics, tech sector employment grew by 53,000 in the city, or 65 percent, to an estimated 134,700. And the average salary of $147,300 in 2016, the most recent estimate available, was far higher than the citywide average of $89,100 for all private employers.Types of tech jobs in New York City, 2016Manufacturing15%TelecommunicationsIncludes internet serviceproviders like Verizon22Internet-relatedIncludes Google andsimilar companies48Computer systems design12OtherTypes of tech jobs in New York City, 2016Manufacturing15%TelecommunicationsIncludes internet serviceproviders like Verizon22Internet-relatedIncludes Google andsimilar companies48Computer systems design12OtherSource: Office of the New York State ComptrollerBy The New York TimesThe Bay Area, to be sure, remains the nation\u2019s high-tech epicenter. New York is growing impressively, but its tech work force, according to most analyses, is less than half and perhaps one-third that of the Bay Area.But the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Silicon Valley, took in $12.8 billion. Start-ups in the Washington, D.C. region, where Amazon plans to put another large headquarters, received $575 million in the third quarter.In the past, New York start-ups typically sold out to larger tech companies. That, too, is changing. Mr. Wilson, the venture capitalist, pointed to MongoDB, a database supplier, and Etsy, an e-commerce seller, as examples of start-ups that held out and went public in recent years.MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share.\u201cNew York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.The rise of New York\u2019s tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education \u2014 a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city\u2019s work force, whose progress enhanced New York\u2019s appeal to Amazon.After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition.The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazon\u2019s board.For technologists who have recently come to New York, part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked: New York\u2019s huge and diverse economy, and its culture.\u201cEverything is tech-driven on the West Coast,\u201d said Jeannette Wing, who left Microsoft Research last year to become the director of Columbia\u2019s Data Science Institute. \u201cBut the East Coast is more well rounded. It is about technology, but not just technology for its own sake.\u201dKeith Collins contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Empire\u2019 Aims to Educate, Not Shock, with an H.I.V.-Positive Love Story", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Season 2 of \u201cEmpire,\u201d Lucious Lyon (Terrence Howard), the vindictive, ruthless music mogul, delivered a blistering statement to his gay son, Jamal (Jussie Smollett): \u201cYou ain\u2019t nothing to me but a disappointment. And the day you die from AIDS, I\u2019mma celebrate.\u201dIt was maybe the worst thing a parent could say to a child, and another example of the rottenness of Lucious\u2019s soul.Three seasons later, \u201cEmpire\u201d has invoked H.I.V./AIDS again, but this time, the subject has been finessed into the story, as a way to educate viewers, not to shock them. Episode 4 told, via flashbacks, the evolution of Jamal\u2019s courtship with a journalist, Kai (Toby Onwumere), including Kai\u2019s disclosure about having H.I.V. And on Wednesday\u2019s episode, Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) learns about Kai\u2019s status when she visits him at the hospital, where he\u2019s recuperating after having gone missing while reporting a story abroad. She is aghast: \u201cYou just going to let him get you sick?\u201d she scolds Jamal, out of Kai\u2019s earshot.In a recent phone conversation, Smollett said \u201cEmpire\u201d had planned to incorporate an H.I.V./AIDS story line since the beginning of the show. Over the years, plans would \u201ccome apart\u201d and \u201cfall away,\u201d he explained, but now, \u201cIt was time.\u201dHe is concerned about how H.I.V./AIDS has become a \u201cside story\u201d in conversations within Hollywood and the broader cultural landscape. \u201cI\u2019m still losing people to AIDS,\u201d he said. Through Jamal\u2019s relationship with Kai, the hope is to \u201cnormalize\u201d the realities of living with the illness and to take away the stigma.Outside perspectives were brought in, including from those who are H.I.V. positive and Smollett\u2019s mentor Phill Wilson, the founder of the Black AIDS Institute, an organization Smollett has worked with since he was a teenager. \u201cThe writers that we have, everything \u2014 our whole team, we can handle this,\u201d he added.With the introduction of Kai, \u201cEmpire\u201d joins a handful of TV shows from the last few years that have featured characters who are H.I.V. positive, including the short-lived HBO series \u201cLooking,\u201d Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d and FX\u2019s \u201cPose.\u201d With the exception of \u201cPose,\u201d which chronicles the predominantly black and brown queer ballroom scene in New York City during the peak of the AIDS crisis in the late 1980s, these programs are set in the present and try to address the realities of having H.I.V., or of being in a relationship with someone who does. (\u201cI love what \u201cPose\u201d did,\u201d Smollett said, because \u201cthey\u2019re right in the heart of the beginning, and we\u2019re able to tell it in present day.\u201d)References to PrEP, the antiviral regimen that significantly lowers the chances of contracting H.I.V. through sex, are peppered into scripts. On \u201cLooking,\u201d for instance, Dom (Murray Bartlett) patly tells Agustin (Frankie J. Alvarez), who is insecure about dating someone with H.I.V., \u201cIt\u2019s not 1994 \u2014 just go on PrEP, get over it.\u201d On \u201cEmpire,\u201d a concerned Cookie asks Jamal if he\u2019s \u201cprepping to die\u201d; Jamal explains that the medication is for people like him who are H.I.V. negative, \u201cso that they don\u2019t get infected.\u201dSmollett said he initially asked the writers to give Jamal the illness. \u201cI was searching for, \u2018What is the way that we can deal with it, that we can tell the story?\u2019\u201d he explained.But according to Brett Mahoney, who took over as showrunner for Season 5, the audience\u2019s alliance with Cookie (she\u2019s a major social media draw on nights that the show airs) helped decide against that creative choice. Cookie would \u201cnever reject Jamal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to tell a story where she was convinced by the facts of what the current issues are of H.I.V./AIDS\u201d and \u201cto accept and embrace Kai.\u201dSmollett is pleased that this is how it turned out. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually more important to see him not have it,\u201d he said, and to instead \u201csee how he deals with someone that he loves having it.\u201dPerhaps not coincidentally, the characters on shows like \u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cTransparent\u201d that are dealing with the status, either directly or by proxy, tend to come from L.G.B.T. communities. Mahoney said the team members felt that in having a black gay character like Jamal they had to discuss H.I.V. in some way: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be part of his world.\u201dLast season, Ellie Kirshenbaum, a programming executive at 20th Century Fox Television, which produces \u201cEmpire,\u201d relayed a story about being in a Trader Joe\u2019s the day after an episode in which Cookie had a heart attack, Mahoney said. A woman was telling the cashier that the episode had inspired her to buy healthier food. \u201cThe numbers of black and brown people, and particularly black and brown men, who are still contracting H.I.V.\u201d highlighted the show\u2019s opportunity to make a difference, he said.Unlike with Lucious\u2019s horrific one-liner to Jamal in Season 2, which eventually was forgotten amid the show\u2019s narrative whiplash, the writers plan to continue addressing H.I.V. as Kai and Jamal\u2019s relationship progresses. In the next episode, Mahoney said, Cookie will be seen educating herself on H.I.V. and what it\u2019s like to live with it today.But above all, Smollett is happiest to have a story line \u201cabout two black men who are in love.\u201d At the end of Wednesday\u2019s episode, Jamal and Kai propose to one another \u2014 a rare, though not unprecedented, moment in scripted TV history. (Black male characters became engaged and eventually got married on the Logo series \u201cNoah\u2019s Arc,\u201d which aired for two seasons in 2005 and 2006.)\u201cI haven\u2019t been this excited about Jamal\u2019s story line since Season 1,\u201d Smollett said. \u201cFor so long I\u2019ve been saying: \u2018Can\u2019t Jamal just have a normal, healthy relationship? Can\u2019t he find that one?\u2019\u201d\u201cCookie and Lucious are pretty healthy, but they\u2019ve still got their issues. I mean, he still let her rot in jail for 17 years and divorced her and then married Boo Boo Kitty, who had a baby by his son,\u201d he added. \u201cSo Kai and Jamal are, by all means, the healthiest relationship on the show.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mike Isaac here, your trusty, San Francisco-based reporter covering all things Facebook, ride-hailing and other Silicon Valley ephemera. It has been a while since I wrote my last newsletter, so bear with me if I\u2019m a bit rusty.Social media was the thing to watch this week. The midterm elections finally took place, with Americans poised to see whether or not a widely predicted \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democrats would sweep the country. As it turned out, that wave was more of a choppy surf; Dems took back the House, while Republicans held onto their majority in the Senate.As Americans made their way to the polls on Tuesday, another big story was whether we would see a repeat of the 2016 presidential election: Everyone was looking for trolls and disinformation.Facebook, home to more than two billion regular users, was the obvious target. Since Russian-backed trolls succeeded in a widespread influence campaign that reached millions of Americans in 2016, Facebook has been under pressure to safeguard its network against the threat of further foreign meddling. The company, to much ado from the press, set up a \u201cWar Room\u201d to catch any last-minute information operations.Jair Bolsonaro, often called the Donald Trump of Brazil, surged to an Election Day victory, aided \u2014 at least in part \u2014 by voter suppression and disinformation tactics that flooded private groups in WhatsApp. That problem is more difficult to deal with on WhatsApp because it is encrypted. And users generally trust private messaging services more than they do more public venues like Facebook.Election Day in the United States was indeed a spectacle for Facebook, but for different reasons than we thought. Save for one episode, the day went off without much of a hitch. We\u2019re still holding our breath, but according to Facebook, there were no enormous reveals, no last-minute election night disasters, nothing that seemed to throw the electoral process completely off the rails.I guess we should be happy that things didn\u2019t go completely sideways after two years of scrutiny and preparation. Perhaps, at least for a moment, we can breathe a collective sigh of relief.Here are a handful of other things you may have missed last week:When Nintendo\u2019s game designers were struggling to name the character, Mr. Segale knocked on their office door. He was there to yell at Minoru Arakawa, then the president of Nintendo of America, for being past due on the rent. As soon as he left, the team knew it had its name: \u201cSuper Mario!\u201d Mr. Arakawa said.Mike Isaac is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.

Was He Wrong?", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe death of a young American missionary on a tropical island at the hands of an indigenous group has left us to wonder: Are they better off with us or without us?Mr. Gettleman is the South Asia bureau chief for The Times, based in New Delhi.The people there are hunters and gatherers. They follow a lifestyle tens of thousands of years old. No outsiders know their language. We don\u2019t know where they came from. We don\u2019t even know what they call themselves \u2014 definitely not the \u201cSentinelese,\u201d as some people do. They have attacked just about anyone trying to step onto their shore, appearing virtually naked and firing arrows. Then they retreat from the beach and melt into the forest. Why? That\u2019s a mystery, too.\u201cIn America, if you enter someone\u2019s garden they come out with guns to shoot you for trespassing,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, these people have been clearly telling us that please don\u2019t come near us, we don\u2019t want to meet you. And yet we keep on barging into their areas, bothering them, and that risks even the tribe\u2019s death.\u201dHer argument is basically self-defense. Because of their isolation, she said, the islanders have no immunity to infections and diseases of the outside world. Even a common cold could kill them. She said that Mr. Chau put these people in grave danger and he should have never visited.\u201cThere is no question that this attempt to make contact was totally wrong and a major violation of their human rights to autonomy,\u201d he said. \u201cOutsiders need to respect their wishes and treat them with dignity as fellow human beings. Respect means we don\u2019t assume to know better how they should live.\u201dFirst, if a population gets too small and isolated, like the people on North Sentinel, it will probably become extinct. Contact may be dangerous, but so is no contact. Second, some type of encounter with an outsider is inevitable, Mr. Hill said, and \u201caccidental contact is a disaster waiting to happen.\u201d North Sentinel is isolated, but it\u2019s only 30 miles or so from Port Blair, the region\u2019s growing capital. How long can the Indians keep people away from the island? Mr. Hill\u2019s solution is to learn what the islanders want so that they can make the decision about their future.\u201cHumans are an extremely social species,\u201d he said. \u201cNo groups want to live isolated forever. They do it out of fear.\u201d \u201cIt takes a certain amount of courage and hard thinking,\u201d Mr. Pandya said about the next step. \u201cIt has to start with gift giving, years of gift giving, then the language has to be learned through this gift giving. You have to make an effort to engage in dialogue. It\u2019s not easy, but everybody is entitled to think about their future, that is the first right, the right to have rights.\u201dWhen I asked Mr. Pandya whether the island was beautiful \u2014 the few photos I\u2019ve seen show tantalizing white beaches and Windex-blue seas \u2014 he snapped back: \u201cNo, it\u2019s filthy. It\u2019s disgusting.

{"Headline": "Three London Jewelry Makers You Need to Know", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTraditionally, the jewelry world, millenniums old, has been staunchly resistant to change. But now, emerging from the gulf separating fine jewelry, moderately costly pieces crafted of precious metals and often semiprecious stones, and the inexpensive fashion pieces sold on Main Street, a powerful new category has blossomed: demi-fine jewelry.Catering largely to millennials who want original design and quality but at affordable prices, young, fashionable and mostly female designers and entrepreneurs are developing brands that can give customers just that. London has become a particularly vibrant hub, producing many of the most important names to know in the market.Here, women making waves with their different approaches explain why they wanted to disrupt the status quo \u2014 and how they did it. Elizabeth PatonWhen you start a jewelry brand, like any entrepreneur, you can initially have quite grandiose aspirations. I always knew I wanted to subvert traditional ideas of fine jewelry and produce pieces that you would never see on Bond Street. But actually, it took time for me to figure out where my brand sat in the market.I had noticed that while affordable jewelry brands using precious metals existed at a price point from \u00a3200 to \u00a3700, few designers then went to the expense of actually setting precious stones, so I started doing that. I also took on bespoke commissions just above cost price. It ate into my margins, but I decided that these could be important future clients. They might not have been able to spend thousands of pounds at the time, but if we developed a good one-on-one relationship, then they may well down the line. It was a long-term approach, but it worked. People have kept coming back. And from there, the business has continued to grow and grow.We sell only in our Chelsea store, on our website and via 1stdibs \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t change that. It means slower growth than if we were also in department stores or doing wholesale, but I think that the retail landscape at the moment is very confused, and that relying on third parties to relay your brand DNA can be dangerous.I don\u2019t actually like the label \u201cdemi jewelry,\u201d either: It\u2019s neither here nor there, and it lumps everyone together when there are a lot of people doing very different things. We all work hard to stand out. I would like to think that as a brand, Tessa Packard is exciting, kooky and whimsical in an industry in which there is still such stiffness. Jewelry that tells a story and feels fun is at the heart of what we are doing.Meanwhile, Ilana was getting increasingly frustrated by the limited choices available for women who wanted stylish jewelry of good quality that didn\u2019t break the bank. She was also bored of the antiquated jewelry marketing by many big brands, where \u201cbuy this and she will love you\u201d has remained front and center. It didn\u2019t speak to us, or any of the women we knew.And so we came up with the solution: Jewelers design the pieces, and then we manufacture and sell them directly to customers. Our partners have all been really keen to work with us, as it has allowed them to take on more experimental approaches to design without any of the risks and connect to a new network of fans. And it allows us to offer up jewelry as an art form that uses metal as a medium, and designer pieces that these clients couldn\u2019t necessarily afford otherwise. And given the breadth of styles in the collections we offer, we really believe we have something for everyone.My brand came from graduating from university and not knowing what I wanted to do. I was looking at all these professional paths \u2014 advertising, medicine, consultancy \u2014 but just felt totally lost. It reminded me of the \u201cDivine Comedy\u201d I had read and loved, all about getting lost in dark forests and not knowing the way. I read it again and suddenly felt compelled to make a little piece for each poem, and to photograph and document them. I hadn\u2019t had any formal training. But gradually I wondered if other people might also like what I was doing.The first years were very tough. I built the business at night, while working during the day as an au pair, for stylists or in e-commerce visual merchandising. No one really wanted to give it a chance. Then just over two years ago, MatchesFashion.com gave me my first order of 50 pieces and it was the biggest order we ever had. It is just exploded from there: The sales growth rate has been 500 percent, with the coin necklaces our most popular product. We now have an average price point of \u00a3280, which I think is our sweet spot.Of course it is a dream to grow so quickly, but it is also really challenging. I\u2019m trying to build a team now and a solid framework we can build on. I am also obsessed with maintaining quality, after buying too much expensive costume jewelry when I was younger that turned my skin green. Historically, I have based everything on creating handmade pieces that are personal, sentimental and meaningful. That can be hard to maintain as you scale. But I think people like our narrative, and you really do need a story to survive in such a crowded marketplace. Now I want to expand into other product categories. Perhaps a book or stationery will be next.Advertisement"}

Also the prequel, the reboot, the reunion, the revival, the remake, the spinoff and the stand-alone franchise-adjacent film. Canceled television shows are reinstated. Killed-off characters are resuscitated. Movies do not begin and end so much as they loiter onscreen. And social media is built for infinite scrolling. Nothing ends anymore, and it\u2019s driving me insane.Today the tradition of the novel has been supplanted by that of the comic book: Stories extend indefinitely, their plot holes patched through superpower, magic and dreams. Or maybe every story is a soap opera now: Nobody dead is dead forever, not Dan Conner of \u201cRoseanne\u201d and definitely not all of the superhero genocide victims of \u201cInfinity War.\u201d Of course, to Hollywood\u2019s bean counters, sequels are mere brand extensions of intellectual property. But something bigger is happening, too: The logic of the internet is colonizing everything.At the same time, social media is pushing the limits of limitlessness. What Instagram has branded \u201cStories\u201d is an endless feed of images, one-liners and special effects that carries no pretense of progression. All it does is continue.The novel\u2019s bounded story was a technological innovation as much as a formal one. Benjamin wrote of it skeptically, charting its rise alongside the spread of the printing press. But even in 1936, a new form was on the horizon: what he called \u201cinformation.\u201d A novel must end because the physical object of the book will eventually run out of pages. But news wires and radio reports just keep coming, and, as Benjamin put it, \u201cBy now almost nothing that happens benefits storytelling; almost everything benefits information.\u201dFor Hollywood branders, the appeal of endlessness is obvious. And for creators, it can present a tantalizing opportunity: a do-over. A series that was canceled too soon, without the closure of a real ending, can claim one now: \u201cDeadwood\u201d will soon be extended as a TV movie. One that was pushed too far \u2014 like \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d which aired a disappointing final season without its creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino \u2014 can attempt to overwrite the bad feelings with fresh plots.And what do we get? Something to talk about. A Silicon Valley buzzword \u2014 \u201ccommunity\u201d \u2014 seems to apply increasingly to our cultural properties, too. While Mark Zuckerberg sells us his morally suspect advertising vehicle under the banner of global connectivity, Hollywood launders its tedious installments and revivals through appeals to fan service. Marketers may love franchises for their ability to break through the clutter \u2014 a revival sells itself \u2014 but audiences, too, cling to these comforting cultural billboards. The security of recognizable characters and a built-in community that understands the same reference points can supersede the material itself. Criticism gives way to fan theories, with endless possibilities but little significance.At least this story ends.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Is Said to Be Shopping for More Real Estate in New York", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon may not be the only technology giant considering a big expansion in New York.Google is in discussions to move into a planned 1.3 million square foot office complex at the St. John\u2019s Terminal building on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, according to a person with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans but not permitted to speak about it publicly.The property, which is expected to be completed in 2022, would allow the internet giant to significantly increase its presence in the city. Google employs around 7,000 in New York, and a space that size could allow it to more than double its local work force.Amazon\u2019s so-called HQ2 effort, a search for a second corporate headquarters outside of Seattle, has dragged on for about a year. Many were surprised when word leaked last week that the e-commerce company could end up with two new big offices instead of one. The other would be in Northern Virginia, outside of Washington.Google opened its first office in New York 18 years ago, but the company\u2019s ever-expanding work force has driven demand for larger offices and more staffing in the city.In March, Google spent $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices. The Chelsea office is Google\u2019s main workplace in the city, housing product and business teams for web search, ads and sales. A Google spokeswoman said it was also planning to add an additional 320,000 square feet of space with the redevelopment of Pier 57.The search for local real estate is part of a general expansion in the United States for Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Last month, Alphabet said it had hired 9,000 employees in the United States this year, raising its total to 94,372 as of September. That was an increase of more than 16,000 from a year earlier.St. John\u2019s Terminal is being developed in Hudson Square by Oxford Properties, a Toronto-based developer. The 12-story building will incorporate a former freight terminal for the High Line and showcases rail beds as a central design feature.As tech companies expand in New York, they are likely to compete with Wall Street for engineering talent.New York has always had a significant technology industry of its own, though it has been dwarfed by the financial industry. For years, the city has ranked second or third among communities in the United States in total tech venture capital investment \u2014 with Silicon Valley and its surrounding area far and away the leader.But one thing the city has not been able to claim in a long time is a technology powerhouse of its own. The closest home of a tech heavyweight is Armonk, N.Y, about 40 miles away, where IBM is based. (IBM also has major offices in Manhattan.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I Don\u2019t Even Know What to Think\u2019: The Whiplash of Watching the Election Results", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOMESTEAD, Pa. \u2014 The night began with giddy eagerness as the crowd trickled into the warren of rooms at the back of a bar just outside Pittsburgh. They were nurses, social workers, professors and retirees who had spent the last two years learning the science of campaigning from scratch and the last few months doing the grueling work.\u201cNo matter what happens,\u201d said Beth Dabruzzo, who hand-wrote thousands of postcards to voters encouraging them to vote for Democrats, \u201cI literally could not have done anything more than I did.\u201dWhat followed were three-plus hours of whiplash: Cheers at the victory of some House candidate somewhere, even if the crowd in the back couldn\u2019t hear the name of the state. Groans as Republicans kept winning seats in the Senate. Choice words for Texas and Florida.Their state, Pennsylvania, delivered what they wanted, by and large \u2014 but not in a number of the races that Ms. Dabruzzo and other people gathered at the party had spent the last few months of their lives on.The lights were turned on, the balloons popped and the candles blown out and Ms. Dabruzzo looked over the results.\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to think,\u201d she concluded.This was a sentiment shared nationwide, for Republicans as well as Democrats. No one could seem to say whether a decisive message had been sent in the election results, or if so, what that message was. Some developments were surprising, others surprisingly predictable, but none of it seemed to add up to a satisfying verdict.\u201cAll right, guys,\u201d summed up Marie Norman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh whose two-year-old grass-roots group, Order of the Phoenix, was the host of the party. \u201cWe tried. We won some big ones.\u201dLike many of the people around her at the party, Ms. Dabruzzo, 48, had never before experienced an election this way. She had voted before, sent money to candidates a time or two, maybe put up a sign.But this election had consumed her lunch hours, nights, weekends and holidays. On Oct. 1, she counted: 1,347 postcards, most of them written at night while her husband was at work and she sat in front of \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d They were sent to voters in a neighboring congressional district. She estimated she wrote and sent another thousand in the weeks after that.Later that month, she took a week\u2019s vacation from her job to go with her husband, Jim, 45, an X-ray technologist, to knock on doors in the district, hundreds of them. They were both brand-new to the game, and they both loved it.But it meant a lot more nerves on a night like Tuesday.\u201cI tend to get overly excited about things, and when they don\u2019t happen, get that much more depressed,\u201d she said beforehand. \u201cSo I\u2019m trying to think not that far ahead.\u201dThe 2016 election had flipped a switch for her. She felt \u201csick, like the country was sick,\u201d like things had gone badly wrong. It was not mere partisanship \u2014 she had voted occasionally for Republicans before; Mr. Dabruzzo had even voted for Rick Santorum, \u201cbefore he went crazy.\u201d But the Trump victory was different.This was the case for nearly all the people at the bar on Tuesday night. Most had done almost no political work before 2016, certainly not knocking on strangers\u2019 doors. Then President Trump came and with it \u201cthis knot in my stomach,\u201d Professor Norman said.The morning after that election, Professor Norman and her husband created the Order of the Phoenix at their kitchen table. It was named after the secret society in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books, which was set up to fight the villain, Lord Voldemort. It would go on to have more than 7,000 members on Facebook, including Ms. Dabruzzo, all of whom would write postcards, campaign and canvass in local elections.It was springtime for grass-roots groups in those first months of the Trump presidency. All across the city and suburbs they sprouted: Progress PA, 412 Resistance, Mt. Lebanon Rise Up and many, many more, thousands of mostly middle-aged, mostly college-educated women with little or no prior organizing experience, meeting at marches, huddling on Facebook and setting off on a rapid nuts-and-bolts education in electoral politics that would lead to a massive regional ground game. Some of these new activists would run for office (and indeed some won on Tuesday night).\u201cWe felt like we could really accomplish something,\u201d said Cindy Callahan, a member of the Order of the Phoenix, who was helping put up balloons as the party got underway on Tuesday night. \u201cWe were the biggest percentage of canvassers in Washington County!\u201dWith a margin of 755 votes in Mr. Lamb\u2019s race, everyone involved felt like they could have made the final difference. And in a district as Republican as his, it seemed that the direction of the country was truly in the hands of the highly motivated volunteers. It was this kind of optimism that drew Ms. Dabruzzo to the campaign of Ron DiNicola, the Democrat running in the 16th district, a half-hour from where she lives. It was a district much like Mr. Lamb\u2019s, and so it, too, could possibly be swung with enough effort.\u201cYou have power in numbers,\u201d Ms. Dabruzzo said. \u201cWhen you get together with other people you can actually do something.\u201dAs Tuesday night wore on, that sense of control had faded somewhat.Ms. David was sounding a common note: A single American may not have power over Florida, or Texas, or the presidential election, or the races around Philadelphia, but that does not mean the only option is to sit back and despair. That is why so many joined the movement in Pennsylvania, because \u201cit\u2019s therapy,\u201d as Ms. Dabruzzo said: Because doing something is not only better than sitting at home, but, as Mr. Lamb\u2019s election showed, it can actually pay off.Still, some of the races in which she had put in hours and hours of work were slipping away. The State House campaigns she had adopted, always long shots, were falling short, in some cases badly. And Mr. DiNicola, who had been leading in the returns all night, started to trail as the last votes came in and the bar in Homestead was closing down.\u201cWe didn\u2019t knock on enough doors,\u201d Ms. Dabruzzo said to herself.In their car on the dark street outside, Mr. Dabruzzo looked into the glow of his phone and confirmed: Mr. DiNicola had conceded. it was over.Ms. Dabruzzo sighed. \u201cBack to the drawing board,\u201d she said.Not that she was done with politics. Not at all. On Wednesday morning, she was already conferring with her fellow activists. A special election was coming for the State Senate district just next door. By noon, she was already checking Amazon for prices on bulk postcards.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can New York City\u2019s Mayor Be an Amazon Booster and Still Be Progressive?", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThose grumblings turned into a full-throated roar this week, with the mayor\u2019s enthusiastic backing of a billion-dollar incentive deal to bring Amazon to Long Island City, Queens.The short answer, said some real estate developers and former political aides, is that he almost always has.When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pushed forward a contentious plan to build taller buildings along a thoroughfare in brownstone Brooklyn, he found support from Mr. de Blasio, then the local councilman.Mr. de Blasio also backed Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s development over Atlantic Yards, a project that spawned years of loud battles, court fights and drew active neighborhood opposition.\u201cHe really seemed unmovable in his support for it,\u201d said Eric McClure, a Park Slope neighborhood activist who met with Mr. de Blasio in 2005 and presented thousands of signatures opposing the project. He failed to change Mr. de Blasio\u2019s mind.The mayor\u2019s stance on Amazon is even more firm.\u201cI get the angst, I get the questions,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in an interview on Thursday, but blocking it would be a \u201chuge mistake.\u201d\u201cI think this deal should be respected because of all it would bring,\u201d the mayor said, pointing to the \u201cstaggering\u201d number of jobs involved \u2014 some 25,000 or more when Amazon is fully moved in to Long Island City.The cost in city and state tax incentives and a state grant would total roughly $3 billion, a figure cited Thursday by Howard Zemsky, the head of the state\u2019s economic development arm.Yet Mr. de Blasio\u2019s positions on real estate development, including his efforts to rezone large areas of New York City, have often put him in direct conflict with his political base, and stretched the distance between his rhetoric and the reality of governing.Advocates for the poor, who helped secure his re-election last year, still chafe at his housing plan, which critics say does not provide enough housing for the poorest New Yorkers.Several City Council members are pushing a bill that would require any rental housing project that receives taxpayer subsidies \u2014 such as tax abatements, loans, tax credits or reduced-cost land \u2014 to set aside 15 percent of its created or preserved units for people living in the city\u2019s shelter system.Mr. de Blasio\u2019s current housing policy calls for a 5 percent set-aside, and he has said he is strongly against increasing that number.But the deal for Amazon, for some, was the last straw.\u201cI expected this mayor to be a stalwart of deeply income-targeted affordable housing,\u201d said Jumaane Williams, a Brooklyn councilman who is running to become the city\u2019s public advocate. \u201cEvery day it\u2019s something else. This Amazon deal took the cake for me.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou give away $3 billion? $3 billion? To the richest man in America? For a company that will most likely come here anyway?\u201dStuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, fumed at Amazon and expressed friction with Mr. de Blasio. \u201cThe mayor is a great ally, but on this issue, we differ on whether or not Amazon belongs in New York,\u201d he said.He has advocated zoning changes in some areas of the city, such as East New York, Brooklyn, that could lead to large increases in density and the construction of both affordable and market-rate housing. He has also relied on the campaign contributions of developers.Indeed, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, Alicia Glen, is eager to increase the amount of building in New York City, believing along with the mayor that the key to providing more housing for low-income residents is to provide more housing for everyone \u2014 and then require some of it to be affordable.In her office, she has a photograph of a Shanghai skyline densely and haphazardly packed with apartment towers mixed with older structures \u2014 a caution about unplanned growth but also a vision of possibility.It is an outlook that Mr. de Blasio has long embraced.\u201cWe believe there is a type of development in communities that can be good, but it has to come with the public sector driving a hard bargain on behalf of the people,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday.At the same time, the mayor has also taken swipes at \u201cgreedy landlords\u201d and has sought the support of community groups that oppose gentrification. That has landed him in trouble when he has tried to pass zoning changes because opponents perceive that his rhetoric does not match his actions.It also makes it easier for critics to paint him as hypocritical, with the Amazon deal in particular, because he has also railed against the retail giant, while defending small, locally owned stores.\u201cWe were very surprised to see him sitting at that table at that press conference,\u201d said Deborah Axt of Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy organization that has backed Mr. de Blasio. \u201cThe subsidy package is disgusting. As details come out, we\u2019re more and more depressed about it and outraged.\u201dShe added that the deal \u201cis absolutely not all on the mayor,\u201d pointing out that he sat alongside Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.But she said she was \u201csubstantially less surprised\u201d by the governor. \u201cOur sense is that the governor has long supported this kind of corporate giveaway,\u201d she said.Mr. de Blasio defended the city incentives, which could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, as available to any company and not tailor-made for Amazon. The company\u2019s presence in the city was not in contrast with his efforts to reduce income inequality, he said, but would ultimately subsidize those plans and programs.\u201cThere\u2019s a whole left position that says you need development to help people achieve their potential,\u201d he said, a tradition that stretches back to the time of Karl Marx.\u201cA major international corporation has their own agenda,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cMeanwhile the strongest city government in America is basically a European social democracy that somehow broke loose from the continent and came here.\u201d\u201cUsing the power of government,\u201d he added, \u201cwe dictate the terms in as many ways as we can. And in this case, we did that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are Killer Robots the Future of War? Parsing the Facts on Autonomous Weapons", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarIt\u2019s a freezing, snowy day on the border between Estonia and Russia. Soldiers from the two nations are on routine border patrol, each side accompanied by an autonomous weapon system, a tracked robot armed with a machine gun and an optical system that can identify threats, like people or vehicles. As the patrols converge on uneven ground, an Estonian soldier trips and accidentally discharges his assault rifle. The Russian robot records the gunshots and instantaneously determines the appropriate response to what it interprets as an attack. In less than a second, both the Estonian and Russian robots, commanded by algorithms, turn their weapons on the human targets and fire. When the shooting stops, a dozen dead or injured soldiers lie scattered around their companion machines, leaving both nations to sift through the wreckage \u2014 or blame the other side for the attack.The hypothetical scenario seems fantastical, but those battlefield robots already exist today in an early form. Milrem Robotics, a company based in Estonia, has developed a robot called THeMIS (Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry System), which consists of a mobile body mounted on small tank treads, topped with a remote-weapon turret that can be equipped with small or large-caliber machine guns. It also includes cameras and target-tracking software, so the turret can pursue people or objects as programmed. This is a human-controlled system for now (and Milrem, for its part, insists that it will remain that way), but the components are there for a robot that can interpret what it sees, identify likely combatants and target them, all on its own. \u201cThe possible uses for the THeMIS,\u201d the robot\u2019s builders gush on the website, \u201care almost limitless.\u201dUnder what circumstances can and should militaries delegate the decision to take a human life to machines? It\u2019s a moral leap that has raised fundamental questions about the nature of warfare and that military planners, human rights organizations, defense officials, research analysts and ethicists have yet to reach a consensus on.The most advanced automated American weaponry has focused on defensive applications. When rocket and mortar attacks threatened large American bases in Iraq in 2003, the Army developed the Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar system (C-RAM) \u2014 a rapid-fire 20 mm cannon that can identify an incoming airborne threat, alert a human operator and \u2014 with the operator\u2019s press of a button \u2014 track and destroy it with a burst of special ammunition that self-destructs in midair to minimize damage to friendly personnel or civilians below.Those weapons were based on a naval gun system, the Phalanx, that\u2019s considered a last line of defense against antiship missiles. The Phalanx was just one of the Navy\u2019s automated answers to late Cold War pressures: Soviet naval doctrine relied on overwhelming enemy ship squadrons with as many as 60 cruise missiles at a time. \u201cWhen large salvos come in, it\u2019s impossible for humans to be able to say, \u2018O.K., you\u2019ve got to take this missile out first,\u2019\u201d says Robert Work, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cThere was no way for humans in the combat information center to be able to keep up with that.\u201d So American planners developed Phalanx and the Aegis Combat System, which links sensors on fleet ships and aircraft to identify airborne threats and, with operator input, automatically attack them with shipboard missiles. It was programmed, Work says, \u201cto have a totally automatic setting, and literally the human at some point pushes the button and the machine makes all the decisions.\u201dIt depends on how autonomous they are. \u201cThere\u2019s a type of fire-and-forget weapon where the weapon itself decides, \u2018O.K., this is what I see happening in the battlefield, and I think I\u2019m going to have to take out this particular tank because I think this tank is the command tank,\u2019\u201d says Work. This is his definition of a true lethal autonomous weapon system: an independent weapon that decides everything about who and what it destroys once a human has unleashed it.Darpa (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has a program called CODE, or Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment, to design sophisticated software that will allow groups of drones to work in closely coordinated teams, even in places where the enemy has been able to deny American forces access to GPS and other satellite-based communications. CODE \u201cis not intended to create autonomous weapons,\u201d says Paul Scharre, author of \u201cArmy of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War,\u201d but rather adapting to \u201ca world where we\u2019ll have groups of robots operating collaboratively together under one person in supervisory control. The program manager has compared it to wolves hunting in coordinated packs.\u201dCODE\u2019s human operators monitor the swarm without micromanaging it, and the autonomy of the drones means that they are programmed to improvise and adjust as they pursue their preset mission. \u201cThe idea here is that CODE is going after mobile or rapidly relocatable targets, so the target locations cannot be specified precisely in advance by humans,\u201d Scharre says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a Tomahawk cruise missile, where you just program in the coordinates and then the missile goes and strikes it. The drones have to be able to search an area and find targets on the move.\u201dA simpler autonomous system is the loitering munition: a drone that can fly for some time on its own, looking for specific signals, before finding a target and crashing into it with an explosive payload. Israel produces a loitering munition, dubbed the \u201cHarpy,\u201d which is designed to hunt out and destroy enemy radar stations and which became a sticking point in U.S.-Israeli relations when some were sold to China in the late 1990s. Companies in several nations, including Slovakia and the United States, have also produced loitering munitions.\u201cImagine that we are fighting in a city and we have a foe that is using human life indiscriminately as a human shield,\u201d says Tony Cerri, who until recently oversaw data science, models and simulations at the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. \u201cIt\u2019s constantly in your face as you\u2019re out walking in the street. You can\u2019t deal with every situation. You are going to make a mistake.\u201dAutonomous weapons, he suggests, are much less likely to make such mistakes: \u201cA robot, operating with milliseconds, looking at data that you can\u2019t even begin to conceive, is going to say this is the right time to use this kind of weapon to limit collateral damage.\u201d This argument parallels the controversial case for self-driving cars. In both instances, sensor-rich machines navigate a complex environment without the fatigue, distractions and other human fallibilities that can lead to fatal mistakes. Yet both arguments discount the emergent behaviors that can come from increasingly intelligent machines interpreting the world differently from humans.Even advocates concede that autonomous military robots could behave in new and unforeseen ways, inducing new errors \u2014 the way trading algorithms unleashed on the stock market can cause flash crashes or a pair of dueling book resellers\u2019 algorithms on Amazon could end up pricing a $70 biology text at $23 million, which happened in 2011. Those possibilities \u2014 and the danger that lethal machine errors could precipitate bloodier conflicts \u2014 will require close cooperative measures between robot-armed nations. Delegations to the United Nations have begun discussions on regulating lethal autonomous weapon systems under an existing Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which governs things ranging from booby traps to blinding lasers.In August, a United Nations working group set down principles that could be used to guide future international regulations on lethal autonomy. Chief among them is the idea of ensuring human responsibility for any weapon throughout its life cycle, which could create new liabilities for arms manufacturers. The United Nations group is set to release a formal report, with recommendations for future action, this month. Besides governments, the group\u2019s meetings attract their share of activists, like Mary Wareham of Human Rights Watch, who is the global coordinator for the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, an initiative launched in 2013 with the explicit mission of keeping humans in charge of lethal decisions in war.\u201cWe\u2019ve focused on two things that we want to see remain under meaningful, or appropriate, or adequate, or necessary human control,\u201d Wareham says. \u201cThat\u2019s the identification and selection of targets and then the use of force against them, lethal or otherwise.\u201d Those are the key decision points, critics say, where only a human\u2019s judgment \u2014 capable of discriminating between enemies and civilians, and keeping a sense of proportionality in responding \u2014 can be accountable and satisfy the conventions of war.The way in which we tend to justify war or condemn certain acts \u201chas to do with the fact that human beings are making decisions that are either moral or immoral,\u201d says Pauline Shanks Kaurin, a professor specializing in military ethics at the U.S. Naval War College. \u201cIf humans aren\u2019t making those decisions, if it\u2019s literally machines against machines, then it seems like then it\u2019s something else, right?\u201dFor Work, the question of morality might come down to America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cThere may be a place and time in the future where we\u2019re up against an opponent who is less worried about delegating lethal authority to a machine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s a long way off, and we have a lot of time to think about that and a lot of time to take action and make sure that we can still control all the weapons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Did they have you in mind for the role from the beginning?No, I don\u2019t believe so. I knew they were looking to bring this character back. And so I put myself forward and, quite rightly, they took it very seriously. They wanted to make sure they got the right person, and I went in and willingly played around in front of a camera so they could have a look at me. I wanted to audition the part just like they wanted to audition me \u2014 to get a sense of, \u201cCan I do this beloved role to millions?\u201dWhat insight did J.K. Rowling offer?She took me back through his childhood and how that emotion impacted this young man. One of the key relationships we talked about, of course, was with Gellert Grindelwald, and how that was formative in that it was intense, intimate, passionate. It was the first time Dumbledore met his match and, for a reason I can\u2019t divulge, they have this falling out. And it propels them in opposite directions and leaves this wound between them that is still open some 25 years later.And what did David Yates mean by Dumbledore not being \u201cexplicitly\u201d gay? Put it this way: This film is not about his homosexuality, nor does his sexuality define him. But that relationship is certainly a defining element of who he is and what he\u2019s about. I also don\u2019t think he\u2019s someone who has given his heart or his soul to many people. The aftermath of their relationship left him reeling, and he\u2019s packed his heart in ice, to be honest, and no one\u2019s quite thawed it.Is the world ready for a gay children\u2019s icon?I think the world is ready for it, and if it isn\u2019t, it bloody well should be.Is Johnny Depp going to be in the next film? [Amber Heard, Depp\u2019s ex-wife, accused him of physical abuse, an accusation he denies.]I believe so.Is there going to be a romance?I have no idea.In Brady Corbet\u2019s \u201cVox Lux,\u201d you\u2019re the grubby manager of Celeste, a school-shooting survivor turned pop star. Celeste reminded me of the Parkland, Fla., students who were simultaneously celebrated and vilified.It takes something that unfortunately is becoming a monthly occurrence and uses it as a starting point for a journey into our relationship with media, with celebrity, with music, with culture. You follow a survivor and the idea that surviving \u2014 or the celebrity that is put on her \u2014 is a curse. I would like to think that the victims of these awful scenarios would say, \u201cThank God someone is actually shining a light on it.\u201dIt\u2019s a terrible shame. I\u2019d love to see it. People worked really hard and put a lot in, obviously himself included.I didn\u2019t really want to get involved, to be honest. I just don\u2019t feel like it was my place to comment, and it\u2019s too delicate a situation. I feel like enough has been said about it. It\u2019s a private affair. [As for working with Allen again], I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d have to consider carefully.Has #MeToo prompted you to rethink the roles you choose?Getting pigeonholed as an actor is terrifying because you want to keep people guessing. So being the golden boy or the beautiful young thing clearly worries me because you think, What happens when my hair falls out, like it is, and I start getting old? The good news is I certainly felt like turning 40, I saw more opportunity to play against type or out of my comfort zone.Looks is a funny thing, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know \u2014 I just feel like there\u2019s so much more to talk about. Having said that, I\u2019m 45.

It could have created 50,000 high-paying jobs in a place with higher-than-average unemployment. It could have become the largest employer in a midsize city, or the central player in a new regional tech hub. That decision suits a company that has long worn its power and size in Seattle awkwardly.

{"Headline": "The Commonality of A.I. and Diversity", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow to create more diverse workplaces and how to use artificial intelligence ethically are among the more challenging dilemmas facing business and government.These topics were the subject of two separate task forces that met at last week\u2019s DealBook conference. Each task force, composed of about a dozen experts and industry leaders, met for an hour, emerging with some specific guidelines and focus areas that were shared with the conference and could be taken back to companies and other organizations for discussion.Companies must be aware of and recognize that algorithms are not neutral, but created by humans with biases and beliefs and make every effort to eliminate those biases.It is far too easy to assume that technology has an objectivity that humans don\u2019t. But the reality is that \u201cartificial intelligence and machine learning and algorithms in general are designed by none other than us \u2014 people,\u201d said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School.\u201cA.I. takes input data and races off to make inference and decision making about the world at lightening pace,\u201d he said, and those inferences will include unacknowledged biases unless people are willing to recognize them and invest the time and money to weed them out.Frida Polli, co-founder and chief executive of Pymetrics, which uses A.I. to recruit employees for companies, showed how biases could arise and how they could be diminished.Algorithms used in A.I. are created using training data sets. If a training data has an overrepresentation of any gender or ethnicity, the features that distinguish that group may be overweighted.To confront the problem, she said her company tested an algorithm on a reference group of people of different genders and ethnicities to check for bias. If there\u2019s an imbalance in the test run \u2014 far more men, for example, or whites are predicted to be good hires rather than women or other races \u2014 then \u201cwe can look at de-weighting features,\u201d she said, that alter the algorithm.Technology companies can and should help the government \u2014 and the military in particular \u2014 develop and use artificial intelligence, but it must be done thoughtfully and carefully.\u201cThe debate is ongoing about when and how to share technology with the government and specifically should companies share digital technology with the military,\u201d said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft.Most of the task force agreed that partnerships between technology companies and government on A.I. could be beneficial, but Serkan Piantino, founder and chief executive of Spell, a company that builds tools for those building A.I. technology, said there should be limits.\u201cAutomating the process to use lethal force is something I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable doing, given how little we know with what is going on with A.I. algorithms,\u201d he said.A.I. requires transparency within the companies building and using it and with the public.Having company employees debate and speak out on potentially controversial issues involving A.I. \u2014 such as at Microsoft \u2014 is one form of transparency. Dennis Crowley, co-founder and executive chairman of Foursquare, said his company had internal discussions when making business decisions that might have ethical implications.\u201cSometimes we have the opportunity to create more evil than good, and we need to talk about that,\u201d he said. One example, he said, was whether his company would work with fast-food chains that wanted to target those using cannabis dispensaries where it was legal. It hadn\u2019t been done before.\u201cThis was right on the edge, so we went to the ethics committee,\u201d Mr. Crowley said. In the end, \u201cwe decided to do the campaign. It was legal and clever and a good use of technology around a category where we don\u2019t see a lot of advertising.\u201dCordell Schachter, the chief technology officer for the New York City Transportation Department, noted that transparency would be crucial with those creating the city\u2019s future transportation technology, which would be driven by A.I.\u201cWe want to see the data \u2014 and not cherry-picked data \u2014 before it goes on the streets,\u201d he said.Companies should set targets and goals, along with incentives, as a way to foster a more diverse staff, but they shouldn\u2019t be used in a vacuum.\u201cAspirational goals are important, but \u201c it\u2019s just not enough,\u201d said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say you want to get the world or your company to 50-50 \u2014 there needs to be transparency around that.\u201dThat means what specifically is the goal, and what is the company doing to achieve that goal \u2014 \u201cboth good and bad,\u201d she said.\u201cThere is a growing body of evidence that suggests cognitive diversity contributes to better decision making at the board level,\u201d said Cyrus Taraporevala, president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. \u201cStudies show that diverse boards pay more attention to risk management and are less susceptible to cronyism and group think.\u201dBut there\u2019s a danger that goals become items to be checked rather than real change. Damien Hooper-Campbell, chief diversity officer at eBay, said that while setting goals and targets for diversity was important \u2014 and backing it up with real costs, such as bonus deductions, if the goals aren\u2019t met \u2014 you also have to \u201cmeet a company where it is.\u201dIf a company has just begun to focus on diversifying its work force, it needs to be educated on how to do it over time, he said. \u201cPeople talk about how businesses measure widgets and productivity, so they can measure this, too. But there\u2019s a big difference between widgets and human beings.\u201dFederal policies and legislation can play a role in promoting diversity in the workplace.Developing laws and policy to create diversity is not always a popular idea, but some say they believe that there are areas where government can help. John Hope Bryant, founder and chairman of Operation HOPE, a community organization, said there was a need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships. When the effort is aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get double credit for that double reach.\u201dA federal policy to encourage paid family leave would also play a crucial role in promoting diversity, said Sallie Krawcheck, chief executive and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial adviser for women.Federal policy could also help ensure that the information companies report on the makeup of their work forces and the compensation are truly transparent. For example, in Britain, many public-, private- and voluntary-sector companies are required to disclose average pay for men and women, including bonuses.In the United States, said Lauren Taylor Wolfe, managing partner of Impactive Capital, \u201ca lot of companies decide what they disclose and what not to disclose. If it\u2019s not done by level, it\u2019s not real transparency.\u201dTo be truly diverse and inclusive, a company must change its culture \u2014 and that has to come from the top down.\u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it, it will be an organ reject,\u201d said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase.Or as Ms. Taylor Wolfe noted, \u201ccompanies get what they celebrate, and if they celebrate diversity, they\u2019ll get it.\u201dNo one expects cultural change to happen quickly, but one of the important elements, Ms. Duckett said, is that bosses need to \u201cmanage to the difference.\u201d Don\u2019t manage everyone the same and expect the same results.After all, parents don\u2019t expect each child to be the same \u2014 they parent differently depending on a child\u2019s personality, strengths and weaknesses, she said. Managers have to do the same.She also noted that diversity was not the same as inclusion and companies must be aware of that. \u201cDiversity,\u201d she said, \u201cis being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance.\u201dFinally, change may seem glacially slow, but Mr. Hooper-Campbell said people shouldn\u2019t be surprised. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t but 100 years ago that I couldn\u2019t go to school with some of the people in this room.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Many residents were angered after the presentation of the deal last week at a news conference, leading to at least one protest.Those in favor of the agreement, politicians and residents, have said that the economic benefits from the deal would far outstrip the cost in tax breaks and a $500 million state grant that were offered to Amazon. The roll out suffered, said one person familiar with the negotiations, because state and city officials were only told 18 hours before the official announcement that the deal was done.State officials are now promising to hold a public meeting about Amazon next month.Meanwhile, state and city officials have been quietly trying to cajole opponents into supporting the deal by phone and in person.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that some regret was expressed about how things were handled\u201d during the rollout of the Amazon deal, said Mr. Van Bramer, describing his meeting on Monday with top officials from the state\u2019s economic development arm, Empire State Development, including its president, Howard Zemsky.

The committee could not alter the incentive package, but it could have a say in the shape of the buildings that will house Amazon. In Long Island, a similar committee helped limit the height of a new hotel as part of a development near the Belmont racetrack.Mr. Zemsky said in a statement that the committee was the \u201cbest way to achieve maximum benefits\u201d for the community. \u201cWe want input from everyone,\u201d he added.Eric F. Phillips, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s press secretary, said that City Hall remains \u201ccommitted to engaging local stakeholders.\u201d\u201cObviously I\u2019m not for the heliport; Nobody is for the heliport,\u201d she said of helicopter landing rights included in the deal for Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos. She said she would advocate for community meeting space, walk-in access for job applicants and no employee cafeteria \u2014 so Amazon workers could be encouraged to eat in the neighborhood.None of the state officials involved in the deal felt that it was rolled out in an ideal manner, said a person with direct knowledge of the conversations. A prime reason, the person said, was the roughly 18-hour window between when Amazon confirmed to them that the deal was done and when the company issued its news release officially making the agreement public.\u201cIf you were a councilman, you would complain if you hadn\u2019t been brought in?\u201d Mr. Louis asked, referring to the negotiations.\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d the mayor replied. \u201cBut I also would say that some things are truly exceptional.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018We Don\u2019t Do the Black Friday Madness\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "In rural Pennsylvania, the family-owned department store Dunham\u2019s caters to those who feel left behind by e-commerce or simply prefer to do their shopping at a slower pace. Supported byThe \u201c33 hour\u201d sale at Dunham\u2019s begins the morning after Thanksgiving and lasts through Monday, when the local schools are closed for deer-hunting season. There are no giant sales on flat-screen televisions or stockpiles of the hottest holiday toy. The big draw is the hot chocolate and the chance to win a $100 gift card.Change comes slowly to Dunham\u2019s, one of the few small family-owned department stores still operating in the United States. The store was founded in the early 1900s in Wellsboro, Pa., a town of about 3,200 people surrounded by dairy farms, fracking fields and woods.\u201cWe don\u2019t do the Black Friday madness,\u2019\u2019 said Nancy Dunham, 75, who runs the store with her husband and two daughters. \u201cWe are trying to offer something different.\u201dThe Dunham family, now in its fourth generation as retailers, has created a niche with shoppers who feel left behind by e-commerce, or choose to opt out of it.Dunham\u2019s draws from a 50-mile radius in north central Pennsylvania, a region that is home to many older people who don\u2019t typically shop online. Many regular customers do not have home computers, tablets or smartphones. The store also attracts tourists and retirees who have moved to the area.Dunham\u2019s occupies three adjoining buildings on Main Street of varying heights and design that reflect the store\u2019s history, but also its continuity. The largest of the storefronts, a three-story building constructed during the Great Depression, carries the family name chiseled into the concrete facade.On a snowy morning the week before Thanksgiving, the scent of cinnamon rolls warming in the cafe wafted through every nook of the store\u2019s 35,000 square feet. Shoppers trickled in from the cold: A man browsed for sweaters, a woman looked for winter boots for her mother, and Jim Rice hunted for a lined flannel shirt in a black and yellow pattern.Mr. Rice thinks nothing of driving 28 miles from his home near the New York border to browse at Dunham\u2019s.Mr. Rice worked for 55 years in a glass company warehouse in Elmira, N.Y., while also taking care of his wife, who had Alzheimer\u2019s. She died last year on Christmas night.\u201cI always liked this store,\u201d said Mr. Rice, 77. \u201cThey know how to treat you.\u201dDunham\u2019s has tried to build its business around local needs and tastes.The town considered the plant so important, residents said, that people used to take turns climbing to the top of a hotel roof to scout for German planes that might want to bomb it.Those days are long gone. Dairy farming is struggling and the glass factory has closed. The area, home to a natural mountain gorge billed as the \u201cGrand Canyon of Pennsylvania,\u201d attracts tourists during the warmer months, second homeowners and hunters. But the winter months are slow.Fracking \u2014 the process of extracting natural oil and gas by shooting water and other fluids deep underground \u2014 has helped pump money into the economy. But workers in that industry tend to stay in town for a few weeks at a time and then go home to their families in other states. The gas companies supply many of the workers with gear and clothing, which means they don\u2019t usually shop at Dunham\u2019s.With no hope for a boom that could transform the local economy, the store takes small steps to try to stoke sales. When large retailers cut back on an older women\u2019s clothing line, known for polyester pants with elastic waistbands and shortened cuffs, Dunham\u2019s expanded its offerings.\u201cMy customer, the little old lady, is being forgotten,\u201d said Nancy Dunham\u2019s daughter Ann Dunham Rawson. \u201cOther companies don\u2019t think that type clothing is much fun.\u201dThe bankruptcies of national chains like Sears and Bon-Ton are driving traffic to Dunham\u2019s, too. But the demise of those large stores also means fewer suppliers of affordable clothing, which makes it harder for Dunham\u2019s to locate product. Ms. Rawson came of age in retail of the 1990s, when consumerism was at its peak.\u201cPeople just bought everything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the brakes have been put on that. They don\u2019t want to own stuff that sits around the house collecting dust. They want experiences.\u201dAfter college, she went to work for Lord & Taylor in Raleigh, N.C. Within a few years, her father, John Dunham, asked her to come home.She hesitated at first, leery of returning to rural Pennsylvania at age 25. But she wanted to work alongside her mother and father, an experienced merchant and merchandiser.The store has survived a flood, fire and a tornado. But the most difficult period came during the past few years.\u201cI am struggling with who our men\u2019s customer is,\u201d Ms. Rawson said.Women\u2019s clothing can be equally confounding. Ms. Rawson said Wellsboro had never been a \u201clittle black dress\u201d type of town. Ms. Mahosky studied dance in college and now works at a car dealership nearby. She shopped at Dunham\u2019s as a child and realized how much she missed the store when she moved away.\u201cI think my generation is craving that experience of not being overwhelmed by technology,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am probably a bit of anomaly.\u201dTo Ms. Rawson, 2016 and 2017 was the \u201cthis is it\u201d moment, when the store\u2019s future seemed most in doubt. Her father, 81, was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, and both of his brothers, who were also involved in the business, died.The family spent months applying to Starbucks for the right to sell its coffee in the cafe. It\u2019s now the only place selling Starbucks for many miles, attracting gas workers who line up in their fire-retardant jumpsuits and big boots for drinks topped with whipped cream and drizzled with caramel.\u201cThe things you see in a small town,\u201d said Nancy Dunham, chuckling.That coffee brought Mary Murphy, 70, and Nancy Szabo, 72, to Dunham\u2019s last week. The two friends sat by the cafe window overlooking Main Street, deep in quiet conversation. They were talking, as they do every Tuesday, about dreams.Their \u201cdream group\u201d meets weekly, often in the cafe in Dunham\u2019s. They spend an hour trying to help each other interpret what their dreams might mean. \u201cWrite down every dream you remember in a loose leaf notebook and put the date on the top,\u201d Ms. Murphy said. \u201cThe vivid dreams are the important ones.\u201dAfter their discussions, Ms. Szabo and Ms. Murphy sometimes like to go shopping. Ms. Murphy, who grew up in Wellsboro, likes to buy toys and takes them to her grandchildren in St. Louis. Ms. Szabo, who retired to the area from New Jersey, said that a sales clerk had recently complimented her on her looks when she held a shirt up in the mirror.Dunham\u2019s employs as many as 50 people during the busier months, many of them part time. The store hires mostly older workers who want to supplement their Social Security income. Nancy Dunham said it would be difficult for a younger person with a family to live on the store\u2019s starting hourly wage of $7.25, which is Pennsylvania\u2019s minimum.Mrs. Dunham said the store cannot afford to compete with large retailers on wages and benefits. \u201cWe are at the bottom of the pay scale,\u201d she said.Connie Cumiskey, 66, works in the card and gift department at Dunham\u2019s, and said she depends on it to support herself and the six cats she adopted.Ms. Cumiskey, who does not own a computer or smartphone, has never bought anything online. She worries that the younger generation has no interest in shopping in stores.She loves selling greeting cards like the ones with brightly colored songbirds \u201cso pretty you could frame them.\u201d But with fewer people sending cards, the store is cutting back on inventory.\u201cIt\u2019s a tough time to be in retail,\u201d Ms. Cumiskey said.While the Dunhams watch the industry warily, they aren\u2019t swayed by what everyone else is doing. They still have no deadline for starting online sales. \u201cI hope people want to keep interacting with each other in brick and mortar stores,\u201d Nancy Dunham said. \u201cIt\u2019s one way we learn from one another. It frightens me to think of a world without it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Fallout Ruptures Democrats\u2019 Longtime Alliance With Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut those tensions burst into open warfare this past week after revelations that Facebook executives had withheld evidence of Russian activity on the platform for far longer than previously disclosed, while employing a Republican-linked opposition research firm to discredit critics and the billionaire George Soros, a major Democratic Party patron.Democrats now face a painful reckoning with longtime friends in the tech industry, relationships girded by mutual interest in issues like immigration and cemented with millions of dollars in campaign contributions.It reinforced criticism from the left \u2014 by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, among others \u2014 that Amazon, Facebook and Google are unaccountable monopolies, digital analogues to the railroad trusts of the Gilded Age.And it complicated life for tech\u2019s remaining allies in the party, such as Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a voracious fund-raiser and a tech booster whose relationship with Facebook goes back almost a decade.\u201cI think 2016 exposed the dark side of technology,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, a Bay Area Democrat. Widely considered friendly with the tech industry, Mr. Khanna criticized Facebook on Friday for its aggressive tactics, and said the company should \u201ccertainly fire the people who were in any way involved in the decision to peddle opposition research.\u201dThe clash intensified on Friday when four Democratic senators wrote to the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to provide more details about Facebook\u2019s lobbying activities. The lawmakers also raised a potentially more explosive issue: whether Facebook had ever used its own data and platform against critics.\u201cWe need to know if Facebook, or any entity affiliated with or hired by Facebook, ever used any of the vast financial and data resources available to them to retaliate against their critics, including elected officials who were scrutinizing them,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of the Democrats who wrote the letter.\u201cAs more and more information comes out about how these guys operate, it\u2019s becoming conventional wisdom among Democrats that there is a serious policy problem here,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated.\u201cThese companies are not credible,\u201d Mr. Stoller added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s becoming clear to Democrats that they aren\u2019t friends \u2014 they are the problem.\u201dFacebook cut ties with the opposition research firm this past week even as executives there denied acting improperly.\u201dOur strategy was to shore up the security on Facebook and make major investments there,\u201d said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, in an interview with CBS on Friday. \u201cIt was not what I was doing, nor was it the company\u2019s strategy, to deflect, to deny or to hire P.R. firms to do things.\u201dBut Facebook and other tech companies now face increasing criticism from within their own ranks. In an interview, Marc Benioff, the billionaire co-founder of the software company Salesforce and a major donor to Democratic causes, said his industry faced \u201ca tension between trust and growth.\u201d\u201cThese companies are going to have to recognize that they have to change,\u201d Mr. Benioff added. \u201cAnd the C.E.O.s have to change. And if they don\u2019t change, those C.E.O.s will be removed by boards and by shareholders.\u201dNo Democrat embodies the tensions between tech and Washington like Mr. Schumer himself. In 2011, he joined Ms. Sandberg to announce the opening of the company\u2019s first East Coast engineering office, in New York City, where he had worked to promote start-ups and other tech businesses.In 2015, Ms. Sandberg co-hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Schumer in her Bay Area home, according to a Facebook employee briefed on the event. (The same trip featured a Schumer fund-raiser held by Bruce Sewell, then Apple\u2019s general counsel, and attended by Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, according to an executive who declined to be named.).By the end of the 2016 cycle, Mr. Schumer had raised more money from Facebook employees than any other Washington lawmaker. All told, Senate Democrats have benefited from over $3 million in political contributions from Facebook\u2019s employees and founders over the years.Relations began to cool after the 2016 elections, when evidence mounted that Facebook and YouTube had become fertile ground for foreign interference and domestic misinformation, threatening not only the party\u2019s values but also its electoral prospects.Early last year, Senator Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat, walked over to the Capitol to deliver a warning to Mr. Schumer, newly elected as Democratic minority leader.Mr. Tester\u2019s warning grabbed the attention of Mr. Schumer and other Democrats, who began to press Facebook and other social media companies to fix the problem.Disinformation was a particular focus for Mr. Schumer, according to an aide with knowledge of the senator\u2019s thinking. In March last year, Mr. Schumer summoned Adam Mosseri, then a vice president overseeing Facebook\u2019s News Feed feature, for a briefing on how the company would limit the spread of bogus news and propaganda. He later sent two aides to Silicon Valley to keep pressure on executives at Facebook, Google and Twitter.But as it became clear that the companies had understated their problems \u2014 and were moving slowly to fix them \u2014 the senator steered a middle course. When he and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, unveiled the party\u2019s \u201cBetter Deal\u201d platform for the midterm elections, a proposal to attack \u201ccorporate monopolies\u201d focused on airlines, beer companies and eyeglass makers.\u201cI am more sympathetic because I think they\u2019re in very difficult position and I worry about government regulation,\u201d he said.Mr. Warner\u2019s growing focus on privacy concerns led to a clash with Mr. Schumer, who confronted Mr. Warner in July, The Times reported this week, warning him to back off Facebook.Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said that the senator \u201cworried that Facebook would bow to pressure from Republicans, who oppose the purging of the fake accounts and bots, and has urged Senator Warner and the Senate Intelligence Committee to make this the priority in their ongoing investigation of the company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important for Facebook to recognize that this isn\u2019t a public relations problem \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental challenge for the platform and their business model,\u201d Mr. Warner said.Facebook previously signaled that it was ready to work with Mr. Warner and others in Congress on new regulation. Yet at the same time, Facebook turned to a conservative opposition research firm that sought to undermine detractors by publicizing financial links to Mr. Soros, a harsh critic of both Facebook and Google.\u201cTheir mantra has been, \u2018We\u2019re different, we\u2019re special, we\u2019re tech, all we do is good,\u2019\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee that oversees consumer protection and data security. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to find out, very graphically, that they do a lot of harm, and in fact they cover up the harm they do.\u201dHe added, \u201cTech is now like every other industry, in my view.\u201dJack Nicas and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon, Apple and Facebook Once Led the Market. Now They Are Driving It Down.", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs concerns about growth and privacy issues took a toll, technology and banking stocks led a slide in Europe, and futures indicated that markets in the United States could follow.The mighty tech titans and their seemingly endless pipeline of profits, which powered one of the longest bull markets in stocks, are looking a little less invincible. Shares of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, are down more than 10 percent since the market peaked, while Facebook and Amazon have dropped more than 20 percent.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing extreme selling in the only favored area that everybody ran to,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a slowdown underway globally,\u201d said James Bianco, president of financial market research firm Bianco Research in Chicago. \u201cThe U.S. has definitely been stronger than the rest of the world. But the fear is, that can\u2019t hold. If the rest of the world slows down, that will eventually slow us, too.\u201dThe potential for higher borrowing costs is also weighing on smaller companies that often borrow money by issuing floating rate debt, which can become more difficult to pay off as interest rates rise. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks is down 14 percent from its high. \u201cThis is simply a continuation of the recent repricing of risk, or growth scare, that we\u2019ve basically been seeing since the end of September,\u201d said Talley Leger, an equity strategist with Oppenheimer Funds. When the stock market hit its peak in September, technology had led the way, accounting for 50 percent of the gains for the year. The tech giants, at first, seemed immune to the sell-off that followed on broader economic worries. Not anymore. Through Friday, roughly a quarter of the market\u2019s decline since September was because of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet, according to data collected by S&P Capital IQ. The sharp sell-off on Monday will only add to that tally. Investors appear especially focused on any signs that extraordinary profits generated by these giant tech companies are under threat. Whether technology stocks can slough off the worries will depend, in part, on whether the companies can continue to deliver strong earnings growth even if the global economy does soften significantly. Recent earnings reports from major tech companies have done little to reassure investors. Since Apple\u2019s share price peaked at just over $232 on Oct. 3, the stock has plummeted by nearly 20 percent, lopping more than $200 billion off the company\u2019s market value. Its shares were down nearly 4 percent Monday.Amazon reported a slowdown in its core retail revenue growth in late October, sending the shares lower. To investors, who often view revenue numbers as a good gauge of the strength of demand in the economy, that was more important than the $2.9 billion in profit the company reported.But if they actually produce the numbers that Wall Street analysts expect, the recent slump in large technology stocks could present a buying opportunity for some investors. Key valuation measures of Apple and Alphabet hit multiyear highs this summer. But the recent drop has left those valuations substantially lower. Prices of Facebook and Amazon are relatively low compared with expected profits, meaning these stocks look \u201ccheap\u201d for certain investors. But they might have to get even cheaper before investors are tempted to snap them up. That\u2019s why some expect the sentiment in the market to get much worse before stocks can resume their climb. \u201cI\u2019m sort of looking for a little more bearishness,\u201d said King Lip, chief strategist at the wealth management company Baker Avenue. An earlier version of this article misstated which company Alphabet is the parent company of. It is Google, not Apple.Advertisement"}

Ms. Greene will remain a board director at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet.Ms. Greene, a widely respected technologist and entrepreneur, said that after leaving Google Cloud, she planned to help female founders of companies by investing in and mentoring them.Ms. Greene joined Google in 2015 when it acquired Bebop, a start-up she had founded, for $380 million.She is best known as a co-founder and former chief executive of VMware, whose software for juggling many programs across many computers is widely used in corporate data centers.

{"Headline": "Why Amazon Wants to Buy 22 Regional Sports Networks", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon is reportedly interested in buying nearly two dozen regional sports networks. That would be a bold gamble on the future of how viewers consume sports content.But what does Amazon want with 22 sports networks?The simplified logic runs like this: At a time when pay TV is in decline, sports content drives viewership across platforms. Owning rights to big franchises would help Amazon market its Prime program (which costs $119 a year), especially if that membership included access to those games. That, in turn, could add more revenue, as Prime members tend to buy more on Amazon.Growth in the number of Amazon Prime members in the United States has slowed recently. It hit 97 million members this year, up from about 90 million last year, according to an estimate from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. A pickup in membership growth would be welcome.Amazon has some experience with sports broadcasts. It streams \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d on Prime, for which it paid $130 million for two years. But $20 billion is a big price tag. So why would Amazon pay up for a business in which it has little experience? The answer is complicated.Regional sports networks are effectively the middlemen of sports rights. They are paid by cable and satellite companies that carry the network, but the network also has to pay teams for rights to broadcast their games. The problem is that cable and satellite companies want to pay less to carry these networks, because fewer people are paying for television these days, while sports teams are looking to receive higher fees.There are bargaining tools that some companies could employ to make owning the middlemen worthwhile. A big media company, like Fox, could bundle the regional sports network with other channels, like Fox News, to get higher rates, making up for the corresponding increase in rights fees. Local TV station owners, like Sinclair or Tegna, both of which are also interested in Fox\u2019s regional sports channels, could use a similar tactic, by bundling local news broadcasts with a regional sports network.But Amazon doesn\u2019t have such leverage, which may not matter.One theory is Amazon could take the games off the cable and satellite systems and make them exclusively available to Prime members. There are two problems with that idea. First, Fox has already negotiated agreements for its 22 regional sports networks with most of the major pay-TV carriers. Those contracts will have to be honored for the next three to five years. Second, even after those contracts run out, team owners may not want to limit the visibility of their games to a single online service, even \u2014 or, perhaps, especially \u2014 if it\u2019s Amazon.Another option would be for Amazon to make games available to Prime subscribers in addition to the local cable system. That way team owners don\u2019t lose out on audience. But the cable operators are sure to balk. They likely don\u2019t want to carry a regional sports network that a Prime subscriber could get for less than $10 a month. And if the pay-TV operators refused to carry the networks, Amazon would face owners unhappy about their teams\u2019 lack of visibility.So why would Amazon want to spend so much for a business that could come undone in the next few years? The obvious answer is that Amazon expects \u2014 or plans to create \u2014 disruption.Streaming could become the dominant media business in the next few years, which could mean that streaming companies become the leading sports broadcasters if they line up the right deals. (Amazon could aim to win exclusive rights for Monday and Sunday N.F.L. games when they come up for renewal around 2021.) And while that may be risky, Amazon does know a thing or two about how to dominate a business. Ask anyone.Advertisement"}

I know right then \u2014 which way too often is in the middle of the night \u2014 that my vomiting child probably has a stomach virus, and that our family has just begun another weeklong round of ring-around-the-toilet. First it\u2019ll be my son, then my daughter, then me, then my husband. My symptoms, for some reason, are the worst. The first time my husband saw me with a stomach bug, he said, \u201cI really thought you were going to die.\u201dIf you can, quarantine the sick. Keep them home, of course, and ideally in one part of the house. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to have a home with multiple bathrooms, designate one as the \u201csick\u201d one that healthy family members don\u2019t use.If that\u2019s not possible, or if everyone has to share a bathroom, \u201cI would not call it overkill to clean surfaces every time\u201d a sick person uses the toilet, said Mary Wikswo, viral epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This means cleaning the toilet, the handle, the sink, the doorknob \u2014 anything that a sick person or his or her fluids might have touched. Close the toilet lid before every flush, too, and maybe even flush a second time after pouring in a half cup to a cup of bleach.A little-known fact about noroviruses is that many household cleaners and wipes don\u2019t kill them. Clorox and Lysol Disinfecting wipes claim to kill 99.9 percent of viruses and bacteria, but that doesn\u2019t include noroviruses. Your best bet is to wipe down surfaces with a bleach solution \u2014 mix between a half cup and cup of bleach with a gallon of water \u2014 or to use health-care-grade bleach wipes, such as Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes, which are hard to find in stores but are sold on websites like Amazon. Let the bleach sit on the surface for at least five minutes, ideally 10, because it takes time to kill these resilient jerks. Hydrogen peroxide cleaners are another effective option.If a family member doesn\u2019t make it to the toilet in time, you\u2019ll have to clean up even more carefully. Angela Fraser, a researcher at Clemson University who studies vomit and fecal cleanup strategies (seriously!), suggests that you wear disposable gloves and goggles. Dr. Perencevich said a face mask is good, too, because it keeps you from touching your mouth. In any case, \u201creally concentrate on not touching your face while you\u2019re doing all this,\u201d he says.To keep the viruses from becoming airborne as you clean, cover the fluid with paper towels, or shake kitty litter or sawdust on it, before scooping it all into a plastic bag. Then close it with a twist tie and dispose of it. Scrub the area with soap and water and then disinfect it with one of the cleaners mentioned above.If you have to disinfect a rug or upholstered furniture, you probably can\u2019t use bleach because it will cause color damage. If you have a steam cleaner, use it for five minutes at 170 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Fraser said. Dr. Perencevich said that another option is to spray it with a hydrogen peroxide cleaner after testing that it won\u2019t cause damage.Speaking of things that don\u2019t kill noroviruses: Drinking grape juice or apple cider vinegar won\u2019t keep you healthy, despite what friends may have told you. (I know, I really wanted to believe it, too.) These \u201ccures\u201d supposedly work because they change the pH of the stomach, making it too acidic for noroviruses to grow. But \u201cnorovirus grows in the small intestine, so changing the stomach environment is really not going to do you much good,\u201d Dr. Wikswo said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Amazon\u2019s HQ2 Winners Look Like, Before Amazon ", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCrystal City in Virginia and Long Island City in Queens are about to become home to an internet giant. They will probably never appear the same again.Instead of one new home, Amazon chose two. Two places, with waterfront views and organic shops and abandoned buildings, that will someday house tens of thousands of high-tech workers.We spent much of this week in those two places, Crystal City in Arlington, Va., and Long Island City in Queens, to capture life there as Amazon named them the winners of a 14-month-long beauty contest for its new headquarters.Together, the two areas \u2014 both are neighborhoods, not actually cities \u2014 could help make Amazon one of the largest private tech employers on the East Coast. Once Amazon fully moves in, neither will likely be the same. Long Island City is home to the country\u2019s largest public housing project. But for many walking along the park in the area that hugs the East River, what stands out are the shiny new high-rises, baby stores, coffee shops and yoga studios. Since 2010, more apartment buildings have been built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in New York. Apartments in dozens of the new buildings sell for an average of over $1 million.That same number of people, earning the same amount of money, are expected to fill Amazon\u2019s offices in Crystal City by 2030.Crystal City, just across the Potomac River from Washington, was the vision of a local developer, Robert Smith, who in the 1960s began to construct commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums on lots once occupied by industrial buildings and junkyards. The neighborhood was named for a crystal chandelier that Mr. Smith hung in the first building. Over the last dozen years, many of the neighborhood\u2019s prominent tenants left, sending Crystal City into a prolonged decline and leaving it without a strong residential or commercial identity. But a recent boom in the Washington region has helped fuel some redevelopment in and around Crystal City, which Amazon, like the local officials who pitched the area to the company, has started referring to as National Landing.In the end, Amazon said, it chose these two places, out of more than 200 that had thrown their hats in the ring, because of the talent it could recruit. And with an army of well-paid workers will come amenities. A short walk from Amazon\u2019s future headquarters in Crystal City is a new Whole Foods market, which is owned by Amazon, and a bar and restaurant that features a drag night. In Long Island City, bars line a main commercial strip that\u2019s home to a Michelin-starred Mexican restaurant and a trendy chicken and waffle restaurant owned by the rapper Nas.The hope over time, for the officials who made the pitch, is that Amazon will help cement their neighborhoods as destinations, with easy access to transportation, large supplies of housing and enough interesting things to do that they\u2019ll no longer be overshadowed by Washington and Manhattan just across the water.Karen Weise, Corey Kilgannon and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Facebook, Apple and Amazon have endured the greatest declines, all down $250 billion or more from their respective peaks.That is a marked reversal for one of the most popular trades on Wall Street. Investors piled into shares of the largest tech companies, betting their revenue would continue to grow strongly as these behemoths upended industries from retail to communication to media.By the end of August, the market value of Apple and Amazon had each surpassed $1 trillion, and Alphabet was flirting with $900 billion. The combined market value of the five had reached $3.6 trillion.But worries about global economic growth as well as lackluster earnings and outlooks the past two quarters have shaken investors\u2019 confidence. In particular, concerns have mounted about how many new iPhones Apple will manage to sell. Facebook has spent much of the year mired in scandal, raising the specter that the United States government will tighten regulation of big tech. All of that has investors questioning whether the values of these big tech companies have become too lofty.Of course, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet have faced steep sell-offs before, only to bounce back quickly. Just this year, the combined market value of those five companies has tumbled 7 percent or more during three separate periods. In each instance, the stocks resumed their march to fresh highs within weeks.The question now, though, is whether this time will be different.An earlier version of this article misstated the combined market value of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet at the end of August.

{"Headline": "In Brazil, Animals Cross a Road of No Return", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHighway BR-262 is among the deadliest in the world for wildlife. Biologist Wagner Fischer has been monitoring its grim toll for more than two decades.Whenever Wagner Fischer drives, he notices the roadkill.As a graduate student in the 1990s, Dr. Fischer, now a biologist with the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, traveled through Brazil\u2019s Pantanal, a tropical wetland the size of Wisconsin, and the largest freshwater wetland in the world. From his motorcycle, he saw monkeys swinging from roadside trees; capybaras slept on the shoulder. He was looking for fishing bats, the subject of his graduate research. But he was fascinated and appalled by the roadside carnage: caimans, anacondas, giant black-necked storks called jabirus and, once, a dead giant anteater with her cub, still alive, clutching her back. The region\u2019s main road, the BR-262, is a long thread of tarmac through the carpet of green, connecting the growing cities of Campo Grande and Corumb\u00e1, 430 miles apart. Dr. Fischer began taking photographs, thousands of them, and tallying the species along the road. He shared his unpublished results with other researchers and government officials. \u201cEveryone from the scientific community kept asking me, \u2018When are you going to publish that?\u2019\u201d Mr. Fischer recalled recently. The highway rises from the surrounding wetlands like an island, tempting wildlife, Dr. Fischer said: \u201cIt\u2019s a trap for fauna, and they don\u2019t know the risk.\u201dThe Pantanal is filigreed with rivers and streams that flood during the rainy season. Much of it is enclosed in the southwestern state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which increasingly is quilted with cattle ranches and soybean farms. Over the years, Dr. Fischer\u2019s colleagues began noticing a steady rise in the roadkill figures.Throughout Brazil, roads are littered with carcasses representing the country\u2019s 1,775 bird species and 623 mammal species. Large mammals are at greater risk in southern Brazil, including the Pantanal and dry savanna, whereas birds are at higher risk in the Amazon, according to Manuela Gonz\u00e1lez-Su\u00e1rez, a biologist at the University of Reading in England. \u201cWhen I got the total number, I was just completely blown away,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez-Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cOut of these 8 million birds, maybe some of those are fairly common ones, where maybe this is not a problem. But we don\u2019t know, exactly. Are we going to lose all birds in Brazil? Probably no. But it would be nice to know, what should we be worried about?\u201dEcologists worry that the problem will soon worsen. Brazil is home to 20 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity, but the newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to develop large tracts of the country\u2019s most ecologically sensitive areas. Now that Mr. Fischer\u2019s data are in the scientific literature, other researchers can more easily compare it with current data and identify trends, said Arnaud Desbiez, a conservation biologist with the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, and a co-author of the 2017 study. Dr. Desbiez also runs Brazil\u2019s Giant Armadillo Conservation Project and a related program called Anteaters and Highways. Ideally, he said, the data would inform government efforts to lessen the carnage. Over the years, Dr. Fischer has shared his unpublished data with state officials and urged them, to little effect, to build a system of bridges and underpasses that would let animals cross roads safely.\u201cFischer\u2019s data were very complete, and it was a very well done study, so it\u2019s sad to see that it hasn\u2019t been used as much as it should have,\u201d Dr. Desbiez said. \u201cA lot of things he suggested have not been implemented. This is not a new problem, but something he demonstrated existed a long time ago.\u201dDr. Fischer said: \u201cEcologists are very worried. The authorities pretend to be worried.\u201dBrazilian officials have taken some basic measures. White metal signs, bearing silhouettes of armadillos and giant anteaters, appear on the roadside every few miles, advising motorists to \u201cRespect Wild Life\u201d and \u201cPreserve the Pantanal.\u201d But signs are easily ignored, especially in the rush of freight-hauling and daily life, ecologists say. Dr. Desbiez favors fencing that keeps animals off the pavement and guides them toward safe passages under or over the road.Fraser Shilling, director of the Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis, helped develop a real-time deer-collision map, which connects to a car or phone app that can warn drivers when to be on high alert. A recent seminar that taught other officials how to build their such maps drew representatives from 42 states, Dr. Shilling said.Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez-Su\u00e1rez is now studying individual species to figure out the impact on local populations. For mammals, especially those who reproduce slowly and in small numbers, the loss of a few individuals could have devastating effects, Mr. Desbiez noted.Monitoring roadkill is important for more than accounting purposes, said Dr. Shilling. Roads are the primary way in which most people interact with wildlife, yet traffic collisions with animals are wildly underreported, he said. Measuring the scale of death is a way to remind people that our footprint is much larger than the carbon dioxide we emit or the waste we produce.\u201cThe first part is discovering that there is a problem,\u201d he said.Dr. Gonzalez-Suarez said that deforestation poses a greater threat to Amazonian biodiversity than a new road does, but the two are linked, she added; new roads are built to harvest wood, and to transport grain and livestock from expanding farmlands.\u201cFor me, the biggest concern as a conservation biologist is the loss of habitat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see roads as necessary, but we need to acknowledge they come with a cost. These are animals that should not be killed. They are only dying because there is a road in there and we drive on it.\u201dDr. Fischer so far has avoided hitting any large animals in his travels, but a couple of birds have not been so fortune. He once struck a seriema, a terrestrial bird that resembles a roadrunner on stilts, and he collided with a parakeet while riding his motorcycle. He hopes that his historical record can help other biologists, and other Brazilians, reckon with the destructive capability of the roads they\u2019re on.\u201cBrazil is a big country with a lot of problems to solve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are trying to make a difference.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Profusion of Diagnoses. That\u2019s Good and Bad.", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDoctorsWith millions of Americans taking risky medications for questionable diagnoses, have we medicalized everyday life?I recently cared for a hairdresser who had gone through a year of vague and varied symptoms. What started as a few unpleasant aches soon became debilitating pain throughout her body. A heavy fatigue settled into her bones: Holding scissors or sweeping the floor became too much. She slept fitfully; her memory flagged. Frustrated by many symptoms and few answers, she grew anxious and depressed.Our medical team, after a battery of unrevealing tests, settled on a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Tears welled in her eyes as I explained the diagnosis, and I worried I\u2019d been too brusque. But these were tears of relief, she said, not because the symptoms had ceased, but because she finally had an answer, a name for her pain.Those who suffer without a clear understanding of its cause experience a unique form of torment. There is great power in diagnosis: It can be comforting, terrifying, and sometimes, even healing.But fibromyalgia wasn\u2019t a recognized diagnosis 30 years ago. Nor were many other now-common diagnoses that have only recently been recognized and treated as medical conditions.Our ever-expanding armamentarium of diagnoses no doubt offers comfort, attention and a path to treatment for many previously undiagnosed \u2014 and undiagnosable \u2014 patients. But we may also be medicalizing much of normal human behavior \u2014 labeling the healthy as diseased, and exposing them to undue risk of stigma, testing and treatment.Trouble sleeping is now insomnia. Shyness is social phobia. Grief is depression. Infidelity is sex addiction. It\u2019s not that these diseases don\u2019t exist \u2014 the spectrum of human behavior is broad, and the extremes do represent real pathology \u2014 but we may be drawing lines in the wrong places, with negative health and financial consequences.With millions of Americans taking risky medications for questionable diagnoses, have we medicalized everyday life?Often overlooked, however, are how the psychologies of doctors and patients contribute. Clinical encounters that don\u2019t end with a definitive diagnosis \u2014 a clear acknowledgment of the enemy \u2014 are inherently unsatisfying. Doctors, through their training and mandate, are motivated to package a constellation of symptoms into something that can be understood, named and treated.At the same time, we have both a growing arsenal of medications to fix patients\u2019 problems and a steadily shrinking number of minutes in which to do so. Not surprisingly, the path of least resistance becomes labeling and prescribing instead of exploring and managing.Patients are motivated by the understandable desire to name and ease their suffering \u2014 and today, many more patients have that opportunity. But it also means that much of normal human experience is treated with prescriptions instead of patience. This is perhaps not surprising. We increasingly have easy solutions at our fingertips: Dial-up modems have given way to broadband; stores are being replaced by Amazon drones; courtship is now Tinder. Is it wrong for patients to expect quick fixes from medicine?An important step forward may be putting more emphasis on nonprescription remedies. For many medicalized conditions, lifestyle changes are often just as effective as medications, if not more so (and don\u2019t come with side effects).Patients and doctors should also regularly revisit whether a given diagnosis still applies over time. Many patients diagnosed with depression, asthma, acid reflux or insomnia may not meet criteria for these conditions when reassessed, but they often continue taking medications even after symptoms have resolved.More fundamentally, we need to reconsider where the upper and lower bounds of diagnosis should be. Many experts believe the pendulum has swung too far, such that much of normal human behavior now falls within treatment thresholds. This reassessment is particularly important because those with mild or borderline symptoms may be less likely to benefit from treatment than those with more severe symptoms.Diagnosis is complicated. It can be a path to acceptance and treatment, or a road to risk and stigma. More diagnoses mean more patients can heal but also that more might suffer. Figuring out who will be helped \u2014 and who will harmed \u2014 might be the most important diagnosis we make.Advertisement"}

His new movie, \u201cVice,\u201d is a grim account of the life of Dick Cheney, with Christian Bale \u2014 smoldering beneath prosthetic jowls and the ample weight he gained for the role \u2014 in the lead. McKay went into it aware that it would be, as he put it to me, \u201cthe most challenging, ambitious movie\u201d he ever made.\u201cThe movie was big,\u201d he said. His shooting script encompassed five decades of Cheney\u2019s life, 200 locations and more than 150 speaking parts. Chief among McKay\u2019s coping mechanisms for stress, going back to his 20s, were cigarettes and junk food, and during the \u201cVice\u201d shoot, he averaged half a pack of American Spirit Ultra Lights a day and put on around 25 pounds. When filming was through, McKay, who is 50, booked time with a trainer he\u2019d hired before. He came over for a session in mid-January. It was then that McKay\u2019s stomach turned. \u201cMy trainer says, \u2018Are you O.K.?\u2019 And I\u2019m, like: \u2018Yeah, yeah, I\u2019m just in bad shape. I\u2019m worn out. I\u2019m still smoking.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe trainer decided not to push it and left. Just then, McKay remembered that Bale, when researching Cheney\u2019s several heart attacks in preparation for \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cmet with a heart surgeon, and he said: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of ways you can show a heart attack. The hands tingling is one, the most common one is the pain in the arm, but what\u2019s really common is queasiness.\u2019 And in that moment, I ran upstairs.\u201d McKay swallowed three baby aspirin and called his wife, who called 911. At the hospital, a doctor confirmed the bad news: He\u2019d had a heart attack. The good news was that they were opening him up, inserting a stent and, if McKay quit smoking and got into better shape, he\u2019d come out fine. One of his two daughters brought him a card at the hospital that read, \u201cCongratulations on Your New Baby!\u201d which she\u2019d modified to say, \u201cI\u2019m Sorry about Your New Heart Attack!\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m 100 percent O.K.,\u201d McKay said. \u201cI do get a little lightheaded sometimes, but I recovered. It\u2019s like in \u2018Jaws,\u2019 when the shark swims right past the kid and doesn\u2019t touch him.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd then about two days later, I called Bale and I said, \u2018Hey man, either you or Dick Cheney saved my life.\u2019\u2009\u201dThis is as close as McKay is likely to come to expressing good will toward the 46th vice president. Far from a grateful tribute, \u201cVice\u201d \u2014 which co-stars Amy Adams as Cheney\u2019s wife, Lynne \u2014 proceeds in a spirit of frenetic and ferocious irreverence. Annapurna, the company behind the film, spent about $60 million to make it, and executives there are positioning the movie, as they did last year with \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d as a major awards-season contender. But McKay had little interest in obeying the familiar rhythms of the academy-pleasing biopic that Cheney\u2019s story might have inspired. In previous features, McKay staged the murder of a man by an airborne trident; filmed a prosthetic scrotum in close-up bobbing atop a snare drum; and enlisted Margot Robbie to explain subprime mortgages from a bubble bath. And yet \u201cVice\u201d is, in tone and form, one of the wildest movies he has made \u2014 and one of the wildest movies ever made about politics, period.A filmmaker less restive than McKay, having cast actors as gifted as Bale and Adams, might have done his best impersonation of, say, Steven Spielberg directing \u201cLincoln\u201d \u2014 filling his movie with so much solemn soliloquizing and rousing Oval Office debate. But in \u201cVice,\u201d scenes of finely wrought drama give way to passages of surreally heightened satire, which in turn give way to horrible v\u00e9rit\u00e9 footage of \u201cenhanced interrogations.\u201d The movie doesn\u2019t only double and triple back on itself but is punctuated throughout with nature-documentary clips, the \u201cWhassup!\u201d beer commercial and a variety of self-reflexive feints. The film\u2019s narrator is Jesse Plemons, whose relationship to Cheney is mysterious: at points he is a soldier, at others a warehouse worker, and at others, Naomi Watts, playing a cable-news anchor, is suddenly narrating instead.What is unambiguous, by the end, is McKay\u2019s conviction that the American right, in its post-Reagan consolidation of power, has set our country and our planet on a path to ruin \u2014 and that no single figure illustrates this better than Cheney. \u201cHe was the expert safecracker who opened up the safe,\u201d McKay said, alluding to Cheney\u2019s deft dismantling of checks on executive power, \u201cand now the orangutan is in there, throwing around the money and the jewels.\u201d McKay knows that a conservative backlash to his film is very likely, and while he emphasized how diligently he grounded the film in research, he also argued that making a less confrontational movie, hewing to a measured realism would have felt not only boring but also incommensurate to the task.\u201cI\u2019ve never dealt with a tone like this, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s by accident,\u201d McKay said. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a world with a tone that none of us has ever experienced. Pipe bombs are being sent to the leaders of a political party, and the guy who made \u2018Dilbert\u2019 is saying, You know the bombs were really made by left-wingers because they didn\u2019t work.\u201d He made an incredulous face. \u201cSo, you\u2019re claiming the assassination attempts are a false flag operation while slamming the liberals and you\u2019re the guy who did \u2018Dilbert\u2019?\u201d When it came to the movie\u2019s protean tone, he said, \u201cAll I can tell you is that we were very conscious of it, we knew it was challenging and indefinable \u2014 and we knew it had to be.\u201dThis was true, he added, not in spite of the material\u2019s seriousness, but because of it. \u201cI\u2019m suspicious of anything that feels like an old form,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re discovering new styles and forms, because this era we\u2019re in demands it. The world has gotten so cartoonishly exaggerated and over the top. Why be subtle anymore?\u201dBut like many self-identifying progressives, McKay \u2014 who grew up on food stamps and was raised in suburban Pennsylvania by his waitress single mother (his father, a musician, left the family when McKay was 7) \u2014 has grown steadily disenchanted with what he calls \u201cthe corporate left.\u201d This summer he joined the L.A. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. He thinks that capitalism must come under greater, Scandinavian-style regulatory control, \u201cespecially if we\u2019re going to do anything about climate change.\u201d Earlier this year he left Funny or Die, a comedy website he co-founded in 2007, after it entered into a sponsored-content agreement with Shell, a deal he called \u201cdisgusting.\u201dMcKay stands at a towering 6-foot-5 and sometimes seems to have more body than he knows what to do with. In his home office, he arranged himself across a beige couch like a coat hurled off in a hurry: torso horizontal, head kinked up against a pillow, legs crossed off the front. The room was trimmed in dark wood. \u201cThis is where I wrote \u2018Vice,\u2019\u2009\u201d McKay said, indicating a desk facing a bay window. A faux-Roman bust, purchased in a prop-department sale for $5, dwarfed McKay\u2019s computer. A vintage poster for the Japanese release of \u201cNetwork\u201d hung beside bookshelves decorated with memorabilia from McKay\u2019s films: the clapboard from \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d a production still from \u201cThe Other Guys.\u201dPiled together on one shelf were some of the books McKay consulted for \u201cVice,\u201d including Barton Gellman\u2019s Cheney biography, \u201cAngler,\u201d Jane Mayer\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d history, \u201cThe Dark Side,\u201d and Cheney\u2019s own memoir, \u201cIn My Time.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of layers to my attraction to Cheney\u2019s story, and one of them is how quiet and mysterious he was, how he\u2019s covered his trail all these years,\u201d McKay said. \u201cYou read his entire autobiography, and you learn nothing about him. Cheney is one of the most brilliant bureaucratic infighters in history, but he knew how to do all this stuff so that you barely knew it was happening.\u201dMcKay has dedicated his recent work to illuminating just such self-obscuring systems of power, the kind that depend on opacity to function. In \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d the narrator, played by Ryan Gosling, puts it this way: \u201cMortgage-backed securities. Subprime loans. Tranches. It\u2019s pretty confusing, right? Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid? Well, it\u2019s supposed to. Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or, even better, for you just to leave them the [expletive] alone.\u201d Last year, McKay directed the pilot for and served as an executive producer on \u201cSuccession,\u201d an HBO drama about a Murdoch-style media-empire patriarch and his reprobate heirs \u2014 their nefarious business dealings and abject power moves.In \u201cVice,\u201d he uses Cheney\u2019s life to tell a broader tale about what McKay describes as \u201cthe Republican revolution and how it changed our country.\u201d He sees Cheney as a \u201cZelig-style\u201d figure of the right. His career in national politics began in the Nixon administration as a congressional intern and then apprentice to Donald Rumsfeld and, from there, intersected and coincided with the rise of key conservative figures: among them the Fox News founder, Roger Ailes, who first floated the idea for a conservative news network while working for Nixon; right-wing megadonors like the Koch brothers; conservative strategy shops like the Heritage Foundation; and, finally, George W. Bush, over whose administration \u2014 and over whose decision to invade Iraq after Sept. 11, despite paltry intelligence linking the two \u2014 Cheney exercised unprecedented influence for a vice president.One of McKay\u2019s models was \u201cThe Power Broker,\u201d Robert Caro\u2019s landmark biography of Robert Moses. \u201cHe\u2019s in the middle of all this stuff,\u201d McKay said of Cheney, \u201cand finally he gets his hand on the wheel.\u201d Unlike Caro, McKay had to tell his story through a camera, and so there are compressions, elisions and metaphors in \u201cVice\u201d that reflect both a filmmaker\u2019s desire to enthrall the crowd and a prosecutor\u2019s desire to nail the defendant. Reading journalistic accounts of Cheney\u2019s move, in 2000, from the private sector back into public service, we learn that he took elaborate steps to divest from Halliburton, the oil conglomerate where he was C.E.O., to avoid the appearance of conflict; here, the relationship between Cheney and the energy sector is presented as one of clear cronyism. Or take Sept. 11. In Barton Gellman\u2019s play-by-play of that morning in \u201cAngler,\u201d it\u2019s strongly implied that Cheney usurped Bush\u2019s authority, ignoring the chain of command and giving fighter jets the O.K. to shoot down commercial airliners if they appeared to be hijacked. The official White House version was that Bush gave Cheney permission to pass along this order, and Gellman, poring carefully through communications records and notes taken by administration staff members, leaves open the extremely slim possibility that this is true. In \u201cVice\u201d there is no such equivocation. We see Cheney give the order to take out the planes himself. Compression, of course, isn\u2019t the same as distortion: Jane Mayer, the investigative journalist, described this scene to me as \u201ca perfect gem,\u201d and told McKay, after he screened the movie for her, that he \u201cgot it right.\u201dOne way McKay might have buttressed \u201cVice\u201d against possible charges of liberal bias would be to include the sorts of political critiques he readily offers up in conversation. \u201cWhen Clinton was elected, he cut welfare and deregulated banks, just like a Republican would have done,\u201d he said, from his couch. \u201cObama waged a war against whistle-blowers, he let the banks off the hook and he expanded executive power.\u201d McKay did tinker for a while with stitching points like these into \u201cVice\u201d \u2014 making it \u201cthe story of Dick Cheney and the rise of the Republican Party, and how they got so big they swallowed the Democrats.\u201d To this end, he pieced in footage of Hillary Clinton supporting the Iraq war. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard,\u201d McKay went on. \u201cThe audience only has a certain amount of oxygen in their lungs.\u201d As he said earlier: \u201cI could have made the movie three and a half hours long, but you can thank me that I didn\u2019t.\u201d (The film runs just over 130 minutes.)McKay predicted that some of the fiercest criticisms of \u201cVice\u201d might come from putatively sympathetic voices: \u201cI actually think left-wing friends of mine are going to be mad at me for humanizing him as much as I do.\u201d Throughout the film, Cheney is depicted as a fearsomely capable stalker of prey; a recurring motif concerns his passion for fly fishing, which McKay described to me as crucial to understanding him. He hired a fly fisherman as a consultant. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe the level of patience and detail that\u2019s involved \u2014 lifting up the rocks to see what kinds of bugs are underneath so you know what kind of lure to use; watching the drift, the way the sun\u2019s hitting it so you know what illusion to create with your lure. And that\u2019s the story with Dick Cheney. Meticulous detail and tremendous patience.\u201d Cheney is rendered tenderly in his interactions with Lynne, his sweetheart since high school, and with his second daughter, Mary, whose coming out as gay in the mid-\u201980s he met with private encouragement and affection. Christian Bale told me that he seized on Cheney\u2019s marriage as his way into the role. \u201cWith any part, you choose what you focus on,\u201d he said, explaining that, in \u201cVice,\u201d he chose \u201cthe love story. I think Cheney\u2019s one of the most romantic men around. At the start he wasn\u2019t particularly ambitious. Very laid back. But he has this undying love, where he\u2019ll do anything to win Lynne\u2019s approval \u2014 he did it all for her.\u201d He added that \u201cthe hardest thing with playing him was trying to understand that awesome power. I could never quite imagine what it must be like to wake up every morning knowing the power within your hands, where your choices affect whether people will die. I obsessed over it for months. But I don\u2019t think he sees himself as a villain \u2014 unless someone\u2019s a sociopath, I think they believe their motives are for a bigger good.\u201dOn the subject of villainy, McKay said: \u201cCheney and Bush did kill, conservatively, half a million civilians in Iraq. Some estimates have it at more than a million. So he\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d But, he said, \u201cI think you have to humanize him, because unless we see how a regular human being can go down these roads, it\u2019s useless.\u201d (McKay has heard nothing from the Cheneys, who did not participate in the making of the film, although he noted that Mary started following him on Twitter.)Recently, a sizable portion of the left has adopted surprising, relatively sanguine attitudes toward the Bush-Cheney years. I asked McKay, who directed a scathingly satirical 2009 Broadway show about Bush called, \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome America,\u201d whether he saw his unsparing portrait of Cheney in \u201cVice\u201d \u2014 humanizing gestures notwithstanding \u2014 as a would-be corrective to liberal amnesia on this score. \u201cI hope to God that it is,\u201d McKay said, nodding. \u201cReally what that shows you is the number of people for whom government is just about appearance. Bush and Cheney just kept up the facade, whereas this administration doesn\u2019t even remotely pretend. So when I hear people say, \u2018I miss the days of Bush and Cheney,\u2019 what they\u2019re really saying is, \u2018I miss the days when people would at least pretend.\u2019\u2009\u201d He went on: \u201cEvery time I see it, I shake my head, like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. The world economy collapsed, we had the greatest military fiasco in U.S. history apart from Vietnam.\u2019 When I hear \u2018Trump makes you miss Bush,\u2019 I go, \u2018There\u2019s no question that Bush and Cheney are way ahead of him in terms of damage done.\u2019\u2009\u201d He characterized such Bush nostalgia bluntly: \u201cNow that my house is on fire, I long for when it was infested by bees.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been playing with this one scene,\u201d McKay explained. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our most challenging runs.\u201d The scene in question takes place in Dick and Lynne Cheney\u2019s bedroom on a stormy night in 2000, after George W. Bush has won the Republican nomination and offered Cheney the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Cheney has declined, volunteering instead to lead the vice-presidential search. In the available accounts of this moment, Cheney\u2019s motivations remain obscure. Was the search a canard \u2014 a mechanism for Cheney, who always intended to take the job, to amass dirt on G.O.P. luminaries that he could later leverage against them? By stalling, was he able to extract more power from Bush when he eventually said yes?Rather than paper over this uncertainty, McKay decided to dramatize it in a particularly audacious way: Bale and Adams begin speaking in a Shakespearean approximation of Early Modern English. \u201cIs my life to be spent in servant\u2019s bow to Nixon, Ford, the thespian Reagan and Bush the Elder?\u201d Dick asks, to which Lynne replies, \u201cDanced nimbly \u2019round the kings\u2019 hearth thou hath, even whilst clamored I for more.\u201d As thunder grows louder in the background, the couple converse in iambs for three full minutes, working themselves up into a libidinal fever as they contemplate the opportunity before them: \u201cMine own blood and will are yours \u2019til pierced be the last soldier\u2019s breastplate spilling forth its ruby jellied treasures!\u201d Adams cries out as she climbs atop Bale.Corwin showed me the Shakespeare run, then said, \u201cEvery time we play this at test screenings \u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s resoundingly rejected,\u201d McKay said.\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying how much people hate it,\u201d Corwin reiterated.Wholey chimed in on a more upbeat note: \u201cI missed it when you took it out.\u201d\u201cSome people love it,\u201d McKay allowed, \u201cbut three out of four definitely hate it.\u201dMcKay has long relied on test screenings to shape his movies. Making comedies, he liked to swap in different punch lines for different crowds, like a stand-up, seeing which ones got bigger laughs and tweaking cuts accordingly. Even after moving into drama, he has found test screenings and focus groups indispensable to ensuring that audiences remain on board, moment to moment \u2014 especially so with \u201cVice,\u201d given its collage of moods and modes. \u201cIf you sit in rooms like this too long, you lose perspective,\u201d Corwin said. Not that the goal is milquetoast consensus. In 2013, when I visited the set of \u201cAnchorman 2,\u201d McKay put it to me this way: \u201cIdeally, you want to be alienating four people, and you want six people to love it.\u201d (Annapurna is likely hoping for more favorable math \u2014 in October, reports circulated that the company was suffering from money trouble, attributed to its model of spending lavishly on auteur-driven projects; McKay\u2019s movies have all done well at the box office, but several of these reports invoked \u201cVice\u201d as a particularly pricey gamble. Annapurna dismisses such reports and says they have full confidence in \u201cVice.\u201d)McKay also showed \u201cVice\u201d to filmmaker friends like Paul Thomas Anderson and David O. Russell. After Anderson, who watched two preliminary cuts, told McKay that the end of the movie worked great but the start \u201chad problems,\u201d McKay decided to scrap two early sections: an elaborate musical number and a prolonged passage set in Cheney\u2019s Wyoming adolescence. McKay adored both but decided that Anderson was right \u2014 they were gumming up the machinery.Amy Adams, for her part, loved the Shakespeare sequence. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great way to explain the motivations of the characters,\u201d she said, while acknowledging that \u201cit was challenging, because it could so easily feel big and broad, but it has to feel intimate.\u201d The passage testified, in her mind, to the way McKay \u201cwas able to so seamlessly navigate tone.\u201d She mentioned an informal exercise that she and McKay practiced on set to help keep her grounded in her character despite the movie\u2019s many shifts in register. \u201cI\u2019d come in at the beginning of the day, kind of half-Lynne, half-Amy, and Adam and I would have these debates\u201d \u2014 about news events depicted in the film, about whatever was in the headlines on that day of shooting. \u201cIt was such a great tool for me to get into Lynne,\u201d she said.McKay wasn\u2019t sure he could get the Shakespeare scene to click, but he was intent on trying. \u201cWe have a nice head of steam going through this part of the movie that we\u2019re loath to mess up, so we took it out for a while,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scene ends well \u2014 it\u2019s always ended well. Getting into it is a little rickety. Now we\u2019re feeling that the movie\u2019s overall structure is playing so strong, though, that maybe we can try and pull off this cliff dive.\u201d So they experimented. Three minutes did feel long. Could they trim the exchange closer to one? And what if Plemons\u2019s narrator came in up top with some coy prefatory remarks to the effect of, \u201cO.K., so we have no idea what was going through Cheney\u2019s head here, and it\u2019s not like we can just imagine it through a scene of fake Shakespeare \u2014 or can we?\u201dMcKay was leaning toward something like that: \u201cMy new thought is maybe we just go bigger with our interruption.\u201d What if the screen went black?\u201cNo matter what we do, there\u2019s gonna be a \u2018What the [expletive]\u2019 reaction,\u201d said Corwin.\u201cOh, that\u2019s a given,\u201d McKay replied. \u201cIt\u2019s more about percentages of \u2018What the. ... \u2019 I could live with 46 percent. I could even get to 55-60 percent. But this scene might be 88 percent, where you start ripping a hole in the movie. Are you O.K. with 88 percent \u2018What the ... ,\u2019 Hank?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll follow you to the gates of hell,\u201d Corwin said, and rewound the scene to give it another look.He found a like-minded conspirator in Will Ferrell, who was hired onto \u201cS.N.L.\u201d the same day as McKay, and who shared his taste for absurd sketches poking fun at oafish, arrogant, rageful men. In the first thing they wrote together, Ferrell played a grotesque version of Neil Diamond, revealing the depraved inspirations behind benign hits like \u201cForever in Blue Jeans.\u201d (\u201cThis next song I wrote after I killed a drifter to get an erection.\u201d) One of McKay\u2019s fondest early contributions to the show starts with the title sequence for a program called \u201cThe Hulk Hogan Talk Show!!!\u201d This sequence \u2014 consisting of a droningly repetitive jingle, garish title cards and numerous stills of Hogan in the ring \u2014 lasts an almost interminable 45 seconds, ramping up in fanfare as it goes. The joke is that this is all misdirection. When the talk show finally starts, we are greeted by Ferrell, wearing a suit and tie on a chintzy set and interviewing a recently released hostage. \u201cHulk Hogan is on vacation,\u201d Ferrell says. \u201cI\u2019m your guest host, Phil Tobin.\u201d (McKay mocked Cheney several times on the show, including in cold opens and an installment of the animated \u201cX-Presidents\u201d series, which he co-wrote, during which the ghost of George Washington calls Cheney \u201ca douche bag\u201d and impales him with a quill pen.)McKay traces his sense of humor to a youthful love of Monty Python and some lasting lessons in irreverence from his mother. \u201cShe\u2019d always be poking holes in things,\u201d McKay said, whether it was sneaking him into the local Y.M.C.A. pool, because memberships were too expensive, or reading children\u2019s books and changing them \u201cso that Little Andy and Dottie were going to the supermarket and shoplifting.\u201d He recalled how one April Fools\u2019 Day, when he was in second grade, he got into bed and she\u2019d dumped sand into it. \u201cAnd she\u2019s like, \u2018April Fools\u2019! It confused me for a couple days, but then it was awesome. It opened up the whole world to me, like, You can play pranks on people!\u201d Over the past decade or so, McKay noted, his mother has grown increasingly conservative, faithfully watching Fox News and voting for Trump in the 2016 election despite supporting Obama in 2008. McKay described her move rightward as a source of both pain and confusion for him \u2014 and a source of ongoing debate between them \u2014 but said that their relationship remained a loving one.When he went to college at Temple University in Philadelphia, McKay studied literature. His favorite authors were those who scrambled storytelling conventions, like John Dos Passos and William Faulkner. Outside class, he tried stand-up comedy. \u201cI started doing open mics and bombing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was never great, but I got decent enough.\u201d McKay has said, \u201cOccasionally I\u2019d drop a political joke in, and I was really bad at it, so I would quickly get them out of my act and go back to joking about airplanes and girlfriends I broke up with.\u201dDuring his senior year, a fellow aspiring comedian named Rick Roman came back from a trip to Chicago and told him, \u201c\u2009\u2018There\u2019s this thing out there called long-form improv, where you get onstage and do whatever you want,\u2019\u2009\u201d McKay recalled. \u201cI go, \u2018Like stand-up?\u2019 \u2018No. You go into a scene and you say, \u201cWe\u2019re on the moon,\u201d and the only rule is you can\u2019t say no.\u2019\u2009\u201d McKay was sold. In 1990, just 18 credits shy of graduation, he unloaded his comic-book collection for $800, bought a secondhand Chrysler and moved to Chicago.There, he enrolled in improv classes with the avant-garde acting coach Del Close, a gruff, bearded guru whose past students had included Bill Murray and Gilda Radner, and whose \u201990s-era charges included Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert. (Close died in 1999.) McKay joined an improv team called the Family, which became Close\u2019s test group: \u201cHe would work out his new forms through us,\u201d McKay recalled. In one of these, \u201cwe\u2019d improvise a whole movie, and use movie language \u2014 credits, camera angles, smash cuts and all.\u201d McKay, the erstwhile lit major, named one new form \u201cthe Deconstruction\u201d: \u201cYou started with a scene played really well. Close listening, detailed characters, implying a world. And then for the rest of the form you rip that first scene apart: pick up on pieces of it, flash backward, flash forward, pick up a character element and exaggerate it.\u201dIn the early 1990s, McKay formed a troupe that would become the Upright Citizens Brigade, including Matt Besser, Horatio Sanz and Ian Roberts. Today, U.C.B. has grown into a bicoastal talent factory, offering classes in New York and Los Angeles, and its former students are everywhere in modern comedy. In its earliest incarnation, though, it was a scrappy upstart with an anarchic sensibility that stood in contrast to more established and relatively staid Chicago outfits like Second City. \u201cWe were doing this crazy show in a coffee house, but then we got a good review, and there were lines around the block,\u201d McKay said. \u201cIt was an amazing experience, but I was still broke.\u201d He eventually decamped for Second City, where he was integral to some modernizing changes \u2014 no more stage, no more curtain, no more rigidly formulaic revues \u2014 and where he \u201cactually started making some money. Besser was pissed at me, but I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, I can\u2019t pay my rent!\u2019\u2009\u201d (His U.C.B. teammates soon replaced him with another young comedian, Amy Poehler.)It\u2019s hard to imagine McKay making a movie like \u201cVice\u201d without his time spent exploding narrative strategies and provoking audiences in Chicago. This is nowhere clearer than in accounts of \u201cPi\u00f1ata Full of Bees,\u201d a hit Second City revue he cocreated. In one bit, McKay portrayed Noam Chomsky as a substitute teacher, terrifying grade-school children with the genocidal story of \u201cthe real Thanksgiving.\u201d Cast members would interrupt performances to recite statistics about how, say, military spending dwarfed welfare spending.One night, they tried to convince the audience that President Clinton had just moments before been killed, stopping the performance with a shellshocked announcement. Wheeling out a television to watch news of the assassination, however, the cast became distracted by frivolous programming. The comedian Scott Adsit, who was part of the troupe, described this stunt several years ago: \u201cWe all started sitting with our backs to the audience, watching sports bloopers, and didn\u2019t do anything but laugh at the TV for another 10 minutes, until the room cleared.\u201d It was a macabre and confrontational prank they pulled only once, Adsit said, noting that even some Second City members were uncomfortable with it. He gave credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 where it was due: \u201cIt was Adam McKay\u2019s idea.\u201dMcKay, like Hayes and Glass, has become invested in figuring out how to get audiences to enjoy the taste of vegetables. He is producing a documentary series at Amazon called \u201cThis Giant Beast That Is the Global Economy,\u201d which will explore such topics as the corruption-riddled world of concrete. He has signed on to direct a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence as Elizabeth Holmes, the Silicon Valley executive, indicted on charges of fraud, behind the disgraced health-services company Theranos. And, he told me, he has three ideas for movies about climate change, which he considers the ultimate vegetable: \u201cI have one that\u2019s epic, one that\u2019s comedic and one that\u2019s a poetic art film,\u201d he said. The comedy \u2014 the only one of these he would describe \u2014 concerns a group of Republican congresspeople from Oklahoma, forced to live in an air-conditioned dome after their state has been otherwise depopulated by global warming, unwilling to give up their seats despite their nonexistent constituency.If McKay ever makes this movie, it will be bleak, no matter how funny it turns out. He acknowledged that \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is a bleak movie, too, and that \u201cVice\u201d is bleaker still: \u201cIt does not send you back into the world feeling good.\u201d It was getting late in the afternoon. I could hear an animal whimpering in McKay\u2019s kitchen. It was the family\u2019s new puppy, a black-and-brown rescue named Timothy, who was being house-trained within a mesh-walled pen.McKay told me that not long after his heart attack, the last family pet, a beloved dog named Pumpkin, died. \u201cThat was tough,\u201d he said, and there was more where that came from. Last fall, Shira Piven was riding in a Lyft when another driver smashed into the car. An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where they took CT scans and M.R.I.s. Scrutinizing these, doctors discovered two troubling things: Piven\u2019s neck was broken and, what\u2019s more, there was a small growth in her chest, eventually diagnosed as malignant. \u201cLung cancer,\u201d McKay said. \u201cThey removed a quarter of her lung, and for a month you could barely hear her talk.\u201d Like McKay, Piven recovered, he said, but they were shaken. \u201cAnd then on top of all this, you\u2019re seeing democracy worldwide collapse, and we\u2019re getting scientific reports from the U.N. basically saying mankind will be extinct in 25 years. I have just never experienced a two-year period like the last two years.\u201dMcKay\u2019s comedies always carried dark undertones. Ferrell\u2019s protagonists might have registered as endearing buffoons, but their tendencies toward ignorance, selfishness, sexism, racism and/or jingoism were among the ways that McKay signaled mordant satirical intentions. It might be most accurate to say that, rather than abandoning comedy in his films, he has inverted the ratio between light and dark.But despite McKay\u2019s suspicion of \u201cold forms\u201d \u2014 despite his conviction that, circa 2018, the best use for a big megaphone is to deliver urgent and edifying messages as loudly as possible \u2014 spending all your time exploring the dark side can be wearying, especially if you spent much of your career chasing sillier and sillier ways to make strangers laugh. Making comedies, McKay was essentially a shadow cast member, yelling out impromptu jokes, midscene, for his actors to repeat, cracking them up as the cameras rolled. Far from disavowing his early movies, he recalled them proudly, describing the family-prayer scene in \u201cTalladega Nights\u201d \u2014 an improv-heavy sequence full of preposterous tangents about infant Jesus and Lynyrd Skynyrd \u2014 as \u201cthe best scene we\u2019ve ever done.\u201dOf his directorial approach, he told me that \u201cdoing a scene with Ferrell, it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m out there with him,\u201d whereas, working with Bale and Adams on \u201cVice,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s very gentle, very subtle. If Ferrell\u2019s a Ferrari, meaning fast and fun, I feel like Bale and Adams are narwhals\u201d \u2014 a wondrous species of whale with a unicorn-like tusk, hard to find outside the Far North. \u201cYou\u2019re watching them, like: \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing this. I\u2019m gonna shut up. That\u2019s an actual narwhal. You can see the horn!\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed. \u201cOnce I have this magical moment, then I\u2019ll dare to wreck it.\u201dI reminded McKay of a moment of a much daffier sort that I observed years ago, during the making of \u201cAnchorman 2.\u201d McKay and Ferrell improvised an improbable erotic fantasy about Mrs. Butterworth, nowhere in the film\u2019s script, with each topping the other\u2019s jokes, relay-race style, and sent the entire set into bouts of convulsive laughter. McKay beamed at this memory. \u201cOh, I miss those days,\u201d he said, sounding suddenly homesick. Timothy was crying softly in the kitchen; the sun was setting; the sea ice was melting; the actual narwhals were imperiled. McKay shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re making me want to go do a comedy right now.\u201dJonah Weiner is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine and a contributing editor at Rolling Stone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A 1965 Novel About an Unhinged President Is Being Rereleased", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsA couple of months ago, prominent political pundits began buzzing about a provocative book by a Washington journalist.The book \u2014 which raised questions about what Congressional leaders should do if the president was mentally unstable and unfit for office \u2014 wasn\u2019t a new expose about the Trump administration. It was a 1965 political thriller by Fletcher Knebel.Now, more than 50 years after it was released, \u201cNight of Camp David\u201d is getting a new life. Later this month, Vintage Books, a Penguin Random House imprint, is rereleasing the novel, as a paperback, e-book and audiobook.The publisher isn\u2019t shying away from drawing parallels between the novel and our current overheated political climate, with a dramatic black cover flap that reprises the tagline on the original novel: \u201cWhat Would Happen if the President of the U.S.A. Went Stark Raving Mad?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s got the perfect balance of escapism and that haunting touch of reality,\u201d said Anne Messitte, publisher of Vintage Books.It\u2019s unclear whether \u201cNight of Camp David\u201d will attract political junkies who have been obsessively following the real-life political melodrama unfolding daily in Washington. Two of this year\u2019s biggest blockbusters \u2014 \u201cFear\u201d by Bob Woodward and \u201cFire and Fury\u201d by Michael Wolff \u2014 offered blistering insider accounts of the drama and dysfunction in the Trump White House, and have sold millions of copies. But as readers have been glued to the nonstop political news cycle, interest in fiction seems to have flagged, while nonfiction sales have surged.There have been some notable exceptions. \u201cThe President Is Missing,\u201d a novel about a fictional president that was written by Bill Clinton and James Patterson, has sold more than a million copies. But other works of political fiction have fallen flat, perhaps because the genre has limited appeal at a moment when the headlines are often more dramatic than anything a screenwriter or novelist could dream up.Some felt similarly about \u201cNight of Camp David\u201d when it first came out. (A Times critic complained that it was too realistic, writing that \u201cas a suspense novel it is probably a great deal too honest for its own good.\u201d) But many readers were riveted: The book spent 18 weeks on the best-seller list in hardcover.Knebel\u2019s son, Jack Knebel, said the family was gratified to see the book republished, and that his father would likely be shocked to see how prescient his novel was.\u201cThe parallels are quite striking between then and now,\u201d he said, \u201cHe\u2019d say, yeah, this is just what I was afraid of.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Helped People Cheat at Grand Theft Auto. Then His Home Was Raided.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA gamer in Melbourne has had his assets frozen in connection with a popular video game cheat. He\u2019s one of many being sued by game companies worldwide, raising questions about copyright law and the policing of online civility.\u201cCheaters do tend to ruin the game experience for others, but not everything that is antisocial is illegal, nor should it be,\u201d said Mitch Stoltz, a senior attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit in San Francisco that defends digital privacy and free speech. There\u2019s a lot of money at stake. But earlier this year, Infamous was taken offline following a spate of legal action by game developers against \u201cmodders,\u201d or people who modify games in a way the original designers did not intend.But for players, the cases and the severity of enforcement often come as a surprise. The use of search and seizure orders in copyright cases is not uncommon in Australia, said Nicolas Suzor, a law and digital media researcher at Queensland University of Technology. But having them obtained in a closed courtroom hearing without the defendant being represented is concerning, he said. Mr. Anderson agreed.The raid, Mr. Anderson said, came after weeks of surveillance. Early on the morning of Sept. 25, his computers and hard disks were seized. \u201cThey\u2019re just beating up on me,\u201d Mr. Anderson said of the game publishers, arguing that the search and seizure order was a disproportionate response. Infamous was designed to help players combat cheaters using more sinister modifications, almost like an antivirus software, he said. But Alex Walker, editor of the gaming website Kotaku Australia, said that Infamous was \u201cjust a straight-up cheat.\u201d Cheats, he said, \u201cbreak and exploit parts of the game code to advantage the experience of one player at the disadvantage of other players.\u201d \u201cIt is genuinely harmful to the community,\u201d he added. In a statement provided to The Times, Take-Two Interactive said it was \u201ccommitted to protecting our multiplayer community from harassment and other disruptions to their shared entertainment experiences.\u201d Still, copyright policy may not be the best way to tackle the problem, said Meredith Rose, a policy counsel and copyright expert with Public Knowledge, an advocacy group in Washington focused on consumer digital rights. She said banning individual cheaters, for example, would be a fairer and more effective response. \u201cThe proportionality of the hammer is completely out of scale with the harm being done,\u201d Ms. Rose said. Even if copyright litigation were justified when it came to cheaters, she added, the cases could set a dangerous precedent: Copyright and anti-circumvention laws could also be used to deter competition, criticism of corporate policies or reports of security vulnerabilities. The contracts that accompany downloads of video games and other media products often include clauses that allow for a broad range of \u201cdraconian\u201d corporate policing, said Mr. Stoltz, the San Francisco attorney. When courts worldwide become willing to \u201ctransform violations of the fine print into heavy-handed remedies,\u201d he said, it makes everyone vulnerable to \u201cthe whims of every company that we do business with online.\u201dAdvertisement"}
