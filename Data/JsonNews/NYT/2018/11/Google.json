{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: How Facebook Wrestled With Its Scandals", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are some of the biggest takeaways from the investigation.\u201cIn the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss [Alex Stamos, then the company\u2019s security chief]. Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. \u201cIts leadership squirmed over Russian meddling investigations:\u201cMr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of [Sheryl] Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal. \u2018You threw us under the bus!\u2019 she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.\u201dThe company hadn\u2019t prepared for the worst on its platform:\u201c \u2018We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u2019 Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.\u201dBut pushed its messaging hard:\u201cFacebook also expanded its work with [the P.R. firm] Definers. On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called [Apple\u2019s C.E.O. Tim] Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users.\u201dAnd Mark Zuckerberg was apoplectic about the criticism:After Mr. Cook publicly derided Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg was so furious that he later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.The bottom line:\u201cAs evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view.\u201dThose moves will be important when the company tries to convince public-market investors that it\u2019s worth a sky-high valuation when it files for an I.P.O. But it remains to be seen if investors will believe that argument.More from Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT:\u201cI\u2019m very happy about the state of the economy now,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cThere\u2019s pretty good reason to think we\u2019re going to continue in a positive vein like that.\u201dHe added that the Fed deserved credit for its role in the long and steady expansion. \u201cOur policy is part of the reason the economy is in such a good place now,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell also noted that Congress \u2014 not the White House \u2014 oversees the Fed, and added that the central bank would continue to raise rates for now.China, Germany and Japan have all seen their economies struggle in recent months. America\u2019s has not, and it looks set to avoid that \u2014 but there\u2019s still reason to worry.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: From Corporate America to China, Everyone\u2019s Braced for the Midterms", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs voters head to the polls, employees at Facebook and Twitter will be on high alert. Neither company wants a repeat of 2016, when Russian operatives used their platforms to influence voters.Perhaps more than ever, Beijing is interested in how Americans vote. A strong showing by Democrats would weaken President Trump \u2014 which could be a boon for China, whose economy is beginning to suffer from American tariffs.If the Republicans lose their majority in both upper and lower chambers, gone will be the days where Trump does anything he wants. There\u2019ll be less room for chest-thumping bravado and more need for rational policy making and diplomacy. Trump would have to change his approach to adopt a more moderate tone: where before he could command, he would have to negotiate \u2014 with other countries, and within his own.More from Karen Weise and J. David Goodman of the NYT on Amazon\u2019s reasoning:Picking multiple sites would allow it to tap into two pools of talented labor and perhaps avoid being blamed for all of the housing and traffic woes of dominating a single area. It could also give the company greater leverage in negotiating tax incentives, experts said.\u201cEven if the most obvious reasons appear to be about attracting more tech workers, the P.R. and government incentives benefits could help, too,\u201d said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site.But the decision would mean that neither city could really claim to have a campus equal to the one in Seattle, as Amazon originally promised.But a note of caution: Mr. Trump said on Monday that \u201cif we can make the right deal, a deal that\u2019s fair, we\u2019ll do that. Otherwise we won\u2019t do it.\u201dHe and Mr. Xi are expected to meet at the G-20 summit meeting in Argentina this month.After intense criticism about the way Facebook was used to incite violence in Myanmar, the company commissioned an independent investigation.\u201cThe report concludes that, prior to this year, we weren\u2019t doing enough to help prevent our platform from being used to foment division and incite offline violence. We agree that we can and should do more.\u201dBut Li Yuan of the NYT notes that these Silicon Valley emissaries also found much to worry about:Chinese technology executives, they found, were even more driven and more willing to do whatever it takes to win. But that comes with major trade-offs, and punishing work schedules are only the beginning. They found Chinese tech executives to be less reflective about the social impact and potential misuse of their technologies, a potentially worrisome quality in a country with loosely enforced privacy laws, strict government censorship and a powerful domestic surveillance apparatus.The magazine explains how he assumed a very visible role:When he tapped Ross in late 2016 for the position, the president-elect called him \u201ca killer\u201d and promised Ross would be a key adviser in the crusade to throw over the chessboard when it comes to America\u2019s trade relationships. \u201cWilbur\u2019s at all the meetings,\u201d says Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council. \u201cAll the meetings.

{"Headline": "How Google Photos Became a Perfect Jukebox for Our Memories", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the artGoogle Photos, introduced in 2015, has become one of the most emotionally resonant pieces of technology today. It is also shaping our narratives along the way.The first time Google Photos made me cry, it was with a sucker punch. Google\u2019s computers can recognize faces, even as they age over time. Photos also seems to understand the tone and emotional valence of human interaction, things like smiles, giggles, frowns, tantrums, dances of joy and even snippets of dialogue like \u201chappy birthday!\u201d or \u201cgood job!\u201d The resulting montage, synced to a swelling Hollywood score, mixed obvious highlights \u2014 birthdays, school plays \u2014 with dozens of ordinary moments of childhood bliss. This is what I mean about a sucker punch: Who expects software to make them cry? Images on Instagram and Snapchat may move you regularly, but Google Photos is not social media; it is personal media, a service begun three years ago primarily as a database to house our growing collections of private snaps \u2014 and a service run mostly by machines, not by other humans posting and Liking stuff.With its heavy focus on artificially intelligent curation, Google Photos suggests the dawning of a new age of personalized robot historian. The trillions of images we are all snapping will become the raw material for algorithms that will curate memories and construct narratives about our most intimate human experiences. In the future, the robots will know everything about us \u2014 and they will tell our stories.But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves. Before fretting about the sci-fi tomorrow, it\u2019s worth marveling at the basic utility of Google Photos today. Tech companies have been trying to create ways to manage digital photos ever since we began ditching film. Most efforts have failed; the better our portable cameras get, the more photos we take, and the more photos we take, the less able we all are to make sense of the stash.\u201cWith the invention of the smartphone, there was nothing that humans did, absolutely nothing, that they didn\u2019t also make an image of,\u201d said Martin Hand, a sociologist at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, and the author of \u201cUbiquitous Photography,\u201d an academic inquiry into the blessed problem of too many photos. \u201cBut that brought about its own problems \u2014 it started to get overwhelming.\u201dMore than a decade ago, the tech world hit on one partial solution to picture overload: Make images social. Through services like Flickr, then Facebook and Instagram, we tried to curate our images by getting others to do it for us. The best photos of you were the ones that were ranked highly in your social feed; the worst were the ones you didn\u2019t post. But social media created another set of problems \u2014 there was a fear of missing out, a sense of performative anxiety, loneliness and an erosion of privacy. \u201cThere was a sense in which because everything was public, young people had to constantly curate the idea of themselves in public,\u201d said Mr. Hand.Its reimagined service would do three things: Offer nearly limitless storage for your photos essentially free (you can pay more to have your images stored in higher-resolution sizes). It put them in the cloud, so they could be accessed anywhere. And, crucially, Photos would lean on Google\u2019s famed A.I. to address what it saw as the key problem of the smartphone era \u2014 the fact that we all take photos but rarely look at them.\u201cWe noticed that you would never relive or reminisce about any of these moments,\u201d said Anil Sabharwal, the Google vice president who led the team that built Photos, and still runs it. \u201cYou would go on this beautiful vacation, you\u2019d take hundreds of beautiful photos, years would pass, and you would never look at any of them.\u201dWhen it started in 2015, Google Photos brought immediate relief. For instance, face recognition made sharing pictures automatic. Now, when I take a photo of my kids, Google recognizes them and shares those photos with my wife; her photos are shared with me. Incredibly, instantly, without thinking, we each have a complete collection of the children\u2019s photos, and any anxiety about keeping them secure has vanished.Then there are Google\u2019s daily prompts to reminisce. It\u2019s difficult to overstate how good Google\u2019s machines are at mining your collection to find new stuff to awe you. In one series, called Then and Now, it will find pictures of the same person, or groups of people, in similar poses at two different time periods: Your children on the first day of school this year versus last year, or you in front of the Empire State Building 10 years ago and today.I worry, given all this, about how A.I.-curated memories are shaping our narratives about ourselves. I think of Samara and children like her: how she will one day watch videos like the one Google produced of her, and she will come to certain conclusions about her childhood only because a for-profit, ad-supported tech company\u2019s machines made choices about what sort of scenes to show and what to hide.At the moment, there is no calamity here: Google Photos\u2019 videos are sunny and bright. But if history is about who tells your story, Photos pushes us into a new realm.The machines, now, are increasingly making sense of our human world \u2014 shaping our reality in the deepest way possible, and like cameras themselves, they\u2019re inescapable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bertolucci\u2019s Best Movies Streaming Now: \u2018Last Tango in Paris,\u2019 \u20191900\u2019 and More", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorking often in collaboration with his favorite cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro, he made films about ordinary and extraordinary people alike, and about the ways in which they struggle to dictate the course of their own lives.The seven movies featured here, however, comprise an excellent sampling of his most celebrated and controversial works, along with a few flawed visions that deserve a second look. (Dates reflect the year of a film\u2019s earliest theatrical debut, foreign or domestic.)A persistent theme in Bertolucci\u2019s work is how individuals are swept up by the forces of history, whether they\u2019re royalty, like Pu Yi in \u201cThe Last Emperor,\u201d or the childhood friends whose fates follow opposing political trajectories in \u201c1900.\u201dWith \u201cThe Conformist,\u201d his rapturously beautiful film about life in Mussolini\u2019s Italy, Bertolucci contends that fascism can also find an audience in passive and susceptible people, not only in the fervent ideologue. Jean-Louis Trintignant\u2019s character makes for a compelling case study: He is a member of the secret police assigned to murder his former college professor, a political dissident exiled in Paris, but he\u2019s hamstrung by feelings for the professor\u2019s wife (Dominique Sanda). Through flashbacks, Bertolucci identifies the circumstances that have led him to this place \u2014 and implies that others can be vulnerable, too.Seen today, the film embodies both the possibilities and the excesses of the Method style of its lead actor, Marlon Brando, whose intense brooding and wrenching outbursts are its driving force. Brando stars as a middle-aged American abroad who enters into an affair with a much younger Parisian woman (Schneider), initially as a salve to get over his wife\u2019s suicide. Their anonymous trysts \u2014 they share no personal information with each other, names included \u2014 are not without emotional consequences.This historical epic immediately ran aground when his 317-minute director\u2019s cut, which he had hoped to release in two parts, was scuttled by his producer, who edited together a 195-minute version before they compromised at 247. Since its 1991 rerelease, however, the longest cut has emerged as the definitive one, fully articulating Bertolucci\u2019s grand statement about Italian politics in first half of the 20th century.Robert De Niro and G\u00e9rard Depardieu star as a two childhood friends born on the same estate on Jan. 1, 1900, one the grandson of a peasant, one the grandson of an aristocrat. Although they remain in contact over the years \u2014 extremely close contact in one scene, which earned the re-release an NC-17 rating \u2014 they\u2019re driven apart by a shared love for the same woman (Dominique Sanda) and their conflicting roles in the fascist takeover of the estate.Although it swept the Oscars in 1987, winning awards for best picture and best director, \u201cThe Last Emperor\u201d has receded from view over the years, which seems entirely appropriate to its story of a leader who was worshiped as a boy and all-but-forgotten as a man.But there\u2019s plenty here to cherish, starting with the sumptuous beauty of the production, which revivifies China\u2019s Forbidden City. It also has one of the greatest film scores in cinema history, composed in separate and distinctive portions by Ryuichi Sakamoto, David Byrne and Cong Su.The life of Pu Yi, played as an adult by John Lone, unfolds in four distinct phases, with the emperor learning the ropes from a British tutor (Peter O\u2019Toole) as a boy, being exiled from the Forbidden City in 1924, returning as a puppet leader of Manchuria for Japanese invaders and, finally, living out the end of his life as a gardener.In the wake of \u201cThe Last Emperor,\u201d this picturesque love triangle, set in North Africa after World War II, was dismissed as comparatively insubstantial, less an engagement with the historical moment than a pretty snapshot.But in adapting the novel by Paul Bowles, who had just settled in Tangier when he wrote the book, Bertolucci is trying to account for how people struggle to find a place for themselves in a suddenly borderless world. Described as \u201ctravelers\u201d rather than tourists \u2014 the distinction being that travelers could stay indefinitely while tourists are just passing through \u2014 an American couple (Debra Winger and John Malkovich) and their friend (Campbell Scott) arrive in Tangier in 1947 and soon get caught up in romantic entanglements that threaten the marriage and the friendship.The casting of Keanu Reeves as Siddhartha all but guaranteed that Bertolucci\u2019s earnest spiritual journey would get scoffed out of theaters. T hat\u2019s to say nothing of the awkwardness inherent in its premise, which follows the search for a reincarnated Buddhist teacher to a middle-class white family in Seattle.Yet \u201cLittle Buddha\u201d has a storybook simplicity that is unusual for Bertolucci, who seems utterly committed to making the transcendent accessible to the widest possible audience. The quest to find the reborn Lama Dorje leads Tibetan Buddhist monks to a sweet young boy (Alex Wiesendanger), whose parents (Chris Isaak and Bridget Fonda) are understandably wary about handing him over to a higher fate. Bertolucci cuts between these recruitment efforts and a highly stylized story-within-the-story about Siddhartha\u2019s quest to end universal suffering.After years of cinematic globe-trotting, Bertolucci returned to Italy for this fetching wisp of a coming-of-age film, which cast Liv Tyler as a 19-year-old who heads to a Tuscan villa with the secret mission to lose her virginity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Always a Great Seat at the Game, if You Can Fly a Blimp", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVocationsA year later, I was teaching a class on the ground when someone came in and told us there was a blimp on a low approach. Everyone ran to the window to watch it. We were only about 200 feet from the landing area. It seemed to fill the sky, and I was in awe.Almost a year later, I was looking for work and typed \u201cpilot jobs\u201d into Google. This Goodyear job popped up. I joined them in 2011.How many pilots are licensed to fly blimps in the world?About 40 to 50 pilots are flying fewer than 10 active blimps in the world today. Only a few I know of are women.What does it feel like to fly in a blimp and to pilot one?Most people compare the feeling to being in a big cruise ship. It shifts slightly with the winds, just like the effect ocean waves have on cruise liners and other ships.Part of the excitement is that the gondola \u2014 where passengers sit \u2014 has large windows, and, hovering at such low altitudes, the views are breathtaking.As pilots, we have to be aware of more than just the aerodynamics. We use gas laws and calculate lift capacity based on constantly changing variables such as temperature, pressure, passenger weights and fuel load.Goodyear\u2019s airships are equipped with the basic tools all pilots use: fly-by-wire flight controls, electronic flight display, Garmin GPS, weather radar, etc.We use engines that swivel. This allows us great maneuverability in the air and the capability to launch and land the airship vertically as well as to maintain higher cruise speeds.Can anyone book a flight as a passenger?No, we don\u2019t take reservations. We do offer rides to our Goodyear dealers around the country, and we also donate blimp rides to nonprofit organizations for charity auctions.The majority of our time in the air involves providing aerial television coverage of sports and entertainment events, including N.C.A.A. football, the N.F.L.\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d the U.S. Open golf tournament, N.B.A. basketball and Major League Baseball.We also spend considerable time traveling across the country to get to the events we cover. The top speed of our blimps is just 70 knots \u2014 that\u2019s 80 miles per hour. So going from my base in Carson to, say, Cleveland for the N.B.A. playoffs in 2017 took seven or eight days with overnight stops.Do the television networks pay Goodyear to shoot the sports events?We provide aerial coverage in exchange for Goodyear brand mentions within the programming. We have been providing aerial coverage since 1955.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Capturing the Complexities of the Modern South, in Photographs", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensA new exhibition challenges the perceived identity of the American South, at a time when the definition of regionalism itself is in flux.\u201c\u2018New Southern Photography\u2019 is not intended to define the South,\u201d Mr. McCabe wrote in the exhibit\u2019s catalog, \u201cbut rather to create an open discussion.\u201d And that discussion includes a diverse group of photographers. There are photojournalists: A beautiful collection by Kael Alford depicts the environmental threats to Louisiana\u2019s coastal communities; another collection by Scott Dalton, a Houston-based photographer, tells the story of immigration, drug trafficking, and trade at the United States-Mexico border in Texas.A sense of home led William Christenberry in the 1960s to photograph ramshackle cabins and old stores with quaint, picturesque Coca-Cola signs in Hale County, Ala. It\u2019s where he grew up. He was picking up where the Depression-era photographer Walker Evans left off decades earlier, further commemorating this gorgeous speck of rural America. The strength of his work \u2014 along with William Eggleston\u2019s depictions of everyday life in the Mississippi Delta and Sally Mann\u2019s lyrical, romantic shots of Virginia, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2014 inspired legions of documentarians who, seemingly governed by the same nostalgic impulses, recycled those visions of the South.\u201cIn the epilogue of my book, I have a picture of a person taking a picture of a Sprott store,\u201d Mr. Matthews said, referring to someone who traveled to West Alabama to rephotograph a convenience store in Sprott that Walker Evans had documented in the 1930s.Images of the idyllic South reinforce notions of rural and small-town America, but they don\u2019t match the full realities of its contemporary culture. Alex Grabiec addressed the suburbanization of once-rural areas with stark, nondescript images whose aesthetics are the opposite of romantic. Jared Soares found and photographed a small yet thriving community of hip-hop artists in Roanoke, Va., historically known for its bluegrass. Susan Worsham composed beautiful images of beautiful strangers, like a soon-to-be-deployed Marine who reminded her of her deceased brother.\u201cAt the beginning of the 21st century, the identity of the American South and the definition of regionalism is in flux,\u201d Mr. McCabe wrote. The photographers who represent it are changing, too.New voices are sometimes better equipped to address the South\u2019s troubled history. In RaMell Ross\u2019s \u201cGiving Tree,\u201d a young girl\u2019s body is languidly draped over a thick tree branch. From the moment he arrived in Hale County, Mr. Ross, who is black, worked to understand how the historic South became the \u201cconception home of the black image\u201d and has contributed to \u201cthe way in which we understand what black struggle is, the origins of it,\u201d he said. Ross has quietly and whimsically integrated the slavery-stained landscape of the South into his work.\u201cIf you saw the \u2018Giving Tree\u2019 image as a white person, you won\u2019t necessarily think of a lynching, you might think of a swing or of something else,\u201d he said.But for a black person, Ross continued, \u201cObviously, it has different connotations. And that\u2019s where the power of skin can actually come out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Visions of a Tech Hub? Landing Amazon Is Just a Start", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Amazon announced plans to build a second headquarters somewhere in North America, it set off a competition for a sort of new-economy golden ticket, a chance for one city to become, almost overnight, a magnet for the high-paying jobs and entrepreneurial spark that are hallmarks of urban success in the 21st century.Critics were just as quick to highlight potential downsides: soaring housing costs, clogged roads and strained public resources.A year later, Amazon appears poised to transform two communities, not just one. But the central question \u2014 will that transformation be for the good or the bad? \u2014 has not changed. Economists, urban planners and other experts say the answer could hinge on decisions in the coming months by the company and by the state and local officials who worked so hard to woo it.\u201cThis is not about a one-time deal,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThis is about whether Amazon and these winning communities are going to create a long-term partnership to minimize the negative impact of supersonic growth.\u201dAmazon may have made that job a bit easier. Splitting the project, known as HQ2, between two cities should ease the pressure on housing and infrastructure that critics have feared. And the company seems to have zeroed in on places able to handle an influx of workers.\u201cThose two markets were in the leading edge of rental slowdowns,\u201d said Aaron Terrazas, a Zillow economist. \u201cThere is definitely a lot more supply in those markets than there was in Seattle a decade ago.\u201dThe specter of Seattle has loomed over the HQ2 debate. Its economy has boomed since Amazon moved into the South Lake Union neighborhood in 2007. But many residents complain that growth has come at the cost of affordability and livability. Although Amazon has never said so explicitly, its tense relationship with its native city may have contributed to its decision to search for a second home.In New York and Virginia, Amazon has a chance for a fresh start. And those places have an opportunity to learn from Seattle\u2019s mistakes.\u201cWhen Amazon moved into its South Lake Union headquarters, no one knew that it was going to become the global phenomenon that it is today,\u201d Mr. Terrazas said. \u201cIn Seattle there was a lot of catch-up in housing development, catch-up in infrastructure.\u201dNew York and Virginia, by contrast, can start planning immediately to build housing, expand infrastructure and improve transit systems. If they do, Amazon could be the nudge that regions needed to address longstanding challenges, said Sarah Rosen Wartell, president of the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\u201cThere is a way that something like this focuses the mind,\u201d Ms. Wartell said. \u201cAmazon or no Amazon, all of our major housing markets and communities that are thriving are dealing with the consequences of growth.\u201dThe key is ensuring that policies benefit all residents, not just highly paid tech workers that Amazon will employ directly, Ms. Wartell said. That means building housing for low- and middle-income families, not just luxury condominiums, and improving transit options in poorer neighborhoods.Critics are skeptical of that prospect. Lauren Jacobs, executive director of the Partnership for Working Families, a network of local advocacy organizations, said Amazon should make specific promises to train and hire workers locally, rather than just bringing them in from out of town.\u201cMany of our neighbors are still struggling in this economy, and this could be an amazing transformational thing to have 25,000 jobs come to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to ensure we don\u2019t see another wave of mass displacement of working-class residents.\u201dTimothy J. Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has studied tax incentives, said comments such as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s were concerning. He and other economists worry about a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d where state and local governments compete to offer ever-bigger subsidies.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to hand out cash, and it\u2019s especially easy to hand out cash if it\u2019s going to be the next governor\u2019s problem,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.But not all incentives are created equal, he noted. Efforts to streamline regulatory and permitting processes, for example, can make projects more attractive to companies without costing taxpayers much if anything. And investments in infrastructure or job training can reap benefits for the community even if they are initially promised as a way to help a specific company.\u201cI would be trying to leverage this into improvements that wouldn\u2019t just benefit Amazon but benefit you more broadly,\u201d Mr. Bartik said.New York and Washington, of course, are a far cry from the rural Southeast. And white-collar tech jobs at Amazon require different skills than the factory jobs created by Mercedes and BMW.But Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, pointed to parallels. Amazon and other technology companies employ not just hotshot graduates of Stanford and Caltech but also thousands of lower-level programmers, data analysts and other workers who have technical skills but not advanced degrees.Amazon\u2019s decision could change the pecking order among technology hubs, in which New York and Washington have lagged behind San Francisco, Seattle and Boston.\u201cI think it does set these cities up to be rivals to Silicon Valley a generation or two down the road,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt could be the catalyst.\u201dAmazon\u2019s arrival will also mean more demand for the pool of tech workers in New York and Washington. That worries some start-ups, who already compete with Google, Facebook and other giants that have set up offices there.But Sam Mandel, senior vice president at Betaworks, a company that develops and invests in start-ups, said Amazon would be a net benefit for the tech sector.\u201cThere will be more people leaving Amazon and wanting to do earlier stage start-ups than there will be people leaving start-ups to go work at Amazon,\u201d Mr. Mandel said.Erin Griffith contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Remembrance of Recipes Past", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThanksgiving is the one time of year when family bonds matter more than the food.Contributing Opinion WriterI keep searching anyway because winter makes me long for those glistening golden discs that Mother Ollie made right on the stovetop, dropping a dollop of thin batter, pancake style, into a shallow pool of heated oil in her own cast-iron skillet. The circles would spread out in the oil, thinner and thinner, until they formed a kind of lace around the edges. A properly formed corn cake is golden in the center, soft and puffy, with lacy edges that are crisp and almost brown. When they look like that, it\u2019s time to flip them over and cook the other side.Mother Ollie\u2019s cooking technique I remember well enough; it\u2019s her recipe for the batter that\u2019s lost to me now. I found her recipe for gruel (\u201cgood for ailing folks,\u201d the card notes) and a recipe in my grandmother\u2019s hand for buttermilk rolls, as well as two different copies of the cream-cheese poundcake invented by Miss Tommie, my grandmother\u2019s best friend. But in the recipe box I inherited from my mother there is no card for corn cakes.Yes, yes, I know the internet is full of recipes for every possible kind of cornbread. Google \u201clacy corn cakes,\u201d and half a dozen recipes will pop up, though none of them look just right in the pictures. Some call for a mixture of plain cornmeal and flour; some call for self-rising cornmeal; some require buttermilk, and some make do with water. It\u2019s a surprising variety of options for a food made from no more than four ingredients, and I tell myself I don\u2019t have time to test them all.The truth is that I don\u2019t want to cook from a stranger\u2019s recipe. I want to cook from a family recipe. It\u2019s Thanksgiving, when I am always most homesick for beloved elders no longer here. I am searching for a very particular taste, for a mixture of corn and salt and butter that will take me instantly back to a farmhouse in Lower Alabama, the house where my people lived for generations. I want my kitchen to be filled with the same scents that came from that old kitchen when the house was full of family.The recipe I\u2019m looking for might still turn up. In her life, my mother created inscrutable taxonomies of every kind, and the cards in her recipe box were no exception. Just because a cornbread recipe isn\u2019t in the bread section does not mean it isn\u2019t in the box somewhere else. And there are hundreds of recipe cards that aren\u2019t in the box at all anymore because Mom pulled them out and never put them back.During the last years of her life, she ate supper at my house every night. Her own stove was unplugged for safety\u2019s sake, and there was no reason for her to spend hours poring over recipes for dishes she was never going to cook. She left the cards in little piles all over her house anyway \u2014 on bookcase shelves, on the floor beside her bed, on every side table in every room. I gathered them up in the days after her sudden death and dumped them into various baskets and boxes. Six years later, I still can\u2019t bring myself to sort through them.When I was growing up, my mother put a hot meal on the table every night, but she was never an enthusiastic cook \u2014 no one greeted the invention of Hamburger Helper with more gratitude. I don\u2019t know why, decades later, she kept pulling out the recipe cards. Maybe she was looking for a particular recipe, too, hoping I might be persuaded to cook a dish she remembered and suddenly missed. Or maybe she wanted only to remember her own beloved dead.For me it is always both heartbreaking and comforting to open my mother\u2019s recipe box on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The family Thanksgiving recipes are there, of course \u2014 the squash dressing, creamed spinach and pecan pie that my children regard as holiday nonnegotiables in the same way I did when I was in my 20s and feeling both the intoxication and anxiety of independence. Thanksgiving is not a time for culinary experimentation, at least not in our family. There\u2019s comfort in a traditional holiday meal that goes far beyond the notion of comfort food.But my mother\u2019s recipe box is also a kind of living document, an annotated interplay of generations. Recipes in my great-grandmother\u2019s hand are adjusted in my grandmother\u2019s, and then again in my mother\u2019s. Tucked behind Mom\u2019s recipe for a ground-beef-and-sour-cream casserole is my recipe for spinach lasagna \u2014 I don\u2019t remember copying it out for Mom, but I recognize the notebook paper I habitually used in graduate school. There\u2019s a recipe for pork tenderloin in my mother-in-law\u2019s handwriting, too, and countless recipes from friends and relations whose handwriting I can still identify even decades after their deaths. I could create a timeline of my own life from those recipe cards.My children have grown up eating Sister Shubert\u2019s rolls on Thanksgiving Day, and they will not be brokenhearted if I never find Mother Ollie\u2019s recipe for corn cakes, though I am not giving up the search. Even if I don\u2019t find it in time, I hope my grandmother\u2019s recipe for yeast rolls, newly recovered from the unfathomable mysteries of my mother\u2019s recipe box, will fill my kitchen with the scent of home. Perhaps the secret is in the buttermilk.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Look Inside the Tactics of Definers, Facebook\u2019s Attack Dog", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a few days before Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, testified to Congress in September, Definers set its sights on a different target: the senators about to question Ms. Sandberg.In one document circulated to reporters, Definers tallied what software the 15 members of the Senate Intelligence Committee used to track visitors to their Senate websites. Another document detailed how much each senator spent on Facebook ads and how much they had received in campaign donations from Facebook or other big tech companies.Known in the political business as opposition research, the documents pushed out by Definers neatly provided reporters with the ammunition they would need to suggest the senators grilling Ms. Sandberg were hypocrites for criticizing Facebook.While senators are no strangers to opposition research \u2014 they use it all the time against political rivals \u2014 they take a dimmer view when it is used against them outside of election season. That is especially true when the research is being paid for and shoveled to reporters on behalf of a company that is saying it wants to work with lawmakers, not against them.And companies facing scrutiny in Washington usually avoid doing anything that could antagonize lawmakers.\u201cAt the same time that Facebook was publicly professing their desire to work with the committee to address these issues, they were paying a political opposition research firm to privately attempt to undermine that same committee\u2019s credibility,\u201d Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the panel, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s very concerning.\u201d\u201cI understand that a lot of D.C.-type firms might do this kind of work. When I learned about it I decided that we don\u2019t want to be doing it,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday during a call with reporters.Colin Reed, managing director of Definers, said in an email that his firm simply compiled public information and what Definers did was \u201cstandard operating procedure\u201d for public affairs outfits. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be surprising to reporters at The New York Times that a P.R. firm would be providing context for reporters ahead of a client\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill,\u201d he wrote.Facebook initially hired Definers to monitor news about the social network. It expanded its relationship with the firm in October 2017 when scrutiny of Facebook was increasing over how Russian agents had used the site to sow discord before the 2016 United States election.Definers began doing some general communications work, such as running conference calls for Facebook. It also undertook more covert efforts to spread the blame for the rise of the Russian disinformation, pointing fingers at other companies like Google.A key part of Definers\u2019 strategy was NTK Network, a website that appeared to be a run-of-the-mill news aggregator with a right-wing slant. In fact, many of NTK Network\u2019s stories were written by employees at Definers and America Rising, a sister firm, to criticize rivals of their clients, according to one former employee not allowed to speak about it publicly. The three outfits share some staff and offices in Arlington, Va.Before Ms. Sandberg\u2019s Senate testimony, Facebook lobbyists pushed lawmakers to refrain from questioning her about privacy, censorship and other issues, and to stick to election interference. The committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, was swayed and warned members to stick to the hearing\u2019s planned topic, The Times reported Wednesday.Facebook had also lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. Mr. Burr invited Larry Page, a Google co-founder, but he did not show up. Instead, Ms. Sandberg sat alongside an empty chair behind a placard for Google.In an email days before the hearing, a Definers employee pressed a Times reporter to write that Facebook was taking the senators\u2019 concerns seriously while Google was irresponsible for skipping the hearing.Like the documents on the senators, Definers distributed other memos that sought to lay out evidence for angles that it wanted reporters to pursue. The memos were typically based on public information like press clippings and social media posts.Definers urged reporters to explore the financial ties between Mr. Soros and Freedom From Facebook, a coalition of groups that had criticized the company. The idea was to persuade reporters that the coalition was not a sincere movement of like-minded groups but rather an orchestrated campaign by a rich, partisan opponent.A two-page document that Definers distributed about Freedom From Facebook noted that \u201cat least four of the groups in the coalition receive funding or are aligned with George Soros, who has publicly criticized Facebook.\u201d The four groups named in the document do appear to have received funding from Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations.A second, 12-page document sought to link Freedom From Facebook to Mr. Soros and to David Brock, a Democratic operative who is widely portrayed in conservative circles as a master of political dirty tricks. While pushing the connection to Mr. Soros, the document highlighted that protesters from Freedom From Facebook held up signs with images reminiscent of old, anti-Semitic propaganda.Definers said in a statement that the document was \u201centirely factual and based on public records.\u201dEddie Vale, a Freedom From Facebook spokesman, said the coalition\u2019s primary funder was the computer scientist David Magerman but he declined to disclose other funders. Mr. Vale said the coalition did not receive money from corporations. Open Society Foundations said it did not fund the coalition.Laura Silber, a spokeswoman for Open Society Foundations, said the philanthropy\u2019s president spoke with Ms. Sandberg on Thursday and requested that Facebook commission an independent review of the company\u2019s relationship with Definers, with results made public within three months.Jack Nicas reported from San Francisco, and Matthew Rosenberg from Washington.

My dad said he could teach me Microsoft Excel if I wanted. One friend asked if he could borrow my abacus. Another asked if I wrote my story on a typewriter.Yes, I did, actually. While wearing a fedora with my press pass in it. Then I sent the story to the office via Western Union.All reporters have their quirks. One of mine just happens to be writing things out by hand instead of using a spreadsheet. I do this willingly and happily, and not as a subconscious rebellion against technology, or out of obligation or some masochistic delight. This confuses friends, colleagues and even my wife, who can\u2019t fathom why I keep to-do lists, appointments, even birthdays in an academic planner instead of on Google calendar.Crazy, right?On a base level, there\u2019s a very simple reason behind my madness: I tend to retain information better if I write it down. The numbers loiter in my brain, awaiting connections like the one I made during a conversation with the football historian John Turney, who posited that 1994 \u2014 when the N.F.L. renewed its emphasis on prohibiting defensive backs from jamming receivers more than five yards downfield \u2014 would be a pivot point in examining the explosion of passing numbers.Hold on, John, let me check. Since I had charted a mess of passing statistics for every season from 1980 to 2017, I was able to discern that, in some categories, he was absolutely correct.The entire exercise \u2014 locating the data, culling what I need and synthesizing it in a format that\u2019s accessible, always with a four-colored ballpoint pen \u2014 helps me detect patterns I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have noticed.These epiphanies used to occur all the time back when I covered baseball. At The Dallas Morning News, two colleagues, Evan Grant and Gerry Fraley, tutored me in the art of tracking a team over a full season. And so I kept a binder filled with pages of various pitching, fielding and hitting statistics for individual players on the Texas Rangers (first half of 2005 season), the Mets (August 2005 through 2009) and the Yankees (2010 through July 2011), and also for those teams as a whole.And besides, I liked having a hard copy just in case.In case of what? Well, I\u2019m still not sure.A deputy sports editor, Randy Archibold, thought it was awesome. My daughter thought it was pretty. My wife thought I was crazy.At the end of every season, I sketch out \u2014 with assistance from ESPN\u2019s playoff machine \u2014 all the different postseason permutations. As in, if Kansas City and Indianapolis win but Cincinnati and Miami lose, which teams make the playoffs? There\u2019s no real value to the endeavor other than convenience: a diagram I can refer to \u2014 and mark up \u2014 on that final Sunday of the season as I adjust hotel reservations for the playoffs.Figure it\u2019s about time. I\u2019ll bring the abacus.Follow Ben Shpigel on Twitter: @benshpigelAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Microsoft Is Worth as Much as Apple. How Did That Happen?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world.It was big and still quite profitable, but the company had lost its luster, failing or trailing in the markets of the future like mobile, search, online advertising and cloud computing. Its stock price languished, inching up 3 percent in the decade through the end of 2012.It\u2019s a very different story today. Microsoft is running neck and neck with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company, both worth about $850 billion, thanks to a stock price that has climbed 30 percent over the last 12 months. At the end of trading Friday, Microsoft was just ahead of its longtime rival.So what happened?There is a short-term explanation for Microsoft\u2019s market rise, and there is a longer-term one.The near-term, stock-trading answer is that Microsoft has held up better than others during the recent sell-off of tech company shares. Apple investors are worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Facebook and Google face persistent attacks on their role in distributing false news and conspiracy theories, and investor concerns that their privacy policies could scare off users and advertisers.But the more enduring and important answer is that Microsoft has become a case study of how a once-dominant company can build on its strengths and avoid being a prisoner of its past. It has fully embraced cloud computing, abandoned an errant foray into smartphones and returned to its roots as mainly a supplier of technology to business customers.Microsoft\u2019s path to cloud computing \u2014 processing, storage and software delivered as a service over the internet from remote data centers \u2014 was lengthy and sometimes halting.Its forerunners to cloud computing go back to the 1990s, with Microsoft\u2019s MSN online service and later its Bing search engine. In 2010, four years after Amazon entered the cloud market, Microsoft introduced its cloud service. But it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.Even then, Microsoft\u2019s cloud service was a side business. The corporate center of gravity remained its Windows operating system, the linchpin of the company\u2019s wealth and power during the personal computer era. That changed after Mr. Nadella replaced Steven A. Ballmer, who had been chief executive for 14 years.Microsoft has also retooled its popular Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a cloud version, Office 365. That offering caters to people who prefer to use software as an internet service and gives Microsoft a competitive entry against online app suppliers like Google.The financial payoff from the shift came gradually at first, but is accelerating. In the year that ended in June, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 15 percent, to $110 billion, and operating profit increased 13 percent, to $35 billion.\u201cThe essence of what Satya Nadella did was the dramatic shift to the cloud,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cHe put Microsoft back into a high-growth business.\u201dIt is the perception that Microsoft is on a high-growth track that has fueled its rising share price.Microsoft would not try to compete with the smartphone technology leaders, Apple, Google and Samsung. Instead, Microsoft focused on its developing apps and other software for business customers.Microsoft does have a successful consumer franchise in its Xbox video game business. But it is a separate unit, and though it generates revenue of $10 billion, that is still less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s overall sales.Microsoft products, in the main, are about utility \u2014 productivity tools, whether people use them at work or at home. And its Azure cloud technology is a service for businesses and a platform for software developers to build applications, a kind of cloud operating system.\u201cIt\u2019s really the coming together of the professional cloud and the professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella explained at the time.Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has loosened up. Windows would no longer be its center of gravity \u2014 or its anchor. Microsoft apps would run not only on Apple\u2019s Macintosh software but on other operating systems as well. Open source and free software, once anathema to Microsoft, was embraced as a vital tool of modern software development.Mr. Nadella preached an outward-looking mind-set. \u201cWe need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft,\u201d he wrote in his book \u201cHit Refresh,\u201d published last year.The company\u2019s financial performance \u2014 and its stock price \u2014 suggest that the Nadella formula is working.\u201cThe old, Windows-centric view of the world stifled innovation,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThe company has changed culturally. Microsoft is an exciting place to work again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Better Local Journalism, by Local Reporters, Is the Goal of a New Database", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLocal journalists who know their hometowns could report the same stories more accurately and with more depth, they say.Sarah Baird, a journalist from Richmond, Ky., is among the critics, and she has an answer.\u201cThese stories cause actual consequences for these communities,\u201d Ms. Baird said, \u201cnot only in how the nation perceives them but how they perceive themselves.\u201dShe has spoken with organizations like PEN America about collaborating with its PEN Across America initiative, which focuses on local news advocacy and media literacy.Shoeleather\u2019s purpose is to make it easy for editors at national news organizations to find reporters who are entrenched in communities and knowledgeable of, say, how agriculture price fluctuations affect residents surrounding Des Moines, or the effect 19th-century race riots might have on current voting legislation in North Carolina. A local reporter, Ms. Baird said, might be able to help an editor with a feature article or to collaborate on breaking news like hurricanes or shootings, rather than relying solely on staff reporters from out of town.The Shoeleather database follows the format of databases created to address the lack of representation in the media industry, including Writers of Color and Disabled Writers. Registering with Shoeleather is free. Journalists sign up using a Google form, noting their location and areas of coverage. Assigning editors can access the database at no cost, sorting reporters by state, city and coverage area and then getting their contact information.Ms. Baird said she planned to connect with regional and national press clubs, as well as research hubs like the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute in Columbia, Mo., and the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues in Lexington, Ky. She will also attend journalism conferences to spread the word about Shoeleather.She hopes word of mouth will be a catalyst.\u201cNational editors are an \u2018if you build it they will come\u2019 sort of thing,\u201d Ms. Baird said when asked how she planned to encourage larger news organizations to use the database.The database could also be a boon for regional publications. Christina C. Smith, an assistant professor of mass communication at Georgia College who specializes in community journalism, said that for regional papers like The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, budget cuts often lead to a decline in coverage of smaller towns\u2019 local politics, and subsequently in the paper\u2019s local character that once enticed readers and advertisers.\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle because circulations are on decline because ad revenue is declining, but those things are declining because they\u2019re not giving their audience anything to pay for,\u201d Ms. Smith said.Shoeleather, she said, could perhaps highlight subjects that would otherwise go uncovered.Steven Waldman, the president and co-founder of Report for America, a nonprofit group that has installed reporters in local newsrooms across the country, agreed. \u201cIf there had been earlier coverage of the opioid problem and a better connection between national and local media, we would have seen this as a national problem sooner,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you can see patterns.\u201d\u201cThe plan is always be around,\u201d Ms. Baird said. \u201cTo be a resource.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Yet there is a silver lining: This is the best time to buy a few items, like video game consoles, televisions and smart home accessories, which plummet to their lowest prices. If you know ahead of time what to focus on, you might score a few good deals.To help narrow your search for good buys on Black Friday, I teamed up with Wirecutter to round up the products that are worth following \u2014 and the ones you can skip.\u201cThis year in particular, the consoles are pretty much the best prices we\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said.For example, both Walmart and Best Buy plan to sell Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 bundled with the new Spider-Man game for $200, down from the retail price of $300 for the console alone. In addition, Nintendo\u2019s Switch console will cost about $300 together with a Super Mario Kart game \u2014 normally, the system costs that much without a game included.Black Friday tends to be one of the best times to buy a great television for a significant discount. But there are caveats.For one, don\u2019t be fooled by ads for so-called doorbusters \u2014 like jaw-droppingly cheap TVs \u2014 at retailers like Best Buy, Mr. Burakowski said. Those tend to be mediocre TV sets, or they sell out extremely quickly. For another, during Black Friday, manufacturers sometimes sell subpar televisions with model numbers that are nearly identical to popular, high-quality sets, he added.SIZEBEST TVRUNNER-UPSTEP UPLessthan50\u201dSony XBR49X900F Samsung UN49NU8000NoneThe Samsung NU8000 has a nice streaming interface, good image quality and special motion features just for video games, making it the best choice for hard-core gamers.51\u201dto60\u201dVizio P55-F1TCL 55R615-17LG 55C8PThe Vizio P-Series offers superb image quality, and with Google Chromecast built in, it can stream from almost any service on your phone. \u00a061\u201dto70\u201dVizio P65-F1TCL 65R617Vizio PQ65-F1The Vizio PQ-Series is the best-looking LCD TV, and it truly shines with HDR content.

These include:outdoor gear laptops large kitchen appliances office suppliesHere\u2019s why: Outdoor gear usually goes on sale in the weeks before Black Friday, and well-reviewed laptops get better discounts during back-to-school season in the fall. Office supplies and large kitchen appliances like refrigerators sporadically go on sale throughout the year and are not tied to a particular season.There\u2019s one more thing you can skip altogether: lining up to stampede into stores at the crack of dawn.The overwhelming majority of good Black Friday deals are obtainable online, Mr. Burakowski said. So after filling up on turkey, you can stick with your friends and family and occasionally peek at your phone to see if the item you wanted went on sale.

{"Headline": "Victoria\u2019s Secret? In 2018, Fewer Women Want to Hear It", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe lingerie company has clung to the idea that women should look sexy for men. And its stock is falling. The push-up bra may be finally going the way of the corset.The news this week that Jan Singer, the C.E.O. of Victoria\u2019s Secret Lingerie was stepping down \u2014 this after a P.R. crisis over transphobic remarks made by another executive \u2014 was just the latest hit to a brand that has been in steady decline for years.The marketing of Victoria\u2019s Secret has been nothing if not consistent. The company\u2019s fashion show this month, complete with skinny models, push-up bras, thongs and strappy stilettos, was a near carbon copy of the one it first mounted in 1995, albeit with more feathers, sequins and wings. And its adherence to that vision of sexy will not be compromised. Not by those who criticize the whole affair as sexist, nor by the slew of new bra start-ups that offer products meant for comfort and ease, nor even by the women abandoning Victoria\u2019s Secret to shop elsewhere.Victoria\u2019s Secret is still the leading U.S. lingerie brand, but its share of the market is falling rapidly. Sales are sagging and the company\u2019s stock is down 41 percent this year. In a September 2017 consumer study conducted by Wells Fargo, 68 percent of respondents said they liked Victoria\u2019s Secret less than they used to and 60 percent said they think the brand feels \u201cforced\u201d or \u201cfake.\u201d\u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret is losing share to other brands because it\u2019s out of touch,\u201d said Paul Lejuez, a retail analyst at Citi who follows L Brands. \u201cThe way it\u2019s marketing is out of touch. Women don\u2019t want to be viewed as stereotypical sexy supermodels buying lingerie just to impress men.\u201d The \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show\u201d on television hasn\u2019t fared well either. It has shed nearly half of its total viewers in five years.Consider: In 2013, when the show was still something of an event, it drew an audience of 9.7 million viewers, bigger numbers that night than NBC\u2019s airing of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d Last year, the show drew an audience of only five million, about three million fewer viewers than tuned into CBS\u2019s broadcast of the holiday classic \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\u201d two hours earlier.Ed Razek, the chief marketing officer of L Brands, made headlines this month as well, when, in an interview with Vogue, he expressed disinterest in the idea of casting plus size and transgender models in Victoria\u2019s Secret shows. These companies were founded by women, and were born of a frustration with the industry at large. Victoria\u2019s Secret, on the other hand, was designed with the straight male consumer in mind.The company was started by the entrepreneurial couple Roy and Gaye Raymond in 1977 as an antidote to the confusion and shame Mr. Raymond felt in department store lingerie sections. He told Newsweek in 1981 that while shopping for his wife he \u201cwas faced with racks of terry-cloth robes and ugly floral-print nylon nightgowns, and I always had the feeling the department store saleswomen thought I was an unwelcome intruder.\u201dHeidi Zak, the chief executive of ThirdLove, said she used to dread having to drive to the mall to go to Victoria\u2019s Secret and buy a bra. \u201cI came out and I took the pink striped bag and stuffed it in my bag because I was embarrassed I\u2019d been shopping there,\u201d Ms. Zak said. \u201cNothing about the brand \u2014 the aesthetic, the product \u2014 nothing really resonated with me.\u201dMs. Imani said she used to shop at Victoria\u2019s Secret in high school but thought the bras were low quality, a point other women made. When she started buying ThirdLove bras, she realized she had \u201cbeen measuring myself wrong. I\u2019d thought for a long time I was a B, but I\u2019 m a C and a half.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know your size, especially if you come from an economically challenged background,\u201d she said. \u201cThirdLove is leveling the playing field in that sense.\u201d Accounting for women\u2019s lived realities, like the wide variation in breast size, was also a part of Knix\u2019s business strategy. Since 2013, the company has gained a cult following in the intimate apparel space for its leakproof underwear and wireless bras. \u201cI was thinking about what happens to women\u2019s bodies at different stages in their lives,\u201d said Joanna Griffiths, the founder and chief executive. \u201cWomen leak during normal activities.\u201d\u201cWhen we launched we knew we wanted to use our customers as our models,\u201d Ms. Griffiths said. \u201cOur campaigns are all real women. We have that built into our brand.\u201dDecreased foot traffic at shopping malls could be hurting Victoria\u2019s Secret, as could their elimination of a swimsuit line. (The company said that swimwear accounted for less than 5 percent of sales in 2016, the last year it was available.)\u201cIt is absolutely not the case that people have just given up wearing bras,\u201d said Cora Harrington, author of \u201cIn Intimate Detail: How to Choose, Wear and Love Lingerie.\u201d But larger trends \u201caround being comfortable, athleisure and body positivity\u201d are definitely ascendant, she said. And it\u2019s true that Victoria\u2019s Secret still draws big influencers and retains cultural cachet. The 2018 show, which will air on Dec. 2, featured a host of superstar \u201cAngels\u201d and lingerie-clad models, including Adriana Lima, Gigi and Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Winnie Harlow. The Kardashian and Jenner sisters all dressed up as Victoria\u2019s Secret angels for Halloween. \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s identity is sexiness, and that very identity is becoming a challenge for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is the question of whether their management team really connects to the customer. They would do well to have more women in leadership.\u201dMs. McKean, who had the double mastectomy, said: \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s angels are so stunning. But they are not real. I mean they are real people, but they are not a reflection of how we should look at our bodies and at women.\u201dMs. Imani, who abandoned Victoria\u2019s Secret after high school, had much less reverence.\u201c I was always averse to the whole \u2018you have to worship white women\u2019s bodies\u2019 thing,\u201d she said.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a flat stomach to feel beautiful,\u201d Ms. Imani added. \u201cI believe that.\u201dJonah Engel Bromwich, Matthew Schneier and John Koblin contributed reporting.An earlier version of this article erroneously included Karlie Kloss among the models in the Victoria's Secret show. While she has walked in past shows, she did not participate in the 2018 show.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Entering Burn Area\u2019: Yosemite After the Fire ", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "America\u2019s national parks are increasingly bearing the burden of climate change, as rising temperatures and new weather patterns create mega blazes. A report from the burn zone. Supported byA megafire is a fire that consumes more than 100,000 acres. A few months ago, in an area near Yosemite National Park, the Ferguson fire raged through the Sierra Nevada mountains, burning 86,000 acres of forest before jumping Highway 41 into the park and scorching another 11,000 acres within its boundaries \u2014 not technically a megafire, but just shy of it. A friend of mine went camping in Yosemite a few weeks after the park reopened. During the day, she and her husband and children passed controlled burns and set up camp amid the stunning autumn colors of Tuolumne Meadows. She awoke in the middle of the night to strangely warm, high winds whipping her family\u2019s tent, and felt something she hadn\u2019t felt before: fear.\u201cIs this what it is to camp in California in the 21st century?\u201d she asked me.In early October, I went to experience the tactile reality of Yosemite after the fires for myself.In the face of this holy beauty, your jadedness falls away. You look and look, and look some more. You find you cannot look enough. Wait another quiet moment or two, and you see that this cliff is, in fact, a place of pilgrimage. You see people from all over the world; you listen to them speak a dozen different languages; you watch them gently touch a gnarled tree, a wall of granite. Something like grace remains.This is where my friend Lynsay and I began our day hike on the sun-dappled Panorama Trail toward Nevada Fall, a round-trip, 10.5-mile hike that would take us a little over five hours to complete. We chose this trail for its larger, longer view on what fire means to a place like Yosemite \u2014 not just the most recent fire, but the constant, successive waves of fire that play a vital role in shaping and maintaining the health of a forest.The drive up the switchbacked, 16-mile road leading to the Glacier Point trailhead, off Highway 41 out of the more-visited Yosemite Valley, is itself a kind of reverse visual timeline of the park\u2019s recent fire history. As we hitched up our day packs and headed down the first mile of the Panorama Trail on foot, we admired the fall palette of cinnamon, rust, citron and lime. Newly attuned to the little clues that the forest offers, we saw evidence of other, older fires almost immediately. Tree trunks were blistered and split from intense heat \u2014 the mottled pattern reminiscent of Dutch crunch bread \u2014 but there they were, still standing, with a lush carpet of verdant shrubs and other undergrowth filling in around their feet.Tuolumne MeadowsCaliforniaYosemite National Park120Yosemite ValleyHalf DomeEl CapitanLiberty CapGlacier PointNevada FallMono Meadow140Illilouette CreekExtent ofFergusonWildfireMariposaGroveNEV.SacramentoArea of detailFish CampSan Francisco41CALIFORNIA10 milesBy The New York TimesAfter crossing a wooden bridge over Illilouette Creek and a steep climb \u2014 700 feet in elevation over 1.5 miles \u2014 to an exposed ridgeline, we descended again, and the microclimate shifted to upper montane forest: cooler, shadier and greener, with red fir, pine and juniper trees, some of them furry with electric-green moss. We began to see the patchwork way that fire ideally works in a big forest \u2014 different areas burn at different times, using up available fuels. In effect, this helps contain flames when subsequent fires do come through, giving older burned areas time to recover. Think of a farmer rotating crops.A mile before the 594-foot Nevada Fall, we began to hear the audible rush of water, and glimpsed Half Dome and Liberty Cap through the canopy. Here, too, were fire scars. As scars do on our own bodies, these tell a story of destruction, and renewal.\u201cThe Ferguson fire, from where it started and moved toward the park, it was slow moving. When it actually entered the park, a lot of areas had had previously prescribed fires, so it didn\u2019t burn as hot, and it wasn\u2019t as devastating as it could have been,\u201d Mr. Gediman said. \u201cThat\u2019s ultimately what we want.\u201dAt the completion of the day\u2019s hike, after our return to Glacier Point, Lynsay and I drove back to Highway 41 and headed south toward Fish Camp. By now, we\u2019d seen plenty of fire traces around the park \u2014 in the burn piles in the valley, in the signs saying \u201cEntering Burn Area, Watch Out For Rock Fall.\u201d But this is where we would see the most dramatic views of all: vast tracts of blackened forest on the downhill side of 41, remnants of red fire retardant still lingering on trees on the uphill side, the road having served as a fire break for embattled firefighters struggling to contain the flames below.We pulled over at one turnoff and walked down into the woods for a closer examination. Rustling leaves, felled trees, the faint scent of smoke, the burned and broken remains of a curious glass bottle stamped with the word \u201cCONTENTS.\u201d And, in the middle of this devastation, bright little shoots sprouting up, doing what grass does \u2014 grow, of course, cheerfully and obliviously.The grove\u2019s restoration \u2014 as well as the current fire management plan for Yosemite \u2014 was designed in consultation with affiliated American Indian tribes and Native American groups. In the centuries long before European visitors arrived, native populations in Yosemite Valley used controlled burning and other tools to manage the living landscape on which they depended.It\u2019s an intriguing, romantic bit of poetry, more literary conceit than literal fact. But it got me thinking about our complex and emotional human relationship with the wilderness.Taken in 1903, it is a quintessential image of the two men at Glacier Point during a three-day wilderness trip into Yosemite. The first night, they camped at Mariposa Grove.\u201cNo temple made with human hands can compete with Yosemite,\u201d wrote Muir. His advocacy is what led to the creation of this national park in 1890.Roosevelt himself said this in a 1915 appreciation of Muir: \u201cHe was a great factor in influencing the thought of California and the thought of the entire country so as to secure the preservation of those great natural phenomena \u2014 wonderful canyons, giant trees, slopes of flower-spangled hillsides.\u201dThe truth is that the Yosemite Valley of today is not the same place it was a century ago. One hundred years from now, because of increased warming trends, it may well be unrecognizable. After all, the way we use the park is changing, too. My friend Sarah told me recently about something called the firefall, a massive bonfire of burning logs shoveled off Glacier Point\u2019s ledge into the inky nighttime darkness, a stupendously popular tradition that began in 1872. Her family has been in California for generations, and she grew up backpacking in Yosemite. She recalls her dad\u2019s tales of the nightly spectacle with wonder and skepticism. Real fire! Shoveled off a cliff into the wilderness! What would Smokey Bear say? We Google \u201cYosemite\u201d and \u201cfire\u201d and \u201ccliff,\u201d and, in short order, we find ourselves exclaiming over a blurry archival video from the 1960s.It is astounding to think that they did this and the whole place didn\u2019t go up in flames. The National Park Service finally banned the practice in 1968, and a few years later, people noticed that a waterfall on the eastern side of El Capitan created the same fiery effect for a few weeks in February, when the winter light hit the font of melting snowpack just right. The fame of this illusory firefall has since eclipsed that of the old one, but I can\u2019t stop thinking of the original firefall \u2014 the one made out of real fire.Here\u2019s another definition of firefall, this time from Merriam-Webster: \u201ca tree whose fall is caused by the partial destruction of its roots in a ground fire.\u201d The one hits uncomfortably close to home. Attitudes toward fire and fire dangers are evolving, but we are still cavalier in our own ways. As we build lives deeper and deeper into every corner of the wild, we are increasingly vulnerable to fire\u2019s fiercely destructive power, the way it behaves in ways we don\u2019t completely understand. It is a given that fire management in these places will become ever more challenging, with a human cost.For now, nature continues to endure. What did we see, post-fire? That resilience and rebirth can still be found. In the tiny green ferns shyly unfurling in the enriched earth. In the naturalization ceremony held at Glacier Point for 43 of the country\u2019s newest citizens, just a month after the park reopened. In the multiagency crews working diligently to clear remaining fire hazards, and to seed and shore up eroding hillsides. In the rangers welcoming returning visitors, in the full campgrounds, in the climbers walking along the trails in the glorious late-afternoon light, their carabiners clinking a musical accompaniment on the approach to the great walls of granite.Bonnie Tsui is a writer based in Berkeley, Calif. Her next book, \u201cWhy We Swim,\u201d will be published by Algonquin Books in March 2020.An earlier version of this article misstated how much of Yosemite National Park was closed because of the Ferguson fire. Much of the park was closed, not all of it.Advertisement"}

And finally, David offers a recommendation \u2014 with a little help from his friends.Background ReadingI\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: We Like Big. Are Google and Amazon Too Big?", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFriday: Tech giants talk expansion, and two columnists sign off.Living and working in New York have ingrained in most of us a certain laissez-faire attitude to things big and grand. The transit system with more stations than anywhere else in the world ... yet not enough. The most populated school system ... yet we don\u2019t always have enough seats for every student. The most celebrated pizza in the country ... and yet we continue to try new styles.This week, New York appeared on the verge of landing a few more big things. Two of the tech industry\u2019s giants signaled an interest in expanding here, potentially bringing a combined 45,000 employees to Manhattan, where Google already has an office, and Queens, where Amazon is considering locating a headquarters.Tom Angotti, professor emeritus of urban planning at Hunter College, said he could not recall a period when New York planned to absorb so many workers from a single employer, let alone two. \u201cExpansions tend to occur incrementally,\u201d he said.These tech giants will undoubtedly help reshape the city. New York can handle big. But is this too big? Probably not. New York will be fine. If that seems a little nonchalant, it\u2019s a well-earned attitude.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s not a lot for New York\u2019s overall economy,\u201d Nicole Gelinas, an analyst at the Manhattan Institute, said.And remember, we\u2019re talking about a possible maximum of 45,000 jobs. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be dismissive of this number,\u201d Gelinas said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to save us or break us either way.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening: \ud83c\udfb6The sun will come out tomorrow. \ud83c\udfb6Eventually.Devils at Maple Leafs, 7 p.m. (MSG+).

He was a heavyset man who appeared to be in his 50s.He was flushed and smelled of alcohol. In an angry voice, he gave me detailed directions to his apartment in Manhattan.Halfway there, bouncing along on the B.Q.E., I noticed that he was slumped over in the back seat. Ten minutes later, I pulled up to his building. He didn\u2019t move.\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d I said, loudly.Nothing.I got out of the cab, opened the door and tapped the man. No response. Then I shook him. Nothing.I quickly drove to a hospital, parked and ran in. A few people were hanging around, and for a moment I wondered if there was a line. Then I yelled that I had a dead passenger in my cab.Within seconds, he was on a gurney, and from there into the emergency room, where a doctor ripped his shirt open.A police officer arrived, asked me some questions and walked away.When he came back, he said the guy hadn\u2019t made it, and that I could go. He handed me a $10 bill. He said the guy had it in his hand. The fare was $8.25. I thanked him.An orderly asked if I was doing O.K. I said I was. Then he asked me out. I declined, but thanked him as well.I drove the cab back to the garage in Long Island City, noting the death on my trip sheet.The dispatcher, sitting in the office behind bulletproof glass, bored and tired, looked at my note.

{"Headline": "The Election Showed a Divided Country. Investors Can Live With That.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks jumped on Wednesday, extending a recovery from the sharp sell-off in October with broad-based gains, after midterm elections that will split control of the United States government between both major parties.The S&P 500 rose 2.1 percent, led by giant technology companies including Amazon, Apple and Google. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 2.6 percent, its strongest gain this month.Stock in consumer discretionary companies climbed 3.1 percent, in a sign of growing optimism that President Trump, stung by his party\u2019s loss of the House of Representatives, could seek a win by striking a trade bargain with China at the Group of 20 summit meeting this month. Shares of Wynn Resorts, the casino company with significant business in China, jumped 3.9 percent.After weeks of uncertainty heading into the election, investors seemed to focus again on the strong fundamentals for American businesses, helping fuel the gains on Wednesday.In the voting on Tuesday, Democrats secured control of the House in the next Congress, while the Republicans padded their majority in the Senate. A divided government is conventionally thought of as good for stock investors, because it means lawmakers are unlikely to produce sweeping policy changes.\u201cInvestors can basically refocus their mental energy away from the macro and back to the micro, where earnings are really good and valuations are really reasonable,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at the institutional brokerage BTIG.Industrial shares rose, bolstered by renewed hope for a bipartisan infrastructure-spending bill. The construction machinery maker Caterpillar, which also has large exposure to China, rose 4.5 percent.Health care shares rallied on the prospect that major health legislation is much less likely. Managed care companies that sell contract Medicaid services to state governments and insurance products on health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act rose sharply.\u201cYou worry less about large sweeping regulatory change,\u201d said Zack Sopcak, an equity analyst covering managed care companies for Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt means a repeat of \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 is off the table,\u201d he added, referring to the potential for a wholesale replacement of the law, commonly known as Obamacare.After an ugly sell-off in October, investors appear to have regained their appetite for stocks. The S&P 500 has risen in four of the first five trading days of November. The 2.1 percent gain on Wednesday for the broad index of large companies was its third-best showing this year.That turn of events reflects a dizzying swing in market sentiment. As recently as Oct. 29, the market was down more than 1 percent for the year after a rout that started in September had vaporized nearly 10 percent in gains.At that time, investors saw ubiquitous threats to the nearly decade-long rally for stocks. The potential pitfalls included rising interest rates, climbing commodity and wage costs, signs of slowing growth in China and Europe and the tariff war between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies.Most of the issues remain unresolved, but the markets have found their footing and trading seemed to suggest investors see reasons for optimism now that the elections have concluded.Equity investors are now sitting on gains of more than 5 percent for the year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Amazon Chose the Wrong Locations for Its HQ2", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseSo, the Amazon bragging rights go to New York City and the Washington, D.C., area. Why do I feel a little deflated?Long Island City, the Queens neighborhood that Amazon picked, will become a high-tech Brooklyn, with a bevy of new farm-to-table restaurants, craft cocktail watering holes and, naturally, the artisanal coffee roasters already ubiquitous in Seattle, all just a subway stop from Manhattan.True, there may be more congestion, higher condo prices and other unwanted side effects, but a metropolitan area the size of New York shouldn\u2019t have any trouble absorbing an additional 25,000 people.And I guess that\u2019s the source of my disappointment: For all the transformative potential of Amazon\u2019s nationwide \u201cHQ2\u201d competition, neither New York City nor Washington (nor, to be precise, the Northern Virginia neighborhoods that are being rechristened National Landing) needed Amazon. They\u2019re already thriving and bustling with affluent, well-educated millennials.As Tom Stringer, head of site selection for the business consulting firm BDO, told me this week, Amazon\u2019s choice \u201conly reaffirms and cements the idea that we have two countries right now, the coasts and the interior.\u201dEven a large, sophisticated Midwestern city like Chicago would at least have been a nod toward America\u2019s heartland.\u201cThere are smaller cities in this country that are incredible places to live,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cThey\u2019re great places to raise families, they\u2019re affordable, and they\u2019re fun.\u201dIn its initial request for proposals, Amazon emphasized many of those qualities, ranking costs second on its list of priorities. That led pundits to eliminate New York, San Francisco, Boston and Washington, all of them among the most expensive places to live or do business, according to KPMG\u2019s annual Competitive Alternatives survey.Among Amazon\u2019s finalists, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Chicago had some of the lowest costs.Of course, the potentially multibillion-dollar tax incentives that New York and Northern Virginia are lavishing on Amazon help compensate for the locations\u2019 high costs. But presumably other cities dangled big tax breaks, too.\u201cLabor force\u201d ranked third on Amazon\u2019s list of criteria, but in the end, it seemed to be determinative. It was the first thing that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, mentioned when he announced the winners: \u201cThese two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come.\u201dThat, in part, reflects the same self-reinforcing tendencies that are driving creative, well-educated workers to the two coasts, with just a handful of high-tech, hipster enclaves (like Austin, Tex., and Denver, two Amazon finalists) in between.\u201cThere\u2019s a herding instinct,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cPeople in creative fields \u2014 medical research and technology, law, financial services \u2014 they all want to be in the same mix. That\u2019s what makes them good. And for companies, their value-added quotient is rare, and it\u2019s what everybody wants.\u201dIt\u2019s not Amazon\u2019s obligation to help heal the growing divide between red and blue America. In holding the competition, it generated tremendous publicity, mostly favorable, and attracted enormous financial incentives, all of which will benefit Amazon\u2019s shareholders. At the same time, the company, and Mr. Bezos in particular, might have considered that Amazon\u2019s success has hollowed out aging downtowns and shopping malls across America, and that having at least one headquarters away from the coasts might have generated considerable political good will.So where does that leave the heartland?And who knows: The truly creative may want to break from the herd and do something original \u2014 like moving to St. Louis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s P.R. Firm Brought Political Trickery to Tech", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Tim Miller, a longtime Republican political operative, moved to the Bay Area last year to set up a public relations shop, he brought with him tradecraft more typical of Washington than Silicon Valley.He was well versed in opposition research \u2014 the pursuit of damaging intelligence about a political enemy. He had ties to online media provocateurs. And, above all, he understood the value of secrecy.Mr. Miller had arrived at the right moment with his company, Definers Public Affairs. With customers and lawmakers questioning the avowed good intentions and power of tech\u2019s biggest companies, Facebook and others were on the defensive.Definers quickly found plenty of business, from start-ups like Lyft, Lime and Juul to giants like Facebook and Qualcomm, the influential chip company that was in a nasty legal fight with Apple over royalties, according to five people with direct knowledge of Mr. Miller\u2019s work who declined to be named because of confidentiality agreements.While working for Qualcomm, Definers pushed the idea that Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was a viable presidential candidate in 2020, according to a former Definers employee and digital records. Presumably, it was an attempt to chill the cordial relations that Mr. Cook had cultivated with the Trump administration.The campaign by Definers signaled an escalation of Silicon Valley\u2019s already brass-knuckled approach to public relations.\u201cThis type of dirty P.R.? It\u2019s always been there, but it\u2019s definitely on the upswing,\u201d said Jonathan Hirshon, who was a public relations representative for technology companies for three decades, including Apple and Sony. \u201cThe idealism is still there, but the truth is, the big companies have become a lot more authoritarian in their approach to the media.\u201dDefiners\u2019s strategy played to a target\u2019s pressure points. Most of what Definers produced for Qualcomm had nothing to do with its beef with Apple, which was a complex legal fight over the royalties Apple should pay for the Qualcomm chips it was using in iPhones.Definers employees distributed anti-Apple research to reporters and would not say who was paying for it. Definers distributed a 13-page memo titled \u201cApple Bowing to Chinese Cyber Regulators\u201d that detailed how Apple\u2019s activity in China contradicted its public stance on privacy elsewhere. It also planted dozens of negative articles about Apple on conservative news sites, according to a person familiar with the work and emails reviewed by The New York Times.Qualcomm officials did not respond to requests for comment.The feuds among the tech industry\u2019s giants have hardly been genteel over the years. Big companies often tip reporters to bad news about other companies and urge regulators to examine competitors.A campaign by Microsoft, referred to as \u201cScroogled,\u201d highlighted what it called Google\u2019s privacy violations. From 2012 to 2014, it took out print and television ads that claimed Google was reading people\u2019s emails, a charge the internet company denied.Matt Rhoades, Definers\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the firm\u2019s work \u201cis absolutely no different than what public affairs firms do every day for their clients across industries and issues across the country. We are proud of the work we do for our clients.\u201dJuul, which has been accused of marketing its e-cigarettes to children, is working with Definers to improve its public image and communicate with reporters.The ride-hailing company Lyft used Definers to help navigate regulatory challenges in statehouses across the country, including choosing which Lyft drivers to pitch to the media for interviews, according to a person familiar with the work.And the scooter company Lime hired Definers in August because it wanted an outside contractor to take a more aggressive tack against rivals, according to a person familiar with that work. Lyft and Lime have since ended their work with Definers.To promote clients and attack its clients\u2019 enemies, Definers regularly used NTK Network, a news aggregator with a conservative slant and 122,000 followers on Facebook.Definers and its sister firm, the political-opposition group America Rising, share some staff and one floor of an office building in Arlington, Va., with NTK. Joe Pounder, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns who describes himself as \u201ca master of opposition research\u201d in his biographies, is listed as a co-founder of Definers and America Rising and editor in chief of NTK.Mr. Pounder and two colleagues distanced NTK from Definers after The Times\u2019s report last week. \u201cWe do not and did not work with Facebook. We share offices with a firm that does,\u201d they wrote in a blog post.But Mr. Miller promoted how Definers used NTK in a proposal sent to a potential Definers client last year, under a section labeled \u201cDigital Platform Echo Chamber.\u201d\u201cDefiners manages NTK Network, a news aggregation platform that targets Washington D.C. influencers. Through NTK we can directly re-publish favorable news from other outlets, and work with like-minded individuals to help create an echo chamber effect,\u201d he wrote in a copy of the proposal reviewed by The Times.This year, NTK has published at least 57 articles criticizing Apple and Mr. Cook. Some of the posts needled Apple for issues at the center of the legal dispute between Apple and Qualcomm and repeated Qualcomm\u2019s complaints. Apple had also started to move away from using Qualcomm chips.Mr. Pounder said in a statement on Tuesday that NTK is regularly pitched by people in public relations and the media. \u201cWhat NTK writes and posts on is what NTK chooses to write and post on,\u201d he added.Definers also used other outlets to disseminate its work. In July 2017, Mr. Miller wrote an article that accused Mr. Cook of lying to President Trump about building Apple factories in the United States, according to an email reviewed by The Times.Mr. Miller said in a text message to The Times that Definers pitched the angle to a range of news outlets. \u201cTwo years into the administration it\u2019s clear we were right,\u201d he added.Mr. Johnson said he had a falling out with Mr. Miller because of Mr. Miller\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump.Mr. Schrage, a longtime confidante of Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, had already announced plans to leave Facebook. Ms. Sandberg, who had previously said she did not know about Definers, admitted in an online comment attached to the memo that she had been informed about the company in emails and other materials.Erin Griffith contributed reporting from San Francisco and Matthew Rosenberg contributed from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Dolce & Gabbana Draws Fire and Accusations of Racism on Social Media ", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Italian luxury brand said its Instagram accounts had been hacked after racist messages purportedly from one of its designers were made public. But some in China aren\u2019t buying that.Instagram may be blocked in China, but it can still make waves there. Dolce & Gabbana, the Italian luxury brand, found that out on Wednesday with stunning swiftness. It abruptly canceled a Shanghai fashion show it had been planning to hold that night as waves of online Chinese users accused Stefano Gabbana, one of the two designers of the fashion line, of being racist. They pointed to private Instagram messages from Mr. Gabbana\u2019s account that the recipient posted publicly.Zhang Ziyi, the Chinese actress best known in the West for the film \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d took the brand to task online. Two dozen models said they would pull out of the show.Dolce & Gabbana said its account and the account of Mr. Gabbana had been hacked and disavowed the messages. \u201cWe are very sorry for any distress caused by these unauthorized posts,\u201d Dolce & Gabbana said on its Instagram account. \u201cWe have nothing but respect for China and the people of China.\u201dOn his account, Mr. Gabbana posted an image of the offensive comments with the words \u201cNot Me\u201d superimposed in big red letters.\u201cI love China and the Chinese culture,\u201d Mr. Gabbana said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened.\u201dThat makes it potentially dangerous territory for someone like Mr. Gabbana, who is famous for picking online feuds and in the past has used his Instagram account to make barbed attacks. He has clashed with Elton John after the fashion designer criticized in vitro fertilization, leading the pop star to create a hashtag, #boycottdolcegabbana, in response.Mr. Gabbana has called the singer Selena Gomez \u201cugly\u201d and hit back at critics of a sneaker with the phrase \u201cI\u2019m thin & gorgeous\u201d written on the side, posting, \u201cDarling, you prefer to be fat and full of cholesterol??? I think u have a problem.\u201d Most of the posts with offending comments have since been taken down.The fashion blogger Bryan Yambao, who blogs under the name BryanBoy and has over 600,000 Instagram followers, expressed skepticism about the brand\u2019s claim that it was hacked \u2014 a sentiment echoed widely online. \u201cI am having a hard time believing the notion that both social media accounts were hacked, especially when Mr. Gabbana has a proven track record of trolling everyone under the sun, from celebrities like Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez to influencers like Chiara Ferragni, both on public feed posts or on comments,\u201d he said in a message on Wednesday. Dolce & Gabbana has been the subject of boycotts so often that the company makes T-shirts inviting people to \u201c#Boycott Dolce & Gabbana,\u201d with a red heart. It is listed for $295 on the company\u2019s website. The latest online flap began with a Dolce & Gabbana ad for the Shanghai show that it posted on Instagram. It features a young Chinese woman in a glittery red dress and dangling jewelry trying to eat a cannoli with chopsticks. Traditional Chinese-sounding music plays in the background. As she flirts with the camera, a male narrator asks, \u201cIs it too huge for you?\u201dThe ad was meant to play on Italian and Chinese cultural differences. In a previous ad, the woman tried to use chopsticks to eat a pizza. But Chinese viewers who saw the cannoli ad \u2014 some overseas and some using special software to circumvent Chinese censors \u2014 found it crass and patronizing. They put screenshots online in China, where they quickly found an audience.In another message, Mr. Gabbana appeared to imply that Chinese people ate dog meat.Dolce & Gabbana said its legal offices were investigating the incidents. \u201cWhat happened today was very unfortunate not only for us, but also for all the people who worked day and night to bring this event to life,\u201d the designers said in a statement, referring to the fashion show.The controversy could be especially damaging for the fashion brand because it has made using Instagram stars in its runway shows a tent pole of its strategy to court millennials.In China, some internet users were unimpressed with the company\u2019s apology.\u201cDo you think Chinese people are three-year-olds?\u201d an Instagram user, Elainee_Hu, wrote in a comment that was liked 691 times. \u201cWe don\u2019t need your apology. Please take your clothes and your brand and leave China.\u201dBy Wednesday afternoon, the controversy was the most-talked-about topic on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. The hashtags #DGgreatshowcanceled, #DGdesigner and #DGofficial response were trending on the website. The backlash marks the second time in more than a year that Dolce & Gabbana has courted controversy in the country.In April 2017, the brand started a campaign that featured migrants and sanitation workers. Critics said the label could have featured more stylish people.Vanessa Friedman and Matthew Schneier contributed reporting. Claire Fu and Zoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now Serving Pie. And Only Pie.", "Date": "2018-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderErin Jeanne McDowell, a food stylist, recipe developer and author of the cookbook \u201cThe Fearless Baker,\u201d doesn\u2019t hide her hierarchical preferences about the Thanksgiving spread.\u201cThe turkey is really just an amuse-bouche for pies,\u201d Ms. McDowell said. And visually, she added, they\u2019re the most striking dish: \u201cCranberry sauce is the most vibrant thing on the Thanksgiving table, and even that is a duller color.\u201dIn Sunday\u2019s paper, Thanksgiving pies took center stage with a dedicated special section created by the Food desk. The section is a twice-folded insert known as a \u201cpano-8,\u201d which The New York Times has used several times before: for illustrations of the physical feats of athletes at the 2018 Winter Olympics, for example, and a graphic showing how people voted in the 2012 presidential election by ZIP code.This go-round, the insert opens up to reveal a kaleidoscopic, 48-inch array of life-size pastries. Among them are a citrus custard pie bearing crisscrossing lime, orange and lemon zest that drew on artwork by Sol LeWitt and a striped berry pie, with the jammy reds and blues of strawberry, raspberry and blackberry.\u201cAs you can see, these aren\u2019t your standard Aunt Margaret apple pies,\u201d said Sam Sifton, the editor of Food. \u201cWe have ombr\u00e9 pies of all sorts, and these colors are really magical.\u201dEmily Weinstein, the deputy Food editor, said that an early idea had been to film strip-style photographs showcasing how ingredients transform into the finale for the feast.\u201cI wanted people to get excited about something, but of course we have to offer you instructions,\u201d Ms. Weinstein said. \u201cWe have to offer insight; we have to spark an idea.\u201d She added that \u201cthere has to be more than just beautiful photographs.\u201dThe idea for the section firmed up when Wayne Kamidoi, one of the art directors on the project along with Fred Bierman, realized that each of the eight panels in a pano-8 is 9 inches by 11 inches \u2014 an almost-perfect fit for a standard 9-inch pastry, with room enough for recipes.\u201cThese pies are almost full-sized,\u201d Mr. Kamidoi said. Pointing to the two-tone ginger custard pie, he said that \u201cyou can see how many slices you can get out of that.\u201dMs. McDowell recalled that when the Food desk approached her with the assignment in August, the mandate reversed the logic of typical recipe development.\u201cThey came to me and wanted them to look a certain way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was pitching the way they looked versus how they taste.\u201dFirst, Ms. McDowell came up with original ideas for how to shape and style each pie. Then she figured out which fillings made the best sense for each. To settle on the final list, Ms. McDowell baked more than a hundred pies, incorporating ideas from an ongoing email chain and a 20-page Google document filled with text and sketches of over a dozen desserts, with suggestions for various architectural features \u2014 such as crimp styles, lattices and crust designs.In Ms. McDowell\u2019s back and forth with Ms. Weinstein and Kim Gougenheim, the project\u2019s photo editor, some flavors were scrapped because the colors and textures didn\u2019t work, like a purple sweet potato filling that looked like baby food; others just weren\u2019t getting the team excited. The trio wrapped up just days before the photo shoot. On the day of the shoot, a quarter of a two-door fridge was stuffed with pie dough.\u201cBy the end everything is covered in flour,\u201d she said about the shoot. \u201cYour shoes, the floor; you\u2019re working as clean as you can, you\u2019re throwing flour around, but it\u2019s one of the times it\u2019s totally acceptable to make a big mess.\u201dMs. McDowell assured a Times reporter that her creations did not go to waste. The crew working on the shoot and the studio staff all took slices home.\u201cNo pie left behind,\u201d Ms. McDowell said.Because color and visual texture were top of mind, one holiday staple pie didn\u2019t make the cut for this project: pumpkin.\u201cWe at The Times are not immune to the charms of Instagram,\u201d Mr. Sifton said. \u201cAnd on Instagram there\u2019s a rich tradition of these pies taking advantage of color and shape and texture in interesting ways.\u201dBut, Ms. McDowell said, \u201cobviously taste is very important.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russians Meddling in the Midterms? Here\u2019s the Data", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey haven\u2019t stopped trying to influence our elections. Indeed, they may be busier than ever.Mr. Morgan and Mr. Fox run a cybersecurity company.Since the 2016 United States presidential election, which Russian operatives influenced through a coordinated campaign of disinformation on social media, platforms like Twitter and Facebook have taken steps to address the problem. Thousands of \u201csock puppet\u201d personas with hundreds of thousands of followers have been taken down on Facebook, for example, and cannot easily be rebuilt. Twitter has reduced the risk that propaganda is spread through automated accounts, or bots.Such efforts may be helping. The consensus among researchers monitoring the 2018 midterm elections is that there has been less of the specific sort of interference the Russians engaged in two years ago, when they attempted to aggravate social tensions in the United States and foster distrust of our democratic institutions.But an analysis by Kris Shaffer, a senior analyst for our cybersecurity company, suggests that while these measures may have rendered some of the Russian tactics of 2016 less effective, they haven\u2019t fully stopped Russian influence operations. In many instances, they seem to have merely caused Russia to shift or develop new tactics.Indeed, our company is currently detecting more overall activity in real time from continuing Russian online influence operations targeting the midterm elections than has been disclosed by social media platforms or detected by researchers during the same period before the election in 2016.In the past month, our researchers have collected more than 26 million social media posts concerning the 2018 midterms. This data set includes a large portion of all relevant content on Twitter as well as a smaller targeted sample of all relevant content on Facebook.We have also identified more than 400 websites that our analysis indicates are likely to be Russian propaganda outlets aimed at American audiences. More than 100 of these websites we have confirmed as under the direction of the Russian government or we believe to be Russian with a very high degree of confidence.In the month of October alone, we tracked 110,000 social media posts that referenced a United States midterm candidate, topic or hashtag and contained a link to one of these websites. More than 10,000 of these posts contained a link to one of the websites we have either confirmed as Russian-directed or believe to be Russian with a very high degree of confidence.The top three websites linked to these social media posts are the site of RT, Russia\u2019s state-financed international cable network (5,275 links); The Duran, a right-wing news and opinion site (1,328 links); and Sputnik, a news and commentary site run by the Russian government (1,148 links).We have also identified 1,451 social media posts aimed specifically at midterm voters from social media accounts assessed with high confidence as belonging directly to Russian influence operations. These posts are largely focused on the geopolitics of the Middle East, the Saudi-assassinated journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh.Last month, the most-shared article of known Russian origin for the month on Twitter was an article from The Duran purporting to show how groups financed by the billionaire Democratic fund-raiser George Soros \u201cplotted with Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to eliminate conservative \u2018right wing propaganda.\u2019\u201dThe Russia-linked social media accounts were active during the Kavanaugh hearings, drawing attention to sexual and domestic abuse allegations against various 2018 Democratic candidates and potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. They have been amplifying anti-immigrant sentiment, including conspiracy theories about the caravan of migrants in Central America, and have promoted the idea that the mail-bomb campaign of the Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc Jr. was a Democratic plot.Because of the numerous changes since 2016 in social media platforms and propaganda-detection practices, a straight \u201capple to apples\u201d comparison of 2016 and the current election cycle is not possible. And no analysis of the social media landscape is ever complete because no one has access to all the data.But any significant detectable quantity of Americans who are unwittingly sharing Russian propaganda on their social networks is cause for concern. And based on activity that our analysis attributes to Russian government efforts, we estimate that at least hundreds of thousands, and perhaps even millions, of United States citizens have engaged with the content of Russian propaganda online. The consensus among academic researchers and Russia experts in the intelligence community is that Russia does not take a timeout from information battles. It considers itself to be in a constant state of information warfare. Its online influence operations are inexpensive and effective, and afford Russia an asymmetric advantage given the freedoms of expression afforded to Western democracies.We are heartened by the seriousness with which many social media platforms and government agencies are treating this situation. But while progress has been made since 2016, we must remain vigilant in the face of confirmed Russian efforts to undermine our democracy.Jonathon Morgan is the chief executive and Ryan Fox is the chief operating officer of New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company that monitors disinformation.Advertisement"}

And now, they want to direct the nation\u2019s talent and tech acumen toward an even loftier end: building an innovation-driven economy, one that produces world-leading companies.Not long ago, Chinese tech firms were best known for copying Silicon Valley.GoogleBaiduYouTubeYoukuInstagramDouyinUberDidiBut the flow of inspiration now runs both ways. American social media executives look to Tencent and ByteDance for the latest tricks for keeping users glued to their phones.Tencent\u2019s WeChat app, an all-in-one hub for socializing, playing games, paying bills, booking train tickets and more, paved the way for the increasingly feature-stuffed chat apps made by Facebook and Apple. Facebook recently took a page from TikTok, a Chinese service that is a sensation among Western tweens, by releasing its own highly similar app for creating goofy short videos.If people in the West didn\u2019t see this coming, it was because they mistook China\u2019s authoritarianism for hostility toward technology.But in some ways Chinese tech firms are less fettered than American ones. Witness the backlash against Big Data in the United States, the calls to break up giants like Facebook and the anxiety about digital addiction. None of those are big problems for Chinese companies.In China, there is pretty much only one rule, and it is simple: Don\u2019t undermine the state.So titans like Weibo and Baidu heed censorship orders. Unwanted beliefs and ideologies are kept out.Beyond that, everything is fair game. Start-ups can achieve mammoth scale with astonishing speed; they can also crash brutally. Thanks to weak intellectual property protections, they can rip one another off with abandon \u2014 not great for rewarding innovation, but O.K. for consumers, who get lots of choices.And the money just keeps flowing in.$25 billionUnited States2015China10520102011201220132014201520162017\u201918$25 billionUnited States2015China105\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917\u201918$25 billionUnited States2015China10520102011201220132014201520162017\u201918In another advantage, old-school industries like media, finance and health care have been dominated by lumbering state-run giants. That has allowed internet champions like Alibaba and Tencent to sew themselves into these businesses with ease.With their mobile payment platforms, the two giants have built sprawling ecosystems in which vast amounts of commercial activity now take place. Little remains of daily life that has not been transformed. Shopping. Getting a loan. Renting a bike. Even going to the doctor.This level of clout hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by China\u2019s leaders. Never in the Communist era have private entities wielded such influence over people\u2019s lives.To keep tech in its place, the government is demanding stakes in companies and influence over management. Regulators have reprimanded online platforms for hosting content they deem distasteful \u2014 too raunchy, too flirty, too creepy or just too weird.That\u2019s why the best way for tech companies to thrive in China is to make themselves useful to the state. Nearly everyone in China uses WeChat, making the social network a great way for the authorities to police what people say and do. SenseTime, whose facial recognition technology powers those fun filters in video apps, also sells software to law enforcement.The risk for these companies is that the government demands more, sucking away resources that could be better spent chasing innovations or breaking into new markets.In China, says Lance Noble of the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, the government\u2019s support \u201ccan be a blessing and a curse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colleges Grapple With Teaching the Technology and Ethics of A.I.", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 About 18 months ago, Shawn Blanton, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, met with some of his graduate students to redesign his course on artificial intelligence.\u201cWe need to transform this course to make it more relevant outside these walls,\u201d he said.It had only been three years since Professor Blanton started the class, but as artificial intelligence moves from the stuff of dystopian fantasies \u2014 robots run amok \u2014 to the reality of everyday use, universities around the country are grappling with the best ways to teach it.But this growth also means new challenges, such as figuring out how to teach the subject in ways understandable to those who are not computer science majors and addressing ethical dilemmas raised by the technology, such as privacy and job displacement.\u201cWe have to start teaching those who will be practitioners and users in the broad discipline of A.I., not just computer scientists,\u201d said Emily Fox, an associate professor of computer science, engineering and statistics at the University of Washington.Professor Fox developed an A.I. course for nonmajors, which was first offered last spring. To qualify, students had only to have completed courses in basic probability and basic programming, far fewer prerequisites than typically needed by students taking A.I.She had to cap enrollment at 110 students because of such high interest.Demi Tu, a senior studying information technology at the University of Washington, is an example of the value of reaching out to students who are not classic technology whizzes. She said she was so taken with what she learned in Professor Fox\u2019s class that she may choose to pursue it in graduate school.\u201cBefore taking the class, I did not know what A.I. was specifically,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted the initial exposure. But the class really opened up a different path for me.\u201dEducators are also struggling to balance what some see as an essential teaching of the deep fundamentals of artificial intelligence with a desire by some in the industry to focus on the less expensive, less complicated training of workers who can complete the tasks at hand without that deep understanding.Or as Levent Burak Kara, a professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, noted, there is a tension in teaching A.I. between ensuring \u201cstudents understand what\u2019s under the hood and what industry wants.\u201dFreshman year may actually be too late to start teaching A.I. Fei-Fei Li, director of Stanford University\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Lab and its Stanford Vision Lab, began a three-week summer program in 2015 for high school students, focused on offering young women early exposure to A.I.\u201cWe want young people to think about their future participation in developing or guiding this technology,\u201d Professor Li said. \u201cToday\u2019s developers are not diverse enough or inclusive enough. We want to educate tomorrow\u2019s A.I.\u2019s technologists, thinkers and leaders and instill them with a human-centered frame of mind.\u201dThe University of Rhode Island has tried to make A.I. more accessible to a broad range of students by opening the lab in its library.\u201cWe\u2019re democratizing A.I.,\u201d said Karim Boughida, the dean of university libraries.The 600-square-foot lab provides workstations for students to take tutorials in areas such as robotics, natural language processing and smarthomes, and to design their own projects. There is also a space where students, faculty and community members can learn, discuss and debate the ethics and future of A.I.The ethical issues raised by A.I. \u2014 among them privacy, security and job displacement \u2014 and how to teach them are something educators across the country are wrestling with. And many professors and students say more needs to be done in A.I. classes \u2014 not just in separate ethics courses \u2014 to ensure students become workers who are thoughtful about the role of A.I.\u201cFor instance, we think of self-driving cars as 20 years down the road, but the way things are progressing, it will be a lot sooner,\u201d said Dillon Pulliam, who is studying for his master\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon. \u201cWe need policies \u2014 if the car hits a pedestrian, who is responsible?\u201dDaniel Grossman, a professor and deputy director of undergraduate studies at the university\u2019s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, explained the purpose this way:The course \u201caims to get at the big ethical questions we\u2019ll be facing, not just in the next year or two but in the next decade or two.\u201dDavid Danks, a professor of philosophy and psychology at Carnegie Mellon, just started teaching a class, \u201cA.I, Society and Humanity.\u201d The class is an outgrowth of faculty coming together over the past three years to create shared research projects, he said, because students need to learn from both those who are trained in the technology and those who are trained in asking ethical questions.\u201cThe key is to make sure they have the opportunities to really explore the ways technology can have an impact \u2014 to think how this will affect people in poorer communities or how it can be abused,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Wrong Way to Punish Iran ", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy threatening to penalize Swift, the financial messaging service, the U.S. is alienating European allies and could undercut the dollar\u2019s dominance.Mr. Farrell is a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University. Mr. Newman is a professor in the School of Foreign Service and Government Department at Georgetown University.On Nov. 4, the United States is set to escalate sanctions against Iran as part of its decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. These sanctions include financial messaging, so the Trump administration could press for Swift, a private cooperative based in Brussels, to disconnect Iranian banks from its network. Swift is like a global post office for banks, providing a secure messaging system for the vast majority of international transactions, so disconnecting Iran would isolate it almost completely from the global financial system and would have drastic and immediate consequences for the Iranian economy.If the Trump administration goes ahead with this plan, it will have serious consequences for the United States as well. It will undermine America\u2019s influence over the international financial architecture and diminish its power over allies and adversaries alike. These baby steps may falter, but they provide a glimpse of what the world would look like if Europe became a competitive global financial power. One of the promises of globalization was that it would promote peace and stability by creating international economic networks that make countries more dependent on one another. Instead, America has weaponized this interdependence, twisting Swift and the dollar clearing system to strangle its adversaries. Other powers could do the same, or even undermine the United States by building alternative global networks.That is why the United States needs European cooperation with its approach to pressuring Iran. The European Union is the one power that could credibly test America\u2019s dominance. The E.U. may not have an army, but it does have economic might. And it can use that power to harm American companies and, if pushed far enough, fragment the international financial system.Sanctioning Swift would be a mistake for the United States. If the European Union can no longer rely on the United States, it will move to further develop its own payment channels. This would take years, but the end result could isolate the United States. Other countries \u2014 not just those in Europe \u2014 may prefer to be part of a European-led financial network, one that is backed by a publicly stated commitment to the rule of law, rather than a global financial system dominated by an increasingly unpredictable America. European politicians have long looked with envy at the power of the United States dollar. They now have an opening to position the euro as a viable competitor.The Trump administration hates being constrained by its allies. What it does not realize is that American economic power depends on the assent of other countries to be part of a financial system led by the United States. Push them too far, and American authority and influence could be permanently undermined.Henry J. Farrell is a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University.

I want a one-and-done.\u2019\u201d Now, she added, job candidates \u201cwant to meet the team.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not just going to blindly take a company because of the name anymore,\u201d she said.Yet while many of the big tech companies have been hit by a change in public perception, Facebook seems uniquely tarred among young workers.\u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of clients recently say they\u2019re not as enthusiastic about Facebook because they\u2019re frustrated with what they see happening politically or socially,\u201d said Paul Freiberger, president of Shimmering Careers, a career counseling group based in San Mateo, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s privacy and political news, and concern that it\u2019s going to be hard to correct these things from inside.\u201dChad Herst, a leadership and career coach based in San Francisco since 2008, said that now, for the first time, he had clients who wanted to avoid working for big social media companies like Facebook or Twitter.\u201cThey\u2019re concerned about where democracy is going, that social media polarizes us, and they don\u2019t want to be building it,\u201d Mr. Herst said. \u201cPeople really have been thinking about the mission of the company and what the companies are trying to achieve a little more.\u201dHe said one client, a midlevel executive at Facebook, wanted advice on how to shift her group\u2019s work to encourage users to connect offline as well. But she found resistance internally to her efforts.\u201cShe was trying to figure out: \u2018How do I politic this? How do I language this?\u2019\u201d Mr. Herst said. \u201cAnd I was telling her to bring up some of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s past statements about connecting people.\u201dOn the recent evening at the University of California, Berkeley, around 2,200 engineering students from around the country gathered for Cal Hacks 5.0 \u2014 a competition to build the best apps. The event spanned a weekend, so teenage competitors dragged pillows around with them. The hosts handed out 2,000 burritos as students registered.It was also a hiring event. Recruiters from Facebook and Alphabet set up booths (free sunglasses from Facebook; $200 in credit to the Google Cloud platform from Alphabet).In the auditorium, the head of Y Combinator, a start-up incubator and investment firm, gave opening remarks, recommending that young people avoid jobs in big tech.\u201cYou get to program your life on a totally different scale,\u201d said Michael Seibel, who leads Y Combinator. \u201cThe worst thing that can happen to you is you get a job at Google.\u201d He called those jobs \u201c$100,000-a-year welfare\u201d \u2014 meaning, he said, that workers can get tethered to the paycheck and avoid taking risks.The event then segued to a word from the sponsor, Microsoft. Justin Garrett, a Microsoft recruiter who on his LinkedIn profile calls himself a senior technical evangelist, stepped onstage, laughing a little.\u201cSo, Michael\u2019s a tough guy to follow, especially when you work for one of those big companies,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cHe called it welfare. I like to call it tremendous opportunity.\u201dThen students flooded into the stadium, which was filled with long tables of computers where they would stay and compete. In the middle of the scrum, three friends joked around. Caleb Thomas, 21, was gently made fun of because he had accepted an internship at Facebook.\u201cCome on, guys,\u201d Mr. Thomas said.\u201cThese are the realities of how the business works,\u201d said Samuel Resendez, 20, a computer science student at the University of Southern California.It turned out Mr. Resendez had interned at Facebook in the summer. Olivia Brown, 20, head of Stanford\u2019s Computer Science and Social Good club and an iOS intern at Mozilla, called him out on it. \u201cBut you still worked at Facebook, too,\u201d she said.Ms. Brown said a lot of students criticize Facebook and talk about how they would not work there, but ultimately join. \u201cEveryone cares about ethics in tech before they get a contract,\u201d she said.Ms. Brown said she thought that could change soon, though, as the social stigma of working for Facebook began outweighing the financial benefits.\u201cDefense companies have had this reputation for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cSocial networks are just getting that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Overhauls Sexual Misconduct Policy After Employee Walkout", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims,\u201d he added.Mr. Pichai also said Google would overhaul its reporting process for harassment and assault, provide more transparency to employees about incidents reported to the company and dock employees in their performance reviews if they do not complete sexual harassment training.The company did not address some other demands by workers, including that it make its internal report on harassment public and put an employee representative on the board. It did not include temporary workers, vendors and contractors in the changes. Google said it would still require suppliers to investigate complaints raised among contractors.Google Walkout For Real Change, the organizers behind last week\u2019s employee walkout, said that although they were encouraged by the changes, the company did not go far enough in addressing systemic racism and other forms of discrimination.At a companywide meeting on Thursday, Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, and Danielle Brown, its chief diversity officer, presented the changes announced by Mr. Pichai, said two people who attended and who were not authorized to speak publicly.Then Ms. Naughton and Ms. Brown, along with Susan Wojcicki, chief executive of Google\u2019s YouTube, and Ruth Porat, Google\u2019s chief financial officer, answered questions from employees, the people said. Mr. Pichai attended, but not Google\u2019s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who sometimes appear at staff meetings.The meeting lasted over an hour, the people said. Some workers asked why contractors did not get the same protection from harassment as full-time employees. In an answer to another question about how to change Google\u2019s executive culture, Urs H\u00f6lzle, a senior vice president and one of the earliest employees, urged staff members to view executives as individuals and not as one group, the people said.Another employee said Mr. Pichai also seemed dismissive of the idea of an employee representative on the board. Mr. Pichai said that was a decision for the board to make, the person said.Google declined to comment on the meeting details.But their statements did little to quell growing employee anger. Many workers expressed their unhappiness on internal message boards and in meetings, as well as on Twitter and other social media. Some began to organize a walkout.On Thursday last week, around 20,000 Google employees walked out of work across the globe \u2014 including in Singapore, in London and at the company\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. \u2014 to show their dissatisfaction. They chanted slogans such as \u201cStand up! Fight back!\u201d Some also held signs that said \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be evil, protect victims, not harassers.\u201dThe employees also listed their demands. The call for more transparency was spurred by how Google often handles internal complaints through its employee relations department, which is staffed by many employment lawyers. Current and former employees have said complainants are often not told about the details of subsequent investigations, while some said they did not know they were being investigated by employee relations until questioned about what actions they had taken.Google\u2019s employment contract also required employees to deal with any grievances with the company in private arbitration. Arbitration, a common practice among technology companies, largely happens behind closed doors and can involve confidentiality clauses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Almost 2019. Do You Know Where Your Photos Are?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the age of image abundance, purges are a way of life.In 2005, Yahoo acquired Flickr, the popular photo site. It already had a photo site, Yahoo! Photos, which was created in March 2000. But don\u2019t worry, the company said:\u00a0The two could happily coexist.In 2007, Yahoo announced it would discontinue that first photo service, and that users should move their photos to Flickr, which now required a Yahoo account to use. In 2013, the company announced that Flickr users would have a terabyte of space \u2014 for most people, an effectively unlimited amount \u2014 to store images for free. (\u201cWe want all your photos,\u201d said Adam Cahan, a Yahoo executive at the time.) By then, digital cameras were ubiquitous and smartphones had gone mainstream. People were producing more photos than ever, but it still wasn\u2019t clear where they were supposed to end up.This news came with a new default storage limit: 1,000 photos. Users could begin paying or take the rest elsewhere. A digital photo first uploaded to Yahoo at the turn of the century, in other words, when most people online were still dialing in to get there, and not once again rescued this year, may finally meet its demise. It would have had a better run than most. And here it is, almost 2019. Do you know where your photos are? Most of us don\u2019t, at least not exactly, or in terms that we fully understand. Holding on to pictures was, for most of the history of photography, a matter of material decay and physical storage. Are these prints fading, and how fast? Are they organized by year or by subject? Do I know where they are? To the people who took them, they were deeply valuable; to anyone else, mostly worthless. Their peculiar sort of pricelessness made archivists of regular people. The problem of what to do with ballooning digital photo collections, on the other hand, is perhaps the great unsolved tech support question of the last 30 years. In retrospect, well-intentioned guidance reads like a manual for the obliteration of memory. Hard drives die unpredictably. If you could produce a Zip drive in 2018, it would likely regurgitate whatever you fed it. CDs and DVDs rot, it turns out. The first services that beckoned us to what was not yet widely known as the cloud set the tone for what was to come. At the turn of the century a site called Zing promised, in a first, \u201cfree unlimited online storage\u201d for photos. By the end of 2001, its home page had been replaced with an apology letter. But online photo collections kept growing \u2014 where else would we go? Newer, more credible services hustled for users. Storage practices didn\u2019t get revised, they accumulated: Photos lived on old discs and drives, moving from site to site, cloud to cloud, from Photobucket to Flickr to Facebook and back, or maybe just waiting on ever-larger SD cards. (Those die, too.)\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve come across with my clients is not necessarily \u2018How do I store them?\u2019 but \u2018How do I move them to the newest application?\u2019\u201d said Kaitlyn Ackron, a 17-year-old student in Rio Rancho, N.M., who provides tech support for seniors through an organization called Teeniors. They worry about accidentally deleting photos from their phones, said Ms. Ackron, who shows them the \u201cRecently Deleted\u201d folder. They\u2019re alarmed when they can\u2019t see old images on a new computer. (The storage device is no longer compatible.) \u201cThere have been quite a few people frustrated with that kind of stuff,\u201d said Yannick Hutchinson, a 23-year-old student who also works with Teeniors. New and subtler forms of online storage, working in the backgrounds of our smartphones, cause particular anxiety. \u201cThe storage is not on their phone, but out there on this supposed cloud,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Well, where is it?\u2019\u201dNow, again, with services like iCloud, the tech industry is promising us all the space we need. This time, however, it has barely felt the need to pitch us. Photo glut is a common condition. These days, smartphone makers don\u2019t need to pitch; they tend to just make us aware of what\u2019s already happening automatically. If you use an iPhone, every picture can be uploaded to Apple\u2019s servers, until you run out of free space, at which point you\u2019ll either need to start deleting things or rent some more, from Apple.Google promises unlimited free \u201cstorage,\u201d sure: \u201csafe, secure, and always with you.\u201d But some of its other promises, the ones we haven\u2019t heard before, are strikingly of their time: \u201cNever worry about running out of space on your phone again.\u201dIt is a gentler approach than \u201cwe want all your photos.\u201d And this most modern solution quickly diverts our attention away from the old question \u2014\u00a0where will my photos end up? \u2014\u00a0to the newer ones attendant with photography as it exists today. People take pictures to remember things, for the benefit of others, or to record something beautiful or notable, but also according to the constant demands of social media, of keeping friends and family updated in real time, and of simply communicating on the phone. The various images we record, and those compelled from us, are something apart from a photo collection. Apple proactively processes a phone\u2019s images into categories, some of which wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the side of a shoe box, or the cover of a photo album: around dates or places; of particular people, who Apple identifies automatically with facial recognition. Sometimes Apple reminds you of a birthday party, and presents you with a moving video. Other times, as it did to a friend, it shows you a slide show of photos you took of a stereo to post it on Craigslist. Remember that day? Google\u2019s approach is more assertive. From your raw imagery, it will automatically edit together a sequence of your child\u2019s development. It will do the same for your dog, whose face it can also recognize. You can search your photos for almost anything: cars, sunsets or \u201cscreenshots containing text.\u201d Its album and videos and searches double as assurances: You may never organize your photos yourself, but we have some ideas; you may not remember taking them in the first place, but they still exist. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent like Flickr,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cTech companies are still selling a lot of very neophyte people a lot of problematic lies about things that matter a lot to them.\u201d Besides, even Flickr offered more than storage. It was a social network with a framework for sorting and tagging and categorizing and discussing photography. You can now export that data alongside your photos if you want, but this archive of metadata has few uses and fewer places to go. The prospect of removing your photos and videos from a service like Google Photo, which provides not just space but also the only interface through which your personal imagery makes any sense, is worse than daunting. Ms. Ackron\u2019s advice for seniors remains practical. \u201cYou always need to keep an eye on where you\u2019re storing your photos, to make sure things aren\u2019t going out of date,\u201d she tells them, describing the process as \u201ctedious\u201d but necessary. \u201cTechnology isn\u2019t slowing down.\u201dThey have advice, too. \u201cI just keep all my pictures on my phone,\u201d Ms. Ackron said. \u201cClients talk about how they kept scrapbooks and photo boxes and photo albums, and about how physically holding the pictures themselves is a different experience.\u201d Now, she said, she prints some favorites of her own. Beneath the roar of digital acceleration, there is still some shuffling of paper. A 2018 analysis by f/22 Consulting, a photo industry firm, noted that a printing business in turmoil has managed to siphon growth from America\u2019s bulging camera rolls. Traditional prints \u2014\u00a0shoe box fodder\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are growing again. But not as fast customized mementos and books, including some generated by tech giants using facial recognition and other artificial intelligence. It\u2019s not a solution, but it may be an escape. My own wedding was just over two years ago, photographed and recorded in a variety of ways. To the extent it existed on social media, it\u2019s in fragments. We have countless photos sitting in folders, and on various drives; some of our guests shared photos with us, others didn\u2019t, and we didn\u2019t bother most of them about it. Google has a cache, which it is tirelessly analyzing for clues and content. For a record of a single weekend, this nebulous digital archive is surprisingly unapproachable. And it has already begun its decay.There does exist a version of events, however, rendered in a coherent way, in the manner of photographs recorded for posterity \u2014\u00a0a pair of photo books printed for our parents, who requested a way to show photos that didn\u2019t involve their phones. If history is any guide, our best chance at having something to look back at when we\u2019re old won\u2019t come from the next Google, or whatever comes after that. It\u2019s that these books will survive all of it, and find their way back to us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Failed to Police How Its Partners Handled User Data", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook failed to closely monitor device makers after granting them access to the personal data of hundreds of millions of people, according to a previously unreported disclosure to Congress last month.Facebook\u2019s loose oversight of the partnerships was detected by the company\u2019s government-approved privacy monitor in 2013. But it was never revealed to Facebook users, most of whom had not explicitly given the company permission to share their information. Details of those oversight practices were revealed in a letter Facebook sent last month to Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, a privacy advocate and frequent critic of the social media giant.When a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the initial F.T.C.-mandated assessment in 2013, it tested Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Microsoft and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handset. In both cases, PricewaterhouseCoopers found only \u201climited evidence\u201d that Facebook had monitored or checked its partners\u2019 compliance with its data use policies. That finding was redacted from a public version of PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s report released by the F.T.C. in June.\u201cFacebook claimed that its data-sharing partnerships with smartphone manufacturers were on the up and up,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cBut Facebook\u2019s own, handpicked auditors said the company wasn\u2019t monitoring what smartphone manufacturers did with Americans\u2019 personal information, or making sure these manufacturers were following Facebook\u2019s own policies.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to just take the word of Facebook \u2014 or any major corporation \u2014 that they\u2019re safeguarding our personal information.\u201dIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \u201cWe take the F.T.C. consent order incredibly seriously and have for years submitted to extensive assessments of our systems.\u201d She added, \u201cWe remain strongly committed to the consent order and to protecting people\u2019s information.\u201dFacebook, like other companies under F.T.C. consent decree, largely dictates the scope of each assessment. In two subsequent assessments, Facebook\u2019s October letter suggests, the company was graded on a seemingly less stringent policy with data partners. On those two, Facebook had to show that its partners had agreed to its data use policies.A Wyden aide who reviewed the unredacted assessments said they contained no evidence that Facebook had ever addressed the original problem. The Facebook spokeswoman did not directly address the 2013 test failure, or the company\u2019s apparent decision to change the test in question.Because the United States has no general consumer privacy law, F.T.C. consent decrees have emerged as the federal government\u2019s chief means of regulating privacy practices at Facebook, Google and other companies that amass huge amounts of personal data about people who use their products. In letters and congressional testimony, F.T.C. officials have pointed to the decrees as evidence of robust consumer privacy protection in the United States.A spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers acknowledged in a statement that Facebook defines the privacy procedures, known as \u201ccontrols,\u201d that are tested during the assessments.\u201cChanges to controls may occur as platforms evolve, such that a control tested in one period may not be identical in a subsequent period,\u201d the spokesman said.The October letter to Senator Ron Wyden details Facebook\u2019s oversight of its partnerships with device makers.While the assessment reports were publicly released by the F.T.C. in June, they included significant redactions, which Facebook and PricewaterhouseCoopers said were necessary to protect trade secrets.Mr. Wyden, whose staff had viewed the full assessments, said at the hearing that he found parts of the unredacted reports \u201cvery troubling\u201d and pressed Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, to release them in their entirety.The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based consumer rights group that helped obtain the 2011 consent decree, is currently suing the agency for release of the full assessments, arguing that the public cannot otherwise judge how effectively the F.T.C. is policing privacy violations.\u201cWhat is clear is that the F.T.C. has failed to enforce the consent order,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the privacy rights group. \u201cAnd this has come at enormous cost to American consumers.\u201dThe F.T.C. declined to comment.Facebook\u2019s compliance with the consent decree is the subject of a new F.T.C. investigation opened in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.In the letter last month, Facebook\u2019s vice president for United States public policy, Kevin Martin, noted that the assessors\u2019 findings had not caused Facebook to fail PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s overall evaluation: The assessors concluded that Facebook was operating \u201cwith sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance\u201d that it was protecting its users\u2019 privacy.It remains unclear whether Facebook has ever scrutinized how its partner companies handled personal data. A spokeswoman declined to provide any examples of the company\u2019s doing so.A BlackBerry official, who declined to discuss details of the companies\u2019 data-sharing agreement, said BlackBerry did not think that Facebook had ever audited its data use, but noted that BlackBerry\u2019s business model relies on protecting users\u2019 personal information.Advertisement"}

We all feel it. I feel it too. At Google, we set a very high bar, and we clearly didn\u2019t live up to our expectations.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cmoments like this show we didn\u2019t always do it right.\u201d He promised that \u201cthere are concrete steps coming up,\u201d but he hesitated to say that Google has a toxic culture.\u201cSexual harassment is a societal problem and Google is a large company,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are definitely doing our best.\u201dMr. Pichai\u2019s tenure atop Google has been marked with internal clashes and external finger-pointing.\u201cWe are a company that\u2019s about freedom of expression and information,\u201d Mr. Pichai said, adding that \u201cwe allow people to speak up\u201d but \u201calso have a code of conduct.\u201dMr. Pichai said on Thursday that Google, which is based in Northern California, has \u201clocal left-leaning employees and local right-leaning employees\u201d but stressed that the company has a global mindset. Besides, he said, personal political leanings are \u201cdifferent than how we build our products, and we are committed to doing it in a nonpartisan way.\u201d\u2014 Tiffany HsuHow many times does some tweet or policy action or statement by President Trump leave Peter Thiel, one of his most vocal supporters, in disbelief?Actually, he said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201dOn Thursday, he acknowledged that the current political environment is \u201cnot healthy\u201d but said that the country has been \u201cpolarised since the late 60s\u201d and that President Trump is \u201cnot the main cause.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated thing to get right,\u201d he said.\u201cI tend to think that the inaccuracies President Trump tells are basically exaggerations of the truth,\u201d Mr. Thiel said.\u2014 Tiffany HsuA month after relinquishing the role of chief executive officer at Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein was still defending the firm he now chairs.\u201cI would say that we\u2019re pretty compliant,\u201d he said late Thursday afternoon at the DealBook conference in Manhattan. He was responding to a question about federal criminal charges filed hours earlier against two former Goldman investment bankers over their role in helping to finance a Malaysian government fund from which about $4 billion went missing. \u201cBut here in this case, at the very least, and this part I know, one of our people lied to us and evaded our systems and our controls.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d he added.On Oct. 1, the longtime investment-banking chief David M. Solomon succeeded Mr. Blankfein as C.E.O. Mr. Blankfein, 64, has stayed on as senior chairman of the board through the end of this year. Beyond joking about the idea of unfettered tweeting, he has said little so far about his future plans.On Thursday afternoon, looking relaxed in a navy suit and blue tie, he reminisced about his more than twelve years running Goldman and addressed some of the c-suite mysteries that had enveloped his tenure. As to whether longtime firm president Gary D. Cohn could have ever succeeded him as C.E.O., he was equivocal.\u201cI think his leaving coincided with a new administration,\u201d said Mr. Blankfein, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t done him the favor of telling him when I was leaving at that point.\u201dAs to whether he would have done anything differently to help Goldman weather the financial crisis, he said more proactive public relations would have helped burnish the firm\u2019s image.\u201cOur mantra was our clients should have the exposure, not us. We\u2019re in the background,\u201d he said of the firm\u2019s approach to publicity in the pre-crisis years. \u201cThat hurt us a lot.\u201d\u2014 Kate KellyMaking a rare public appearanceThursday at the DealBook conference, the 47-year-old executive discussed the family\u2019s latest round of deal making and what it could mean for the family\u2019s other assets. In particular, he spoke about the newspaper business under News Corp, a roster that includes The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, as well as The Times and The Sun in Britain.The sale of Fox\u2019s film and TV studios to Disney prompted a question about whether his father would ever sell The Wall Street Journal, which Mr. Murdoch acquired in 2007 for over $5 billion.\u201cI never thought we\u2019d sell the TV studio, the film studio, so who knows?\u201d Lachlan responded. In the next breath, he said of his father, \u201cHe loves journalism. He loves The Wall Street Journal and what it represents.\u201dThe businesses that will remain under the control of the Murdochs after the close of the Disney deal early next year will center on news and sports. That means Lachlan will run Fox News, the Fox Broadcasting network and the FS1 cable sports network.Fox News, in particular, has come under heavy criticism for its close ties to the Trump administration. That has led to charges from critics that Fox News, and the larger Murdoch TV business, is actually a red state media organization.Lachlan disagreed. \u201cI think about it as an all-state media organization,\u201d he said, later adding that, \u201cwe program to everyone. It\u2019s to the coasts. But also everywhere in-between.\u201dHe cited figures that showed more Fox viewers are tuned to its sober news segments than the fiery opinion hours. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d he said.\u2014 Edmund LeePadma Lakshmi believes in redemption for men brought down amid the #MeToo movement.But that redemption should come from genuine remorse and understanding of the impact of one\u2019s actions, as Ms. Lakshmi said Thursday, and shouldn\u2019t be driven by a man\u2019s being good at a certain job.It was one of the lessons that Ms. Lakshmi and her fellow panelist, Lisa Borders, sought to impress on their audience. The women discussed how the #MeToo movement continued to revolutionize gender dynamics across the workplace, culture, in social circles and in sports and education. Both have become vocal leaders.The op-ed was published as two women came forward to detail accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and President Trump questioned why one of the women, Christine Blasey Ford, didn\u2019t report the incident when it happened more than 30 years ago.The conversation was wide-ranging as Ms. Borders and Ms. Lakshmi described the need for a cultural shift, not just in the workplace, but particularly in how men are socialized and boys are raised.\u201cWe need to stop equating aggression and masculinity because I think that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d Ms. Lakshmi said.Ms. Borders said there needed to be more transparency, particularly on the issue of salaries, so women would know if they were being underpaid. She said that companies should understand that policies and practices that empower women also help organizations as a whole.\u201cWe add value,\u201d Ms. Borders said.Both women said the ability to share stories through social media had helped strengthen the #MeToo movement and create a time of real social change. Ms. Borders said there was a recognition among what she called survivors of sexual abuse that their stories were not \u201cour burden to bear but society\u2019s burden to bear.\u201d\u201cAnd it lit fire,\u201d she said.Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, the maker of the disappearing-message app Snapchat, said broadcasting regulations offer a framework for how to think about the dangers of social media.\u201cIf you look historically at America, a place that\u2019s always celebrated things like free speech, we\u2019ve actually always thought about broadcasting really differently than how we thought about communication,\u201d he said.While Americans have long accepted most forms of speech, even the distasteful kind, they have been less tolerant when that speech is widely distributed, he said, noting that broadcasters are subject to regulations on what they can and can\u2019t say or show.\u201cI think we\u2019re in this weird moment in time where this behavior\u2019s been enabled technically and the regulatory framework actually hasn\u2019t caught up to that reality,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.When asked if he was suggesting that social media should be regulated, Mr. Spiegel said only that there was much to learn from how Americans have thought about the responsibility of broadcasters in the past. The challenge, though, is identifying what, exactly, broadcasting is, he said.\u201cWe understand what one-on-one communication is, but let\u2019s say your Uncle Joe, for example, has some very extreme, maybe not so accurate, views on the world and he wants to reach 500 people. Is that OK? If he wants to reach 50,000 people, is that OK? If he wants to reach 100,000, is that OK? Where do we draw the line in terms of where broadcasting is versus communication with friends?\u201dSome have argued that social media has enabled social change, but Mr. Spiegel said that view is overly simplistic.\u201cOne of the more dangerous things that I\u2019ve seen is this idea that just using your voice is going to make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of it, that\u2019s half of it, but the other half is really taking action to implement that change.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiTo address corporate America\u2019s diversity problem, Ken Frazier sees a lesson in his own past.The chief executive of Merck is one of only three black chief executives in the Fortune 500. But growing up as the son of a janitor in inner-city Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier faced an opportunity gap. Fortunately for him, a desegregation policy and a 90-minute daily bus ride that gave him time to read helped to overcome it.\u201cI look back at my own life and I realize that I was treated in an extraordinary way in this country,\u201d he said.As the nation increasingly self-segregates, Mr. Frazier said, the workplace is one of the few remaining places that offers that same opportunity for people of different backgrounds to interact \u2014 and business leaders, he says, have a responsibility to uphold that basic American value.That conviction led Mr. Frazier to step down last year from President Trump\u2019s manufacturing advisory council, the first of many executives to do so after the president equivocated in his response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\u201cFor me, it was a very clear personal decision as a matter of conscience,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cI happen to believe that political discourse, political speech, has consequences.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiMary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said that the company plans to roll out a ride-sharing service that would rely on autonomous vehicles in 2019, a development that would advance the already-heated race to bring self-driving cars to market.\u201cWe\u2019re on track, with our rate of learning, to be able to do that next year,\u201d Ms. Barra said, adding that the company had a strategy to show how its vehicles are safer than human drivers. The vehicles can currently run safely at speeds of up to about 30 miles per hour, and the service will be limited to a small geographical area, Ms. Barra said.She did not say where the service would operate, but noted that the company has been testing in San Francisco.Autonomous vehicles rely on what Ms. Barra described as \u201ca suite of sensors,\u201d including radar, cameras and a technology known as lidar. G.M. is focused on advancements to lidar, which will drive down costs and enable the vehicles to travel at higher speeds, she said.\u201cWe do believe in an all-electric future,\u201d she said.\u2014 Niraj ChokshiNancy Dubuc, the newly installed chief executive of Vice Media, announced at the conference today that the company will be profitable by \u201cthe next fiscal year.\u201d That would be an important milestone for a business that was most recently valued at $5.7 billion.\u201cIt actually was profitable a couple years ago, and then with all the expansion and investment, we made it not profitable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut very, very quickly it\u2019ll be profitable again.\u201dCost cutting will help. But Ms. Dubuc characterized the forthcoming changes as a way to become more efficient. \u201cWhen you have expansion everywhere, you\u2019re obviously going to have duplication everywhere too,\u201d she said.Vice started as a free punk magazine in Montreal in 1994 and has traded on its irreverent, brash tone to become a global media company with about 3,000 employees. Backed by media giants like the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, Vice now includes an advertising agency, a TV network, a film-production business and programs on HBO.Vice founder Shane Smith responded to the article by pledging a series of changes, including pay equity and reaching gender parity within the work force. In a statement, he said, \u201cfrom the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.\u201dMs. Dubuc praised Mr. Smith for his response.\u201cShane did a powerful thing and that was to take seriously the changes that needed to happen at Vice,\u201d she said, later adding that her being named aschief executive was an important signal for the company to send.\u201cI could have a pretty dramatic impact,\u201d she said.\u2014 Edmund LeeFor someone who speaks often and loudly about taking a stand and doing good, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock spends a lot of time thinking about gray areas.\u201cThese things are not black or white,\u201d he said on Thursday at the DealBook conference in New York.BlackRock has $6.5 trillion under management, giving it great influence over many of the world\u2019s top public companies. In a conversation that ranged from tariffs to bitcoin, Mr. Fink returned repeatedly to ideas about corporate accountability.\u201cI\u2019m not a nanny either,\u201d Mr. Fink said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not telling companies what their purpose should be. But I do believe it\u2019s up to the company to identify what their purpose is.\u201dOther executives \u2014 including Mr. Dimon, Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone and Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber \u2014 also dropped out of the event. Despite his refusal to attend what he called a \u201cvery public showcase\u201d of the kingdom\u2019s strengths, Mr. Fink said that BlackRock would continue to conduct business in Saudi Arabia, adding that he \u201cnever believed that decision would cost us all the business.\u201dBut he stressed that his attention to social responsibility is not a passing fad.\u201cI certainly never did this to be in vogue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re being asked.\u201d\u2014 Tiffany HsuSteve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, concluded his presentation on Thursday with the results of a poll he recently helped run: 61 percent of the people surveyed cared about using researched facts to help form their opinions on policy, beating the 54 percent who said their values shaped their opinions.For Mr. Ballmer, that is central to a project he has been working on since he retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014 and has poured millions of dollars into: USAFacts, a nonpartisan database of federal, state and local government revenue and spending.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the better part of four years trying to understand where government gets its revenue, where it spends its revenue,\u201d Mr. Ballmer told the audience on Thursday.In a wide-ranging presentation, Mr. Ballmer ran through some highlights of the types of data his website provides, hitting on hot-button issues in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.Mr. Ballmer has called USAFacts \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual financial filings that companies make. In charts, Mr. Ballmer showed how he believes USAFacts can help Americans filter the increasingly convoluted noise.On immigration, for example, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States rose from about 10.5 million to 12.1 million in recent years, according to USAFacts\u2019 analysis of government data. The number of border agents has risen sharply from about 4,000 to 19,000 over the same period, while border apprehensions have decreased from roughly 1.7 million to 300,000, Mr. Ballmer said.The numbers raise natural questions, Mr. Ballmer said. Why are there more border agents today, fewer apprehensions, but more undocumented immigrants?\u2014 Mihir ZaveriDavid Gelles, Corner Office columnist at The New York Times, presented the findings of a DealBook conference task force on diversity in the workplace, characterizing it as a \u201creally lively discussion\u201d that could have gone on for hours. Nonetheless, \u201cwe made a remarkable amount of progress in an hour,\u201d he said.Among the conclusions of the report:\u2022 Aspirational goals are in general a good thing, but they\u2019re not enough, said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. Companies also need to be transparent in how they\u2019re achieving those goals. In addition, there can\u2019t be separate business and diversity scorecards \u2013 diversity needs to be part of the business.\u2022 Legislation and federal policies need to play a role. John Hope Bryant, founder and chief executive of Operation HOPE spoke about the need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships, and when the effort is especially aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get a double credit for that double reach,\u201d he said.\u2022 Companies have to realize diversity is a long-term goal, and it has to be baked into its culture. \u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it,\u201d it won\u2019t work, said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JP Morgan Chase. And everyone has to join the conversation, she said.\u2014Alina TugendRebecca Blumenstein, the deputy managing editor of New York Times, described the conversations of a DealBook conference task force, intended to establish guidelines on how to ethically implement A.I., as one of the \u201chighest level discussions she has ever seen\u201d about the technology.Among the conclusions of the panel:\u2022 Companies should take care to scrutinize their machine learning initiatives (and algorithms in general) for biases that may be passed on from their creators, said Dipayan Ghosh, a Pozen Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. These technologies should be developed with greater consideration for the public interest.\u2022 In New York City, when considering artificial intelligence in transportation, companies should be transparent with the data they use in order to ensure the technologies are a benefit to society, said Cordell Schachter, the chief technology officer of the New York City Department of Transportation.\u2014 Mihir ZaveriA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified the people shown.

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: WeWork Might Be Too Big to Fail", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn just eight years, WeWork has become a titan of the real estate market, snapping up pricey leases around the world. Critics have long scoffed at its business model, and many think that it will face a reckoning in an economic downturn.WeWork has gobbled up leases for so much space in so many cities, there\u2019s a compelling case to be made that its landlords wouldn\u2019t be able to afford for it to go under.Because of WeWork\u2019s size, \u201cthey have more power in a down market,\u201d said Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the longtime real estate investor and founder of Colony Capital.We\u2019ll get a close look at the state of WeWork\u2019s finances later today when it releases third-quarter earnings.An F.T.C. consent decree says that Facebook is supposed to monitor those data-sharing arrangements. What actually happened, according to Nicholas Confessore, Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance of the NYT:When a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the initial F.T.C.-mandated assessment in 2013, it tested Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Microsoft and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handset. In both cases, PricewaterhouseCoopers found only \u201climited evidence\u201d that Facebook had monitored or checked its partners\u2019 compliance with its data use policies. That finding was redacted from a public version of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report released by the F.T.C. in June.\u201cFacebook claimed that its data-sharing partnerships with smartphone manufacturers were on the up and up,\u201d Mr. Wyden told the NYT. \u201cBut Facebook\u2019s own, handpicked auditors said the company wasn\u2019t monitoring what smartphone manufacturers did with Americans\u2019 personal information, or making sure these manufacturers were following Facebook\u2019s own policies.\u201dStocks dropped again yesterday as investors worried about the future of big technology companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 2.8 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 2 percent.Apple remains a key concern. The company has a market value above $900 billion, so moves in the share price have an outsize effect on stock indexes \u2014 like the S&P 500 \u2014 that are weighted by market size.\u2022 Companies\u2019 capital spending jumped in the first and second quarters, but fizzled out in the third.\u2022 Corporate tax receipts have fallen by a third compared with last year, belying Republicans\u2019 promise that the cuts would pay for themselves. (The federal budget deficit is up 17 percent from last year.)\u2022 Wages haven\u2019t grown in inflation-adjusted terms, though Republicans say that will take time.Mr. Tankersley\u2019s and Mr. Phillips\u2019s conclusion: \u201cTen months after the law took effect, that promised \u2018supply side\u2019 bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus.\u201dEven so, it has been signed by 50 nations, 130 private sector groups (including many big American tech companies) and 90 charitable groups and universities. Absent: the U.S. itself, along with nations including China, Iran, Israel, Russia and Saudi Arabia.A phone call made after the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi \u2014 in which a member of the kill team instructed a superior to \u201ctell your boss\u201d the job was done \u2014 is the latest piece of evidence that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is linked to the death.The revelation will add pressure on the U.S. to punish the Saudis and Prince Mohammed, despite initial reluctance by the Trump administration to do so. The incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee has promised to investigate Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.

But she cannot be assured of support from hard-line Brexiteers in her cabinet, whom she may need to face down.If the deal is rejected today, Mrs. May\u2019s leadership could hang in the balance.

{"Headline": "Imagining What Happens When the Robots Take the Wheel", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.An appalling statistic appears toward the end of \u201cNo One at the Wheel,\u201d Samuel Schwartz\u2019s valuable primer on self-driving cars: In the century since the automobile arrived on the scene, 70 million people have been killed by it, and four billion injured.Schwartz, who served as New York City\u2019s traffic commissioner in the 1980s, was nicknamed \u201cGridlock Sam\u201d for his devotion to the conundrum of traffic (and for coining the loathsome term). He knows everything about how cars and people don\u2019t get along, having been on the front lines. This book \u2014 written in an earnest, conversational style \u2014 is his attempt to grapple with a fresh threat that\u2019s appeared after decades of progress.Futurists may have promised us flying cars, but what we\u2019re going to get instead are driverless ones, and Schwartz\u2019s is the first comprehensive analysis of what that will mean on the ground. Most likely, there will be far fewer fatalities. With nearly 40,000 people killed in 2017 in the United States alone, that\u2019s a huge benefit. But cars that can drive themselves will bring with them other knotty societal problems.By next year, both General Motors\u2019 self-driving unit, Cruise, and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo (formerly the Google Car) aim to have driverless cars available for ride-hailing services in major American cities. And that\u2019s just the beginning. Schwartz figures that autonomous vehicles, or A.V.s, will arrive in huge numbers in the decades ahead, bringing cheaper mobility options, improved safety, reduced pollution thanks to the electric motors they will favor, but also profound ethical dilemmas \u2014 namely, the restaging of the conflict between walking and driving.Schwartz is in it for pedestrians (and bicyclists). For centuries, shocking as it might seem now, people could walk pretty much wherever they pleased. Sure, they had to dodge the occasional mule cart or arriving stagecoach, but for the most part, they ruled the crude paths and humble cobblestones, from ancient Rome to Belle \u00c9poque Europe.The automobile constrained them. Jaywalking became a crime. Cars mowed them down. Schwartz and fellow urban enthusiasts successfully fought to reclaim space for the basic human act of walking. And now the A.V.s have appeared.\u201cIf history warns us about anything,\u201d Schwartz notes, \u201cit\u2019s that pedestrians and cyclists have to be better organized, more vocal and more vigilant if they are going to ensure that A.V.s will not completely eliminate walking on many streets, except in fenced-in locations or at different levels from the roadway.\u201dThe advent of smartphone-enabled businesses like Uber and Lyft has accelerated this disruption, as Schwartz points out. The riches are plainly in sight: Cruise was valued at over $14 billion, and one Wall Street bank thinks Waymo could be worth $175 billion. These players want to launch autonomous mobility services quickly to gain market share, leaving until later the debugging of the ensuing mayhem.Will pedestrian deaths go down in an A.V. future? Almost certainly. But there are other factors to consider even before the robots take over, like congestion pricing, which Schwartz forcefully supports for both human-driven cars and A.V.s.I\u2019m someone who enthusiastically drives cars for a living and who, without reservation, admits that the automobile has brought menace and avoidable carnage right along with the freedom to set out on the open road. We should have better thought it through the last time around. If we heed Gridlock Sam and this valuable, humane book as we move toward a future in which we largely surrender the wheel, we can avoid messing up again. From his perspective, we don\u2019t have a choice.Matthew DeBord is a senior correspondent at Business Insider and the author of \u201cReturn to Glory: The Story of Ford\u2019s Revival and Victory at the Toughest Race in the World.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.M.\u2019s President Will Take Over Its Self-Driving Effort", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA top General Motors official is taking on a new role that underlines the auto industry\u2019s intense push to develop and commercialize self-driving cars.The official, Dan Ammann, will give up the job of G.M. president and become chief executive of Cruise, the division working on autonomous vehicles, the company said Thursday.The move gives Cruise increased management heft as it prepares to start a driverless-ride service by the end of 2019. G.M. expects the service and other related businesses to expand rapidly, and Mr. Ammann said it could involve \u201ctrillions\u201d of self-driving cars in the future.\u201cThis is technology that we wanted to develop and deploy in massive scale, measured ultimately in units of trillions,\u201d Mr. Ammann said in an interview. \u201cTo go from where we are to achieve that objective requires a major commitment of time and resources, and so I\u2019m going all in.\u201dKyle Vogt, a co-founder of Cruise and its current chief executive, will become president and chief technology officer.Other automakers and technology companies \u2014 including Ford Motor and Waymo, the self-driving company that is owned by Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 are working on similar efforts in the expectation that such driverless services will become a large and lucrative business. Few have suggested that these new businesses could become as vast as Mr. Ammann\u2019s vision of trillions of vehicles, however.Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst, said G.M. appeared to be \u201cin the top tier\u201d of companies striving to grab the lead in driverless-ride services. But G.M. has revealed few details about Cruise\u2019s technology, he added, so it is hard to judge how advanced it is.Ford, which is testing autonomous delivery cars in Miami, plans to have a driverless car in mass production by the end of 2020. Waymo has been working on its technology for nearly a decade and has racked up tens of millions of miles of on-road testing.Waymo has a test fleet of self-driving cars in Scottsdale, Ariz., providing rides to a limited number of residents. It plans to buy up to 62,000 Chrysler minivans and 20,000 Jaguar electric cars next year to deploy in a commercial ride service.Analysts also said Mr. Ammann\u2019s arrival at Cruise could signal preparations for an initial public offering of the unit, which could bring billions of dollars in proceeds.Mr. Ammann \u201chas the Wall Street background to do that,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said.Cruise is testing about 180 self-driving cars in San Francisco. Its vehicle, the Cruise AV, is a small electric car that has no steering wheel or pedals. It navigates streets using radar, cameras and other sensors that allow the car\u2019s computer systems to identify pedestrians, intersections, other vehicles and obstacles. With no steering wheel, it has two passenger seats in the front and a center console with a display screen, and a buttons and knobs for audio and climate control.G.M. plans to mass produce the car at a plant in Lake Orion, Mich., where it assembles an electric car already in showrooms, the Chevrolet Bolt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Neo-Nazis Have No First Amendment Right to Harassment, Judge Rules", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA lawsuit accusing the publisher of the neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer of coordinating a \u201cterror campaign\u201d of online harassment against a Jewish real estate agent cannot be dismissed on First Amendment grounds, a federal judge in Montana ruled this week.The events that spurred the lawsuit began in the fall of 2016, when The Daily Stormer published a series of articles attacking Ms. Gersh, of Whitefish, Mont., for her interactions with Sherry Spencer, the mother of the white supremacist leader Richard Spencer.Ms. Spencer owned a building in Whitefish and Ms. Gersh had talked to her about its potential sale after word circulated that residents were considering a protest there against white supremacy.Then Ms. Spencer reversed course, and published a blog post on Medium, charging that Ms. Gersh had tried to threaten and extort her to sell the building and break with her son. Mr. Anglin then began writing and publishing his own articles calling for \u201ca troll storm\u201d against Ms. Gersh.\u201cTell them you are sickened by their Jew agenda to attack and harm the mother of someone whom they disagree with,\u201d he wrote, according to the suit.In the months that followed, the site published over 30 related posts \u2014 and the phone numbers, email addresses and social media profiles of Ms. Gersh, her husband and 12-year-old son, as well as friends and colleagues, the suit states.By the spring of 2017, the family had received more than 700 vulgar and hateful messages, including death threats, many referencing the Holocaust. Some phone messages consisted solely of the sound of gunshots.The Southern Poverty Law Center filed the lawsuit on Ms. Gersh\u2019s behalf in April 2017. Mr. Anglin sought to have it dismissed, and a magistrate judge, Jeremiah C. Lynch, ruled against him in May. Mr. Anglin filed objections to that ruling, which sent the case to Judge Christensen for additional review.David Dinielli, a lawyer for the law center, said in a statement that Judge Christensen\u2019s ruling on Wednesday \u201cunderscores what both we and our client have said from the beginning of this case \u2014 that online campaigns of hate, threats, and intimidation have no place in a civil society, and enjoy no protection under our Constitution.\u201dIn a phone interview, Mr. Dinielli said that the Gersh family had notified law enforcement of the harassment, but there have been no criminal charges.His lawyer, Marc Randazza, said that Judge Christensen\u2019s decision was dangerous for free speech.\u201cThe rule we lay down for the Nazi applies equally to the civil rights activist,\u201d Mr. Randazza said in a statement. \u201cAnd that ruling, if it stands, is not going to be good for anyone who engages in common outrage culture. Maybe that\u2019s a good thing, but I think not.\u201dMr. Anglin never responded, and Mr. Obeidallah said his lawyers were preparing to file paperwork for a default judgment.\u201cI don\u2019t expect us to collect any money,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBut if we did collect any money from Anglin I would donate it all to organizations that fight bigotry and racism.\u201d\u201cHe should be assured that if we end up with a judgment, we will go to the ends of the earth to collect, so that he doesn\u2019t do this again and can no longer publish,\u201d Mr. Dinielli said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keeping This Fluffy, Fragile Beast Alive", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA veterinarian told them that rabbits, under stress, tend to die quickly and easily. They hoped their rabbit \u2014 and their new love \u2014 would prove more resilient.She\u2019d moved to town four months ago and still hadn\u2019t unpacked. Cardboard boxes lined the walls of her apartment, as if making way for the large cage in the center. \u201cIt\u2019s Judy!\u201d Ashley said, flinging her arms in the cage\u2019s direction.I wasn\u2019t sure how to greet a rabbit. \u201cHiya, Judy,\u201d I said in my dog voice. I waved.Judy did not seem impressed. She raised her ears from a head that remained at rest atop two rolls of dewlap and twitched her nose as if to swipe me aside.Layered in her own surfeit of furs, Judy carried herself like a czar in minks. Ashley opened the cage, and Judy allowed me, as if paying obeisance, to touch her spotted coat. \u201cAm I not the softest thing in the world?\u201d she seemed to ask.I expected things to warm between Judy and me, but I didn\u2019t know how to court a rabbit. I rabbit-sat for Ashley (just as a friend) a couple of times over the next months when she was out of town. This entailed providing Judy with kibble, romaine and twice daily hay. I would read on Ashley\u2019s couch while Judy hopped around, greasing the legs of the coffee table with her chin, marking her territory against me.Ashley had told me I would be able to wrangle Judy back into her cage if I made a bloop sound, so I waddled after her bloop-blooping and shooshing the air with my hands, but Judy would not let herself be harried by bloops like mine.The first day I made the mistake of picking her up, as I had seen Ashley do many times. (Judy allowed herself to be carried like a baby, feet up, in Ashley\u2019s arms.) But unworldly thigh strength hid beneath Judy\u2019s soft pelt, and she immediately bounded off, leaving deep purple scratches on my wrists.Judy eyed me the whole chaste year I spent hanging out at Ashley\u2019s apartment, as if questioning what I thought I was doing there.A few days after Ashley and I finally kissed, she called me in tears. Judy\u2019s cage was soaked with blood.We rushed her to the vet, where they cut her open, removed several afflicted organs and sewed her up again. While we waited, the vet said that rabbits often did not wake from surgery.Rabbits don\u2019t like pain, the vet said. Too much stress and they tend to quit.I found myself feeling envious of rabbits as the vet explained Judy\u2019s fragile physiology. Natural selection hadn\u2019t equipped me with a way to grant myself an easy death. But rabbits, apparently, were adept at having quick heart attacks when under mortal threat. I wondered how Judy would decide: Tough it out or fold?It was spring. The nights I had imagined with Ashley were not set at Bright Eyes & Bushy Tails Veterinary Hospital, but when Judy finally woke, Ashley\u2019s joy was all-embracing.The vet, though, did not seem relieved. Judy wasn\u2019t eating and drinking, and until she did, we had to fear a condition called gastrointestinal stasis, in which a rabbit\u2019s digestive system shuts down and the animal slowly bloats to death. I watched Ashley\u2019s face go ashen again and wondered if she really wanted me here for this. Something in me said: \u201cBack away.\u201dGood relationships, it seemed to me, were based on mutual niceness, a gentle zone where friends and partners lived out their affections. The rabbit had not been especially nice to me, not compared with golden retrievers I had known, and I didn\u2019t feel like being that nice to her, not since she chewed through my MacBook cord. Now the vet was handing me several IV rehydration bags and a mix of mealy food paste we were supposed to force-feed to a rabbit that I doubted even wanted me in her life.But it was a two-person task to administer her critical-care rabbit food, a powdered blend of timothy grass and soybean hulls to be mixed with warm water and syringed thrice daily past Judy\u2019s unfriendly teeth. Listening to the vet\u2019s instructions, I understood I was conscripted.Judy\u2019s mealtimes were small sagas. Ashley would lie on the floor and press her forehead against Judy\u2019s to calm her. Judy would then let herself be picked up and swaddled in a bath towel. Ashley would tenderly elevate the bundled rabbit to the couch, where I would hold Judy against the cushion like a football while Ashley tried to get a syringe nib past her lip.At the first whisker grazing, Judy would hunch powerfully backward, hiding her face in the towel. If the syringe neared again, she would buck and bolt from the couch altogether.It was infuriating to be angry at a rabbit. Couldn\u2019t she understand I was trying to save her life? I could, of course, muscle her down against the couch cushion if I had to, but she fought me so fiercely that I worried she would pull her stitches out.Ashley and I screamed at each other as we took turns trying to pry up Judy\u2019s lip and slip in the pasty nutrients: \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt her!\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll die if she doesn\u2019t eat!\u201d And in the middle of it all, we would start fighting about why it had taken me a year to kiss her.As I cleaned the spilled rabbit food from the couch cushions, I thought about the couches of my life, all the times I had been wedged between parents to be told about a death or divorce. I could remember the couches more clearly than the talks. On this couch, Ashley and I were already having fights grievous enough to ensure I would remember this fabric forever, no matter how short our romance proved to be.I watched Ashley rolling her forehead against Judy\u2019s or barely smoothing the fur between her eyes. Judy didn\u2019t hop away or hunch back or even blink. She didn\u2019t look comfortable, but she seemed to know she was loved. That didn\u2019t mean she had to pretend to enjoy every minute or love the meal paste we were forcing her to eat.\u201cO.K., it\u2019s time,\u201d I said after a while, because food had to be followed by drink. Ashley picked Judy back up and pet her while I hung an IV bag from the lamp. The needles were fearsome, wide as cocktail straws. When Judy was ready, Ashley squeezed my hand and nodded. Neither of us could watch as I pinched a tent of skin from Judy\u2019s back and jabbed the needle in.Judy flinched but stayed. We opened our eyes and looked at each other. Then we switched on the drip.A rehydrated rabbit is a funny thing. We joke about Judy\u2019s dromedary days still, how she would drag her fluid-filled lump across the living-room floor, taking uncertain, lopsided hops that audibly sloshed.Two months ago we got married, and in thinking about the forever thing, I have been remembering the vet\u2019s talk: how, beyond some threshold of pain and stress, rabbits tend to quit. I suppose it remains to be seen whether Judy is invincible. Probably she isn\u2019t. But possessed of the ability to stop her heart at any time, she consistently chooses to stick around.Judy outlived that couch, which got torn up in a move, and another couch too, which we left behind in Denver when we moved to France, where Ashley has work.Judy (and Roberta too, our second rabbit) live in Paris now. The apartment we rented came with a bright red couch, and quite possibly we will have to swaddle Judy and pin her against it to dose her with something she doesn\u2019t like. Ashley or I may have to spend an angry solo night on the red couch from time to time. But we like it \u2014 for fights or, you know, making up. For watching the rabbits hop around the floor.Our friends and family advised us that international travel with rabbits sounds like an avoidable torment, and of course they are correct. But so what? Love entails plenty of those. Opt out too often and you opt out of the thing itself.Not us. Our love is a tough little monster. Also the softest thing in the world.Advertisement"}

When you find yourself one woman in a room of 30 people, that is when you feel lonely.\u201dDr. Ahouansou, whose company employs 15 people, said men still have a blind spot \u2014 not about women in management, but about women in technology. \u201cThey need to change their mind-set that science is just for them,\u201d she said.No one disputes these days that STEM remains mostly a man\u2019s world. Much has been written about the male geek culture that dominates Silicon Valley and other technology hubs. But numerous speakers at the conference agreed that needs to change soon if women are to adjust to fast-changing job markets that increasingly require technological skills, or scientific proficiency.The study found that in the developed world, women account for just 25 percent of graduates in information and communications technology, and 24 percent in engineering \u2014 even though women outnumber men in graduate schools over all.As jobs change around the world, technology \u2014 and the flexibility it promises \u2014 could offer women a chance to choose how, when and where they work. But these opportunities are lost without the skills to access them, which is why many said at the global women\u2019s forum, in which The New York Times is a partner, that giving women the skills to master technology is a social, moral and economic necessity.\u201cFixing that is the right thing to do,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said.\u201cWhat the study found is that girls want more role models,\u201d Ms. McKinley said. \u201cWhere are the women STEM teachers? Girls are more interested in hands-on experience; they want to see the life applications of what they are learning. We need to focus on this.\u201dAngel Gurria, Secretary General of the O.E.C.D., speaking at an opening event at the organization\u2019s headquarters, said a recent effort in his native Mexico \u2014 \u201cmacho Mexico\u201d as he put it \u2014 to expose girls in high schools to celebrated women in science and technology has had a positive affect. But, he acknowledged, fighting stereotypes is an uphill battle.\u201cThey happen naturally, starting in families,\u201d he said. \u201cParents often don\u2019t have enough information. We are fighting centuries and centuries of tradition and culture.\u201d One answer, some experts say, is to encourage paternity leave after the birth of a child, which allows their wives to keep working, and the men to become more involved in family life and to offer their daughters in particular another role model at home.Paternity leave has been catching on in some countries, particularly those facing a declining birthrate and an aging population, as a way to encourage women to stay in the work force.In Iceland and elsewhere, fathers\u2019 share of paid leave dipped during the financial crisis, as men stayed at work to boost the family income.But in many countries, cultural biases can trump even the most progressive legislation. Generous paternal leave policies in Japan and Korea are rarely used for both economic and cultural reasons, Mr. Adema said.In Russia, legislation that allows fathers to take up to three years off after the birth of a child is widely shunned, according to Svetlana Lukash, a member of Russia\u2019s presidential staff. \u201cIt is still badly perceived by society,\u201d she said.According to O.E.C.D. statistics, women are still eight times more likely to care for children than men, even though 86 percent of men agree they should do more to share the burden at home. As several speakers admitted, attitudes toward shared responsibilities at home have changed, but behavior has not.\u201cWe need to make the women\u2019s agenda a family agenda,\u201d said Gabriela Ramos, chief of staff at the O.E.C.D.Attracting girls and women to STEM studies is just one issue. Another, perhaps more significant, is encouraging them to stay the course. \u201cIt is all about retention,\u201d Ms. Estanislao said. \u201cIt is useless to bring in women if you can\u2019t keep them.\u201dAccording to Ms. Nefesh-Clarke, more than 50 percent of women in information and communications technology, or ICT, leave, mainly because of a hostile environment. That helps explain why women hold only 3 percent of the top management jobs in ICT, she said.\u201cWe can\u2019t just address the external pipeline,\u201d she said later. \u201cWe have to address the internal pipeline, and why it is leaking. What is it about the culture of ICT that makes women not want to stay?\u201dA new danger is that the low level of women\u2019s participation in STEM may become self replicating. A number of speakers at the three-day forum noted that women are woefully underrepresented in the high-tech start-up world. Only 9 percent of apps are created by women; 10 percent of innovative start-ups were founded by women; and women-only teams account for just 6 percent of popular open source programming language for data analysis.In other words, all-male teams are writing algorithms that reflect their attitudes and biases, which inadvertently or not can exclude women.\u201cAlgorithms are built by humans,\u201d said Emanuela Aureli, of Spencer Stuart, a consulting firm. \u201cIf women don\u2019t participate in their creation, they won\u2019t have a voice.\u201d Pronouns flagging the sex of applicants have been found inserted in job search programs, she said.\u201cThe message is we should not reproduce the biases and stereotypes of the analog world,\u201d said Ms. Ramos, the chief of staff of the O.E.C.D.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of women in information and communications technology who leave, mainly because of a hostile environment. It is 50 percent of women, not 50 women.Advertisement"}

I used to report for The Queens Tribune, The New York Observer, WNYC, and Politico before joining The Times last month as the new New York Today reporter.You\u2019ll also notice that we\u2019re giving New York Today a redesign, in hopes of making our newsletter even more helpful as you begin your day.Consider New York Today a running conversation about what is, and is not, working in New York.Here are some of the big themes I\u2019m going to explore in this space:Transportation: How people move \u2014 by car or bus, on trains, scooters, over bridges and all across our city \u2014 is obviously of vital importance. The subways (and mass transit in general) are the veins and arteries of New York. If they\u2019re clogged, we\u2019re in trouble.Information: How we get news, the shrinking of local journalism, and the vast expansion of Google, Facebook and Twitter are changing how we relate to those around us.I\u2019m hoping that New York Today can help you to navigate this landscape.Culture/Identity: How we talk about race, class, gender and other forms of identity in New York is changing. We\u2019re going to pick up and discuss some of those stories, from myriad perspectives.Let\u2019s begin.A special election to fill her public advocate position will take place in February. But many prospective candidates have already started their campaigns.Ms. Smalls, who served as a policy aide on Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, is a lawyer and lives in Manhattan.Even as the Mexican police jet started its descent into Long Island, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera had no idea where he was going\u2026.But as an airport glimmered on the ground outside his window, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 shackled, handcuffed and in the care of two American law enforcement agents \u2014 anxiously asked where he was being was taken, according to a person briefed on the trip.\u201cBienvenido \u00e1 New York,\u201d one of the Americans said.El Chapo terrorized his native Mexico for decades. So why is he being tried in Brooklyn?\u201cThe Brooklyn indictment, originally filed in 2009, stems from a series of obscure contract killings that occurred in New York in the early 1990s,\u201d Alan writes.\u201c...the election on Tuesday strongly suggested that the golden era of charter schools is over in New York. The insurgent Democrats who were at the forefront of the party\u2019s successful effort to take over the State Senate have repeatedly expressed hostility to the movement....it seems highly likely that a New York Legislature entirely under Democratic control will restrict the number of new charter schools that can open, and tighten regulations on existing ones.\u201dGovernor Cuomo also recently softened his support for charter schools as he eyes a potential White House bid.Xavier\u2019s mother, Janet Guillen, of Inwood, said she has been out of work because of the demands of caring for Xavier.She had been working at a grocery store when she found out she was pregnant.\u201cI never thought I was going to have a kid,\u201d she said. \u201cAt 38 \u2014 what? Nah. It\u2019s too late for me.\u201d After seeing specialists, Ms. Guillen learned her son had autism.Xavier now attends the Kennedy Children\u2019s Center, an affiliate of Catholic Charities that specializes in preschool for children with developmental issues.HOW TO HELPJeffrey M. Ward thinks the whole thing started with a tweet.\u201cWe kind of noticed that we were close to the same number in birds, somewhere around June, or July,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think we were at the same number.\u201dThen, \u201cI went up on him and I posted on Twitter. So, he went out to the coast and got a few birds up on me and he replied back to me, with his numbers.\u201dThus began the great Birder Competition of 2018, starring two brothers from the South Bronx, each vying to see more species of birds.\u201cAs mad as I am that I\u2019m losing at the moment, I\u2019m happy that he got to Texas and got so many new birds that he\u2019s never seen before.\u201dHave a great Monday.Advertisement"}

Here are some tips to help.Most medical professionals categorize travel as a stressful event, even more so for those suffering from autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel, celiac, Hashimoto\u2019s or psoriasis. A change of routine, jet lag, and unfamiliar germs or foreign food can exacerbate one\u2019s condition.Plus, since a growing number of people adhere to strict anti-inflammatory diets to manage those illnesses, dining on the road can pose a real challenge. Here, doctors and specialists share some advice on how to stay healthy and eat well while traveling. As always however, talk to your doctor for specific advice related to your condition, depending on where you plan to visit.He also recommends carrying on medications in their original packaging with a copy of prescriptions, as well as a doctor\u2019s letter detailing their condition and necessary medications to decrease any chance of confiscation by airport or border security.\u201cVisiting regions like Western Europe where it\u2019s easy to replace medications is also helpful,\u201d he added. If specialty drugs are lost or confiscated, patients can contact their health insurance\u2019s or drug company\u2019s patient support programs, which typically provide a rescue supply of medications through a local specialty pharmacy or hospital (depending on the country). For generic drugs, patients can usually go to local pharmacies to get a short-term refill.Supporting the body\u2019s immune system is key to staying healthy while traveling. Ryan Warren, a clinical nutritionist at the Jill Roberts Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian steers her patients toward local, fresh, seasonal foods while traveling abroad. \u201cEvery patient\u2019s dietary needs are different, but I recommend fresh fruits and vegetables (well cooked, skinned and de-seeded if the patient is avoiding high roughage foods), lean proteins like fish, poultry and eggs, and a variety of whole grains, nuts, nut butters and legumes, as tolerated,\u201d she said.Ms. Warren also suggests staying away from raw foods because they can carry food-borne illnesses, exposing travelers to pathogens that might be problematic for people with compromised immune systems. Avoiding inflammatory triggers like concentrated sweets, fried greasy foods and alcohol is also beneficial. \u201cSince air travel is inherently dehydrating, drinking plenty of water is key,\u201d she adds.Tips for how to combine pleasure with wellness when you\u2019re on the road, because isn\u2019t living your best life the point of a vacation in the first place?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cryptocurrency Millionaire Wants to Build a Utopia in Nevada", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "A man spent millions on an enormous plot of land near Reno. Now he wants to build a community based on the blockchain technology introduced by Bitcoin.Supported bySTOREY COUNTY, Nev. \u2014 An enormous plot of land in the Nevada desert \u2014 bigger than nearby Reno \u2014 has been the subject of local intrigue since a company with no history, Blockchains L.L.C., bought it for $170 million in cash this year.The man who owns the company, a lawyer and cryptocurrency millionaire named Jeffrey Berns, put on a helmet and climbed into a Polaris off-road vehicle last week to give a tour of the sprawling property and dispel a bit of the mystery.He imagines a sort of experimental community spread over about a hundred square miles, where houses, schools, commercial districts and production studios will be built. The centerpiece of this giant project will be the blockchain, a new kind of database that was introduced by Bitcoin.After his driver stopped the Polaris on a high desert plateau, surrounded by blooming rabbit brush and a grazing herd of wild horses, Mr. Berns, who is 56, pointed to the highlights of his dream community.\u201cYou see that first range of mountains,\u201d he said, pointing south. \u201cThose mountains are the border of our South Valley. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going to build the high-tech park,\u201d a research campus that would cover hundreds of acres. There are also plans for a college and an e-gaming arena.As strange \u2014 even fantastical \u2014 as all this might sound, Mr. Berns\u2019s ambitions fit right into the idiosyncratic world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains.The blockchain began as a digital ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Some aficionados have grander plans. They think it could be a new way of taking power back from the institutions they believe are calling all the shots.Just as Bitcoin made it possible to transfer money without using a bank, blockchain believers like Mr. Berns think the technology will make it possible for ordinary people to control their own data \u2014 the lifeblood of the digital economy \u2014 without relying on big companies or governments.Mr. Berns was drawn to Nevada by its tax benefits, including the lack of income taxes. And the breadth of his ambitions certainly raises the risk of a boondoggle.But he is different from his crypto-brethren in one big way: He is spending his own money. So far, he said, he has spent $300 million on the land, offices, planning and a staff of 70 people. And buying 67,000 largely undeveloped acres is a bit of old-fashioned, real estate risk-taking.Still, Mr. Berns said his ambition was not to be a real estate magnate or even to get rich \u2014 or richer. He is promising to give away all decision-making power for the project and 90 percent of any dividends it generates to a corporate structure that will be held by residents, employees and future investors. That structure, which he calls a \u201cdistributed collaborative entity,\u201d is supposed to operate on a blockchain where everyone\u2019s ownership rights and voting powers will be recorded in a digital wallet.Mr. Berns acknowledged that all this is way beyond what blockchains have actually accomplished. But that hasn\u2019t discouraged him.\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d he said over the roar of the Polaris engine. \u201cI just \u2014 something inside me tells me this is the answer, that if we can get enough people to trust the blockchain, we can begin to change all the systems we operate by.\u201dMr. Berns has managed to win over local officials who are eager for economic development. Nevada\u2019s governor, Brian Sandoval, read a proclamation that named the Blockchains property \u201cInnovation Park\u201d at an event last month where Mr. Berns sat on a panel with the governor and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla.Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory in Nevada, which has been described as the largest building in the world, is surrounded by Blockchains\u2019 land. Companies like Google, Apple and Switch also have properties in the industrial park that is surrounded by Mr. Berns\u2019s holdings.The Nevada county where this is all located, Storey County, has only about 4,000 residents and was best known, until recently, for its history of silver mining and its modern brothels, including one owned by a county commissioner.That same county commissioner, Lance Gilman, bought the land surrounding the brothel and turned it into the industrial park where Tesla and Google are now located.Blockchains has already received preliminary county support for a new town along the Truckee River, with thousands of homes, a school and a drone delivery system, and is working closely with the county on a broader master plan.But for now, Blockchains is empty land and a repurposed office building. Mr. Berns said the company won\u2019t begin construction on the broader property until late 2019, at the earliest, after putting together the master plan and getting it approved by the county.The office manager from Mr. Berns\u2019s old law office in Los Angeles, Joanna Rodriguez, moved with her four children and husband to Nevada.\u201cHe has these crazy ideas \u2014 but I know that every time he sets his mind to something he will get there,\u201d said Ms. Rodriguez, 29, who has worked with Mr. Berns for eight years and is now the manager of the Blockchains office in Nevada. \u201cThat\u2019s why I decided to move.\u201dMr. Berns spent most of his professional life on class-action lawsuits, many of them against financial companies. He learned about Bitcoin in 2012 but was won over by another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, which makes it possible to store more than just transaction data on a blockchain.Mr. Berns bought Ether, the digital token associated with Ethereum, in a big sale in 2015. Thanks to an astronomical increase in the price of Ether and some well-timed selling last year before it crashed, he became wealthy enough to fund his dream project.Ethereum is what he believes makes his community more than just a giant real estate project. To understand why requires more than a bit of imagination. And faith. Every resident and employee will have what amounts to an Ethereum address, which they will use to vote on local measures and store their personal data.Mr. Berns believes Ethereum will give people a way to control their identity and online data without any governments or companies involved.That is a widely shared view in the blockchain community, but there are significant questions about whether any of it can work in the real world. Most blockchain companies have failed to gain any traction, and Ethereum and Bitcoin networks have struggled to handle even moderate amounts of traffic.Mr. Berns believes that one of the big problems has been security. People have been terrible at holding the private keys that are necessary to get access to a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet.He wants to address that with a custom-built system where people\u2019s private keys are stored on multiple digital devices, kept in vaults, so that no one device can gain access to the keys. He has already purchased vaults that are burrowed into mountains in Sweden and Switzerland, and he plans to build additional vaults in the mountains in Nevada.The other thing holding back Ethereum, Mr. Berns believes, has been a lack of real-world laboratories. His Nevada land, he hopes, will change that.\u201cThis will either be the biggest thing ever, or the most spectacular crash and burn in the history of mankind,\u201d Mr. Berns said. \u201cI don\u2019t know which one. I believe it\u2019s the former, but either way it\u2019s going to be one hell of a ride.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Haiku of a Home in Sullivan County", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byON LOCATIONIn Phillipsport, N.Y., an architect set out to build the bare minimum of a rural retreat: a pared-down house with a sense of poetry.9 PhotosMany architects aspire to design buildings with a sense of poetry. When Kyle Page began thinking about a weekend house for his family in Sullivan County, N.Y., it was more along the lines of haiku.\u201cI kept simplifying it to the purest forms, the purest wrapper,\u201d he said.That focus on simplicity wasn\u2019t just a design preference; it was a requirement of his budget.Mr. Page was confident he could design a beautiful modern house. He just wasn\u2019t sure they could afford to build it.He began looking for a lot in 2015. After months of searching, he found a listing on Zillow for 19 forested acres with no specific address in Phillipsport, a hamlet in the town of Mamakating, about 80 miles north of Manhattan. With the help of Google Maps, he figured out where the land was, and was intrigued to see that it had a large pond.\u201cI went and checked it out that weekend,\u201d Mr. Page said, \u201cand put an offer in as soon as I could.\u201d They closed on the property for about $135,000 in August 2016.Determined to keep construction costs as low as possible while also flexing his architectural muscles, he began designing a compact structure at the edge of the pond with a number of distinctive features. The resulting 1,080-square-foot home is formed by two connected volumes: one with a gable roof, containing the main living spaces; the other with a flat roof, housing a mudroom, bunk room, carport and mechanical equipment.The gable-roofed portion is clad mostly in weathering steel, while the flat-roofed part is wrapped in ebonized, rough-cut cedar siding, both of which Mr. Page felt would help the structure blend into its surroundings.Inside, the concrete foundation serves as the finished floor, and an electric ducted mini-split system provides heating and cooling. There is no natural gas, propane or oil heating. Instead, Mr. Page gave the building a \u201chyper-efficient envelope\u201d with spray-foam insulation, and designed an overhang facing the pond that works with the seasons: In the summer, it shades the living room; in the winter, it allows sunlight inside.In addition to a living-and-dining area with an open kitchen under a cathedral ceiling, there are three modest bedrooms, two small bathrooms and a sleeping loft. But there is no lavish master suite: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to call an 8-by-11-foot room a master bedroom,\u201d joked Mr. Page, who was more intent on providing enough sleeping space for their children and guests.Much of the furniture was similarly cost-efficient \u2014 made from wood found on the property. An old, ailing maple tree provided lumber for headboards for two of the beds and for the rustic shelves and dining table with benches that Mr. Page designed. He also turned logs from ash trees destroyed by the emerald ash borer (a type of beetle) into stools and side tables by cutting into them with a chain saw to create legs.\u201cThe kids love them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey send trains through them and create bridges between them.\u201dOnce the major construction was completed, Ms. Stecker developed a custom seed mix for grasses and wildflowers to heal the earth that was torn up in the process. \u201cI tried to knit it back together with the context,\u201d she said, noting that wildlife has since returned. \u201cThe deer and wild turkeys have taken ownership.\u201dBut even with the most disciplined budgeting, the house, like any custom home, wasn\u2019t exactly inexpensive. Completed in June after a year of construction, it cost a total of about $450,000, most of which was paid for by a construction loan.For Ms. Stecker, the result is a testament to her husband\u2019s vision and planning. \u201cIn every aspect, he was relentless in pursuing the best efficiency, cost and design all together,\u201d she said. \u201cI have this sense of awe every time we drive in and this incredible house is sitting there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Who will fact-check Gossip Cop?Gossip Cop relies heavily on celebrity publicists to knock down rumors about their famous clients, so it\u2019s tempting to dismiss the site as a public relations arm of the entertainment industry. But there is an emerging rigor to Gossip Cop\u2019s methodology, reflected in the latest iteration of the site and the actions of the website\u2019s founder, Michael E. Lewittes. On the surface, it appears that Gossip Cop has ambitions to become, or at least be treated like, a full-blown fact-checking service on par with PolitiFact and Snopes.This notion is disputed by Mr. Lewittes, a former Access Hollywood producer and tabloid columnist who launched the site with financial backing from Dan Abrams, a television journalist and founder of Abrams Media, the boutique online publisher of Mediaite and The Mary Sue. (Mr. Abrams is listed as co-owner and co-founder, but is not connected to the editorial content of the site; he currently serves as chief legal correspondent for ABC News.)And Mr. Lewittes is the son of Joel Lewittes, a former federal judge, also in New York\u2019s Southern District, and his wife, Lee Kushnir Lewittes, is a booker for the Fox News morning show \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d (According to an online newsletter published earlier this year, the Lewittes family attends Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, the Upper East Side synagogue that, until early 2017, counted Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump as members.)While giving verified independent outlets special license to fact-check may help embattled platforms like Facebook and Google help to restore their image in the short-term, in the long-term, as the Weekly Standard episode suggests, the same arrangement has the potential to do more damage.\u201cThe only people \u2018cheated\u2019 here are the tabloid\u2019s readers,\u201d the story said. Around the world, the spheres of politics and entertainment continue to overlap. The need for fact-checking outlets with an understanding of tabloid and celebrity culture, which is now political culture, is only likely to grow. Facebook, as is its way, wouldn\u2019t go into detail about its process for certifying third-party fact checkers. Controversially, the company enforces nondisclosure agreements with fact-checking partners, leaving the facts about fact-checking in a state of shadow. And Gossip Cop, for its part, would not speak of its plans for the future of fact-checking. But there is a world in which Gossip Cop could help determine what celebrity gossip gets to even exist on the internet.The Trump-Daniels affair is an uncomfortable reminder that in 2018, celebrity gossip can regularly be the real news. Almost every outlet that has covered the scandal has quoted or mentioned the story in The Dirty to establish the fact that the rumor predated Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Seven long years ago, Gossip Cop deemed the underlying rumor as false. Maybe more disturbingly, it also was one of only two outlets that bothered to check it out at all. Advertisement"}

How the Flatirons got their name became clear as I made my way up the First-Second Flatiron Trail. A seemingly endless cascade of large pinkish-brown stones led upward into the trees and brush. Mottled with a spray of green-gray lichen, they nearly resembled a camouflage pattern. I stopped at some point during my ascent and looked toward the southeast, where in the distance, a small rainbow was peeking through the clouds out over downtown Denver, about 25 miles away. I found it easier than surfing, but tricky nonetheless. I spent the first 30 minutes paddling from my knees on the long, wide board until I found the nerve to attempt to stand, and promptly fell into the reservoir. But after about a half-dozen falls I got the hang of it, and we spent the next hour paddling like a couple of gondoliers around the peaceful and largely empty reservoir.I spent the next few hours hiking most of the 4.1-mile trail and then doubling back. Bring plenty of water \u2014 the hike isn\u2019t difficult, but the sun is strong and the air is thin. But the pristine mountain panoramas are unmatched, and I came across only a handful of people on my hike. There were animal sightings, too, including mule deer and many cute yellow-bellied marmots.I was happy, too, as I got back into the car with my bounty. For having spent a mile (or two) up in the sky during the entirety of a four-day trip, it all felt amazingly down to earth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shetland Islands: Scenery, Sheep and Knitters Galore on Britain\u2019s Northern Tip", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "PursuitsShetland Wool Week is hailed as the worldwide mecca of knitting festivals. But the islands have a rich, complex history beyond that of the textiles industry.Supported byLast fall, just a few days into my trip to the Shetland Islands, the Scottish subarctic archipelago across the sea from Norway, I found myself on the top of a cliff face, peering through the fog at a huge rock in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The rock was topped with a spike of white: the Muckle Flugga lighthouse, built in 1854, a mind-boggling feat as the rock\u2019s cliff face juts straight up out of the roiling sea. In the early days of the lighthouse, our tour guide told us, men had to be hoisted by ropes around their arms to safely cross the gap between their boat and the landing area on the rock. At this most northerly point in the U.K, I felt a profound sense that I was very far from home.Before I left New York, the only thing I really knew about Shetland was that it is the birthplace of Fair Isle knitting (Fair Isle being the most remote of the islands), a technique of colorwork recognizable in traditional sweaters. What I found was a place with a complex history beyond that of the knitting industry, difficult to get to but well worth the journey.In Shetland, knitting is a tradition that goes back centuries and is embedded in the place\u2019s rich history. Sheep here outnumber people by 20 to 1, and inclement weather on the islands has encouraged the local sheep to grow a softer and lighter weight fiber that makes Shetland wool unique.For much of the 20th century the textile industry was an important element of Shetland\u2019s local economy; women farmers, before production was moved to factories, knitted the yokes of sweaters to be sent abroad while they walked to and from the fields.Today, knitters in Shetland are unambiguously celebrated for their vision and skill; frequent signs on the road advertise local designers whose homes double as shops.There are about 100 islands in Shetland, though only 16 are inhabited. To get to mainland Shetland, one either takes an overnight ferry or a small plane from Aberdeen, on the coast of Scotland (I took the ferry, a very memorable roller-coaster experience on the heaving sea that I\u2019m nonetheless not sure I want to experience again). Some of the smaller islands\u2019 municipal needs are taken care of from Lerwick on mainland Shetland, the islands\u2019s central port and biggest city (with a population of about 7,500), which is also where the hub of the festival is.Often when you curve around a bend in the road the view before you is breathtaking, and if you are driving a car you have to be careful not to drive right off the road. Cliffs drop precipitously just feet from the pavement; inlets have choppy waves (and, in summer, killer whales who pick off sleepy seals), enormous rocks jut up from the ocean just off the coast, and everywhere, roofs and boats and houses are painted cheerful colors that burst against the overcast sky.In the winter, there is a month of near-perpetual darkness, and in the summer, a month of continuous sunlight; the wind, I was told, is constant no matter the time of year, though at certain times it is known to gust harder, stronger, or more or less predictably (in September, the month I was there, the winds are known as \u201cthe Equinox gales\u201d).Considering the size of Shetland, Wool Week is incredibly vast and diverse. The program is eight full days, and each day features myriad classes and exhibitions, tours, gatherings, teas and lectures on nearly all of the islands; on a random day, I counted 54 different offerings.For such a small place, Shetland offers an incredible amount to attract visitors. In addition to the textile industry, visitors are drawn by archaeology \u2014 (there are ancient sites scattered all over the islands), by geology (the islands sit atop a network of tectonic plates and boast an array of ancient and volcanic rocks), by caving and kayaking, and by an enormous diversity of nesting seabirds (puffins, who nest there in the 100s of thousands in the summer, are a popular draw).Two of the nights we were there, there were sightings of the northern lights, ethereal streaks of color across the night sky. The main industry on Shetland is still fishing \u2014 primarily mackerel, herring and salmon farming \u2014 and more than 75 percent of Scotland\u2019s mussels are produced there.Getting there was a bit of a challenge \u2014 as with most everywhere on the islands, there are no street addresses, so one has to know the landmarks one is looking for, or pray that Google recognizes what you are searching for and can lead you to the correct dropped pin.Jamieson and Smith Shetland Wool BrokersLerwickmainlandJamieson\u2019s ofShetlandA970ScallowayCastleB9073Virdafjell Bedand BreakfastUradale FarmGulberwickNorth SeaDetail, below1 mileNorwayMuckle FluggaLighthousescotlandAberdeenbritainunstHermanessNationalNatureReserveireland250 milesyellOllaberry HallEshaness Lighthousemainlandshetland islandsDetail, topAtlantic OceanNorth Sea20 milesBy The New York TimesUradale Farm is actively trying to bring more of the native Shetland sheep back to Shetland \u2014 currently, of about 150,000 sheep on Shetland (compared to 25,000 people), less than 30,000 are native, though the native sheep are the ones most well-adapted to thrive on the islands.Ronnie decried the phasing out of native sheep \u2014 for many years, only white wool has been worth any money (white wool can be more easily dyed, and is considered more \u201cpure\u201d for no clear reason), though native sheep are traditionally black or brown (or \u201cmoorit\u201d). Asked whether he saw any change, he spoke about Wool Week and the bigger crowds it brings to the islands every year, all with interest in and passion for the native wool. \u201cYou\u2019re standing here, that\u2019s the change,\u201d he said. Before Wool Week started nine years ago, he said, the situation seemed quite desperate.After he talked, he brought us into his colorful home (a rainbow is painted on the ceiling) for tea and more homebakes, and spoke a bit more generally about the increased interest that Wool Week has brought to Shetland (he and his wife also then let us shop for wool in their living room). One of the organizers I spoke to said that Wool Week in 2017 brought in more than 700,000 pounds (or about $900,000) to the local economy, and that doesn\u2019t include all that was spent at local shops, restaurants, or B & Bs by the 600 attendees. In 2018, nearly 700 people made the trip, primarily from Europe, the United States and Canada, but also from many farther-flung places such as Australia, Japan, Egypt, Lebanon, Indonesia and Israel.Where is all of this attention coming from? The BBC series has helped, as has perhaps a general back-to-basics interest in those of us who feel increasingly distanced from a natural form of community in our modern world.One doesn\u2019t want to get too positive \u2014 nearly every person who shared with us the good news about a resurgence of interest in the knitting industry was also quick to share the difficulties their line of work still faces (the general demand is still for inexpensive, mass-produced white wool, and the market for handmade goods is still small and imperiled) \u2014 but standing on the shores of Shetland during Wool Week, a knitter can\u2019t help but feel optimistic, and a person can\u2019t help but feel swept away.Nellie Hermann is the author most recently of the novel \u201cThe Season of Migration,\u201d and is a fellow at The Institute for Ideas and Imagination in Paris.An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of the mystery writer who set a series of murder mysteries on the Shetland Islands.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market\u2019s Dangers Are Easier to See Now", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesProject ahead a year or two: It is much easier to make a case for a troubled stock market than for a booming one.Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, regularly tallies what he calls \u201cthe pros and cons\u201d of the stock market. I asked him for an informal update: He came up with 14 pros versus 22 cons.That abundance of negativity isn\u2019t intended as a quantitative assessment of the market\u2019s prospects, but it does give a rough sense of his view and, I think, of the perspective of many skittish investors.\u201cWe were bullish for a long time, but right now I\u2019d say I\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a time to be cautious.\u201dI also asked James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in Minneapolis, for his sense of the market. An economist, Mr. Paulsen is worried about stocks because he is worried about the economy, he said. While the United States is not in a recession now, he said, \u201cwe have moved into the ballpark of a recession.\u201d\u201cIt gets somewhat easy, with a little experience, to recognize when you\u2019re in the ballpark of a recession,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThat is where we are now, and that alone is quite a bit of information.\u201dGiven his current outlook, which is that the probability of a recession within two years is reasonably high though not certain, \u201cthis is a good moment to take a little risk out of your portfolio, just in case things turn down,\u201d he said.The stock market, Mr. Paulsen said, often moves in advance of a recession \u2014 and a declining market can help cause a recession \u2014 making investment timing extremely difficult now. In this dangerous environment, he said, \u201cright now, I\u2019d be a little careful.\u201dMr. Hickey, too, advises caution, because when he enumerates the pros and cons for the market, the positive side is scanty. It includes factors like these:\u25a0 The yield curve \u2014 the difference between long- and short-term interest rates \u2014 remains in a bullish zone, although that positive margin has been narrowing and bears close watching.\u25a0 Finally, there is already so much bad news about the stock market that it amounts to good news. According to contrarian logic, Mr. Hickey said, the negatives are baked into stock prices, so the market has room to rise.That last item may be a stretch. It is an indication, he said, that he is having difficulty being upbeat.The stock market negatives on Mr. Hickey\u2019s list, by contrast, are straightforward. A sampling includes these items:\u25a0 The trend of stock prices has been quite negative. While a string of strong days could turn that around, momentum is bearish.\u25a0 Despite Mr. Powell\u2019s latest comments, the Fed is still tightening monetary policy, which could easily derail the stock market and the economy.\u25a0 The fiscal stimulus provided by the tax cut is, increasingly, behind us. Combined with tighter monetary policy, the loss of fiscal stimulus could hurt the American economy.\u25a0 Tariffs have been rising, and business sentiment has been depressed by the prospect of widening trade wars.\u25a0 Global economic growth has been slowing, and many stock markets around the world are already in bear market territory.\u25a0 The domestic housing market has weakened, homebuilder stocks have plunged, commodity prices have fallen, and auto sales are relatively weak.\u25a0 The tech sector, which propelled the market higher earlier in the year, has now lost hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Because of the importance of stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Apple, the psychological \u201cimpact of their weakness can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d Mr. Hickey said.\u25a0 Corporate debt levels are high, creating new vulnerabilities.\u25a0 The rate of earnings growth is likely to decline. That could disappoint Wall Street analysts and shake up the market.And that\u2019s just a start. The negatives go on and on.Yet even despite these portents, a gloomy financial outlook may not be entirely appropriate. For example, neither Mr. Hickey nor Mr. Paulsen is confident that the bull market is over or that a recession is likely to arrive soon.\u201cThere could be another strong bull run,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a good sense of that until at least the end of the year.\u201dI asked Mr. Paulsen to make the strongest case he reasonably could for upbeat economic and market outcomes for the next two years. In response, he said it was possible that the Fed would soften its monetary policy enough to extend the economic recovery and bolster the stock market. If the economy keeps growing and corporate earnings keep rising, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks will rise, too.The odd conditions of 2018 have already made stock valuations more attractive. Because prices have been flat while earnings have risen, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has declined to about 18, from about 23.5 in January, he pointed out.If that trend continues, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks might become rather enticing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go into a recession and if interest rates don\u2019t rise too much, at some point stocks could look good enough to set off another bull run,\u201d he said.But he added that he wouldn\u2019t bet on it with money needed to pay the bills in the next couple of years.After a nearly 10-year bull run, the downside of the market is becoming increasingly obvious.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ghosn Arrest Exposes Stress in Japanese-French Auto Marriage", "Date": "2018-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is probably never a good time for an auto empire to have its leader thrown in jail. But for Nissan and Renault, the arrest of Carlos Ghosn comes at an especially inopportune moment.The two carmakers can ill afford turmoil in the alliance headed by Mr. Ghosn when the global auto market is entering a downturn, a trade war provoked by the Trump administration is interfering with supply chains and Silicon Valley is spawning well-financed new competitors.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest in Tokyo this week on suspicion that he deceived Japanese authorities about his pay package, exposed deep fissures in the union between Renault and Nissan that he engineered in 1999, and which Mitsubishi Motors joined in 2016.Whatever the outcome of legal proceedings against Mr. Ghosn, he is unlikely to regain his previous stature. Instead, analysts said, there could be a destructive power struggle within the alliance as Nissan tries to assert more control. Renault has been the dominant partner of the three carmakers even though Nissan sells more cars, a state of affairs that appears to rankle executives in Tokyo.Hiroto Saikawa, the chief executive of Nissan, made no attempt to disguise his enmity toward Mr. Ghosn after his arrest Monday. Even though Mr. Ghosn has not been formally charged with a crime, Mr. Saikawa told reporters Monday that his boss\u2019s behavior had been intolerable and he would recommend his removal as the company\u2019s chairman.The Nissan board followed through on Thursday with a unanimous vote to remove Mr. Ghosn as chairman and to eliminate Greg Kelly, a board member and former human resources director, who has also been implicated in the financial misconduct allegation. Mr. Ghosn stepped down as Nissan\u2019s chief executive last year, but remained chairman and continued to lead the alliance, also serving as chairman at Mitsubishi, and chairman and chief executive at Renault.The board also emphasized, in a statement, that \u201cthe long-standing Alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged and that the mission is to minimize the potential impact and confusion on the day-to-day cooperation among the Alliance partners.\u201dThe statement was telling \u2014 and fell in line with the economic realities of the industry. Regardless of whatever problems the two carmakers may be having in their relationship, analysts say, they would be in much worse shape alone. Other car companies are trying to get bigger, joining forces with onetime rivals so they can share the enormous costs of developing electric, so-called self-driving cars.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has made no secret about its desire to merge with another big carmaker. Ford and Volkswagen are discussing cooperation on the production of commercial vehicles. Honda and General Motors have formed a partnership to develop autonomous vehicles.\u201cBreaking the alliance would be a very negative thing for all of the parties,\u201d said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a market research firm. \u201cCarmakers are realizing that being alone is more difficult. Going out of the alliance would be going against the trend.\u201dTo some extent the companies were victims of circumstances beyond their control. Nissan was hit by slowdowns in the United States and China, the world\u2019s two biggest car markets. Renault suffered from declines in emerging markets like Africa and India. Renault also felt some collateral damage in a geopolitical conflict after it bet big on Iran, then was forced to withdraw after the United States restored sanctions.But analysts also question company strategies that Mr. Ghosn, the dominant personality at Nissan, Renault, Mitsubishi and the alliance among them, championed. The United States is a prominent example.Nissan has long been perceived as the No. 3 Japanese automaker in America after Toyota and Honda. As the auto industry recovered after the 2008 recession, Mr. Ghosn laid out a new global strategy that called for increasing the company\u2019s U.S. market share to more than 10 percent \u2014 about a 50 percent increase from 2007 \u2014 in hopes of pushing past Honda.To drive sales, Nissan heavily discounted prices, often in ways that caused dealers to lose money on some sales. Under a strategy called \u201cGrow or Go,\u201d it pushed small dealerships to sell or close their franchises. At the same time it favored certain \u201cpreferred\u201d dealers by secretly paying them up to $1 million or more to help them build plush, new showrooms.While Nissan achieved its market-share goal for a while, it also alienated many dealers, and even some who were profitable sold their franchises because of the company\u2019s practices.And this year, with overall United States sales flat, Nissan\u2019s sales have declined 6.5 percent through October. It has been particularly hard hit by slumping sales of sedans.\u201cThey have increased market share,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader, an online buying and selling platform. \u201cBut they have not done it in a way that is healthy.\u201dNissan is not in a good position now that the United States market is losing steam, Ms. Krebs said.\u201cCar sales are edging downward,\u201d she said. \u201cOther carmakers are ramping up their incentives. Where have they got to go? They already have big incentives.\u201dRenault would be in an even weaker position as a stand-alone company. It is a minor player in China and has no presence in the United States. Without a substantial footprint in those two giant markets, it has little hope of achieving the scale needed to bargain for the best prices from suppliers and invest in new technologies.All traditional carmakers are trying to maintain their existing businesses, rooted in internal combustion engines, and at the same time they are investing heavily to develop autonomous, electric vehicles. Those new products are not yet generating profits, and there is competition from companies like Uber and Google, which are using their formidable financial resources to move into the car companies\u2019 turf.Car companies also face higher prices for steel and aluminum because of tariffs that President Trump has imposed on imports from foreign producers. And the levies he has imposed on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory tariffs from China, have interfered with the flow of car parts.Those challenges may help explain why Renault has been more reluctant than Nissan to cut Mr. Ghosn loose. The company appointed an interim replacement, Thierry Bollor\u00e9, the company\u2019s chief operating officer. But Mr. Ghosn remains chief executive even though he occupies a jail cell in Tokyo, apparently prohibited even from communicating with his family.Sooner or later, though, the companies will not be able to avoid a painful re-examination of their relationship.\u201cWe have seen there are differences,\u201d Mr. Munoz of JATO Dynamics said, \u201cas beautiful as it seemed when Ghosn was in charge.\u201dNeal E.

The crossing of I\u2019M IT with I AM ALI at 45D seemed like a dupe to me, but Mr. Ezersky says that type of dupe in a puzzle doesn\u2019t bother him.2D: Whew, that\u2019s some tough wordplay there. \u201cArm for taking needles, for short?\u201d is hinting at the arm of a larger department, not a human arm that might take a needle. The answer is D.E.A.62D/63D: I really laughed out loud when I finally got this, because I got it without even knowing why it was right. I automatically filled in OMG for 62D\u2019s \u201cTexter\u2019s \u2018No 63D,\u2019\u201d because I read it as a solver being upset because a clue was missing (something that, in past years, used to keep me up at night). Once I moved on to 63D (\u201cSee 62-Down\u201d), I could see that 62D needed to be read as \u201cNo WAY!,\u201d which is a synonym for OMG.\u201cGO WEST YOUNG MAN, go west,\u201d was an expression first used by John Babsone Lane Soule in the Terre Haute Express in 1851. The author and journalist Horace Greeley \u2014 a proponent of western expansion into the territories \u2014 liked it, and rephrased it slightly for an editorial in the New York Tribune on July 13, 1865: \"Go West, young man, and grow up with the country.\"What does this have to do with our puzzle? Mr. Ezersky noticed that he could emulate that phrase inside a grid by taking a set of phrases that ended in LAD \u2014 a synonym for \u201cyoung man\u201d \u2014 and moving that LAD all the way to the left or west side of the phrase.I will admit that I got the revealer right off the bat, because what other advice is Horace Greeley really known for? (Horace Greeley experts appearing in force in 3 \u2026 2 ... 1 ...) Once I got GO WEST, YOUNG MAN, though, I honestly thought that the theme entries were going to be written in backward, as if they were traveling from east to west.But no. That\u2019s not enough for our Mr. Ezersky. He has to take an entire word and move it from one place to another. For example, at 17A, the clue is \u201cMany a hit by Def Leppard,\u201d and the answer is POWER BALLAD. But that\u2019s not how you write it in. You take the LAD at the eastern end of the phrase, move him west, and you wind up with LADPOWERBAL. Now you move the other three young men west.Welp, this is about everything the constructor and solver side of me could have wanted:1. A theme with an unconventional revealer that leads to quite the \u201caha!\u201d moment.2. Kooky bits of fill like I AM ALI and DVD-VIDEO to accompany a youthful, sportsy vibe in AIGHT, NOOB, VIKES and BREES. 3. Shout-outs to (objectively) awesome things in the clues, from Kendrick Lamar to Taco Bell\u2019s Baja Blast.But constructor Sam is just one solver. Editor Sam certainly knows that this puzzle isn\u2019t for everyone, and promises to make sure constructor Sam chills on those sick, twisted puzzles he creates ... it\u2019s been quite the stretch as of late! That said, editor Sam is at least put at ease by the fact that there\u2019s still universally fun fill in TWIST TOP, ROOM TEMP, ACTED BIG and HIP-HOP, as well as a nice theme set he hopes any solver can appreciate.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

Gitanjali called it Tethys, after the Greek goddess of fresh water. Her device uses disposable cartridges that, once dipped in water, provide accurate and immediate readings of lead levels. \u201cIt\u2019s based on something called carbon nanotube sensor technology,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd with a Bluetooth extension, it gives you results on your mobile phone.\u201dWith Google at everyone\u2019s fingertips, coding tutorials readily available and open-source systems unlocking ever-expanding possibilities, young people like Gitanjali are increasingly using technology to solve weighty problems. And with a refreshingly non-jaded \u201cwhat if\u201d mindset, these teens might just figure out a way to create a better future for us all.\nThe teenagers, who live in Cupertino, Calif., were already working in the field of environment protection and water conservation, and wanted to use their science and tech knowledge to create long-lasting solutions. \u201cSanjana and I have been coding for a long time,\u201d Aditya says. \u201cProgramming is essentially our second language. We have a good sense of solving problems by integrating hardware and software. We live in a world of technology, with cloud computing and machine learning, so we thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we develop a device that is able to take into account factors like wind speed, temperature and humidity, and also use image recognition to identify the types of fuel in the area that contribute to a wildfire happening?\u2019\u201dAnd they did.Aditya and Sanjana created the Smart Wildfire Sensor, an outdoor hardware setup that predicts the likelihood of fires before they start, with the potential to protect homes and lives and reduce firefighting costs. The sensor can be mounted to a tree and has two parts: a device that records and transmits weather data, and an embedded high-resolution camera that captures images of the biomass, the organic matter that acts as the fire\u2019s fuel.\u201cUsing TensorFlow, Google\u2019s open-source machine-learning platform, we analyze images of biomass and estimate their moisture content to find out the amount of dead fuel,\u201d Sanjana says. \u201cWe\u2019re getting about 89 percent accuracy.\u201d The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection took an interest, and the two teens are now working with the department to further develop, test and implement this technology to mitigate wildfire risks, which have increased exponentially in recent years.\u201cIf you\u2019re dreaming about some potential solution, you have all of the resources you need online,\u201d says Sanjana, who also developed the Smart Flood Sensor. \u201cPrior generations did not have these resources, but now, anyone can easily learn programming. If you can dream it, you can do it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot cheaper than the synthetic material farmers currently use,\u201d Nirghin says. \u201cPlus it\u2019s more effective and better for the environment.\u201d Known as a super absorbent polymer, the powder can be sprinkled on top of soil, mixed into it, or added in tablet form to retain water hundreds of times its mass, creating mini-reservoirs and allowing crops to thrive in drought-stricken areas.\u201cEven though a lot of people think that teenagers don\u2019t have the resources to come up with solutions, and say, \u2018You should wait until you\u2019re a scientist,\u2019 I completely disagree,\u201d Nirghin says. \u201cTeenagers can be very good at understanding problems.\u201dNirghin is now a student at Stanford and has partnered with an international agricultural company to develop her product. \u201cI think young people bring something so unique to the table, in terms of their imagination and what they can create,\u201d she says. \u201cOur communities should take advantage of that.\u201d\nJosh Sheldon agrees. \u201cKids are fearless,\u201d says Sheldon, an associate director of the MIT App Inventor, where Gitanjali learned to build apps. \u201cAdults learning to code are tentative and afraid to move a mouse to click something, because they think they might break the computer or crash the program. Kids are just, \u2018We\u2019ll try it. We\u2019ll see what it does.\u2019\u201dGitanjali says she failed time and time again while developing Tethys. Until she didn\u2019t. \u201cMy mantra in the beginning was, \u2018Just have fun with it,\u2019 because I didn\u2019t know what was going on: \u2018Carbon nanotubes, what?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd by the end of this, I figured it out, because I was experimenting and trying new things. I wasn\u2019t afraid to fail.\u201dNow in eighth grade at Science Technology Engineering Math (STEM) School Highlands Ranch near Denver, Gitanjali is enhancing the Tethys unit to be \u201ca lot more accurate, compact, affordable and easy to use,\u201d she says, so people worldwide will be able to easily test their drinking water. She also plans to use the Firebase app development platform to allow Tethys users to upload the results of their water test. \u201cWith that data, I\u2019ll create a global water-quality heat map using Google Maps Heatmap function,\u201d she says.Gitanjali now codes just about every day and regularly creates new apps. \u201cBecause Android has an open architecture, I am able to use third-party tools to develop apps quickly and test them,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, Android is the most common operating system in the world. I like that anybody in developing countries who cannot afford an expensive iPhone can use the app.\u201dSomehow, this 13-year-old also finds the time to mentor younger children, offering her own style of anti-bullying seminars, which includes a little science. \u201cI start with the message of kindness and then end the sessions with one STEM topic, such as 3-D printing or simple programming, or ways to observe problems around us,\u201d Gitanjali says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see that kindergartners and first-graders can understand problems easily and jump to solutions without barriers.\u201dArmed with technology and determination, today\u2019s young people offer hope that humanity will get back on the right path. \u201cWe are growing up in this reality where you\u2019re seeing global problems that never existed before,\u201d Rao says. \u201cThat's where this creative mindset comes from: We want to make the world better for everyone.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "How to Buy a Used Phone Without Getting Fleeced", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew smartphone season is here, but last year\u2019s models can offer similarly impressive features at great discounts. These tips will help you grab one without regretting it later.Apple, Samsung and Google have all launched their new phones. Everyone in the world is itching to upgrade to the latest and greatest, but not you. You\u2019re a deal hunter, and while everyone else is paying $1,000 or more for a shiny new device, you\u2019re buying a used version of last year\u2019s almost-as-good model for a fraction of the cost. Here\u2019s how to get a deal without getting scammed.When a carrier blacklists a device \u2014 which can happen if the device is reported as lost or stolen, or if someone sells it while it\u2019s still on a payment plan \u2014 it can\u2019t be activated on any carrier. That means you\u2019ll be stuck with a $400 paperweight.Some sellers may prefer to keep the IMEI private, and that\u2019s fine \u2014 as long as you have a return policy and buyer protection, you can check the IMEI after receiving the phone. You\u2019ll just have to go through the hassle of returning it if something goes wrong.If you\u2019d rather buy locally and hold the device before handing over your hard-earned cash, Mr. Edwards recommends checking the IMEI in person. \u201cWhen I was buying phones on Craigslist, I would always insist on meeting in a carrier store for the transaction,\u201d he said. \u201cThen the carrier can check to see if it\u2019s blacklisted.\u201dAgain, none of this is foolproof since a phone can be reported lost, stolen or unpaid-for after you\u2019ve purchased it, but it\u2019s a good thing to check before you do.These days, many phones are compatible with multiple networks. But there are two caveats: You need to make sure the device isn\u2019t software-locked to another carrier, and you need to make sure its hardware is optimized for your carrier.When you buy a phone directly from Verizon, AT&T or another carrier, it usually comes \u201ccarrier locked.\u201d That means that phone will only be usable on Verizon, AT&T or whatever carrier you bought it from unless you ask them to unlock it.If you\u2019re buying a used phone, you want to make sure it isn\u2019t locked to a carrier other than your own. If you\u2019re on AT&T, you can\u2019t buy a phone that\u2019s locked to Verizon. You\u2019ll either want an AT&T-branded phone or a phone that\u2019s listed as \u201cunlocked\u201d by the seller.In addition, \u201csome phones have a few different numeric models that work better on some carriers than others,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cFor full and optimal compatibility, you need to pay attention to the specifics.\u201dThat means you shouldn\u2019t just search for \u201ciPhone 7\u201d and buy the cheapest listing that pops up. The iPhone 7 A1660 may look nearly identical to the A1778, but the former works on all carriers, while the latter lacks support for some of the technologies used on Verizon and Sprint. In other cases, you may run into \u201cinternational\u201d models, which can lack support for certain features (like Samsung Pay, in the case of the international version of the Galaxy S7).If you aren\u2019t sure which model numbers are compatible with your network, check on the manufacturer\u2019s website, or Google around to find out which model your carrier sells; then, search for that on your marketplace of choice.Once you\u2019re able to hold the phone \u2014 whether during a physical meetup or after receiving it in the mail \u2014 be sure to inspect it for damage. If you\u2019re meeting in person, find a spot with good light, so you can inspect the phone slowly and carefully.\u201cObviously, scratches, dents and cracked glass will be evident by handling the phone,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cWater damage is harder to spot from the outside of the phone, but every phone usually does have one or two moisture indicators \u2014 sometimes behind the battery, sometimes in the SIM card tray. That\u2019s one of those things that should be checked once you\u2019ve got the phone in hand.\u201d Before you buy, research to see if there are moisture indicators you can check once you have the device.You\u2019ll also want to turn on the screen and swipe around for a bit. \u201cIf an item\u2019s been repaired or refurbished, it may have been a shoddy repair job,\u201d said Mr. Edwards. \u201cThat can be sometimes be harder to spot, but give the screen a quick usability test once you\u2019ve got it.\u201dIf you don\u2019t find any damage, perform a factory reset on the phone right away to ensure it isn\u2019t locked to the seller\u2019s iCloud or Google account, which will prevent you from using it. If it resets and you\u2019re able to log in with your account, you\u2019re good to go.On the other hand, if you find damage that wasn\u2019t indicated in the listing, you can either call off the purchase, negotiate the price down or \u2014 if the phone was purchased online \u2014 open up a dispute with the seller. Remember, even if you aren\u2019t annoyed by a particular flaw, it could lower the phone\u2019s resale value if you decide to sell it down the line. So it\u2019s usually in your best interest to get a phone in good condition, even if you can get a damaged one for cheaper.There are never any guarantees with buying used, even if you stick to these best practices. In my experience, though, problems are pretty rare, and for every broken device you might receive, you\u2019ll have many more that work perfectly \u2014 and even if you occasionally get fleeced with no recourse, you\u2019ll likely save money in the long run. Just take the right precautions, and you should be prepared for almost any hiccup that comes your way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook to Drop Forced Arbitration in Harassment Cases", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook said on Friday that it would no longer force employees to settle sexual harassment claims in private arbitration, making it the latest technology company to do away with a practice that critics say has stacked the deck against victims of harassment.Facebook acted one day after Google announced similar plans. Last week, 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout from the company\u2019s offices around the world to demand that it change the way it handled sexual harassment incidents. Microsoft changed its arbitration policy about a year ago, as did the ride-hailing company Uber six months ago.The technology industry, known for its groundbreaking products as well as its trendsetting office culture, has gone to considerable lengths in recent years to keep work-force disputes out of the court system. Forcing employee complaints into arbitration has become as common as free lunches and shuttle buses to the office.In arbitration, employment experts say, the playing field shifts toward businesses. Cases are decided by arbitrators instead of judges, and the more cases that companies take to arbitration, the better they fare, according to a 2011 analysis by Alexander J. S. Colvin, a professor at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\u201cThis is a pivotal moment for our industry and corporate America more broadly,\u201d Lori Goler, a Facebook vice president, said in a statement. \u201cWe think this is the right thing to do and hope other companies do, too.\u201dThe use of arbitration clauses, embedded in the fine print of contracts, has soared in the last decade, as corporations try to keep disputes away from public scrutiny.Chris Baker, an employment lawyer and partner at the law firm Baker Curtis & Schwartz, said arbitration cases were often heard by a retired judge who may not be as empathetic as a jury to a harassment victim. They are often shrouded in confidentiality, and arbitration awards tend to be less than those in a jury trial.Mr. Baker said the moves by the tech firms could chip away at arbitration in all kinds of employee disputes because it would be hard for companies to draw the line at sexual harassment.\u201cI think it\u2019s the pebble that starts the avalanche,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very meaningful.\u201dBecause the claims are often kept under wraps in confidential arbitration hearings, critics say harassers often move easily to other jobs without warning to future victims.It has become a significant issue in Silicon Valley, where gender imbalance is stark and tales of sexual harassment are rampant. Critics of arbitration requirements have pushed companies to do away with arbitration and confidentiality clauses that often help companies keep the public and their own employees in the dark about bad behavior.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has noted that forced arbitration \u201ccan prevent employees from learning about similar concerns shared by others in their workplace.\u201dFacebook said it would now make arbitration an option, but not a requirement, for employees reporting a sexual harassment claim. Facebook said it had been planning to make the changes to its arbitration policy for \u201ca while\u201d but did not specify a time frame. There is no indication the company was facing specific pressure to alter its policies.Lyft, Uber\u2019s top competitor, made a similar policy change around the same time.In December, as Microsoft faced a proposed class-action lawsuit by female technical staff claiming discrimination, it vowed to end the arbitration requirement for harassment claims. The women lost the case and are appealing.Microsoft\u2019s policy change was largely symbolic because the company rarely used arbitration clauses in its employment agreements. However, Microsoft also said it would support federal legislation making the requirement of arbitration in harassment cases unenforceable.Apple has never arbitrated a harassment or discrimination claim, said Kristin Huguet, a company spokeswoman. It had a forced arbitration requirement for new employees until earlier this year, but it made arbitration optional and then eliminated the clause from employment contracts altogether. She did not specify when. Ms. Huguet said that even Apple employees who had agreed to such an agreement were no longer bound by it.Companies large and small have figured out how to use arbitration to prevent employees from taking disputes to court and to prevent others, including customers, from banding together in a class action. Some state judges have called the ban on class actions \u2014 one of the few ways that ordinary citizens can fight deep-pocketed corporations over unfair business and employment practices \u2014 a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card for employers.In recent years, it has become tough to apply for a credit card, get cable service, rent a car or shop online without agreeing to settle any disputes in arbitration. The same is true for getting a job.The use of arbitration clauses can be traced back to a coalition of credit card companies and retailers that came up with a plan to shield themselves from expensive lawsuits. Starting around 1999, the group\u2019s legal teams began discussing how to use the fine print of contracts to stop class actions. Bank of America, Chase, Citigroup, Discover, Sears, Toyota and General Electric all attended.Arbitration clauses that don\u2019t allow class-action suits are used by a wide variety of companies, including Macy\u2019s and Kmart. In 2016, when Gretchen Carlson sued Roger E. Ailes, her former boss at Fox News, over allegations of sexual harassment, his lawyers pushed for the case to move into arbitration.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg from New York.

{"Headline": "What We Have to Fear", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore the midterms, a trip to Hungary shows the dangers facing the United States.Opinion ColumnistBUDAPEST \u2014 The technology conference held here last week could have taken place in almost any other big city in Europe or the United States. It featured executives from Google, Slack, LinkedIn, Airbnb and more. I came to talk about The New York Times\u2019s digital strategy, and I stayed for three days to explore Budapest and interview people here.And yet life in Budapest doesn\u2019t feel authoritarian. It feels Western. It feels familiar.Which, as I reflected on my trip \u2014 and on the midterm campaign that I returned home to \u2014 left me deeply unnerved.Orb\u00e1n is no Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping. He doesn\u2019t put opponents in jail or brutalize them. \u201cThere aren\u2019t secret police listening to us,\u201d one Orb\u00e1n critic told me over dinner. Zselyke Csaky of Freedom House, the democracy watchdog, told me, \u201cThere is no violence, not any kind of political violence.\u201dDoes any of this sound familiar?Most alarming, the Republican Party has shown multiple signs of early Orb\u00e1nism. No, the party is not as bad as Fidesz, and, yes, American democracy remains much healthier than the Hungarian version. But the parallels are there for anyone willing to see them: Like Orb\u00e1n, Republican leaders have repeatedly been willing to change the rules and customs of democracy for the sake of raw power.Usually, Trump is not even the main force behind these tactics. Other Republicans are. In North Carolina, after Republicans lost the governorship in 2016, they went so far as to strip the office of some of its authority. Of course it\u2019s true that Democrats sometimes play rough too, but there is no list remotely like the one above for them.The United States won\u2019t suddenly become Hungary. We start from a much stronger place. But our democracy will suffer. And democracies can deteriorate more quickly than people often realize.Not so long ago, Hungary was a shining example of post-Soviet success. Power alternated between the center-right and center-left. Orb\u00e1n \u2014 a pro-democracy activist during the end of Soviet rule in Hungary, who co-founded Fidesz as a center-right party \u2014 originally became prime minister in 1998. After only one term, and to his shock, he lost the job.He responded with a plan to recapture power for \u201c15 to 20 years,\u201d as he said at the time. \u201cWe have only to win once, but then properly,\u201d he explained. Fidesz did win in 2010, with help from a bungling socialist government and widespread income stagnation. Orb\u00e1n went to work.His strategy has had three main pillars. One, he sought to control the media. Two, he launched a Christian-themed culture war that discredits his opponents. Three, he changed the rules of democracy. In each of these ways \u2014 just as Bannon understands \u2014 Fidesz is a turbocharged version of the Republican Party.I found it chilling to return home to a Republican closing message in the midterms that echoed Orb\u00e1n\u2019s so closely. In both, fictitious invading hordes \u2014 and those who supposedly support them \u2014 are the enemy of the people.As I kept seeing photos of male politicians in Hungary, I was reminded of the all-male group of Republicans who tried to rewrite health care law in the United States.

{"Headline": "John Chau Aced Missionary Boot Camp. Reality Proved a Harsher Test.", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust months before undertaking the most forbidding journey in his life as a young missionary to a remote Indian Ocean island, John Allen Chau was blindfolded and dropped off on a dirt road in a remote part of Kansas.After a long walk, he found a mock village in the woods inhabited by missionaries dressed in odd thrift-store clothes, pretending not to understand a word he said. His role was to preach the gospel. The others were supposed to be physically aggressive. Some came at him with fake spears, speaking gibberish.It was part of an intensive and somewhat secretive three-week missionary training camp. Mary Ho, the international executive leader for All Nations, the organization that ran the training, said, \u201cJohn was one of the best participants in this experience that we have ever had.\u201dFor Mr. Chau, 26, the boot camp was the culmination of years of meticulous planning that involved linguistics training and studying to become an emergency medical technician, as well as forgoing full-time jobs so he could travel and toughen himself up.He did it all with the single-minded goal of breaking through to the people of North Sentinel Island, a remote outpost of hunters and gatherers in the Andaman Sea who had shown tremendous hostility to outsiders.It was an obsession. Ever since Mr. Chau had learned in high school through a missionary website, the Joshua Project, that the North Sentinel people were perhaps the most isolated in the world, he was hooked. Much of what he did the rest of his short life was directed toward this mission.He would pull up Google Maps and point to a green speck in a place no one had ever heard of \u2014 the Andaman Islands, far off the coast of India \u2014 and tell his friends with a buoyant smile: \u201cI\u2019m going there.\u201dIn the 21st century, it is a marvel that a place like North Sentinel even exists.A tropical island, it is home to a few dozen people living a lifestyle thousands of years old and speaking a language no outsiders understand. Visitors have been driven back and killed by islanders armed with bows and arrows. Mr. Chau knew this.A review of hundreds of pages of his journals and blog postings, as well as interviews with two dozen people from around the world \u2014 fellow missionaries, family members and relatives of fishermen in the Andaman Islands \u2014 reveal a portrait of a joyful adventurer with a zest for life who resisted all warnings, despite being told repeatedly he might be killed.\u201cMy folks tried to talk him out of it,\u2019\u2019 said John Ramsey, a friend. \u201cHe said it was what he felt called to do, and he was pretty made up in his mind already so it didn\u2019t seem like persuasion would do a lot of good anyway.\u201dAs he prepared for the mission, Mr. Chau stepped up his exercise routine, doing push-ups, jogging and being careful what he ate.Friends said he did not expect to die and had taken all precautions he could think of to survive, including packing what he called an \u201cinitial contact response kit\u201d with dental forceps to remove arrows.400 milesCHINAINDIAMYANMARthailandBay ofBengalAndamanIslandsAndamanSeasouthandaman10 milesIndian OceanPort BlairNORTHSENTINELISLANDAndamanSeaBy The New York TimesMany of his friends admitted they knew the mission was extremely dangerous \u2014 and illegal because for years the Indian government has prohibited outsiders from visiting the island.But they also said they were in awe of what he was trying to do, seeing Mr. Chau as a pure expression of their faith.His mission failed. After landing on North Sentinel in mid-November wearing only black underpants \u2014 Mr. Chau thought that would make the islanders feel more comfortable \u2014 he struggled to communicate.The islanders were aggressive, as they have been with just about everyone else who had tried to make contact with them.They shouted at him. They shot arrows. Then they killed him.His body is still on the beach. Indian police officers are afraid to retrieve it, lest they increase the hostilities.His friends mourn the loss of someone they describe as a real character: good looking but perennially single, always exploring, even landing a beef jerky sponsorship that gave him all the free jerky he could eat for his travels.But many fellow Christians, including some of his friends, are uncomfortable with what he did.\u201cHe was caught up in a dangerous set of ideologies that helped drive him to do something so unwise,\u201d said Kaleb Graves, a student pastor in Arkansas who befriended Mr. Chau at a linguistics institute last year.\u201cHe should have known better.\u201dMr. Chau grew up in Vancouver in Washington State, not far from Portland, Ore. The youngest of three children, he is the son of an American mother, who is a lawyer, and a Chinese father, a psychiatrist.He is of the generation that has put his entire life \u2014 even before it actually started \u2014 online, including pictures of his young father during Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution. His father, Patrick, said he disagreed with his son about many religious matters and did not want him going to North Sentinel but was \u201cin the dark most of the time\u201d about what his son was doing.Mr. Chau attended a Christian high school and then Oral Roberts University, a fundamentalist Christian school, where people remembered how positive and open he was.\u201cHaving a conversation with John was like having a conversation with someone who reached out their hand and put it on your heart to feel the way it beats,\u201d said Nicole Hopkins, a college friend.\u201cWhen he looked at me, it was like someone really saw me,\u201d she said, \u201clike I could take off any mask of who I pretended to be.\u201dHis heroes were the naturalist John Muir and Jim Elliot, an American evangelical missionary killed in Ecuador, and friends said missionary work was the perfect fit.It united his two interests: traveling to far-flung places and serving God.In the Book of Matthew, the resurrected Jesus says: \u201cGo and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.\u201dThis passage is known as the Great Commission, and several of Mr. Chau\u2019s friends said that more than anything else, it explained why Mr. Chau did what he did.In the past few decades, mission work has soared. The number of American Christian missionaries going overseas has increased to around 130,000 today, from 57,000 in 1970, said Gina A. Zurlo, associate director at the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.The reasons, scholars say, are the rise of evangelicalism; an increase in the number of independent churches organizing their own missions; and the ease of travel.He also learned first aid and became an E.M.T.In 2015, he made his first of four trips to the Andaman Island chain, basing himself in Port Blair, the main city.The men at the hotel where he usually stayed said he was friendly and always requested the same room: 121, a small single with a good view.Preparations for his trip to North Sentinel picked up last year. He completed a summer course at the Canada Institute of Linguistics, in British Columbia, where he hunkered down in a dorm room stacked with books and jars of peanut butter, immersing himself in phonology and phonetics.He was determined to translate the Bible into the language that the people on North Sentinel speak, which has stumped anthropologists who say it is unintelligible even to people who live on nearby islands.He told his friends that he wanted to immerse himself in the culture and stay for years.He also reassured them he would take it slow, leaving gifts for the islanders and waiting for them to open up to him before he approached.While he was preparing for his mission, Mr. Chau struck up a relationship with Perky Jerky, a company that gives away its product to \u201cmicro influencers.\u201d In exchange for free jerky, Mr. Chau agreed to promote Perky Jerky on social media.He often had the boxes of Perky Jerky sent to his friend, Mr. Ramsey, whose family lived about an hour away from the linguistics school. He and Mr. Ramsey had met during a summer trip to Israel for Christian students.While Mr. Chau did not broadcast his North Sentinel plans on social media, he revealed them to the Ramsey family.\u201cHe was well aware of the dangers and the fact that it was not exactly legal,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said.Mr. Ramsey\u2019s mother, who initially had misgivings, was won over and helped edit Mr. Chau\u2019s application for missionary boot camp.In a world where just about every mile is mapped, North Sentinel remains an enigma. The people there have resisted contact from outsiders for as long as there are records.In 1880, a 19-year-old British naval officer impetuously kidnapped several islanders and brought them back to Port Blair. Some soon died and later the officer wondered if this episode had increased the islanders\u2019 hostility.Around this time, the British, who were the imperial power in the region, began building up Port Blair, home to a large prison.Vishvajit Pandya, an Indian anthropologist, said the people on North Sentinel used to trade with other islanders and possibly intermarry with them, but the British expansion disrupted those ties, isolating North Sentinel.The population of the island has now fallen to 50 to 100, which anthropologists say could be a threat to survival.From what anthropologists surmise, the islanders are related to other Andaman ethnic groups. All are believed to have migrated from Africa tens of thousands of years ago.The people on North Sentinel eat fish and turtles, wear bark belts around their waists and carry long bows to fire arrows. They have killed several outsiders, including fishermen, who have stepped on their beach.Nevertheless, Mr. Chau was determined to go there alone.He thought his size would make him less threatening, Mr. Ramsey said. Mr. Chau was about 5\u20196,\u201d 130 pounds.In October 2017, Mr. Chau began his missionary training at All Nations\u2019 headquarters in Kansas City, Mo. He attended lectures, spoke with anthropologists and participated in the village simulation exercise.That exercise, said Mrs. Ho of All Nations, was \u201cdesigned to reflect an amalgamation of many different aspects of language and culture that a missionary might encounter on the field.\u201dMr. Chau performed impressively, she said. Still, there were concerns.His planned trip to North Sentinel had no precedent. And missionaries usually travel in teams. Others were willing to go with him, Mrs. Ho said, but he refused, saying it was too dangerous.Mr. Chau landed in Port Blair on Oct. 16, traveled to another island in the Andamans and then returned to Port Blair.There, he holed up for 11 days in a small apartment that he referred to as a \u201csafe house\u201d in a long note that the police found after his death. He wrote that he never saw sunlight that whole time.All Nations, the missionary organization where John Chau trained, shared images from a note written in his final days.The police say he was doing this to avoid being spotted; his friends say he was trying to prevent himself from getting sick to protect the islanders, whose immune systems have been isolated so long that some experts say they could be wiped out by the common cold.With the help of a local evangelical, Mr. Chau hired five fishermen. Their boat was a battered wooden craft about 30 feet long, with a roof made of bamboo sticks and a plastic tarp. They chugged out the night of Nov. 14.When they reached North Sentinel in the morning, Mr. Chau assembled a collapsible kayak because the fishermen refused to go to the island with him, insisting on staying a half mile out.Mr. Chau saw some islanders on the beach, paddled up to them and tried to preach, saying: \u201cMy name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you,\u201d according to the note. They raised their bows and he paddled back to the fishing boat.A few hours later, he tried walking onto the beach with some gifts like scissors and safety pins.A boy shot an arrow into a waterproof Bible he was carrying.Another islander, a man wearing a crown possibly made of flowers, stood on a coral rock and yelled at him.Mr. Pandya, one of the few anthropologists to have set foot on North Sentinel, said these were clear warnings.The islanders, he said, were saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to engage with you, go away.\u201d\u201cIf they were so savage,\u201d Mr. Pandya said, \u201cthey would have slaughtered him straight away.\u201dThe islanders chased Mr. Chau into the surf. He saw the fishermen far away, standing in the boat, waving their arms up and down, and swam to them.The last part of the note conveys fear. He wrote, \u201cIt almost seems like certain death to stay here.\u201dBut the next morning he insisted on sending the fishing boat away, saying in the letter he had met someone in South Africa who went through a similar experience on a different island in the Andamans and won the trust of islanders only after being dropped off by a boat.He seemed now to be contemplating the end, writing in the note, \u201cRemember, the first one to heaven wins.\u201dThe fishermen told the police the next morning that Mr. Chau swam to the island. They then went to the ocean to fish.When they returned to North Sentinel a day later to check on him, they saw a group of islanders on the beach dragging Mr. Chau\u2019s body with a rope.All five fishermen have been arrested, along with two others, accused of helping lead Mr. Chau to his death.\u201cI am frustrated hearing John\u2019s name,\u201d said Naw Halen, the wife of one of the fishermen. \u201cHe has filled my family with sorrow for our whole life.\u201dIn American missionary circles, his death hit like a shock wave.Members of the Ramsey family gathered in their living room, read through Mr. Chau\u2019s last letter and cried.But they said they did not feel guilty.\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said. \u201cHe had a higher calling that he was following. I don\u2019t have any regrets.\u201dJeffrey Gettleman and Kai Schultz reported from New Delhi; Ayesha Venkataraman from Mumbai, India; and Hari Kumar from Port Blair, India.

{"Headline": "The Lure of the Steelhead", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTELKWA, British Columbia \u2014 Steelhead are a form of oceangoing rainbow trout endemic to some rivers draining to the Pacific from North America and Russia\u2019s Kamchatka Peninsula. They are also a metaphor for wonder and optimism.The wonder speaks to the fish\u2019s epic life cycle \u2014 a journey of hundreds of miles to the sea from its natal river, thousands of miles in the North Pacific feeding and growing, and hundreds of miles back home to spawn. Some fish return to the sea to complete the cycle again.The optimism concerns their elusive nature, at least as far as anglers are concerned. Many steelhead anglers will log days and days \u2014 thousands of casts \u2014 with nary a nibble. The fish\u2019s seeming disinterest only heightens their appeal, since steelhead do not feed in most river systems, but are believed to strike a fly from a territorial instinct. That, and the raw power of their take, which is positively addictive.The Skeena River flows some 350 miles in a southwesterly direction from its headwaters in northwestern British Columbia to the Pacific near Prince Rupert. Along the way, it picks up tributaries that represent a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of the world\u2019s most celebrated steelhead fisheries \u2014 the Babine, the Bulkley/Morice, the Copper, the Kispiox, the Sustut.The region\u2019s identity is closely tied to its angling treasures; in the gateway town of Houston, a 60-foot fly rod graces Steelhead Park. Motels and campgrounds advertise, \u201cSteelhead Fishermen Welcome.\u201dFor any serious steelheader, the rivers of the Skeena drainage are Valhalla.Fly-fishers are a hopeful lot by nature; how else can you believe that pitching a bit of fur and feather into a vast river will yield a fish? Steelhead aficionados ratchet that optimism up to a near fanatical \u2014 if not masochistic \u2014 level.While returns in much of the steelhead\u2019s historic range are disturbingly low (with many populations at risk of extinction), the rivers of the Skeena drainage remain relatively healthy. Hence an angler\u2019s odds for success increase.\u201cThere are no hatcheries on the Skeena system, no dams, and abundant healthy spawning habitat,\u201d noted Pete Soverel, founder and president of the Conservation Angler, which advocates wild anadromous fish populations. \u201cThis makes the rivers of the Skeena ideal for sustaining healthy wild steelhead populations.\u201dAt a bend in the Morice River near the village of Houston, my fishing partner Mike Marcus suggested we anchor our raft. The crystalline water immediately before us flowed fast \u2014 too fast for fish to hold. But about 80 feet out, there was a jumble of rocks where the water briefly slowed.\u201cI bet there\u2019s a fish there,\u201d Marcus said, before inviting me to try my luck first.I waded out and began casting slightly downstream, letting the fly swing toward shore with the current. Looking back upriver, I was struck by the setting \u2014 thick pine forests on both banks, and rugged snow-fringed mountains beyond, bifurcated by a thin line of morning mist. A few more casts and the fly \u2014 a purple Hobo Spey \u2014 swung just beyond the rocks. Almost on cue, my spey rod jolted as line screamed off the reel. A steelhead soon launched from the river, a silver missile that was speeding downstream.Some anglers will spend over $7,000 a week to visit fishing lodges on the Skeena\u2019s rivers. That was not in our budget; but the Bulkley and Morice (which is essentially the upper portion of the Bulkley) have enough public access points to make a do-it-yourself trip possible. After much planning \u2014 a rented house in Telkwa, Google Earth maps of the river and hours of tying flies \u2014 our group of five loaded two trucks with rafts and supplies and headed the nearly 1,000 miles north from Portland, Ore.My one previous trip to the Bulkley, in 2001, had been a disaster. Heavy rain had transformed the river\u2019s generally clear waters into chocolate milk, rendering it almost unfishable. Rivers going out of shape is a constant threat in this wet part of the world. My companion and I hooked two steelhead that week.There was little rain in the forecast for 2018\u2019s mid-September week \u2014 prime time for fish returns \u2014 and we were heartened to arrive at the Walcott bridge boat launch on Day 1 to find clear water.Over the next five days, we floated four different sections of the Bulkley/Morice, rising before dawn and returning to our domicile after dark. We ran our own shuttles, leaving one vehicle at the takeout point so we could return to retrieve the second truck from the put-in. Then we returned to the takeout to retrieve our rafts.One starting point on the Morice lacked a formal boat launch, requiring us to carry our rafts down a steep bank to the river \u2014 no small feat for our aging crew. (This was a buddy\u2019s 60th birthday celebration.) Fishing was difficult, thanks to colder than usual water temperatures, but we slowly cracked the code. On the last two days, Marcus and I each hooked nine fish, a season\u2019s worth of fish on our home rivers.On the long ride home, we contacted the owner of the Telkwa house about its availability in 2019. The Bulkley excursion may become an annual pilgrimage.Advertisement"}

Start with \u201cI notice,\u201d then \u201cI wonder,\u201d and end with \u201cThe story this map is telling is \u2026.\u201d and a catchy headline.__________________Updated: November 15, 2018Though most Thanksgiving travel is by car, in 2017 about 4 million flew during Thanksgiving week. This week\u2019s graph is a directed graph (see Stat Nuggets for full explanation) of this surge in passenger demand during this one week. It is based on 2015 search data from Google Flights.Planeloads of people are leaving Boston, Washington, and Atlanta. Why are so many passengers fleeing these cities? And, planeloads are going to Miami, Orlando, and Las Vegas. But, wait, these are warm vacation destinations. Are passengers getting together with family for Thanksgiving or is something else going on here?Many students noticed that there were many passengers leaving Boston, New York and Washington, major employment centers with many university students. And, many students noticed Miami, Orlando, and Las Vegas were popular destinations. These are cities that are warm and have tourist attractions. Maybe people are going there for a vacation, but maybe they are also joining family there for their Thanksgiving dinner. Finally, there is a big increase in traffic in Atlanta, both going and coming. What do you think is causing this?Two headlines that hit two different angles on the graph were from Brooklyn. Liana\u2019s \u201cFly to Your Turkey\u201d and Jett\u2019s \u201cAway From the Cold, Towards the Attractions!\u201d Challenge: Come up a headline that combines these main ideas. Good noticing and wondering leads to snappy headlines.Here are some questions you may want to think about critically.\u2022 Notice which cities have the biggest increase in passengers as an origin and which cities as a destination. Is there any overlap in the lists? What characteristics do each of these subgroups have?\u2022 What do you notice about distance traveled for these origin-destination pairs?\u2022 Notice that the lines to and from Los Angeles are very thin. I wonder why this is so for such a large city. Can you explain this?\u2022 The demand for air travel is calculated per capita. (See Stat Nuggets.) What does it mean to have the same increase, say 10 percent, in air travel demand for large versus small cities?\u2022 If you can find your nearest airport on the graph, where are your \u201cneighbors\u201d flying for Thanksgiving? Explain whether that makes sense to you.Thank you for participating in \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d, which is intended to help you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data.

Have a happy and healthy Thanksgiving.________Stat Nuggets for \u201cPumpkin Pie in Miami: Thanksgiving Flight Patterns\u201dDIRECTED GRAPHA directed graph (or digraph) shows the relationship between pairs of objects. The objects are shown as vertices (points). A pair is connected with a directed edge (arrow), which is \u201cone-sided\u201d like on a one-way street sign.In the Thanksgiving passenger graph, the directed graph shows the increase in traffic for Thanksgiving between flight origins and destinations, which are the vertices. There is no arrow to show direction, but the edge\u2019s origin is red and the destination is blue. The width of the edge indicates the increase in Thanksgiving air travel as adjusted by the combined origin and destination population.QUANTITATIVE & CATEGORICAL VARIABLESQuantitative variables have numbers as possible values. They have units and can be ordered. Categorical (also called qualitative) variables, like favorite color, have possible values that are not numbers.In the Thanksgiving passenger graph, there is one quantitative variable (increase in number of people flying as represented by width of the edge), and one categorical variable (origin-destination combination, with order specified by red as origin and blue as destination).ACTUAL VALUE vs. PER CAPITA VALUEAn actual value is the observed number of items in a group with some characteristic. The per capita value is the observed number of items divided by the population of the area of interest.In the Thanksgiving passenger graph, the actual increase in the number of passengers between each pair of origin and destination cities is adjusted by the combined populations of these two cities. This may change the ordering of cities compared to the ordering based on the increase in the number of passengers. For example, Atlanta and Chicago are about tied for the increase in number of passengers, but Atlanta\u2019s per capita increase in number of passengers is almost six times Chicago\u2019s per capita increase in number of passengers._________The graphs for \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

{"Headline": "Lean Out ", "Date": "2018-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerhaps it\u2019s only fair that, as women like Sheryl Sandberg rise to power, they pay the price for failure. But why is everyone so ready to forgive the man who really runs Facebook?Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Suddenly, everyone wants Sheryl Sandberg to lean out.Apologies for using that obvious turn of phrase to describe the precarious situation the chief operating officer of Facebook now finds herself in. But it works perfectly for Ms. Sandberg, the author of \u201cLean In,\u201d which made her very famous and helped burnish her reputation as a management wizard.To be clear, as the No. 2 in charge, Ms. Sandberg deserves much blame for the bad decisions at Facebook. But it\u2019s notable that she is under much more fire than Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive. While he underwent some scrutiny at Congressional hearings and in interviews, he has somehow managed to come off like a geek who has lost his way in the woods. Whatever blame he got has dissipated quickly.And this week, in news dropped on the day before Thanksgiving, Ms. Sandberg admitted she did know a thing or two about the hiring of the Definers, after previously saying that she did not.Whoops. And so now come the calls for her comeuppance, which have been growing louder. Ms. Sandberg is especially vulnerable because she has long been cast as the professional \u2014 who came from Google no less \u2014 in contrast to \u201cZuck,\u201d the founder, the dude whom no one thought had the people skills or altruistic motives to deal with these high stakes political decisions.And yet he is the one with the power at Facebook. He is its top executive, its visionary founder and, most of all, its controlling shareholder. Mr. Zuckerberg, if you want to use a comic-book reference here, is a combination of Wolverine and Deadpool with a little bit of zombie magic thrown in.Mr. Schrage, the one who actually made the bad call on the press strategy, is also somehow evading censure: He is now seen as the loyal guy who fell on his sword, while Ms. Sandberg looks more like the one who pushed him onto the blade.And that is one of the key lessons to learn here about the tech industry today: Everyone expects so little from the male leaders who are often seen as the fulcrum of the digital worlds they create, while the female leaders \u2014 who are not usually the inventors \u2014 are held to a tougher line.Ms. Sandberg, of course, has power over much of Facebook\u2019s business operations, advertising and also the critical communications and policy units. Perhaps it\u2019s only fair that, as women rise to power, they pay the price for failure.But what is more often true in tech is that men are seen as the key players, and women are just not seen as crucial to a company's success. That inequity has become a theme of a wide range of employment issues across Silicon Valley of late, including the phenomenon of \u201cunderleveling\u201d \u2014 hiring women and people of color at a lower level than they deserve.\u201cI, as a black woman at Google, came in with an undergraduate and master\u2019s degree from Stanford and three years\u2019 worth of experience working in the tech industry, and they chose to put me into an entry-level six-month contract position in recruiting,\u201d she said.She said Google managers insist that the company isn\u2019t diverse enough because of the \u201cpipeline problem.\u201d They say: \u201cWe need to go to more schools and teach them how to code. There\u2019s something wrong with these students and something wrong with the pipeline.\u201d But she argued there\u2019s a bigger problem at Google that has nothing to do with the pipeline. \u201cBlack women have the highest attrition rate. They\u2019re leaving Google at higher rates than any other group, all over the industry.\u201dShe and the other organizers blamed this on opportunities that were not offered as readily, on tougher hurdles to leap over, on pay that was consistently lower and, most of all, on a system that forgave the men for their mistakes, and did not forgive the women.That was underscored at Google by an astonishing $90 million payout to the top executive Andy Rubin when he left in a cloud of controversy.Ms. Parker, who now works at YouTube, described succinctly the issue of who really paid the price for his sins. At the walkout, she said she asked the crowd: \u201cWhere do you think Google got that $90 million they used to pay out Andy Rubin? They got it from every time you worked late. Every promotion you didn\u2019t get because they said there\u2019s not enough budget, you have to wait. It\u2019s from every contractor who came to work sick because they have no paid time off. These are conscious decisions that the company is making, and abusers are getting rich off of our hard work. It\u2019s just not fair, and they completely know what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThey completely do. Ms. Sandberg is hardly blameless, but notice that she is the one facing the real firing line and not Mr. Zuckerberg. Which is to say, no matter his responsibility, he is unkillable, unfireable and untouchable and no amount of leaning in by Ms. Sandberg or any other woman in tech is going to change that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Human Brain Is a Time Traveler", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "Looking to the future has always defined humanity. Will A.I. become the best crystal ball of all?Buckner\u2019s lab, run by the neuroscientists Marcus Raichle and Steven Petersen, was exploring what the new technology of PET scanning could show about the connection between language and memory in the human brain. The promise of the PET machine lay in how it measured blood flow to different parts of the brain, allowing researchers for the first time to see detailed neural activity, not just anatomy. In Buckner\u2019s study, the subjects were asked to recall words from a memorized list; by tracking where the brain was consuming the most energy during the task, Buckner and his colleagues hoped to understand which parts of the brain were engaged in that kind of memory.But there was a catch. Different regions of the brain vary widely in how much energy they consume no matter what the brain is doing; if you ask someone to do mental math while scanning her brain in a PET machine, you won\u2019t learn anything from that scan on its own, because the subtle changes that reflect the mental math task will be drowned out by the broader patterns of blood flow throughout the brain. To see the specific regions activated by a specific task, researchers needed a baseline comparison, a control.At first, this seemed simple enough: Put the subjects in the PET scanner, ask them to sit there and do nothing \u2014 what the researchers sometimes called a resting state \u2014 and then ask them to perform the task under study. The assumption was that by comparing the two images, the resting brain and the active brain, the researchers could discern which regions were consuming more energy while performing the task.But something went strangely wrong when Buckner scanned the resting states of their subjects. \u201cWhat happened is that we began putting people in scanners that can measure their brain activity,\u201d Buckner recalls now, \u201cand Mother Nature shouted back at us.\u201d When people were told to sit and do nothing, the PET scans showed a distinct surge of mental energy in some regions. The resting state turned out to be more active than the active state.The odd blast of activity during the resting state would be observed in dozens of other studies using a similar control structure during this period. To this first generation of scientists using PET scans, the active rest state was viewed, in Buckner\u2019s words, as \u201ca confound, as troublesome.\u201d A confound is an errant variable that prevents a scientist from doing a proper control study. It\u2019s noise, mere interference getting in the way of the signal that science is looking for. Buckner and his colleagues noted the strange activity in a paper submitted in 1993, but almost as an afterthought, or an apology.But that passing nod to the strangely active \u201cresting state\u201d turned out to be one of the first hints of what would become a revolution in our understanding of human intelligence. Not long after Buckner\u2019s paper was published, a brain scientist at the University of Iowa named Nancy Andreasen decided to invert the task/control structure that had dominated the early neuroimaging studies. Instead of battling the \u201ctroublesome\u201d resting state, Andreasen and her team would make it the focus of their study.Andreasen\u2019s background outside neuroscience might have helped her perceive the value lurking in the rest state, where her peers saw only trouble. As a professor of Renaissance literature, she published a scholarly appraisal of John Donne\u2019s \u201cconservative revolutionary\u201d poetics. After switching fields in her 30s, she eventually began exploring the mystery of creativity through the lens of brain imaging. \u201cAlthough neither a Freudian nor a psychoanalyst, I knew enough about human mental activity to quickly perceive what a foolish \u2018control task\u2019 rest was,\u201d she would later write. \u201cMost investigators made the convenient assumption that the brain would be blank or neutral during \u2018rest.\u2019 From introspection I knew that my own brain is often at its most active when I stretch out on a bed or sofa and close my eyes.\u201dAndreasen\u2019s study, the results of which were eventually published in The American Journal of Psychiatry in 1995, included a subtle dig at the way the existing community had demoted this state to a baseline control: She called this mode the REST state, for Random Episodic Silent Thought. The surge of activity that the PET scans revealed was not a confound, Andreasen argued. It was a clue. In our resting states, we do not rest. Left to its own devices, the human brain resorts to one of its most emblematic tricks, maybe one that helped make us human in the first place.It time-travels.As you walk, you remember the physical sense of unease in the room as your colleague ranted over the most meaningless offense. You imagine a meeting six months from now with a comparable eruption \u2014 only this time it\u2019s happening in front of your boss. A small wave of stress washes over you. Perhaps he\u2019s just not the right fit for the job, you think \u2014 which reminds you of the one time you fired an employee, five years ago. Your mind conjures the awkward intensity of that conversation, and then imagines how much more explosive a comparable conversation would be with your current employee. You feel a sensation close to physical fear as your mind runs through the scenario.In just a few minutes of mental wandering, you have made several distinct round trips from past to future: forward a week to the important meeting, forward a year or more to the house in the new neighborhood, backward five hours to today\u2019s meeting, forward six months, backward five years, forward a few weeks. You\u2019ve built chains of cause and effect connecting those different moments; you\u2019ve moved seamlessly from actual events to imagined ones. And as you\u2019ve navigated through time, your brain and body\u2019s emotional system has generated distinct responses to each situation, real and imagined. The whole sequence is a master class in temporal gymnastics. In these moments of unstructured thinking, our minds dart back and forth between past and future, like a film editor scrubbing through the frames of a movie.The sequence of thoughts does not feel, subjectively, like hard work. It does not seem to require mental effort; the scenarios just flow out of your mind. Because these imagined futures come so easily to us, we have long underestimated the significance of the skill. The PET scanner allowed us to appreciate, for the first time, just how complex this kind of cognitive time travel actually is.In her 1995 paper, Nancy Andreasen included two key observations that would grow in significance over the subsequent decades. When she interviewed the subjects afterward, they described their mental activity during the REST state as a kind of effortless shifting back and forth in time. \u201cThey think freely about a variety of things,\u201d Andreasen wrote, \u201cespecially events of the past few days or future activities of the current or next several days.\u201d Perhaps most intriguing, Andreasen noted that most of the REST activity took place in what are called the association cortices of the brain, the regions of the brain that are most pronounced in Homo sapiens compared with other primates and that are often the last to become fully operational as the human brain develops through adolescence and early adulthood. \u201cApparently, when the brain/mind thinks in a free and unencumbered fashion,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit uses its most human and complex parts.\u201dIn the years that followed Andreasen\u2019s pioneering work, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of studies and papers mapped out the network of brain activity that she first identified. In 2001, Randy Buckner\u2019s adviser at Washington University, Marcus Raichle, coined a new term for the phenomenon: the \u201cdefault-mode network,\u201d or just \u201cthe default network.\u201d The phrase stuck. Today, Google Scholar lists thousands of academic studies that have investigated the default network. \u201cIt looks to me like this is the most important discovery of cognitive neuroscience,\u201d says the University of Pennsylvania psychologist Martin Seligman. The seemingly trivial activity of mind-wandering is now believed to play a central role in the brain\u2019s \u201cdeep learning,\u201d the mind\u2019s sifting through past experiences, imagining future prospects and assessing them with emotional judgments: that flash of shame or pride or anxiety that each scenario elicits.A growing number of scholars, drawn from a wide swath of disciplines \u2014 neuroscience, philosophy, computer science \u2014 now argue that this aptitude for cognitive time travel, revealed by the discovery of the default network, may be the defining property of human intelligence. \u201cWhat best distinguishes our species,\u201d Seligman wrote in a Times Op-Ed with John Tierney, \u201cis an ability that scientists are just beginning to appreciate: We contemplate the future.\u201d He went on: \u201cA more apt name for our species would be Homo prospectus, because we thrive by considering our prospects. The power of prospection is what makes us wise.\u201dIt is unclear whether nonhuman animals have any real concept of the future at all. Some organisms display behavior that has long-term consequences, like a squirrel\u2019s burying a nut for winter, but those behaviors are all instinctive. The latest studies of animal cognition suggest that some primates and birds may carry out deliberate preparations for events that will occur in the near future. But making decisions based on future prospects on the scale of months or years \u2014 even something as simple as planning a gathering of the tribe a week from now \u2014 would be unimaginable even to our closest primate relatives. If the Homo prospectus theory is correct, those limited time-traveling skills explain an important piece of the technological gap that separates humans from all other species on the planet. It\u2019s a lot easier to invent a new tool if you can imagine a future where that tool might be useful. What gave flight to the human mind and all its inventiveness may not have been the usual culprits of our opposable thumbs or our gift for language. It may, instead, have been freeing our minds from the tyranny of the present.The capacity for prospection has been reflected in, and amplified by, many of the social and scientific revolutions that shaped human history. Agriculture itself would have been unimaginable without a working model of the future: predicting seasonal changes, visualizing the long-term improvements possible from domesticating crops. Banking and credit systems require minds capable of sacrificing present-tense value for the possibility of greater gains in the future. For vaccines to work, we needed patients willing to introduce a potential pathogen into their bodies for a lifetime of protection against disease. We are born with a singular gift for imagining the future, but we have been enhancing those gifts since the dawn of civilization. Today, new enhancements are on the horizon, in the form of machine-learning algorithms that already outperform humans at certain kinds of forecasts. As A.I. stands poised to augment our most essential human talent, we are faced with a curious question: How will the future be different if we get much better at predicting it?But machines have been soothsayers from the beginning. In 1900, sponge divers stranded after a storm in the Mediterranean discovered an underwater statuary on the shoals of the Greek island Antikythera. It turned out to be the wreck of a ship more than 2,000 years old. During the subsequent salvage operation, divers recovered the remnants of a puzzling clocklike contraption with precision-cut gears, annotated with cryptic symbols that were corroded beyond recognition. For years, the device lay unnoticed in a museum drawer, until a British historian named Derek de Solla Price rediscovered it in the early 1950s and began the laborious process of reconstructing it \u2014 an effort that scholars have continued into the 21st century. We now know that the device was capable of predicting the behavior of the sun, the moon and five of the planets. The device was so advanced that it could even predict, with meaningful accuracy, solar or lunar eclipses that wouldn\u2019t occur for decades.The Antikythera mechanism, as it has come to be known, is sometimes referred to as an ancient computer. The analogy is misleading: The underlying technology behind the device was much closer to a clock than a programmable computer. But at its essence, it was a prediction machine. A clock is there to tell you about the present. The mechanism was there to tell you about the future. That its creators went to such great lengths to predict eclipses seems telling: While some ancient societies did believe that eclipses harmed crops, knowing about them in advance wouldn\u2019t have been of much use. What seems far more useful is the sense of magic and wonder that such a prediction could provide, and the power that could be acquired as a result. Imagine standing in front of the masses and announcing that tomorrow the sun will transform for more than a minute into a fire-tinged black orb. Then imagine the awe when the prophecy comes true.Prediction machines have only multiplied since the days of the ancient Greeks. Where those original clockwork devices dealt with deterministic futures, like the motions of solar bodies, increasingly our time-traveling tools forecast probabilities and likelihoods, allowing us to imagine possible futures for more complex systems. In the late 1600s, thanks to improvements in public-health records and mathematical advances in statistics, the British astronomer Edmund Halley and the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens separately made the first rigorous estimates of average life expectancy. Around the same time, there was an explosion of insurance companies, their business made possible by this newfound ability to predict future risk. Initially, they focused on the commercial risk of new shipping ventures, but eventually insurance would come to offer protection against just about every future threat imaginable: fire, floods, disease. In the 20th century, randomized, controlled trials allowed us to predict the future effects of medical interventions, finally separating out the genuine cures from the snake oil. In the digital age, spreadsheet software took accounting tools that were originally designed to record the past activity of a business and transformed them into tools for projecting out forecasts, letting us click through alternate financial scenarios in much the way our minds wander through various possible futures.But cognitive time travel has been enhanced by more than just science and technology. The invention of storytelling itself can be seen as a kind of augmentation of the default network\u2019s gift for time travel. Stories do not just allow us to conjure imaginary worlds; they also free us from being mired in linear time. Analepsis and prolepsis \u2014 flashbacks and flash-forwards \u2014 constitute some of the oldest literary devices in the canon, deployed in ancient narratives like the \u201cOdyssey\u201d and the \u201cArabian Nights.\u201d Time machines have obviously proliferated in the content of sci-fi narratives since \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d was published, but time travel has also infiltrated the form of modern storytelling. A defining trick of recent popular narrative is the contorted timeline, with movies and TV shows embracing temporal schemes that would have baffled mainstream audiences just a few decades ago. The epic, often inscrutable plot of the TV show \u201cLost\u201d veered among past, present and future with a reckless glee. The blockbuster 2016 movie \u201cArrival\u201d featured a bewildering time scheme that skipped forward more than 50 times to future events, while intimating throughout that they were actually occurring in the past. The current hit series \u201cThis Is Us\u201d reinvented the family-soap-opera genre by structuring each episode as a series of time-jumps, sometimes spanning more than 50 years. The final five minutes of the Season 3 opener, which aired earlier this fall, jump back and forth seven times among 1974, 2018 and some unspecified future that looks to be about 2028.These narrative developments suggest an intriguing possibility: that popular entertainment is training our minds to get better at cognitive time travel. If you borrowed Wells\u2019s time machine and jumped back to 1955, then asked typical viewers of \u201cGunsmoke\u201d and \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d to watch \u201cArrival\u201d or \u201cLost,\u201d they would have found the temporal high jinks deeply disorienting. Back then, even a single flashback required extra hand-holding \u2014 remember the rippling screen? \u2014 to signify the temporal leap. Only experimental narratives dared challenge the audience with more complex time schemes. Today\u2019s popular narratives zip around their fictional timelines with the speed of the default network itself.In a way, those advances are already around us, but in the form of software, not pharmaceuticals. If you have ever found yourself mentally running through alternate possibilities for a coming outing \u2014 what happens if it rains? \u2014 based on a 10-day weather forecast, your prospective powers have been enhanced by the time-traveling skills of climate supercomputers that churn through billions of alternative atmospheric scenarios, drawn from the past and projecting out into the future. These visualizations are giving you, for the first time in human history, better-than-random predictions about what the weather will be like in a week\u2019s time. Or say that dream neighborhood you\u2019re thinking about moving to \u2014 the one you can finally afford if you manage to get that raise \u2014 happens to sit in a flood zone, and you think about what it might be like to live through a significant flood event 10 years from now, as the climate becomes increasingly unpredictable. That you\u2019re even contemplating that possibility is almost entirely thanks to the long-term simulations of climate supercomputers, metabolizing the planet\u2019s deep past into its distant future.Accurate weather forecasting is merely one early triumph of software-based time travel: algorithms that allow us to peer into the future in ways that were impossible just a few decades ago, what a new book by a trio of University of Toronto economists calls \u201cprediction machines.\u201d In machine-learning systems, algorithms can be trained to generate remarkably accurate predictions of future events by combing through vast repositories of data from past events. An algorithm might be trained to predict future mortgage defaults by analyzing thousands of home purchases and the financial profiles of the buyers, testing its hypotheses by tracking which of those buyers ultimately defaulted. A result of that training would not be an infallible prediction, of course, but something similar to the predictions we rely on with weather forecasts: a range of probabilities. That time-traveling exercise, in which you imagine buying a house in the neighborhood with the great schools, could be augmented by a software prediction as well: The algorithm might warn you that there was a 20 percent chance that your home purchase would end catastrophically, because of a market crash or a hurricane. Or another algorithm, trained on a different data set, might suggest other neighborhoods where home values are also likely to increase.These algorithms can help correct a critical flaw in the default network: Human beings are famously bad at thinking probabilistically. The pioneering cognitive psychologist Amos Tversky once joked that where probability is concerned, humans have three default settings: \u201cgonna happen,\u201d \u201cnot gonna happen\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d We are brilliant at floating imagined scenarios and evaluating how they might make us feel, were they to happen. But distinguishing between a 20 percent chance of something happening and a 40 percent chance doesn\u2019t come naturally to us. Algorithms can help us compensate for that cognitive blind spot.Machine-learning systems will also be immensely helpful when mulling decisions that potentially involve a large number of distinct options. Humans are remarkably adept at building imagined futures for a few competing timelines simultaneously: the one in which you take the new job, the one in which you turn it down. But our minds run up against a computational ceiling when they need to track dozens or hundreds of future trajectories. The prediction machines of A.I. do not have that limitation, which will make them tantalizingly adept at assisting with some meaningful subset of important life decisions in which there is rich training data and a high number of alternate futures to analyze.Choosing where to go to college \u2014 a decision almost no human being had to make 200 years ago that more than a third of the planet now does \u2014 happens to be a decision that resides squarely in the machine-learning sweet spot. There are more than 5,000 colleges and universities in the United States. A great majority of them are obviously inappropriate for any individual candidate. But no matter where you are on the ladder of academic achievement \u2014 and economic privilege \u2014 there are undoubtedly more than a few dozen candidate colleges that might well lead to interesting outcomes for you. You can visit a handful of them, and listen to the wisdom of your advisers, and consult the college experts online or in their handbooks. But the algorithm would be scanning a much larger set of options: looking at data from millions of applications, college transcripts, dropout rates, all the information that can be gleaned from the social-media presence of college students (which is, today, just about everything). It would also scan a parallel data set that the typical college adviser rarely emphasizes: successful career paths that bypassed college. From that training set it could generate dozens of separate predictions for promising colleges, optimized to whatever rough goals the applicant defined: self-reported long-term happiness, financial security, social-justice impact, fame, health. To be clear, that data will be abused, sold off to advertisers or stolen by cyberthieves; it will generate a thousand appropriately angry op-eds. But it will also most likely work on some basic level, to the best that we\u2019ll be able to measure. Some people will swear by it; others will renounce it. Either way, it\u2019s coming.In late 2017, the Crime Lab at the University of Chicago announced a new collaboration with the Chicago Police Department to build a machine-learning-based \u201cofficer support system,\u201d designed specifically to predict which officers are likely to have an \u201cadverse incident\u201d on the job. The algorithm sifts through the prodigious repository of data generated by every cop on the beat in Chicago: arrest reports, gun confiscations, public complaints, supervisor reprimands and more. The algorithm uses archived data \u2014 coupled with actual cases of adverse incidents, like the shooting of an unarmed citizen or other excessive uses of force \u2014 as a training set, enabling it to detect patterns of information that can predict future problems.No matter how careful the Chicago P.D. is in deploying this particular technology, we shouldn\u2019t sugarcoat the broader implications here: It seems inevitable that people will be fired thanks to the predictive insights of machine-learning algorithms, and something about that prospect is intuitively disturbing to many of us. Yet we\u2019re already making consequential decisions about people \u2014 whom to hire, whom to fire, whom to listen to, whom to ignore \u2014 based on human biases that we know to be at best unreliable, at worst prejudiced. If it seems creepy to imagine that we would make them based on data-analyzing algorithms, the decision-making status quo, relying on our meanest instincts, may well be far creepier.Whether you find the idea of augmenting the default network thrilling or terrifying, one thing should be clear: These tools are headed our way. In the coming decade, many of us will draw on the forecasts of machine learning to help us muddle through all kinds of life decisions: career changes, financial planning, hiring choices. These enhancements could well turn out to be the next leap forward in the evolution of Homo prospectus, allowing us to see into the future with more acuity \u2014 and with a more nuanced sense of probability \u2014 than we can do on our own. But even in that optimistic situation, the power embedded in these new algorithms will be extraordinary, which is why Ludwig and many other members of the A.I. community have begun arguing for the creation of open-source algorithms, not unlike the open protocols of the original internet and World Wide Web. Drawing on predictive algorithms to shape important personal or civic decisions will be challenging enough without the process\u2019s potentially being compromised or subtly redirected by the dictates of advertisers. If you thought Russian troll farms were dangerous in our social-media feeds, imagine what will happen when they infiltrate our daydreams.According to Marcus Raichle at Washington University, it may not be too late to repair whatever damage we may have done to our prospective powers. A few early studies suggest that the neurons implicated in the default network have genetic profiles that are often associated with long-term brain plasticity, that most treasured of neural attributes. \u201cThe brain\u2019s default-mode network appears to preserve the capacity for plasticity into adulthood,\u201d he told me. Plasticity, of course, is just another way of saying that the network can learn new tricks. If these new studies pan out, our mind-wandering skills will not have been locked into place in our childhood. We can get better at daydreaming, if we give ourselves the time to do it.What will happen to our own time-traveling powers as we come to rely more on the prediction machines of A.I.? The outcome may be terrifying, or liberating, or some strange hybrid of the two. Right now it seems inevitable that A.I. will transform our prospective powers in meaningful new ways, for better or for worse. But it would be nice to think that all the technology that helped us understand the default network in the first place also ended up pushing us back to our roots: giving our minds more time to wander, to slip the surly bonds of now, to be out of the moment.Steven Johnson\u2019s most recent book is \u201cFarsighted: How We Make the Decisions That Matter the Most.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Don\u2019t Need to Go to the Dark Web to Find Hateful Conspiracy Theories", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorYou don\u2019t have to go deep into the internet to find the baseless conspiracies that provided a backdrop for mass murder in Pittsburgh and the recent pipe-bomb mailings to Barack Obama, the Clintons, George Soros and CNN. They are served up in plain sight, for profit, at airport bookstores, at movie-theater chains and on cable television.They come by way of publishing houses like Hachette and Penguin Random House; film distributors like Universal Home Studios and Lionsgate; theater chains like AMC and Cinemark; and 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News.Those companies have all helped feed a segment of the media business that should be called what it is \u2014 the Incitement Industry.It rakes in profits by serving up agitprop that targets liberals, Democrats and \u201cdeep state\u201d operatives who are said to be plotting to destroy America for the benefit of darker-skinned migrants or a shadowy consortium of elites.You can see this kind of thing in the pages of \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals\u201d by the Fox News opinion host Jeanine Pirro. Published in July by Center Street, a division of the Hachette Book Group, Ms. Pirro\u2019s book lays out \u201cthe globalist, open-border oligarchy\u201d that, the author asserts, is seeking to nullify the results of the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe perpetrators of this anti-American plot include, but are not limited to, the leadership at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., N.S.A. and other intelligence agencies, the Democratic Party and perhaps even the FISA courts,\u201d she writes.Another recent best seller in the same vein, \u201cResistance Is Futile!\u201d by the conservative provocateur Ann Coulter, was published by Sentinel, an imprint of the publishing giant Penguin Random House. It argues that the \u201cresistance\u201d that sprang up in the wake of President Trump\u2019s election is \u201cnothing less than a coup.\u201d And it lights into a conveniently vague villain \u2014 \u201cthe media\u201d \u2014 in a chapter titled \u201cFor Democracy to Live, We Must Kill the Media.\u201d\u201cThe media\u2019s position is that they\u2019re allowed to engage in lies, deception and even illegal acts to swing an election,\u201d Ms. Coulter writes.The film makes the case that the Nazi platform was similar to that of today\u2019s Democratic Party. Prominent among its villains is George Soros, who was allegedly sent a pipe bomb by Cesar Sayoc Jr., who also is accused of sending similar packages to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama.\u201cThe progressive Democrats are the true racists,\u201d the film\u2019s narrator intones. \u201cThey are the true fascists. They want to steal our income. They want to steal our earnings and our wealth and our freedom and our lives.\u201d\u201cDeath of a Nation\u201d will have a second life on the streaming platforms Amazon, iTunes and Google Play, as well as on DVD, sold at Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers. The distribution is being handled by Quality Flix and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.The hysteria led Bill Kristol, the conservative Republican who was once a regular on the Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox News, to tell Brian Stelter of CNN that it was time for Fox\u2019s owners and investors to take a hard look at the rhetoric spilling out of its news channel.(Representatives for Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, did not comment for this article.)But where is the line between falsehoods that may incite violence and good, old-fashioned American political hyperbole? And should book publishers and entertainment companies be more careful about the products they send out into the world in a tense sociopolitical atmosphere?\u201cI don\u2019t want some publisher telling me that something is beyond bounds,\u201d Mr. Kristol told me in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m a libertarian on points of view and even interpretations of history.\u201dBut after noting that conspiracy theories of recent vintage have whipped up fear and hatred, Mr. Kristol added, \u201cThere are things that normal fact-checking would rule out. It\u2019s not a matter of ideology; it\u2019s truth.\u201dI asked Hachette, the company behind \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals,\u201d whether Ms. Pirro\u2019s statement that Mr. Soros has \u201can agenda to destroy this country and the capitalist system\u201d had passed muster with the publisher\u2019s editors and fact-checkers. I got no answer.Sentinel, the division of Penguin Random House that published Ms. Coulter\u2019s recent best seller, was at least willing to engage. Its publisher, Adrian Zackheim, told me the author\u2019s views were \u201cexpressions of opinion.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s time to stop labeling her book \u201cnonfiction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Facebook Has Handled Recent Scandals", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylettersAn investigative piece about missteps by Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg led readers to discuss profits, privacy and the public interest.To the Editor:Perhaps we should add \u201cDestroy\u201d to the alliteration. Did we expect a generation of younger corporate owners and investors, having made their money so large and fast, to somehow live up to the values expressed in their TED Talking enthusiasms? For all their world-changing identification, they are reproducing the social destruction so perfected by their corporate elders \u2014 that is, to brand themselves as do-gooders while working feverishly to prevent policy changes that would restrict, in any way, their ability to mine profits from ventures that are in direct conflict with their acclaimed values.As long as corporate culture embraces growth through profit as the ultimate criterion for success, and our politicians take a share of the winnings as the price of their support, we will continue down this slide. Facebook, Google, Amazon \u2014 they are merely the most recent players in the big Monopoly game that is our financial culture, and I thank the journalists who have been tracking their double-dealing. At least we know who the players are in the game of destruction.To the Editor:Privacy in the digital world is an antiquated concept. The government\u2019s efforts to curb abuse are equally antiquated. No one is truly protecting us. Sadly, we all have culpability because we believe the illusion that free really is free and that the digital world makes life better without significant cost.To the Editor: To the Editor:I\u2019m speechless at the chicanery. Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg live in ivory towers. They played a big part in the current very dangerous erosion of American democracy and the rise of far-right extremism and got away with it for a while, blinded by their own giant egotism and financial success. But they forgot the oldest clich\u00e9 in the book, that power corrupts, and they apparently didn\u2019t read their history lesson on the rise and fall of corrupt individuals. Most of all, they obviously thought they were powerful enough that they didn\u2019t need to worry about journalists. The arrogance of that is beyond description. Ultimately nobody is above the law or beyond the reach of good investigative journalism. Bravo, New York Times!To the Editor:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Searching Social Media for Clues About Violent Crimes", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderTimes Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.In the last several weeks, my colleagues and I have reported on two suspects in high-profile crimes: Robert Bowers, the man accused of killing 11 people in a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and Cesar Sayoc Jr., who has been charged with sending explosives through the mail to prominent Democrats and news organizations. On Tuesday, a judge ordered Mr. Sayoc to be held without bail.In both cases, the social media accounts of the suspects were instrumental in determining possible motives for their alleged crimes. Mr. Sayoc\u2019s Twitter and Facebook accounts were filled with pro-Trump partisan content, right-wing conspiracy theories and violent threats \u2014 including some he made against Democrats who ultimately were sent explosives.Typically, the first step in investigating a breaking news situation playing out on social media is to save and screenshot everything you can find. Social networks often act quickly to remove the pages of named suspects in high-profile crimes. And if you want to study these accounts, you need the raw material.You also need to verify that the accounts actually belong to the suspect. In Mr. Sayoc\u2019s case, his accounts didn\u2019t match the name given out by law enforcement. On Twitter, he went by \u201cCesar Altieri.\u201d On Facebook, he went by \u201cCesar Altieri Randazzo.\u201d Verifying account ownership often takes a combination of conventional reporting (contacting the platforms, as well as law enforcement) and digital forensics. Often, it\u2019s hard to be 100 percent sure, but in the case of Mr. Sayoc, several clues \u2014 such as photos of decals posted to his Twitter account that matched the photos of his van \u2014 helped us feel confident enough to move forward.While I was verifying Mr. Sayoc\u2019s accounts, my colleagues helped me scrape their contents. My colleague Rich Harris built an automated tool that allows for the mass-archiving of tweets. It\u2019s incredibly useful, and allowed us to save thousands of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s tweets before they were taken down. I also took screenshots of the images that appeared on Mr. Sayoc\u2019s Facebook page, and another colleague, Paul Murray, helped me archive years\u2019 worth of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s Facebook posts.In Mr. Bowers\u2019s case, others first discovered his profile on Gab and, luckily, a few of them archived the contents on archive.is, a website that allows you to save a snapshot of a website at a given point in time. Someone also posted a video to Bitchute, a video-sharing site, that showed a person scrolling through Mr. Bowers\u2019s Gab feed before it was taken down. We used that video, plus the archived posts, to reconstruct as much of Mr. Bowers\u2019s feed as possible inside a Google doc, which we shared with the team reporting on the shooting.Sometimes, once you find one piece of a social media trail \u2014 say, a username or alias used on one website \u2014 you can use it to find other pieces. Other times, you hit a dead end. I have a small toolbox of apps and utilities I turn to in situations where I need to dig deeper into a given person\u2019s social media presence. But in this case, I didn\u2019t need to \u2014 there was more than enough information on each suspect\u2019s profiles to start reporting on them.In both cases, social media provided a trove of evidence.Social media will never give a full measure of a person\u2019s motivations. But as more people live more of their lives on Facebook, Twitter and other social networks, it\u2019s increasingly important to understand the contours of these networks, including the darker corners where violent behavior can take root.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook\u2019s Leaders Fought Through Crisis", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySheryl Sandberg was seething.But it wasn\u2019t the looming disaster at Facebook that angered Ms. Sandberg. It was the social network\u2019s security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.\u201cYou threw us under the bus!\u201d she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.The clash that day would set off a reckoning \u2014 for Mr. Zuckerberg, for Ms. Sandberg and for the business they had built together. In just over a decade, Facebook has connected more than 2.2 billion people, a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the way, Facebook accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that propelled the company into the Fortune 500.But as evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.When Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to President Trump, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.And when that failed \u2014 as the company\u2019s stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash \u2014 Facebook went on the attack.While Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms. Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook\u2019s reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.This account of how Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg navigated Facebook\u2019s cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.Facebook declined to make Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.\u201cThis has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\u201dEven so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook\u2019s conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of Facebook\u2019s data-hungry business model.\u201cWe failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u201d Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.His answer each time: a resounding \u201cNo.\u201dThree years ago, Mr. Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company\u2019s extraordinary success. Ms. Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, \u201cLean In,\u201d in 2013.But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them. Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.The question was unusual. Mr. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Ms. Sandberg\u2019s domain. In 2010, Ms. Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook\u2019s chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Ms. Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Ms. Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company\u2019s terms of service to see if the post, or Mr. Trump\u2019s account, violated Facebook\u2019s rules.Mr. Kaplan argued that Mr. Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.\u201cDon\u2019t poke the bear,\u201d Mr. Kaplan warned.Mr. Zuckerberg did not participate in the debate. Ms. Sandberg attended some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.Mr. Schrage concluded that Mr. Trump\u2019s language had not violated Facebook\u2019s rules and that the candidate\u2019s views had public value. \u201cWe were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,\u201d he said in an interview.In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement and account remained on the site. When Mr. Trump won election the next fall, giving Republicans control of the White House as well as Congress, Mr. Kaplan was empowered to plan accordingly. The company hired a former aide to Mr. Trump\u2019s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over internet companies.But inside Facebook, new troubles were brewing.In the final months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Mr. Stamos.Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Mr. Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.Mr. Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations. At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.Mr. Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize the extent of Russian activity on Facebook. In December 2016, after Mr. Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Stamos \u2014 alarmed that the company\u2019s chief executive seemed unaware of his team\u2019s findings \u2014 met with Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.Ms. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner.Still, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg decided to expand on Mr. Stamos\u2019s work, creating a group called Project P, for \u201cpropaganda,\u201d to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Mr. Stamos\u2019s original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.But Mr. Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by American intelligence agencies that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr. Trump.If Facebook implicated Russia further, Mr. Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians\u2019 fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr. Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.Ms. Sandberg\u2019s subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators\u2019 concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance. By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a \u201cfive-alarm fire,\u201d said a person familiar with the discussions.Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on Sept. 6, 2017, the day of the company\u2019s quarterly board meeting.After Mr. Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Ms. Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Mr. Zuckerberg also asked Mr. Stamos and Mr. Stretch to brief the board\u2019s audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.Mr. Stretch and Mr. Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.The disclosures set off Mr. Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company\u2019s headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Mr. Bowles pelted questions at Facebook\u2019s founder and second-in-command. Ms. Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Mr. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.The same month, Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites \u2014 a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Mr. Warner\u2019s former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Mr. Kaplan\u2019s team took a larger role in managing the company\u2019s Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.Ms. Sandberg also reached out to Ms. Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Ms. Sandberg\u2019s empowerment initiative. Ms. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s 2015 memoir, and the senator\u2019s chief of staff had previously worked at Ms. Sandberg\u2019s charitable foundation.But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Ms. Sandberg complained about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Ms. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation. But she dialed down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Ms. Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.A spokesman for Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook\u2019s lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \u201cFacebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\u201d he said.In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company. Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialized in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations \u2014 an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.Google and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was championed by Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota who had pummeled Facebook over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and senior commerce committee member who was a frequent critic of Facebook.Facebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.When the bill came to a vote in the House in February, Ms. Sandberg offered public support online, urging Congress to \u201cmake sure we pass meaningful and strong legislation to stop sex trafficking.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \u201cPrivacy to us is a human right. It\u2019s a civil liberty.\u201d (Mr. Cook\u2019s criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.)Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \u201cWe Get It,\u201d meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.Then Facebook went on the offensive. Mr. Kaplan prevailed on Ms. Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company\u2019s American lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Mr. Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook.The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company\u2019s political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients\u2019 enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.Mr. Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers\u2019 work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Mr. Cook\u2019s criticism upset Facebook.If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \u201cmuddy the waters,\u201d Mr. Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, Calif., bar last month.In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \u201cHere Together,\u201d to apologize to its users. Days before Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s good-will tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company\u2019s communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic \u2014 a suspicion confirmed by Facebook\u2019s pollsters.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s political instincts were no more well-tuned. During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.Mr. Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook\u2019s leader, Mr. Walden realized, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.Ms. Sandberg had said little publicly about the company\u2019s problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.Some colleagues believed that Ms. Sandberg \u2014 whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company \u2014 was protecting her own brand at Facebook\u2019s expense. At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Ms. Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.So Ms. Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company\u2019s Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Mr. Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its work force than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Ms. Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.Her top Republican target was Mr. Burr, whose Senate committee\u2019s Russia investigation had chugged along. The two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive, and met in person this fall. While critics cast Facebook as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.She made the same case in June at a conference of the National Association of Attorneys General in Portland, Ore. At the time, several attorneys general had opened or joined investigations into the company. Facebook was eager to head off further trouble.The company organized several private receptions, including what was billed as a conversation with Ms. Sandberg about \u201ccorporate citizenship in the digital age\u201d and a briefing on Cambridge Analytica.While Facebook had publicly declared itself ready for new federal regulations, Ms. Sandberg privately contended that the social network was already adopting the best reforms and policies available. Heavy-handed regulation, she warned, would only disadvantage smaller competitors.Some of the officials were skeptical. But Ms. Sandberg\u2019s presence \u2014 companies typically send lower-ranking executives to such gatherings \u2014 persuaded others that Facebook was serious about addressing its problems, according to two who attended the conference.In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.In July, organizers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organizers held aloft signs depicting Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.\u201cDepicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\u201d the organization wrote. \u201cProtest Facebook \u2014 or anyone \u2014 all you want, but pick a different image.\u201d The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \u201cextreme anti-Israel groups.\u201dFacebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \u201cmenace\u201d with \u201cneither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\u201dDefiners pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros\u2019s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros\u2019s son. (An official at Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support campaigns against Facebook.)Mr. Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook\u2019s New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.In July, as Facebook\u2019s troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, by then Facebook\u2019s most insistent inquisitor in Congress.Back off, he told Mr. Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Mr. Schumer\u2019s intervention. Mr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer\u2019s efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Mr. Schumer had not wanted Mr. Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook\u2019s Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.But Ms. Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 a pivotal encounter for her embattled company \u2014 and her aides were taking no chances.Inside the room, they labored to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialized in training corporate executives.Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Ms. Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Mr. Burr, who was determined to avoid a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labeled \u201cGoogle.\u201d Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Mr. Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive.Mr. Dorsey showed up. Mr. Page did not.As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook\u2019s rival.Ms. Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.In large letters were her stage directions: \u201cSlow, Pause, Determined.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Survive the Next Era of Tech (Slow Down and Be Mindful)", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIn his final State of the Art column, Farhad Manjoo reflects on the industry\u2019s changes and presents a new guide for navigating the future of technology.At the time, technology felt thrilling and world-changing. You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d \u2014 and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder. But tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things \u2014 every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps \u2014 that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.So to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.Now the time has come to amend and update that advice \u2014 which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I\u2019m not going far: I\u2019ll be writing for The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section starting next year.)How should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.Not long ago \u2014 in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn\u2019t work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?Something strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.But ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?But you don\u2019t have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too \u2014 and for a better, healthier tech industry, it\u2019s best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.Best of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry. There are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices \u2014 so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple\u2019s service but not from Spotify. But it\u2019s precisely this sort of mischief that I\u2019m hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.One reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.The lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.That\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.Are these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful. Go slow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Fall, Wiping Out Gains for 2018", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market\u2019s gains for 2018 were erased on Tuesday, as a sell-off led by giant technology stocks continued. The renewed declines in the United States came after drops in Asia and Europe.The pain persisted for such companies on Tuesday with Apple and Amazon falling by more than 4 percent in early trading. But a new area of concern also flared after the retailer Target reported third-quarter sales and profit that missed Wall Street expectations.The softness in retail shares reflects growing investor concern that the strong American economy \u2014 which has so far shrugged off Federal Reserve interest rate increases and signs of weakness in China and Europe \u2014 is likely to face increasing challenges in 2019, as the impact of federal tax cuts and spending increases diminishes.Also weighing on stocks was a slump in crude oil prices, which hit their lowest point this year after dropping as much as 7 percent on Tuesday.Monday\u2019s slide in the United States had already spilled over into Europe and Asia before trading on Wall Street opened on Tuesday. By the end of the trading day, the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of eurozone blue-chips, had dropped more than 1.4 percent.Concerns about privacy lapses and mismanagement at technology companies weighed on stocks on Monday, adding to broader concerns about the impact of a trade war between the United States and China as well as signs of slowing growth around the globe.The pessimism continued in the Chinese markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen as the worries that hurt technology stocks in the United States hit stocks in other parts of the world.In Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, trade concerns helped to push the stocks of Chinese semiconductor makers and other big technology companies into the red. A drop in the stock price of the chip maker Nvidia several days ago after disappointing earnings may also have rattled investors in chip makers across China. The Chinese stock market is down by more than 20 percent so far this year.Shares of Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate, fell 3.3 percent in Hong Kong trading. A broader index of large Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong dropped by 1.6 percent, while the Hong Kong market closed the day down 2 percent.\u201cStocks look weak,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for Asia Pacific at the Dutch bank ING, wrote in a note to investors. \u201cOversupply in the semiconductor industry is an issue for Asia, and made worse by an apparent lack of demand for some well-known producers of high-tech products,\u201d he added.In Seoul, South Korea, and Taipei, Taiwan, the markets finished the day down nearly 1 percent.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong, Amie Tsang from London and Matt Phillips from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marooned on \u2018Love Island\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveWhen a medical crisis asks a young woman to confront the messier aspects of love, she plunges into a reality TV version of romance.One of the greatest joys of my life is watching the British reality television program \u201cLove Island,\u201d a daily show in which six men and six women are placed in a luxury island villa, filmed constantly and encouraged to fall in love. The couple that wins the heart of the United Kingdom wins 50,000 British pounds. The concept is admittedly shallow and heteronormative, verging on dystopian.I did not miss an episode of \u201cLove Island\u201d during last summer\u2019s blistering heat wave, the summer my life turned upside down. It didn\u2019t matter how late I got home or how terrible I felt. When I was especially tired or lonely I often fell asleep watching it and, upon waking, would prod my laptop to life to see what I had missed \u2014 an easing out of one day and into the next, in the spaces I would have been chatting with my partner, Chris. That summer, the pillow where his head normally lay was empty.Within a week of seeing the first episode, I had ordered a personalized \u201cLove Island\u201d water bottle and began sharing knowing looks with others on the bus or subway when I drank from it. Our glances were a sort of communion.The symptoms had started in late autumn, but we brushed them off. We ate salads and stayed in more, partly because he was suffering a mysterious tiredness. It\u2019s easy to see signs in retrospect, the things that creep up on you.There were more concerning facts too, but you see what you want to see. So when the referrals started \u2014 a CT scan, an MRI, more appointments \u2014 I tried not to see anything right up until the moment the news broke: He had bowel cancer.It all happened within a month of the colonoscopy, which is not very long \u2014 half as long, in fact, as a season of \u201cLove Island.\u201d Within four short weeks of filming, most of the contestants pair up and start committed relationships, shyly moving their bodies in bedclothes under the gaze of the nighttime cameras.A month is long enough for your life to change. A day is enough. Ten minutes.Such a turn of phrase is characteristic of him, this man I love.\u201cI love you too,\u201d I said.On the bus home, I thought about how \u201cLove Island\u201d would be there for me, six hours a week for the next two months. It would mark almost exactly the period of his early recovery to whatever would come next.As the hospital days continued, I started to invest my energy in buying new furniture and assembling it alone in front of the contestants, whom I had started to think of passionately and protectively as friends, children even. Their vulnerability made me feel as if I knew them. I wept for them with genuine emotion that I was afraid to express any other way, because when I did I usually ended up lying on the carpet in our hall, hyperventilating.When a design flaw meant that a screw would not fit where it should in a shelving unit, I had to get resourceful. There was nobody to help me, and it was 1 a.m., the bodies of the contestants lithe and bikini-clad, their voices on a low volume so I wouldn\u2019t wake my neighbors.I broke down and cried for 10 minutes, and then I used a shoe to hammer it in. It was as if I were on an island too (my own personal \u201cLove Island\u201d!) with my water bottle and the small matters of survival that I had to solve in isolation, where I was marooned. But my life would have certainly been sad to observe, so I was glad that my new friends could not see the tragic person on the other side of the screen.It gave me comfort to see these love stories taking place outside of the dirty context of reality. May you never see the person you love with tubes running out of their body, I wished for them, these beautiful couples who were all years younger than me, though I considered myself young, and too young for what was happening.May you never know the terror of your future changing before your eyes, children and homes and plans evaporating. May your futures be symmetrical, adoring and sponsored as long as you live.And yet I was glad for them, too, and for the ability to revel in love stories with problems so distant from my own. There was no ugly crying in hospital bathrooms, checking the color of catheter bags or mopping up vomit. No mashed potato or custard spooned into mouths. Only potential and the golden days of new love.I remembered those days, but there was a different love in play for me now \u2014 a wiser one, for which I was unprepared and that I had assumed we would not be flung into for years, decades.He returned home before the end of the season. Though he had not watched any episodes, I had kept up a commentary with him about these strangers to whom I had grown so attached. We watched it, ceremonially. The love story of Jack and Dani, the eventual winners, had already established itself as one of the great romances of our time. Chris held my hand as I wept. The catharsis of crying over these people had been very beneficial to me, I explained.I remembered being a dizzying two weeks into our relationship and understood how quickly the contestants could fall for each other. I believed it was real because it had been real for us. All those years ago, taking a long walk on a winter beach, hair in our eyes and mouths and feeling a happiness so powerful I believed I might die if I didn\u2019t see it through.I believed in the radical possibility of love, the radical stupidity of it, of letting myself fall. I believed, too, in the maelstrom of emotional energy that my screen had been transmitting nightly, restoring my faith, or something like it. To see that even under the most cynical of circumstances, love would find a way through adversity.I am grateful for the slow restoration of normalcy, the new skin of it, even with the pink tenderness still underneath.We are a week away from the wounds on his stomach healing, the ileostomy reversed now, by which I mean the slides are back inside the water park. We cook and talk about the future, freshly aware that what can seem like the destruction of everything is sometimes just the beginning.Occasionally the best-case scenarios play out. Love flourishes in a place that seems hopeless. There is a new love story happening for us now. Day by day, month by month, we face uncertainty but are no longer marooned; we are in possession of a strange and hopeful beauty.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Google Walkout Was a Watershed Moment in Tech", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the artOutsiders have little leverage to force the industry to change. The companies\u2019 own workers are another matter.However Google responds, little at the internet search giant \u2014 and, perhaps, little in Silicon Valley \u2014 will be the same again.For two years, regulators, lawmakers, academics and the media have pushed Silicon Valley to alter its world-swallowing ways. But outsiders have few points of leverage in tech; there are few laws governing the industry\u2019s practices, and lawmakers have struggled to get up to speed on tech\u2019s implications for society. Protests by workers are an important new avenue for pressure; the very people who make these companies work can change what they do in the world. But the Google walkout suggests something bigger could be afoot. The walkout\u2019s organizers told me that they were aiming to keep that movement alive \u2014 to ask the most important questions about how their company operates in the world, and to inspire those in other parts of the tech industry to take up similar arms.\u201cSomething we\u2019ve discussed as a group, something we\u2019ve locked arms over, is that we\u2019re assembled now,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, a marketing manager at Google-owned YouTube who created the internal discussion forum in which organizers planned the walkout. \u201cWe have an incredibly engaged group of people, and we aren\u2019t going to stop escalating this,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe group isn\u2019t really going to back down from this or a host of other things. The walkout was not like a blowing-off-steam exercise.\u201dThe walkout was sparked by a specific grievance: a report in The New York Times that Google gave a $90 million exit payment to Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, after he was accused of coercing a woman to perform oral sex in a hotel room (a charge that he denies but that the company found credible). The organizers said their aims were far larger, though, than sexual harassment and abuse.\u201cOur discussions expanded very quickly,\u201d Ms. Stapleton said. \u201cWhat is it that we want the company to be, and what should we do with the power that we very quickly see we are harnessing? Is Google for good? Do we think that technology is toxic? Are we navigating through a host of complex issues online in a positive way?\u201dSpeaking to Ms. Stapleton and several of her fellow organizers, I was struck by their intoxicating optimism. They brimmed with confidence about their capacity to push for a new moral, ethical and social framework in tech. And because Google\u2019s culture is a model for the industry and much of corporate America, they saw the idea of changing the company as part of a larger social and political struggle to make a dent in the universe.\u201cI think what we did was disprove the myth that it\u2019s too hard to take collective action,\u201d said Celie O\u2019Neil-Hart, who works in YouTube\u2019s marketing department. She described the meticulous way that she and other organizers of the walkout distilled the thousands of discussions flowing through their group into a list of demands. Their secret? Google\u2019s own technology.\u201cI was getting hundreds of pieces of feedback on these demands, but ironically thanks to Google\u2019s products, like Google Groups and Docs and comments, I was able to get this constant stream of real-time feedback from a collective group of hundreds of Googlers, all while doing my day job,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neil-Hart said. She noted, too, that many Googlers had been hired for their work-endless-hours drive; now that drive was marshaled in the service of a movement.Stephanie Parker, a policy specialist at YouTube, described organizing the protest in a way that sounded to me like designing and releasing a new Google product, only with a group that was more passionate and personally invested.\u201cIt was really fun to see my fellow employees flex the skills that a lot of them had developed at Google \u2014 their program management skills, their marketing skills, their P.R. skills, but in the service of this movement,\u201d she said.A lot about the walkout was particular to Google\u2019s culture, which has always encouraged a more open form of debate than many tech peers. Companies more consumed with secrecy \u2014 Facebook, for instance, or Amazon or Apple \u2014 may be less tolerant of a large number of employees who use their tech skills to go rogue.But such a prospect is not out of the question. Tech workers have endless options when it comes to employment; the tight labor market gives them greater leeway in voicing their concerns, and the promise that their voices are valued gives them an expectation that they can effect change.\u201cI didn\u2019t think this would happen, but it\u2019s amazing to see,\u201d said Ellen Pao, a venture capitalist who sued her former firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, for sexual harassment and now works at the nonprofit group Project Include. \u201cIt\u2019s another point of pressure \u2014 maybe the most powerful one yet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd until recently, there really hasn\u2019t been much pressure at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What is your tech setup while you\u2019re on the road?Lots of countries block or monitor certain sites, so I use VPNs, which route all traffic through an anonymous server in another country. And I tether my laptop to my phone so I can avoid sketchy Wi-Fi.In which country did you find the way people use technology the most surprising and why?I first went to Myanmar in early 2014, when the country was opening up, and there was no such thing as personal technology. Not even brick phones.People sometimes talk about this showing that Myanmar wasn\u2019t \u201cready\u201d to come online so rapidly. But it looked to me like the same distorting effect of social media I\u2019d seen in any other country. Maybe the change was just more obvious because it happened so rapidly and Myanmar was already pretty messed up.You\u2019ve lately been writing a lot about the effects of social media on the world. What have been some of your major takeaways?We think of any danger as coming from misuse \u2014 scammers, hackers, state-sponsored misinformation \u2014 but we\u2019re starting to understand the risks that come from these platforms working exactly as designed. Facebook, YouTube and others use algorithms to identify and promote content that will keep us engaged, which turns out to amplify some of our worst impulses.It made me think of the old \u201cTerminator\u201d movies, except instead of a killer robot sent to find Sarah Connor, it\u2019s a sophisticated set of programs ruthlessly pursuing our attention. And exploiting our most human frailties to do it.Facebook\u2019s terrorizing me into mourning a breakup hardly matters. But, for a lot of users, unhealthy-but-irresistible content can come in more consequential forms. Like a viral rumor or a statement of hate we might otherwise know to avoid.Where do you think this might all lead us?I spend a lot of my time asking people this. What is the aggregate effect of routing an ever-growing share of human social relations through engagement-maximizing algorithms?Maybe the effect is broadly negative. Maybe it\u2019s broadly positive. Probably it\u2019s mixed. But it is almost certainly profoundly disruptive in ways that we may spend the rest of our lives trying to understand.Whether they set out to or not, these companies are conducting the largest social re-engineering experiment in human history, and no one has the slightest clue what the consequences are.It\u2019s not that I fear some devastating privacy breach or misuse of my data. Rather, these platforms are incredibly sophisticated at learning our habits and keeping us engaged in ways that are not necessarily healthy for us or our communities. Most days, it\u2019s unhealthy only on the scale of a candy bar or secondhand smoke, but who needs it?Outside work, is there a gadget or software or some other tech tool that you or your family loves using? Why?I do a lot of cycling, for which the United Kingdom\u2019s rural quarters are a paradise, so my iPhone is stuffed with various weather and transit apps. Google Maps has mostly replaced the GPS gadgets and old-fashioned bicycle maps.Advertisement"}

Looking for hip-hop? You want Hollis, an incubator of rap music. Political pedigree? Go to Governor Cuomo\u2019s Holliswood or President Trump\u2019s Jamaica Estates. Big-box stores? Douglaston and Fresh Meadows have those.Hollis Hills claims no such distinctions. The placid community of about 1,500 single-family houses, built around the time of World War II, is best known for P.S. 188, one of New York City\u2019s top-rated public elementary schools.It was P.S. 188, also called the Kingsbury School, that attracted Vicky Zhang and Nelson Chen, who had been renting in Bayside. The couple focused their search in areas of Queens served by highly ranked public schools before zeroing in on Hollis Hills, which Mr. Chen, 47, an information technology consultant, said reminded him of the \u201cidyllic leafy neighborhood on Long Island where I grew up.\u201dQUEENSCLEARVIEW EXPWY.Hollis HillsBaysideSPRINGFIELD BLVD.LONG ISLAND EXPWY.FRANCIS LEWIS BLVD.OaklandGardensALLEY PONDParkBell Blvd.Long Island MOTOR PKWY.UNION TPKE.Chabad of Eastern QueensP.S. 188American Martyrs Roman Catholic ChurchHollis Hills BaysideJewish Center Hollis HillsGRAND CENTRAL PKWY.CUNNINGHAMParkQueens VillageJamaica Estates1/2 mileBy The New York TimesIn June, the couple closed on a brick-and-frame, three-bedroom colonial, a short walk from the school. They paid $957,500 and began a renovation that includes opening up the first floor.Mr. Chen said his family appreciates the quiet surroundings and the diversity of their neighbors: Christian and Jewish; Asian, Ecuadorean and Eastern European, among others. Most important, their son, a first-grader, was accepted into P.S. 188\u2019s gifted and talented program. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of homework, and he\u2019s not too happy about that,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cBut that\u2019s good. We wanted to give him a rigorous beginning.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re in the city, close to everything, but it\u2019s a beautiful suburban area\u00a0\u2014\u00a0where are you going to find so much green?\u201d said Mr. Halili, whose organization tends to the aesthetics by planting flowers in public spaces.After coming up short in five Hollis Hills bidding wars, Carin Bail and David Rosenfeld were determined to land a house in the neighborhood where Ms. Bail grew up and her parents still reside. In 2014, while living with their toddler son in a one-bedroom Bayside co-op, the couple bid over the asking price for a two-bedroom, side-hall colonial listed at $549,000. \u201cI wanted to live in Hollis Hills so freaking badly and decided, \u2018I\u2019m getting this house,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Bail, 41, a literacy specialist with the city schools.They paid $570,000. Now, with two children, Ms. Bail and Mr. Rosenfeld, 47, an occupational therapist, plan to build a third bedroom over the attached garage.With Hollis Hills near \u201cevery single highway\u201d \u2014 which is good for her husband, who drives to work in the Bronx \u2014 Ms. Bail cites location as an advantage. Indeed, residents tend to use their cars. The closest everyday shopping \u2014 supermarket, pharmacy, dry cleaner \u2014 is a neighborhood away, on 73rd Avenue in Oakland Gardens.\u201cIt would be cool if Hollis Hills had more conveniences, like a busy Astoria,\u201d Ms. Bail said. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s nice not having all that stuff.\u201dWedged between Cunningham and Alley Pond parks, in an elevated portion of Queens shaped by retreating glaciers, Hollis Hills is bounded by the Clearview Expressway to the west, Grand Central Parkway to the south and Springfield Boulevard to the east. Woods provide a buffer against the highways, and a forested path that was part of the old Long Island Motor Parkway forms the community\u2019s northern border.Union Turnpike, the main drag, creates a postal division. Homes to the south \u2014 the majority of those in the neighborhood \u2014 are in Queens Village\u2019s 11427 ZIP code. Those on the north side are in Oakland Gardens\u2019s 11364.The housing stock includes primarily colonial, ranch and Cape Cod-style houses on 40- to 50-foot lots. But in recent years, scores of homes have been expanded or replaced by new construction.\u201cEvery single house I sell in Hollis Hills, the buyer does something to \u2014 knock it down completely, gut it, extend it,\u201d said Irene Gringuz, a saleswoman with Daniel Gale Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and a Hollis Hills resident. \u201cThe old-timers grumble, but I tell them, \u2018All this construction around you, that\u2019s the reason your home has such a high value.\u2019\u201dWhile smaller houses needing renovation are sometimes listed in the high $800,000s, prices generally start in the $900,000s, said Julia Shildkret, owner of the Julia Shildkret Real Estate Group, in Fresh Meadows. But \u201cwe haven\u2019t yet seen a selling price of $2 million,\u201d she added, a level eclipsed in Holliswood and Jamaica Estates, where properties are larger.Through the first nine months of 2018, the median sales price was $940,000, up from $878,000 a year earlier, according to the listing service.Except for a library branch, six houses of worship and two small commercial clusters along Union Turnpike \u2014 one anchored by a Greek restaurant, the other by an Italian restaurant \u2014 Hollis Hills has few amenities. Mr. Halili, of the Civic Association, said he hopes to raise money to build a playground, as many newcomers are families with small children.Even without a playground or ball field, residents have opportunities to gather. Block parties, wine socials and Christmas tree and menorah lightings are among the events sponsored by the Civic Association.Many students go on to M.S. 172 on 257th Street in Floral Park, which has close to 1,000 students in sixth through eighth grade. On state tests, 70 percent met or exceeded standards in reading and 57 percent in math, versus 44 and 36 percent citywide.The nearest public high school is Martin Van Buren, on Hillside Avenue in Queens Village, but most Hollis Hills students attend other public or private high schools throughout the city.The QM6 and QM36 express buses to Midtown Manhattan pick up passengers on Union Turnpike. Alternatively, commuters can take the Q46 bus to the Union Turnpike-Kew Gardens subway station and grab an E or F train. Another option is driving to the Bayside station of the Long Island Rail Road for a train to Pennsylvania Station. The ride takes about a half-hour; the fare is $10.25 during peak hours, or $226 monthly.Decades before the Long Island Expressway existed, there was the Long Island Motor Parkway, 45 bucolic miles of concrete between Queens and Ronkonkoma. Developed in 1908 by the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt\u2019s great-grandson, the private toll road was the nation\u2019s first thoroughfare built specifically for automobiles, and was used for 30 years. Prominent remnants in Hollis Hills include the walking and biking path maintained by the city parks department, and bridges over Hollis Hills Terrace and Springfield Boulevard.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Founder\u2019s Big Idea to Revive BuzzFeed\u2019s Fortunes? A Merger With Rivals", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "Supported byBut efforts to re-establish its fortunes have already begun. The company expects to surpass $300 million in revenue this year, the three people said. To get there, BuzzFeed now sells cookware at Walmart and accepts banner ads on its web pages. It runs a morning show on Twitter, a weekly one on Facebook and another on Netflix, all of which are paid for by the platforms. Its newsroom and its entertainment studio churn out thousands of videos and articles each week, to an audience of 690 million people every month. The company also gets a commission when a reader buys a product on Amazon or other commerce sites after clicking through from one of BuzzFeed\u2019s recommended product links, known as affiliate marketing. And on Monday, BuzzFeed News announced a membership model that provides exclusive access to newsletters and behind-the-scenes content for $5 a month. A $100 donation gets you a tote bag. (BuzzFeed\u2019s website will remain free.)\u201cYou have Vice and Vox Media and Group Nine and Refinery,\u201d Mr. Peretti said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of them that are doing interesting work.\u201d He extolled the logic of combining forces: A larger entity could lobby for a higher percentage of the ad dollars Facebook and Google share with publishers whenever their content, videos in particular, runs on the platforms. In turn, publishers can supply them with content that is safe for users and friendlier for advertisers.\u201cHaving some bigger companies that actually care about the quality of the content feels like something that\u2019s very valuable,\u201d he said. Though initial discussions involving a few companies have taken place, they were all very preliminary, according to five people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. BuzzFeed has spoken to at least one other company, while other publishers have had separate discussions, these people said. Mr. Peretti declined to name which companies he has talked to regarding any potential mergers. Any deal would be difficult to pull off given the number of investors involved and the compounding losses that would result from combining several money-losing start-ups. Staff cuts would be inevitable.Still, publishers have been getting squeezed by the tech platforms as online advertising rates continue to level off. \u201cIf BuzzFeed and five of the other biggest companies were combined into a bigger digital media company, you would probably be able to get paid more money,\u201d he said. A natural camaraderie exists among the digital publishers, which could make a potential partnership more palatable, said Benjamin Lerer, the chief executive of Group Nine. \u201cI don\u2019t believe my competition is BuzzFeed or Vox or Vice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe compete on a day-to-day basis for business, but the ultimate competition here is us against traditional TV and also protecting ourselves against the big platforms.\u201dMr. Lerer and Mr. Peretti have been friends for over a decade, and Mr. Lerer\u2019s father, the venture capitalist Kenneth Lerer, is the chairman of BuzzFeed. He also sits on the board of Group Nine. But the younger Mr. Lerer stressed that any business deal between the two would not include his father to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201cConsolidation in digital media is something that is going to happen,\u201d he added.Money for a merger wouldn\u2019t be an issue, according to Mr. Peretti. The sticking points would center on who would run a combined entity as well as how each business would be valued in a merger. The combined valuation of the companies Mr. Peretti mentioned exceeds $7 billion.Other publishing executives acknowledged the seeming inevitability of consolidation. \u201cWe\u2019ll always consider ways to better serve our audiences and strategically grow our business through building, partnering and acquisition,\u201d said Jim Bankoff, the chief executive of Vox Media. Philippe von Borries, a co-chief executive of Refinery29, said that in the next year or so there might be \u201can opportunity for the leading media and entertainment companies that emerged over the past decade to come together,\u201d provided all parties could settle on a shared culture and vision.Vice Media did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Peretti, 44, started BuzzFeed in 2006 as a kind of experimental project while working at The Huffington Post, an early giant of web publishing that he founded with Arianna Huffington and Kenneth Lerer. In many ways it was a return to his first media obsession: what makes something go viral. In 2001, while a graduate student at the M.I.T. Media Lab, Mr. Peretti got in a heated email exchange with customer service representatives at Nike. The company allowed buyers to customize their shoes with a word or phrase. Mr. Peretti chose \u201csweatshop.\u201dThe request was denied. Mr. Peretti insisted \u201csweatshop\u201d had not violated Nike\u2019s criteria, but the company wouldn\u2019t fulfill his order. He forwarded the email thread to several friends who sent it on to several others. It eventually reached millions of people. Mr. Peretti ended up appearing on the \u201cToday\u201d show debating labor issues with a Nike executive.The story has become the stuff of internet lore, but it also represents the heart of BuzzFeed. The early chat bot became a website, which led to original content and then the formation of a newsroom, which now boasts a huge monthly audience.As BuzzFeed\u2019s audience has grown, so has the diversity of its content. Hard-hitting investigative journalism lives alongside listicles, quizzes and cooking videos.\u201cBuzzFeed has always been very experimental,\u201d he said. The ethos that led to its viral content and mining of memes to explain the day\u2019s news is now being applied on the business side, he said, \u201cto consider commerce and advertising and even donations.\u201dThe company is positioning its membership model as a way of supporting its journalism, despite being a for-profit company. BuzzFeed had experimented this year by soliciting donations from readers for its news division. The high level of interest spurred the creation of memberships, which sound similar to fund-raising drives by nonprofits like PBS.Last year, native advertising slowed down considerably, so BuzzFeed started accepting banner ads. After President Trump was elected, a lot of brands didn\u2019t know what they wanted to say, Mr. Peretti said.\u201cSome of them got scared to say anything because everything seemed polarized,\u201d he said. That prompted the move to accept traditional ad formats.This year, BuzzFeed started selling cookware based on the popularity of its Tasty cooking videos. The company licensed the name to a manufacturer that sells the branded pots and pans at Walmart, a deal worth more than $20 million to BuzzFeed, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Making sure the business can thrive is important to Mr. Peretti, even if it comes in the form of bakeware and banner ads.At a staff meeting in Los Angeles a few years ago, someone asked Mr. Peretti what he would do if he won the lottery.He responded: \u201cI already won the lottery when we sold HuffPost to AOL. After that, I went out and bought a Honda Odyssey.\u201dMr. Peretti acknowledges the anecdote but said it shouldn\u2019t be characterized to mean he doesn\u2019t care about money, or its importance to BuzzFeed.\u201cA company that doesn\u2019t generate money isn\u2019t a company that gets to do very much,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a business standpoint, money is a means to an end.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He eventually (spoiler alert) acquires a taste, thanks in part to the urgings of his white counterpart.The crispy poultry motif figures heavily in the \u201cGreen Book\u201d trailers, conceivably as a warning. Every suspicion you might entertain \u2014 that this will be a sentimental tale of prejudices overcome and common humanity affirmed; that its politics will be as gently middle-of-the-road as its humor; that it will invite a measure of self-congratulation about how far we, as a nation, have come \u2014 will be confirmed.If you want to get scholarly about it, you could stretch the tradition even further, following literary critics like Leslie Fiedler and D.H. Lawrence and seeing Tony and Don as manifestations of a primal American archetype. Huck and Jim. Ishmael and Queequeg. Natty and Chingachgook \u2014 bonded cross-cultural pairs that symbolically redeem America of its original racial sin.\u201cGreen Book,\u201d written and directed by Peter Farrelly (of the once notoriously naughty Farrelly Brothers), is based on a true story. Tony Lip and Don Shirley were real people, and the movie grounds their journey to the South in piquant historical details. The book referenced in the title was a guide used by black motorists to help them avoid the dangers and indignities of road travel, especially below the Mason-Dixon line. Don\u2019s record company, having booked him on a tour through several southern states, hires Tony to serve as a de facto bodyguard as well as a chauffeur.He also becomes, inevitably, a kind of white savior, intervening to shield his employer, when he can, from white people who have no such obligation. The hypocrisies of segregation are laid out \u2014 Don is celebrated as an artist and denied service at hotels and restaurants \u2014 as are the brutal and insidious manifestations of white supremacy.The real drama, and also the comedy, is between the two men. The contrast of their temperaments is not subtle. Don, highly accomplished and educated \u2014 he\u2019s \u201cDr. Shirley\u201d to most, \u201cDoc\u201d to Tony \u2014 is formal and fastidious, an aesthete and an intellectual with no patience for vulgarity or sloppiness. He\u2019s also gay, though this fact is handled with a discretion that borders on squeamishness. Tony is a caricature of Italian-American family-man exuberance. He\u2019s voluble and emotional and constantly smoking, eating, or both at the same time. At one point, reclining in a hotel-room bed, he folds a pizza in half and shoves it in his mouth. Not a slice of pizza. The whole pie.His warm, earthy authenticity has a salutary effect on Don, whose hauteur masks a deep loneliness. In return, Don refines Tony\u2019s taste and dissolves his prejudices. As I said, there\u2019s not much here you haven\u2019t seen before, and very little that can\u2019t be described as crude, obvious and borderline offensive, even as it tries to be uplifting and affirmative.And yet! There is also something about this movie that prevented me from collapsing into a permanent cringe as I watched it. Or rather, two things: the lead performances. (Linda Cardellini, as Tony\u2019s wife, Dolores, is wonderful too, but she\u2019s only around at the beginning and the end.) Mortensen, plump as a mortadella, doesn\u2019t so much transcend the ethnic clich\u00e9s of the role as chew through them, emerging into a zone of vaudevillian poetry. Ali, more or less the straight man in the double act, approaches every moment with a razor-fine wit, a lively awareness of the absurdity of the situation that may not belong to the character alone.These men are good company, even if the trip itself might cause some queasiness.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

The problem is, so does everybody else. The flood of tourists, visiting family members, school groups and temporarily freed office workers means that a simple visit to a museum can be more of a production than it would normally be. Because navigating long lines and crowded galleries can be quite daunting, it\u2019s essential to plan ahead.To manage the flow of visitors to its Warhol exhibition, the Whitney Museum is selling timed-entry tickets and art lovers are encouraged to book in advance \u2014 slots do sell out. The museum, which is usually closed on Tuesdays, will remain open on select Tuesdays during the run of \u201cWarhol,\u201d including New Year\u2019s Day; as usual, it\u2019s open late on Fridays and Saturdays (until 10 p.m.), too. The real key may be timing: \u201cOne of the best times to come is later on a Saturday (after 6 p.m.) when most of the crowds have gone for dinner,\u201d a museum representative wrote in an email.With lines regularly forming at the Metropolitan Museum of Art before it opens at 10 a.m., it is advised that visitors dress warmly during the holiday season if they plan to arrive early. If you\u2019re willing to forgo a trip up the Met\u2019s famous stairs, the lines at the street level entrance at 81st street tend to be shorter.The holidays can be stressful, so if the crowds at the more popular exhibitions and galleries spike your anxiety, the museum recommends visiting the quiet spaces that can be found even during the holiday rush, including the Studiolo from the Ducal Palace in Gubbio (gallery 501), the Buddhist sculpture rooms in the Asian art section (galleries 206, 223-231, 234-240) and the tranquil galleries in the back of the Robert Lehman Wing (galleries 950-960).Remember that the big museums have extended hours on Fridays, Saturdays or both. Most museums are open on Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve, but closed on Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Day. (It\u2019s always good to check websites to be sure, especially for commercial art galleries, many of which close for extended periods during the holiday season.)

So did my accountant, who is not registered with either party.The apps are to elections what Zillow is to real estate \u2014 services that pull public information from government records, repackage it for consumer viewing and make it available at the touch of a smartphone button. But instead of giving you a peek at house prices, VoteWithMe and OutVote let you snoop on which of your friends voted in past elections and their party affiliations \u2014 and then prod them to go to the polls by sending them scripted messages like \u201cYou gonna vote?\u201dVote With Me\u201cI don\u2019t want this to come off like we\u2019re shaming our friends into voting,\u201d said Naseem Makiya, the chief executive of OutVote, a start-up in Boston. But, he said, \u201cI think a lot of people might vote just because they\u2019re frankly worried that their friends will find out if they didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cYou want to use that gentle social pressure around voting,\u201d said Amanda Coulombe, general manager of organizing at NGP VAN, a campaign technology company for Democrats, \u201cbut really making sure you are balancing that with not freaking people out.\u201dFor one thing, he said, people could use the apps to create contact lists of acquaintances, strangers or public figures they do not like and maliciously publicize their voting histories. As a hypothetical example, he said, religious leaders might be outed for registering with a political party whose platform runs counter to their institution\u2019s doctrine.\u201cI don\u2019t think there are any particular safeguards to prevent people from just assembling a contact list for more malicious purposes, acquiring this information and using it to harass or coerce people,\u201d Mr. Rubinstein said.The apps\u2019 developers say they are simply democratizing access to these public records.\u201cThe message is going to be coming from someone that not only knows who you are but knows that you didn\u2019t vote last time,\u201d said Mikey Dickerson, the executive director of the New Data Project, who served as chief of the United States Digital Service under President Barack Obama. \u201cWe are trying to engineer a situation where there is a social expectation that they do vote.\u201dLily Jampol, a diversity and inclusion consultant in San Francisco, downloaded the VoteWithMe app last Monday. By Tuesday afternoon, she said, she had sent dozens of text messages to people in her contacts.\u201cI\u2019ve been optimizing, trying to wrangle for people who I think will be most affected,\u201d said Ms. Jampol, a behavioral scientist.The apps also distinguish engaged voters from wayward ones.If someone in your contacts list has a perfect voting record, OutVote identifies him or her as a \u201csuper voter\u201d and displays an emoji of a smiley face with red hearts for eyes next to the name. For those \u201cwoke friends who vote,\u201d it suggests sending a message saying: \u201cI know you\u2019re gonna vote on November 6 DUH, but make sure to remind your friends too!\u201dBoth apps display election years that people have skipped with a big red slash next to their names. OutVote marks voters who missed elections with a sad-faced emoji dripping a tear.To test the apps, reporters at The New York Times created a mock contact list of politicians and celebrities with their names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and workplaces and other data about them. The results suggest how easy it can be to use the information to pry into someone\u2019s personal life.A spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that she was purged from the New York voter rolls in 2016 and that he was looking into 2014. Ms. Milano said, in a message sent via her publicist, that she was dealing at the time with severe postpartum depression after the premature birth of her daughter.By inspecting data that the apps harvested from our contacts, The Times also found that they took more personal data than required to match voters \u2014 such as the workplace and email address of Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican.After queries from The Times, VoteWithMe and OutVote each said they had eliminated some types of data that their apps were harvesting. In subsequent testing last week, The Times found that VoteWithMe no longer collected email addresses, street names and numbers, or company names. But OutVote continued to do so. Mr. Makiya of OutVote said the app had stopped collecting social profile data but needed the email addresses to match voter files.That app allows users to send messages asking contacts to vote \u2014 without displaying those contacts\u2019 voting histories. It also collects data on users\u2019 contacts and matches them to voter files to help Vote.org track whether people who received messages were more likely to vote than people who did not.Debra Cleaver, chief executive of Vote.org, said the app was part of an experiment to determine the efficacy of such digital social pressure tools. It might turn out, she said, that it takes messages from several friends to get someone to vote.\u201cNo one really knows whether peer-to-peer technology has been successful this year,\u201d Ms. Cleaver said. \u201cI think we should be cautiously optimistic but realistic.\u201dAaron Krolik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: On Netflix, Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin Are Aging Bros", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInevitability isn\u2019t a good argument for a TV show\u2019s existence, however. \u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201d (eight episodes arrive Friday) isn\u2019t a disaster; it has a certain warm-bath appeal, if you don\u2019t mind a thick foam of prostate jokes. But it is adrift in a bland netherworld between Lorre\u2019s precision-tooled, laugh-a-minute network comedies and the quieter aesthetic of the alt-sitcom, lacking the strengths of either.Putting Douglas in the role of a silver-haired Hollywood Lothario (his hair is fantastic) who chose integrity over stardom can be seen as a clever bit of casting, both for and against type. The real (unintentional) twist, though, is having him play an acting coach who pushes his students to be honest onstage \u2014 given that Douglas, in his highly successful career, has consistently given closed-off, impenetrable performances.The one really notable exception was his relaxed, completely convincing portrayal of the middle-aged writing teacher Grady Tripp in \u201cWonder Boys\u201d (2000), and the scrambling, half-principled Sandy is a little like Grady 20 years down the road, without tenure. Douglas is clearly comfortable with Sandy, and his performance is amiable and easy to like. But it\u2019s not much more than that: As a showrunner and writer, Lorre (who gets full or partial writing credit on all eight episodes) hasn\u2019t done anything to raise Douglas\u2019s game.What he has given him are platitudes and attitudes, the outline of a well-meaning Peter Pan confronting mortality and isolation without the substance. A sitcom character, in other words. You could argue that this is the point: As Sandy skirts financial ruin and vacillates over his relationship to an \u201cage-appropriate\u201d woman (played by Nancy Travis, 17 years younger than Douglas), Norman frequently calls him out on his shallowness.But those observations aren\u2019t insights so much as obligatory comic beats. Moving into single-camera naturalism, Lorre carries with him the structures and comic sensibilities of the multicamera network sitcom \u2014 he just slows the pace, stretching out the setups, and ratchets down the jokes, as if explosive laughs would be unseemly in these quieter surroundings.And while the bromance of Sandy and Norman is the heart of the show, the masculinity-in-moth-balls atmosphere can be overpowering. If you\u2019re a man who hasn\u2019t heard of retrograde ejaculation, you\u2019ll Google to see if it\u2019s a real thing, after which you\u2019ll feel a little sick to your stomach.Particularly egregious is the treatment of Norman\u2019s daughter, a pill-popping head case played by Lisa Edelstein who shows up for a few episodes to vex her poor father and is completely forgotten once she is dropped off at rehab.Norman, who experiences a tragic early loss and grows progressively morose and antisocial, is a bum part. But Arkin, still bringing sharp wit to aggravation and aggrievement, is the best thing about \u201cThe Kominsky Method,\u201d even when the writing takes Norman into kvetching \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d territory. If you have to listen to someone complain about the modern world (\u201cSkype \u2014 what a stupid word\u201d), it might as well be him.Advertisement"}

Mr. Schmidt and other senior Google leaders were close with the Obama White House. Several went to work in government, including Megan Smith, who became the chief technology officer at the White House and an assistant to the president.After the election of President Trump, Mr. Schmidt\u2019s presence in Washington waned. Ms. Molinari was poised to take on some of his former lobbying duties. But it is unclear how effective she was at working with the Trump administration. She has not been able to stem attacks by Republicans like the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, on issues such as political bias in Google\u2019s search results.Google ranked first among companies in lobbying spending last year, but its Washington operation has been under fire for months.Last year, Google pushed out a former Obama administration official, Caroline Atkinson, the vice president of global public policy, from her role. That job remained empty for several months until Google hired Mr. Bhatia, the head of global policy from General Electric.The Washington office, including Ms. Molinari, has been blamed by some inside Google for not sending an executive to a recent Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference, according to a person familiar with internal discussions and who was not authorized to speak about it publicly. The committee focused on Google\u2019s absence during the hearing, putting an empty chair at the witness table in his place.Mr. Bhatia said that after a transition period, Ms. Molinari would continue as an adviser at Google. The company is looking for a replacement for Ms. Molinari.Katie Benner and Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

We usually talk about what\u2019s going on at their companies, or what\u2019s happening in Washington.But sometimes, we chat about meditation. Yes, that\u2019s right: meditation.Since I took over the Corner Office column this year, the subject has already come up in several interviews.\u201cHaving a beginner\u2019s mind informs my management style,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to listen deeply, and the beginner\u2019s mind is informing me to step back, so that I can create what wants to be, not what was. I know that the future does not equal the past. I know that I have to be here in the moment.\u201dMark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, was severely injured in a skiing accident in 2004 and used meditation to help him get back to work. After experiencing the benefits of meditation firsthand, he started offering mindfulness classes to Aetna employees, and before long, he said, the corporate culture had changed.And Mark Hoplamazian, the chief executive of Hyatt Hotels, who has dabbled in meditation, spoke about the importance of empathy and mindfulness to his strategy.These C.E.O.s are not alone in embracing mindfulness. Today, plenty of other companies, including Google, Ford and McKinsey, are offering meditation programs in the office.Since then, my meditation practice has ebbed and flowed, though the benefits have remained the same. There are stretches during which I diligently make time to sit on my cushion every day, quietly observing my thoughts, emotions and sensations. Then I\u2019ll go awhile without any formal practice. Then I\u2019ll go on retreat again, as I did this spring, going off the grid for days at a time.These days, my meditation coverage mostly turns up in the Corner Office, where, even when a C.E.O. isn\u2019t specifically talking about meditation, the answers to my questions are often informed by the practice of mindfulness.When I asked Mr. Benioff whether companies had a responsibility to benefit society, his response might as well have come out of a Buddhist scripture.\u201cThis company is not somehow separate from everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we not all connected?

Here\u2019s how Kate Conger, a tech reporter, reduces that exposure.How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Kate Conger, a technology reporter for The Times in San Francisco, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.You cover breaking news about all things tech \u2014 from Google to Facebook to Twitter to Uber. What are your most important tools for staying quick on your toes?I use a note-taking app called Bear, which lets me sort and filter my notes using hashtags. It makes it really easy for me to keep my notes orderly while I\u2019m running around between interviews, and makes it possible for me to quickly return to a conversation months or even years later if I need to refer to it again. I\u2019m always a bit stressed about the security of tools I use for reporting, but Bear syncs through Apple\u2019s CloudKit, a framework that lets the app developers store my data on Apple\u2019s servers, so I feel relatively comfortable with it.For me, the most important way to stay quick is to stay focused \u2014 so I ultimately end up relying on pen and ink more than tech tools. It feels as if my half-baked thoughts are constantly getting bumped down my news feeds, so I keep a paper to-do list. I have disappearing messages turned on in most of my Slack, Signal and WhatsApp conversations, so sometimes I also need to write down important points so I don\u2019t forget them. I\u2019m paranoid, and keeping paper notes feels safer to me.What app do you use most? The app I use more than any other is Spotify. I\u2019m playing music constantly from the minute I wake up until I go back to sleep, which helps me keep track of time. If I\u2019ve played a whole album through and not finished writing a paragraph, I know it\u2019s time to buckle down. But I have such a love-hate relationship with Spotify. I do really like the Daily Mixes, which help me discover new music. I wish I could pin or save them. Sometimes I get mixes based on artists I haven\u2019t listened to in ages, and I just want to go back to the mix I had on repeat the day before.I\u2019m horribly cheap, but Spotify is one of the few apps I pay for. Since I\u2019m paying, my expectations are sky high, and yet the app is buggy and slow, and it crashes regularly. I expect it to read my mind and know exactly what I want to hear at all times, but it doesn\u2019t, so I\u2019m disappointed.I also love that more and more messaging apps are adding options for ephemeral conversation. I\u2019m increasingly convinced that the default of digitally hoarding all conversations forever was a terrible idea, and I like that I can get my conversations to disappear from most of the chat apps I use now.You\u2019ve written a lot about security. How do you keep your own tech setup secure? I got interested in security out of necessity. When I was a kid using social media for the first time, I was also in the process of extricating myself from an abuser. I had to figure out how to use things like Myspace \u2014 it felt very important at the time to have a vibrant Myspace life! \u2014 in ways that would protect my anonymity, my location data and other sensitive information. I\u2019d constantly be messaging my friends, asking them to take down certain pictures or posts that could help my abuser find me. This isn\u2019t a concern for me anymore, but the situation forced me to think about what kinds of personal data I was sharing online from the moment I started doing it, and I\u2019m grateful for that. A lot of people don\u2019t think about their online privacy until they\u2019re dealing with a compromising situation in which their data is already out there.What about protecting conversations with sources?I approach security as a journalist in much the same way that I\u2019ve approached security as a person. The first thing I think about is limiting my exposure \u2014 what kind of data are my source and I generating? How do I minimize that footprint, or at least minimize how long my devices retain it? The second step is securing the data we do end up generating, which often means encrypting it.Encrypted chat apps like Signal have made security and ephemerality so much easier. But because they require a phone number, there\u2019s still what\u2019s called the first contact problem \u2014 how does someone who doesn\u2019t have your phone number initiate a secure conversation with you? I\u2019ve tinkered around with a few different approaches: using burner SIM cards, setting up secondary numbers with Google Voice or Twilio, or using apps, like Wickr, that don\u2019t force me to publish my phone number. But I haven\u2019t settled on a solution that feels totally seamless yet.All this security tech can get overwhelming. I still believe that sometimes the most secure, ephemeral conversation you can have is an in-person one.What tech product are you personally obsessed with? I\u2019m honestly a bit slow about adopting new technology. I think I ought to be more adventurous as a tech reporter, but I tend to find things I like and stick with them. For example, I\u2019m refusing to upgrade my iPhone because I like Touch ID \u2014 I haven\u2019t even tried Face ID yet.Oh, and portable battery packs! I don\u2019t know how I ever survived without them. They are perfect lifesaving angels.Advertisement"}

Why are thousands of Hondurans camped out on the southern border of the United States? Why have many athletes decided to kneel during the national anthem? To answer any of these questions \u2014 or the myriad others posed by the news every day \u2014 students will need to understand what happened in the past.In this teaching resource, we suggest different methods teachers can use to easily facilitate these connections.

Here are two examples you might consider using.Global | Human Rights Violations (or Religious Conflict)If you\u2019re studying 20th-century human tragedies like the Holocaust or the Rwandan genocide, students learn that human rights violations are unfortunately an enduring issue. The current persecution of the Rohingya clearly highlights that reality._________U.S. | ImmigrationOnce they find a piece that interests them, they can identify what argument the writer is making and then decide if they agree or disagree. For balance, they can look for another opinion piece that argues a different position, either in The Times or elsewhere, and decide which point of view they agree with most and why. What issues that we\u2019re still debating today were issues in the era they are studying? What images, quotes, data or other kinds of information can they find that might make interesting paired texts to link the two eras?_________Global | World War IThe world just commemorated the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I. Katrin Bennhold writes about the unsettling similarities between 1914 and today:Now as then, Europe\u2019s political center is weak and the fringes are radicalizing. Nationalism, laced with ethnic hatred, has been gaining momentum. Populists sit in several European governments._________U.S. | ReconstructionReconstruction has long been misrepresented, or simply neglected, in our schools, and unlike Confederate generals and founders of the Ku Klux Klan, few if any monuments exist to the black and white leaders of that era._________Since social studies students spend a great deal of time exploring historic places, one easy way to make that study relevant to them is to have them discover what those places look like today, and how life there has either changed or stayed the same. What remnants of the past are still present? Why?Global | China (Silk Road)China now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.China envisions a vast global network of trade, investment and infrastructure that will reshape financial and geopolitical ties \u2014 and bring the rest of the world closer to Beijing._________U.S. | HarlemFor nearly a century, Harlem has been synonymous with black urban America. Given its magnetic and growing appeal to younger black professionals and its historic residential enclaves and cultural institutions, the neighborhood\u2019s reputation as the capital of black America seems unlikely to change soon.But the neighborhood is in the midst of a profound and accelerating shift. In greater Harlem, which runs river to river, and from East 96th Street and West 106th Street to West 155th Street, blacks are no longer a majority of the population \u2014 a shift that actually occurred a decade ago, but was largely overlooked._________Historians\u2019 understanding of the past is typically grounded in what they glean from analyzing texts and artifacts. How are these still relevant today? Regular readers of The Times know that works of art, texts and structures created long ago are often featured in stories from the Politics, Travel or Arts sections as new generations discover them or reconsider their power and significance.Global | The Ruins of Ancient RomeIslamic State propagandists considered Palmyra a bonanza for promoting their vision of a strictly religious caliphate devoid of homage to other cultures or religions. They publicized the work of their demolition teams with graphic photographs._________U.S. | The Constitution_________Global | Fascist LeadersEven though the rise of fascist leaders like Hitler and Mussolini pulled the world into the most destructive conflict in human history, World War II, the end of the war marked the end of fascism.Right?_________U.S. | Robber BaronsAmerican industrialists and business magnates in the late 19th century, like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt and John D. Rockefeller, were called robber barons by critics because of ruthless business practices that helped make them incredibly wealthy._________When School Gets Real: Teachers Connect Classroom Lessons to Current EventsMaking It Relevant: Helping Students Connect Their Studies to the World TodayMaking Connections: 50 Teenagers Suggest Creative Ways to Link Classic Texts to the World Today50 Ways to Teach With Current Events_________How do you embed current events in your social studies classroom?

One day he was visited by a clever god called Theuth.Theuth was an inventor of many useful things: arithmetic and geometry; astronomy and dice. But his greatest discovery, so he believed, \u201cwas the use of letters.\u201d And it was this invention that Theuth was most eager to share with King Thamus.The art of writing, Theuth said, \u201cwill make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit.\u201dBut Thamus rebuffed him. \u201cO most ingenious Theuth,\u201d he said, \u201cthe parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them.\u201dThe king continued: \u201cFor this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners\u2019 souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember themselves.\u201dWritten words, Thamus concluded, \u201cgive your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things but will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.\u201dWelcome to Facebook.To which one can only say: About time.The story of the wildly exaggerated promises and damaging unintended consequences of technology isn\u2019t exactly a new one. The real marvel is that it constantly seems to surprise us. Why?But the deeper reason that technology so often disappoints and betrays us is that it promises to make easy things that, by their intrinsic nature, have to be hard.Tweeting and trolling are easy. Mastering the arts of conversation and measured debate is hard. Texting is easy. Writing a proper letter is hard. Looking stuff up on Google is easy. Knowing what to search for in the first place is hard. Having a thousand friends on Facebook is easy. Maintaining six or seven close adult friendships over the space of many years is hard. Swiping right on Tinder is easy. Finding love \u2014 and staying in it \u2014 is hard.That\u2019s what Socrates (or Thamus) means when he deprecates the written word: It gives us an out. It creates the illusion that we can remain informed, and connected, even as we are spared the burdens of attentiveness, presence of mind and memory. That may seem quaint today. But how many of our personal, professional or national problems might be solved if we desisted from depending on shortcuts?To read The Times\u2019s account of how Facebook dealt with its problems is to be struck by how desperately Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg sought to massage and finesse \u2014 with consultants, lobbyists and technological patches \u2014 what amounted to a daunting if simple crisis of trust. As with love and grammar, acquiring and maintaining trust is hard. There are no workarounds.Start over, Facebook. Do the basics. Stop pretending that you\u2019re about transforming the state of the world. Work harder to operate ethically, openly and responsibly. Accept that the work will take time. Log off Facebook for a weekend. Read an ancient book instead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Cheap Labor Drives China\u2019s A.I. Ambitions", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldSome of the most critical work in advancing China\u2019s technology goals takes place in a former cement factory in the middle of the country\u2019s heartland, far from the aspiring Silicon Valleys of Beijing and Shenzhen. An idled concrete mixer still stands in the middle of the courtyard. Boxes of melamine dinnerware are stacked in a warehouse next door.Inside, Hou Xiameng runs a company that helps artificial intelligence make sense of the world. Two dozen young people go through photos and videos, labeling just about everything they see. That\u2019s a car. That\u2019s a traffic light. That\u2019s bread, that\u2019s milk, that\u2019s chocolate. That\u2019s what it looks like when a person walks.\u201cI used to think the machines are geniuses,\u201d Ms. Hou, 24, said. \u201cNow I know we\u2019re the reason for their genius.\u201dMost importantly, this thinking goes, the Chinese government and companies enjoy access to mountains of data, thanks to weak privacy laws and enforcement. Beyond what Facebook, Google and Amazon have amassed, Chinese internet companies can get more because people there so heavily use their mobile phones to shop, pay for meals and buy movie tickets.But the ability to tag that data may be China\u2019s true A.I. strength, the only one that the United States may not be able to match. In China, this new industry offers a glimpse of a future that the government has long promised: an economy built on technology rather than manufacturing.\u201cWe\u2019re the construction workers in the digital world. Our job is to lay one brick after another,\u201d said Yi Yake, co-founder of a data labeling factory in Jiaxian, a city in central Henan province. \u201cBut we play an important role in A.I. Without us, they can\u2019t build the skyscrapers.\u201dWhile A.I. engines are superfast learners and good at tackling complex calculations, they lack cognitive abilities that even the average 5-year-old possesses. Small children know that a furry brown cocker spaniel and a black Great Dane are both dogs. They can tell a Ford pickup from a Volkswagen Beetle, and yet they know both are cars.A.I. has to be taught. It must digest vast amounts of tagged photos and videos before it realizes that a black cat and a white cat are both cats. This is where the data factories and their workers come in.Taggers helped AInnovation, a Beijing-based A.I. company, fix its automated cashier system for a Chinese bakery chain. Users could put their pastry under a scanner and pay for it without help from a human. But nearly one-third of the time, the system had trouble telling muffins from doughnuts or pork buns thanks to store lighting and human movement, which made images more complex. Working with photos from the store\u2019s interior, the taggers got the accuracy up to 99 percent, said Liang Rui, an AInnovation project manager.\u201cAll the artificial intelligence is built on human labor,\u201d Mr. Liang said.AInnovation has fewer than 30 taggers, but a surge in labeling start-ups has made it easy to farm out the work. Once, Mr. Liang needed to get about 20,000 photos in a supermarket labeled in three days. Colleagues got it done with the help of data factories for only a couple thousand dollars.\u201cWe\u2019re the assembly lines 10 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Yi, the co-founder of the data factory in Henan.The data factories are popping up in areas far from the biggest cities, often in relatively remote areas where both labor and office space are cheap. Many of the data factory workers are the kinds of people who once worked on assembly lines and construction sites in those big cities. But work is drying up, wage growth has slowed and many Chinese people prefer to live closer to home.Mr. Yi, 36, was out of a job and trying to get other ventures going with elementary school classmates when someone mentioned A.I. tagging. After online searches, he decided it wasn\u2019t super technical but needed cheap labor, something Henan has in abundance.In March, Mr. Yi and his friends set up Ruijin Technology, which rents offices the size of two professional basketball courts in an industrial park for $21,000 a year. It was previously the park\u2019s Communist Party committee\u2019s event space, so the ceiling lights are covered with red hammers and sickles.Ruijin, which means smart gold, now employs 300 workers but plans to expand to 1,000 after the Chinese New Year holiday, when many migrant workers come home.Unlike workers and business around the world, Mr. Yi isn\u2019t worried that A.I. will take his job.\u201cThe machines aren\u2019t smart enough to teach themselves yet,\u201d he said.Hiring is a bigger worry.Ruijin\u2019s pay of $400 to $500 a month is higher than average in Jiaxian. Some potential job candidates worry that they don\u2019t know anything about A.I. Others find the work boring.Jin Weixiang, 19, said he would quit Ruijin after the Chinese New Year and go to sell furniture in a physical store in southern city Guangzhou.\u201cI\u2019m a people\u2019s person,\u201d said Mr. Jin. \u201cI\u2019m doing labeling for the money.\u201dBut for some former migrant workers, the job is better than working on assembly lines.\u201cIt was the same work, same movement, day after day,\u201d said Yi Zhenzhen, a 28-year-old Ruijin employee who once worked at an electronic component company. \u201cNow I have to use my brain a little bit.\u201dMost of the time, customers don\u2019t tell these data factories what the task is for. Some are obvious. Labeling traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians are usually for autonomous driving. Labeling many types of camellia flowers could be for search engines.Once Ruijin was given the task of labeling the images of millions of human mouths. Mr. Yi said he wasn\u2019t sure what it was for. Maybe facial recognition?Roughly 300 miles to the north, in the Hebei city of Nangongshi, Hou Xiameng runs her data factory out of her in-laws\u2019 former cement factory. Her first job out of college was labeling faces for Megvii, the Chinese facial recognition company with a $2 billion valuation that\u2019s most famous for its technology platform called Face++. To this day, some facial recognition systems recognize her before they do her friends because, she says, \u201cmy face is in the original database.\u201dBut life in Beijing was too tough and expensive. She and her then-fianc\u00e9, Zhao Yacheng, decided to move back to their hometown and start a data factory. Ms. Hou\u2019s parents would pay for computers and desks. They are renovating the warehouse next door to hire 80 more people.Like Mr. Yi, Ms. Hou doesn\u2019t spend time thinking about the implications of her work. Are they contributing to a surveillance state and a dystopian future that machines will control human?\u201cCameras make me feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in control of the machines for now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What does the House control? What is the difference between the House and Senate?Like the Senate, the House is responsible for introducing bills and amendments, and members of both bodies serve on committees \u2014 such as those for the budget and the judiciary.The House has the power to initiate impeachment proceedings for government officials, and it is the chamber that introduces spending bills, giving it greater sway over the power of the purse.With a Democratic majority, the House will have the opportunity to introduce bills that could force senators to make a decision that could hurt their favor with voters.\u201cIt\u2019s a very alluring prospect for Democrats now to be able to put together bills which enjoy a lot of public support,\u201d said Ross Baker, a professor of American politics at Rutgers University. \u201cAnd then send it to the Senate to reject them.\u201dThe Senate is often considered a more prestigious body, in part because there are far fewer senators than representatives, but also because the Constitution gives the group unique powers.The Constitution gives the Senate the power to approve presidential nominations, including Supreme Court justices. Senators are also tasked with approving treaties with foreign countries.The Senate has a long history of closely watched investigative hearings. A Senate committee investigated the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, for example, as well as allegations of sexual harassment against Justice Clarence Thomas in the 1990s.Though impeachment proceedings begin in the House, the matter is then sent to the Senate, whose chambers act as a courtroom for the trial. The Senate has the sole power to conduct impeachment trials, essentially serving as the jury, as it did when it acquitted President Bill Clinton in 1999.At least two-thirds of senators have to find the president guilty to remove him from office.Although the Senate and the House have similar responsibilities to provide government oversight, the founding fathers gave them certain specialties, said Mr. Baker, the Rutgers professor.\u201cThey have very distinct and separate functions to play,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the Senate, it\u2019s nominations and treaties, and in the House, it\u2019s taxes and spending.\u201dIn terms of presidential succession, the speaker of the House is second in line, after the vice president. The president pro tempore of the Senate follows after the speaker.But on perhaps the biggest issue \u2014 that of impeachment \u2014 the outlook remains largely unchanged.With a Republican majority in the Senate, it is unlikely that the House Democrats would try to impeach Mr. Trump, barring big developments in the special counsel\u2019s investigation or elsewhere.

{"Headline": "Hard Knock Life: What Are the Turtles Telling Me?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNothing much makes sense these days, including the visits from my reptilian friends.Who\u2019s there?Nobody.Twice, I heard a rapping at our front door, and twice I looked out the window to see no one. Either I was losing my mind, or someone was playing a practical joke.The Eastern box turtle is the official reptile of my state, Tennessee. (The state reptile of New York, in case you\u2019re wondering, is the snapping turtle. Similar, but it bites.) We live in an old, wooded Nashville neighborhood, a few blocks from 3,000 acres of parkland. Rabbits, skunks, turkeys and deer also frequent our yard, and I try to respect their wildness rather than treat them like the cast of a Disney movie. I would never, say, try to capture any of these creatures to make them live inside my house and wear tiny pants. I do name them sometimes, though \u2014 as I had done with Frank, whom I\u2019ve known for the four years my family has lived in this house. Sometimes he wanders onto our back porch and I\u2019ll hear one of the kids say, \u201cOh, hey Frank.\u201dBut the knocking was new, and it soon became a regular thing. Now that we knew it wasn\u2019t a burglar or an obnoxious joke, we didn\u2019t mind, although we worried that Frank might hurt himself, banging his head against the door. We\u2019d just pick him up and move him to a shady spot. \u201cFrank\u2019s pranks,\u201d as we dubbed them, became a problem only when Frank started knocking in the middle of the night. One morning I woke to my husband sitting up, rubbing his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep all night,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to keep moving Frank.\u201dLater that morning I heard a scuffle at the door. \u201cWell, well, well \u2026 Look who it is.\u201d This time Frank took a few steps into the house, looking around. I picked him up and relocated him to the yard.The bottom of our door has a shiny brass kickplate affixed to it, and because Frank is only about four inches tall, it probably functions as a big looking glass to him. We guessed he was picking a fight with his own reflection. If I wanted to explain his behavior with a story, I could weave a parable about how everyone\u2019s fighting an inner demon. Like Frank, we all have an enemy in the mirror, and our greatest danger is that we could destroy ourselves while battling it.Several weeks into Frank\u2019s pranks, my husband shook my shoulder at 6 a.m. \u201cCome see.\u201d This time when we opened the door, we saw someone new.This turtle was a bit smaller, slightly more vividly colored. \u201cThat\u2019s a different turtle, right?\u201d he said. We couldn\u2019t figure out whether it was male or female, so I Googled \u201chow to sex turtles\u201d (a search phrase which, in retrospect, could have gone terribly wrong). Turns out, there are signs \u2014 subtle differences in shell shape and eye color \u2014 but most people can\u2019t tell for sure without the help of a vet. I wasn\u2019t going to subject this turtle to a veterinary examination, and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to pressure my new friend on gender identity. We named this one Fancy and decided to use they/them pronouns.Fancy showed up several days in a row, but never knocked, only stood quietly before the door\u2019s shiny surface. When we opened it, Fancy froze, then slowly turned and walked back into the bushes, as if we\u2019d both agreed to look away and pretend the encounter hadn\u2019t happened.One day, as I watched Fancy nibble grass, I began to doubt our theory that Frank and Fancy were two different turtles. I pulled up pictures I\u2019d taken of each. \u201cI think Frank and Fancy might be one and the same,\u201d I told my husband. \u201cWe never see them together, and they both have this handprint marking on their backs.\u201d Perhaps Frank was a much more complex individual than we first suspected. Who isn\u2019t?\u201cNope,\u201d he disagreed. \u201cDifferent turtles.\u201d In that case, we hadn\u2019t seen Frank for days. Where was he? And what did Fancy know?You could spin all sorts of theories \u2014 from the tragic (in which they\u2019re the abandoned pets of our home\u2019s former owners) to the \u201cPoltergeist\u201d (in which the house was built on a turtle burying ground) to the practical (in which they\u2019re begging for food). I put out some cherry tomatoes, spinach and a dish of water, just in case. The cherry tomatoes disappeared fast. No one ate the spinach.This wasn\u2019t the first time turtles had played a part in our family\u2019s story.When my son was in preschool, he learned the \u201cI Have a Little Dreidel\u201d song, but either misheard or mispronounced \u201cdreidel\u201d as \u201cturtle.\u201d He mangled the lyrics until it became a whole different song, a rhyme he asked us to sing each night: \u201cTurtles, turtles, turtles / How I love you so / Turtles, turtles, turtles / Never let you go.\u201d It was our bedtime routine for a decade.If I really wanted to, I could read my turtle visits as a sign from the universe that my role as a parent is changing. My son is in high school now; college is on the horizon. Turtles, turtles, turtles / time to let him go?It\u2019s just that assigning meaning to events is so satisfying. I want themes, threads, a plot that proceeds toward resolution. I want people to learn their lessons and change their ways and for the moral of every story to make us better as a species. But look at the news \u2014 full of arbitrary injustices and disasters, human beings treating each other with cruelty. The part of my brain that wants the world to conform to a story that makes sense crashes against the rock of reality again and again. My soul sometimes feels as battered as Frank\u2019s head must after banging on my door.Several friends suggested I identify the turtles by marking their shells with nail polish, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. The fun is in guessing, not knowing. I haven\u2019t heard them rattling their breakfast dish to demand tomatoes for a few weeks now, anyway.Maybe the turtles knocked to suggest I stop trying to explain everything. Perhaps they came to let me know that nature \u2014 including human nature \u2014 won\u2019t conform to storytelling parameters, no matter how much mental energy I spend trying to make it so. They might have come to say, \u201cLook! The world is full of spontaneous gifts you can\u2019t control or rationalize.\u201dBut probably not.This is the story of turtles who came and left for reasons of their own. They\u2019re turtles. It\u2019s not their job to teach me anything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech C.E.O.s Are in Love With Their Principal Doomsayer", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "The futurist philosopher Yuval Noah Harari thinks Silicon Valley is an engine of dystopian ruin. So why do the digital elite adore him so?Supported byThe futurist philosopher Yuval Noah Harari worries about a lot.He worries that Silicon Valley is undermining democracy and ushering in a dystopian hellscape in which voting is obsolete.He worries that by creating powerful influence machines to control billions of minds, the big tech companies are destroying the idea of a sovereign individual with free will.He worries that because the technological revolution\u2019s work requires so few laborers, Silicon Valley is creating a tiny ruling class and a teeming, furious \u201cuseless class.\u201dBut lately, Mr. Harari is anxious about something much more personal. If this is his harrowing warning, then why do Silicon Valley C.E.O.s love him so?\u201cOne possibility is that my message is not threatening to them, and so they embrace it?\u201d a puzzled Mr. Harari said one afternoon in October. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s more worrying. Maybe I\u2019m missing something?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m interested in how Silicon Valley can be so infatuated with Yuval, which they are \u2014 it\u2019s insane he\u2019s so popular, they\u2019re all inviting him to campus \u2014 yet what Yuval is saying undermines the premise of the advertising- and engagement-based model of their products,\u201d said Tristan Harris, Google\u2019s former in-house design ethicist and the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.Mr. Harari, thinking about all this, puts it this way: \u201cUtopia and dystopia depends on your values.\u201dHe followed up with \u201cHomo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,\u201d which outlined his vision of what comes after human evolution. In it, he describes Dataism, a new faith based around the power of algorithms. Mr. Harari\u2019s future is one in which big data is worshiped, artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, and some humans develop Godlike abilities.His prophecies might have made him a Cassandra in Silicon Valley, or at the very least an unwelcome presence. Instead, he has had to reconcile himself to the locals\u2019 strange delight. \u201cIf you make people start thinking far more deeply and seriously about these issues,\u201d he told me, sounding weary, \u201csome of the things they will think about might not be what you want them to think about.\u201dMr. Harari agreed to let me tag along for a few days on his travels through the Valley, and one afternoon in September, I waited for him outside X\u2019s offices, in Mountain View, while he spoke to the Alphabet employees inside. After a while, he emerged: a shy, thin, bespectacled man with a dusting of dark hair. Mr. Harari has a sort of owlish demeanor, in that he looks wise and also does not move his body very much, even while glancing to the side. His face is not particularly expressive, with the exception of one rogue eyebrow. When you catch his eye, there is a wary look \u2014\u00a0like he wants to know if you, too, understand exactly how bad the world is about to get. At the Alphabet talk, Mr. Harari had been accompanied by his publisher. They said that the younger employees had expressed concern about whether their work was contributing to a less free society, while the executives generally thought their impact was positive.Some workers had tried to predict how well humans would adapt to large technological change based on how they have responded to small shifts, like a new version of Gmail. Mr. Harari told them to think more starkly: If there isn\u2019t a major policy intervention, most humans probably will not adapt at all.It made him sad, he told me, to see people build things that destroy their own societies, but he works every day to maintain an academic distance and remind himself that humans are just animals. \u201cPart of it is really coming from seeing humans as apes, that this is how they behave,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re chimpanzees. They\u2019re sapiens. This is what they do.\u201dHe was slouching a little. Socializing exhausts him. An Alphabet media relations manager later reached out to Mr. Harari\u2019s team to tell him to tell me that the visit to X was not allowed to be part of this story. The request confused and then amused Mr. Harari. It is interesting, he said, that unlike politicians, tech companies do not need a free press, since they already control the means of message distribution. He said he had resigned himself to tech executives\u2019 global reign, pointing out how much worse the politicians are. \u201cI\u2019ve met a number of these high-tech giants, and generally they\u2019re good people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not Attila the Hun. In the lottery of human leaders, you could get far worse.\u201dSome of his tech fans, he thinks, come to him out of anxiety. \u201cSome may be very frightened of the impact of what they are doing,\u201d Mr. Harari said. Still, their enthusiastic embrace of his work makes him uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s just a rule of thumb in history that if you are so much coddled by the elites it must mean that you don\u2019t want to frighten them,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cThey can absorb you. You can become the intellectual entertainment.\u201dC.E.O. testimonials to Mr. Harari\u2019s acumen are indeed not hard to come by. \u201cI\u2019m drawn to Yuval for his clarity of thought,\u201d Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter and Square, wrote in an email, going on to praise a particular chapter on meditation.And Mr. Hastings wrote: \u201cYuval\u2019s the anti-Silicon Valley persona \u2014 he doesn\u2019t carry a phone and he spends a lot of time contemplating while off the grid. We see in him who we wish we were.\u201d He added, \u201cHis thinking on A.I. and biotech in his new book pushes our understanding of the dramas to unfold.\u201dA few nights earlier, Mr. Harari spoke to a sold-out theater of 3,500 in San Francisco. One ticket-holder walking in, an older man, told me it was brave and honest for Mr. Harari to use the term \u201cuseless class.\u201dHe told the audience that free will is an illusion, and that human rights are just a story we tell ourselves. Political parties, he said, might not make sense anymore. He went on to argue that the liberal world order has relied on fictions like \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d and \u201cfollow your heart,\u201d and that these ideas no longer work in the age of artificial intelligence, when hearts can be manipulated at scale.Everyone in Silicon Valley is focused on building the future, Mr. Harari continued, while most of the world\u2019s people are not even needed enough to be exploited. \u201cNow you increasingly feel that there are all these elites that just don\u2019t need me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s much worse to be irrelevant than to be exploited.\u201dThe useless class he describes is uniquely vulnerable. \u201cIf a century ago you mounted a revolution against exploitation, you knew that when bad comes to worse, they can\u2019t shoot all of us because they need us,\u201d he said, citing army service and factory work.Now it is becoming less clear why the ruling elite would not just kill the new useless class. \u201cYou\u2019re totally expendable,\u201d he told the audience.This, Mr. Harari told me later, is why Silicon Valley is so excited about the concept of universal basic income, or stipends paid to people regardless of whether they work. The message is: \u201cWe don\u2019t need you. But we are nice, so we\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\u201cIf humans are hackable animals, and if our choices and opinions don\u2019t reflect our free will, what should the point of politics be?\u201d he wrote. \u201cHow do you live when you realize \u2026 that your heart might be a government agent, that your amygdala might be working for Putin, and that the next thought that emerges in your mind might well be the result of some algorithm that knows you better than you know yourself? These are the most interesting questions humanity now faces.\u201dMr. Harari and his husband, Itzik Yahav, who is also his manager, rented a small house in Mountain View for their visit, and one morning I found them there making oatmeal. Mr. Harari observed that as his celebrity in Silicon Valley has risen, tech fans have focused on his lifestyle.\u201cSilicon Valley was already kind of a hotbed for meditation and yoga and all these things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the things that made me kind of more popular and palatable is that I also have this bedrock.\u201d He was wearing an old sweatshirt and denim track pants. His voice was quiet, but he gestured widely, waving his hands, hitting a jar of spatulas.Mr. Harari grew up in Kiryat Ata, near Haifa, and his father worked in the arms industry. His mother, who worked in office administration, now volunteers for her son handling his mail; he gets about 1,000 messages a week. Mr. Yahav\u2019s mother is their accountant.Most days, Mr. Harari doesn\u2019t use an alarm clock, and wakes up between 6:30 and 8:30 a.m., then meditates and has a cup of tea. He works until 4 or 5 p.m., then does another hour of meditation, followed by an hourlong walk, maybe a swim, and then TV with Mr. Yahav.The two met 16 years ago through the dating site Check Me Out. \u201cWe are not big believers in falling in love,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cIt was more a rational choice.\u201d\u201cWe met each other and we thought, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re \u2014 O.K., let\u2019s move in with each other,\u2019\u201d Mr. Yahav said.Mr. Yahav became Mr. Harari\u2019s manager. During the period when English-language publishers were cool on the commercial viability of \u201cSapiens\u201d \u2014 thinking it too serious for the average reader and not serious enough for the scholars \u2014 Mr. Yahav persisted, eventually landing the Jerusalem-based agent Deborah Harris. One day when Mr. Harari was away meditating, Mr. Yahav and Ms. Harris finally sold it at auction to Random House in London.Mr. Yahav used to meditate, but has recently stopped. \u201cIt was too hectic,\u201d he said while folding laundry. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get this kind of huge success and a regular practice.\u201d Mr. Harari remains dedicated.\u201cIf it were only up to him, he would be a monk in a cave, writing things and never getting his hair cut,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, looking at his husband. \u201cCan I tell that story?\u201dMr. Harari said no.\u201cOn our first meeting,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, \u201che had cut his hair by himself. And it was a very bad job.\u201dThe couple are vegan, and Mr. Harari is particularly sensitive to animals. He identified the sweatshirt he was wearing as one he got just before one of his dogs died. Mr. Yahav cut in to ask if he could tell another story; Mr. Harari seemed to know exactly what he meant, and said absolutely not.\u201cIn the middle of the night,\u201d Mr. Yahav said, \u201cwhen there is a mosquito, he will catch him and take him out.\u201dBeing gay, Mr. Harari said, has helped his work \u2014 it set him apart to study culture more clearly because it made him question the dominant stories of his own conservative Jewish society. \u201cIf society got this thing wrong, who guarantees it didn\u2019t get everything else wrong as well?\u201d he said.\u201cIf I was a superhuman, my superpower would be detachment,\u201d Mr. Harari added. \u201cO.K., so maybe humankind is going to disappear \u2014 O.K., let\u2019s just observe.\u201dFor fun, the couple watches TV. It is their primary hobby and topic of conversation, and Mr. Yahav said it was the only thing from which Mr. Harari is not detached.They just finished \u201cDear White People,\u201d and they loved the Australian series \u201cPlease Like Me.\u201d That night, they had plans to either meet Facebook executives at company headquarters or watch the YouTube show \u201cCobra Kai.\u201dMr. Harari left Silicon Valley the next weekend. Soon, in December, he will enter an ashram outside Mumbai for another 60 days of silence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Helping Out Family Is Taken to Extremes in \u2018My Sister, the Serial Killer\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesAyoola \u2014 lovely, dopey, incorrigibly murderous \u2014 is the chaos at the heart of \u201cMy Sister, the Serial Killer,\u201d a much-anticipated first novel from the Nigerian writer Oyinkan Braithwaite. It\u2019s Lagos noir \u2014 pulpy, peppery and sinister, served up in a comic deadpan courtesy of the narrator, Ayoola\u2019s horrified sister Korede.Korede, a nurse, is as unprepossessing as her sister is beautiful, and as loyal as they come. She\u2019s always on hand to discreetly dispose of a body or to help concoct an alibi \u2014 even as she\u2019s baffled by her sister\u2019s motives. Ayoola claims the murders are in self-defense, but she never seems hurt or even terribly rattled. (And why is she wandering around with a nine-inch knife, anyway?)\u201cI found myself typing \u2018serial killer\u2019 into the Google search box at 3 a.m.,\u201d Korede says. In one desperate moment she even wonders if the weapon could be to blame: \u201cI cannot imagine her resorting to stabbing if that particular knife were not in her hand; almost as if it were the knife and not her that was doing the killing. But then, is that so hard to believe? Who is to say that an object does not come with its own agenda? Or that the collective agenda of its previous owners does not direct its purpose still?\u201dThat knife once belonged to their father, a vicious man who died in an accident (or was it?). Their mother is now a blurry creature, lost in an Ambien-induced stupor. The sisters only have each other. Korede\u2019s one confidant is a comatose patient to whom she confesses everything \u2014 her consuming crush on a doctor at the hospital, and the truth of her sister\u2019s compulsion.The chapters are brisk \u2014 a page or two long, with titles like \u201cBleach,\u201d \u201cBody,\u201d \u201cStain.\u201d The narration is clean and efficient; the characters lightly sketched. Psychologizing is kept to a minimum. There are a few tiresome genre tropes \u2014 an annoying reliance on ellipses to convey mood, and subtext that comes emblazoned in neon. (\u201cI head to the supply cabinet and grab a set of wipes. If only I could wipe away all our memories with it.\u201d) But this book is, above all, built to move, to hurtle forward \u2014 and it does so, dizzyingly.There\u2019s a seditious pleasure in its momentum. At a time when there are such wholesome and dull claims on fiction \u2014 on its duty to ennoble or train us in empathy \u2014 there\u2019s a relief in encountering a novel faithful to art\u2019s first imperative: to catch and keep our attention.Every now and again, however, the aperture widens. The story becomes larger. Cracks emerge in Korede\u2019s facade of strenuous calm. She turns jealous when Ayoola receives flowers: \u201cI console myself with the knowledge that even the most beautiful flowers wither and die.\u201d Her self-loathing grows darker. \u201cThere never seemed to be much point in masking my imperfections,\u201d she says of putting on makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s as futile as using air freshener when you leave the toilet.\u201dAyoola\u2019s vivid crimes are the center of the novel, but the margins are crammed with stories of routine humiliation and entitlement, everyday violence \u2014 the world that has produced these women. Braithwaite explores the accident of beauty, and its command; how women\u2019s faces can write their fates. And she does her most artful work in conjuring the corruption and ambient menace of Lagos, as Korede perceives it. At a traffic stop, a policeman coaxes a bribe out of her. He tries to get into the car; he lazily threatens her. She frantically tries to manage the situation: \u201cEducated women anger men of his ilk, and so I try to adopt broken English.\u201d Finally, he takes her money, and she drives on. It\u2019s a situation she has endured many times before. It still terrifies. And it will happen again.One of Ayoola\u2019s boyfriends confronts Korede at one point. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with her,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you? What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d This scorpion-tailed little thriller leaves a response, and a sting, you will remember.Advertisement"}

Lael Brainard, a fellow Fed governor, said they would \u201cweaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system.\u201d But Greg Baer of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said they don\u2019t go far enough.More details from Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner of the NYT:\u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel that we\u2019re unequal or we\u2019re not respected anymore,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, 33, a product marketing manager at Google\u2019s YouTube who helped call for the walkout. \u201cGoogle\u2019s famous for its culture. But in reality we\u2019re not even meeting the basics of respect, justice and fairness for every single person here.\u201dIt\u2019s the latest sign of how the tech industry\u2019s rank and file employees are embracing activism \u2014 and pushing back against their leaders. Workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies have recently spoken out about their employers\u2019 willingness to work on military projects, the gender pay gap and other issues.Last month was painful for investors. At its worst, the S.&P. 500 was down more than 9 percent, though it rebounded in the last few days to finish October with losses of around 7 percent.Only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. The S.&P. 500 has been dragged down disproportionately by smaller, domestically focused companies, cyclically sensitive industrial firms and global manufacturers like Caterpillar.And he also lists the issues that spooked investors:President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.The streaming service has changed its stance on not showing movies in theaters before streaming them. It will screen three movies that it wants to be considered for Oscars, including Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d in theaters for several weeks before they go online.Netflix\u2019s modified distribution approach should persuade more theaters to participate. But the move is really about winning Oscars and wooing Hollywood talent.Academy Awards voters \u2014 unlike the Emmys electorate \u2014 have been cool to Netflix. Heavyweights like Steven Spielberg, for instance, have chafed at the company\u2019s policy of streaming movies immediately, suggesting that the service\u2019s original films should be considered television. Top directors like Mr. Cuar\u00f3n, who won an Oscar in 2014 for directing \u201cGravity,\u201d also want their work to be seen on big screens, which has made it harder for Netflix to compete with studios for projects.But the move will give Netflix a new headache: explaining to its other filmmakers why their productions didn\u2019t get a theatrical release.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

They have absolutely no morals.\u201dAnd after this article was published online, Mr. Tobaccowala called The New York Times to add to his comments.\u201cThe people there do,\u201d he said, referring to possessing morals, \u201cbut as a business, they seem to have lost their compass.\u201dAnd while ad agencies or their holding companies, like Publicis, place money on behalf of brands, it is up to the brands to decide whether to advertise on Facebook.\u201cAgencies can make recommendations, but marketers need to decide at what point is this going to be a liability for them,\u201d said Marla Kaplowitz, chief executive of the 4A\u2019s, an industry trade group.So far, very few have been willing to leave the platform.Mr. Norman said Facebook should establish an ombudsman role to assess its societal risks, with reports in its regular financial filings. He compared the work to an accounting firm\u2019s audit of a corporation\u2019s finances.\u201cThe business should be obliged to report its risk to society versus just financial risks to the business,\u201d Mr. Norman said.\u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes, but to suggest that we aren\u2019t focused on uncovering and tackling issues quickly is not true,\u201d Carolyn Everson, the vice president of global marketing solutions at Facebook, said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur clients depend on us to help drive their business, and whether that means supporting the largest brands in the world or budding entrepreneurs, we\u2019ll stay focused on doing the best work for our partners, improving safety and security across our platforms, and driving social good in the world.\u201dAlmost all of Facebook\u2019s revenue \u2014 which climbed to just over $40 billion last year \u2014 comes from advertisers, which range from local businesses to global brands. Along with Google, Facebook dominates the digital advertising market, and even as user growth has slowed, its revenue has risen quarter after quarter. But marketing is built on trust between sellers and buyers, and the revelations this week are a jolt for some in the industry.\u201cUp to now, whatever you said about Facebook, you couldn\u2019t say it was a two-faced company,\u201d Mr. Tobaccowala said. \u201cIt says one thing to you and does something completely different. This is very hard if you are a marketer.\u201dHe added: \u201cI\u2019m not anti-Facebook. But I have always believed that marketers need people who recognize their dollars, and that they should drive and control their brands and they should control their data, and I think this will probably give them additional gumption to stand up and be heard.\u201dDave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted television ads, said the reports about Facebook\u2019s behavior \u201care driving a lot of pretty intense conversations in the ad industry these days.\u201d\u201cWhat I hear most are brands saying that time for just talking is over: \u2018It\u2019s no longer about what Facebook says, it\u2019s about what they do and what they stop doing,\u2019\u201d he said.Unilever did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\u201cSo far, the track record basically has been that regardless of what Facebook does, they keep getting more money,\u201d Mr. Tobaccowala said. \u201cThe question simply is, will this make people wake up?\u201dAdvertisement"}

China\u2019s tech industry is becoming more serious about grappling with its products\u2019 unintended consequences \u2014 and about helping the government.\u201cTencent has been dedicated to dealing with terrorist information online and other internet crimes, in line with the government\u2019s crackdown,\u201d Chen Yong, an executive in Tencent\u2019s security management department, said at the event.At Wuzhen, by contrast, Mr. Xi appeared only by proxy. The head of the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda department, Huang Kunming, conveyed a message of thanks from Mr. Xi and then delivered an opening address that extolled the world-changing power of internet access.Among Chinese companies this week, private enterprises showed off the ways in which they increasingly support and work with the government, while state-backed companies demonstrated they were not doomed to be tech laggards.The Tencent executive, Mr. Chen, described in an interview the company\u2019s relationship with law enforcement.Political activists have reported being followed based on what they have said on WeChat. Chat records have turned up as evidence in court, fueling speculation about whether Tencent, the app\u2019s developer, may be the source.Mr. Chen said Tencent reports illegal activity discovered on its platforms to the government, after which the authorities can request specific user information. Metadata describing when and where users logged into a Tencent app can be stored for up to six months, he said. But Mr. Chen denied that the company gave law enforcement officials a back door through which they could freely peruse chat records and user data.\u201cWe only store the content that the law prescribes,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever long the law says to store it, that\u2019s how long we store it.

One company attending the conference is taking things a step further.IrisKing, which is based in Beijing and has substantial state backing, started out by making iris-recognition software for coal mines. With their faces and fingertips covered in soot, miners needed another technology for clocking in and out of work.Now, IrisKing\u2019s tools also help identify refugees in Syria and recover trafficked children in China, said Wang Xintao, a marketing manager for the company.The company has also started working with the authorities in Xinjiang, Mr. Wang said.

{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Hits the Barrier of Meaning", "Date": "2018-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMachine learning algorithms don\u2019t yet understand things the way humans do \u2014 with sometimes disastrous consequences. Ms. Mitchell is Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University.You\u2019ve probably heard that we\u2019re in the midst of an A.I. revolution. We\u2019re told that machine intelligence is progressing at an astounding rate, powered by \u201cdeep learning\u201d algorithms that use huge amounts of data to train complicated programs known as \u201cneural networks.\u201d Today\u2019s A.I. programs can recognize faces and transcribe spoken sentences. We have programs that can spot subtle financial fraud, find relevant web pages in response to ambiguous queries, map the best driving route to almost any destination, beat human grandmasters at chess and Go, and translate between hundreds of languages. What\u2019s more, we\u2019ve been promised that self-driving cars, automated cancer diagnoses, housecleaning robots and even automated scientific discovery are on the verge of becoming mainstream. The lack of humanlike understanding in machines is underscored by recent cracks that have appeared in the foundations of modern A.I. While today\u2019s programs are much more impressive than the systems we had 20 or 30 years ago, a series of research studies have shown that deep-learning systems can be unreliable in decidedly unhumanlike ways.I\u2019ll give a few examples. \u201cThe bareheaded man needed a hat\u201d is transcribed by my phone\u2019s speech-recognition program as \u201cThe bear headed man needed a hat.\u201d Google Translate renders \u201cI put the pig in the pen\u201d into French as \u201cJe mets le cochon dans le stylo\u201d (mistranslating \u201cpen\u201d in the sense of a writing instrument). These are only a few examples demonstrating that the best A.I. programs can be unreliable when faced with situations that differ, even to a small degree, from what they have been trained on. The errors made by such systems range from harmless and humorous to potentially disastrous: imagine, for example, an airport security system that won\u2019t let you board your flight because your face is confused with that of a criminal, or a self-driving car that, because of unusual lighting conditions, fails to notice that you are about to cross the street.Even more worrisome are recent demonstrations of the vulnerability of A.I. systems to so-called adversarial examples. In these, a malevolent hacker can make specific changes to images, sound waves or text documents that while imperceptible or irrelevant to humans will cause a program to make potentially catastrophic errors. What would be required to surmount this barrier, to give machines the ability to more deeply understand the situations they face, rather than have them rely on shallow features? To find the answer, we need to look to the study of human cognition. A.I. programs that lack common sense and other key aspects of human understanding are increasingly being deployed for real-world applications. While some people are worried about \u201csuperintelligent\u201d A.I., the most dangerous aspect of A.I. systems is that we will trust them too much and give them too much autonomy while not being fully aware of their limitations. As the A.I. researcher Pedro Domingos noted in his book \u201cThe Master Algorithm,\u201d \u201cPeople worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they\u2019re too stupid and they\u2019ve already taken over the world.\u201dMelanie Mitchell is Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University and External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. Her book, \u201cArtificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans,\u201d will be published in 2019 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Gene Editing to A.I., How Will Technology Transform Humanity?", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "Five big thinkers \u2014 Regina Barzilay, George Church, Jennifer Egan, Catherine Mohr and Siddhartha Mukherjee \u2014 puzzle over the future of the future.\u201cA geneticist, an oncologist, a roboticist, a novelist and an A.I. researcher walk into a bar.\u201d That could be the setup for a very bad joke \u2014 or a tremendously fascinating conversation. Fortunately for us, it was the latter. On a blustery evening in late September, in a private room at a bar near Times Square, the magazine gathered five brilliant scientists and thinkers around a table for a three-hour dinner. In the (edited) transcript below \u2014 moderated by Mark Jannot, a story editor at the magazine and a former editor in chief of Popular Science \u2014 you can see what they had to say about the future of medicine, health care and humanity.But the ones that involve gene editing are on their way, they\u2019re in the pipeline. There\u2019s a lab at Stanford that\u2019s doing gene editing on blood stem cells for sickle-cell disease. Then you can transplant those blood cells and replace the diseased cells, and the sickle-cell disease should be cured. We\u2019ll get comfortable with it, and by comfort I mean not just becoming comfortable with technically how to do it, but realizing it doesn\u2019t all of a sudden cause some horrible cancer, or some terrible disease, which, if you ask me, I think is quite unlikely. But at some point the decision will come down to the F.D.A. and other organizations; they\u2019ll have to say, let\u2019s go forward. Bottom line, our capacity to become more comfortable with the consequences of gene editing will come from diseases where the stakes, as it were, are more simple and higher \u2014 especially with a disease like acute myeloid leukemia, where there\u2019s an extremely high mortality rate \u2014 and then we\u2019ll backtrack our way into reproductive technology.I learned this in a very personal way. When I was 43, I went in for a routine mammogram, and all of a sudden I was diagnosed with breast cancer. This was a big shock because, to the best of my knowledge, nobody in my family had ever been diagnosed with cancer. At every point in my treatment, I had many more questions than my doctors had answers to. I remember I did my mammogram, and they said, \u201cYour cancer is really tiny.\u201d I said \u201cGreat!\u201d Then we went to M.R.I., and suddenly they see cancer all over. Then they did a biopsy, and they discovered it\u2019s actually small; the M.R.I. was a false positive. How can we have this high-resolution M.R.I. modality and still not know that this is a false positive?For me as a computer scientist working in artificial intelligence, it seemed obvious to train a machine to make these kinds of predictions. If you look at what was happening in computer vision, A.I. systems could already identify very subtle distinctions between images, at a level of detail that\u2019s hard for the human eye to differentiate. Why do people need to undergo unnecessary procedures and live with months of uncertainty while the technology that can fully resolve the situation already exists?And this was just one of many steps in the treatment pipeline where I saw how artificial intelligence could transform cancer diagnosis and treatment. As an A.I. researcher, I was stunned to see all these opportunities to help patients squandered. From a patient\u2019s perspective, it felt cruel. We\u2019re talking about well-understood technology commercially deployed in other industries, not brand-new research. And this is a general trend. It doesn\u2019t matter what your disease is; today, A.I. is not yet part of clinical treatment.Ultimately that brought me to two areas. One of them relates to something very basic in clinical research \u2014 extracting relevant information from patients\u2019 electronic records. Even though every hospital sits on a gold mine of data, it\u2019s severely underutilized by care providers and clinical researchers, because the records are mostly in text. Unless they\u2019re specifically trained, machines cannot read these stories; they expect a database where information is properly structured. And so, today, if you as a patient want to know how patients like yourself responded to treatment in your hospital, you can\u2019t find the answer. Even in the most prestigious journals, almost all the studies that use past patient data do that data extraction by hand, which is expensive and slow and dramatically limits the scope of these studies.In my core field of research, natural language processing, we\u2019ve developed lots of tools that can automate this task. And so we applied those tools to create a database of more than 100,000 patients with breast disease from Massachusetts General and other partner hospitals that spans decades. Now with one simple query you can find a cohort of patients with the same disease features and study it over time.Another thing I\u2019m working on relates to reading mammograms. Today the risk models used in clinical practice are very imprecise. Our ability to predict who is going to get cancer is very, very low. Our idea was to let the machine algorithm look for patterns in the raw mammographic image: If it looks at the mammogram, from five years earlier, of a woman who went on to develop cancer, can it detect patterns?We are now thinking of expanding our work to prescreen for lung and pancreatic cancer. Imagine how it can change the game if these diseases, which are now diagnosed late, when they are largely uncurable, could be detected early \u2014 how many lives can be saved. That is the way that A.I. can transform medicine. It will identify patterns far too subtle for humans to identify.In surgery, we\u2019re also starting to use the same sorts of tools that Regina is applying to radiology images and natural language analysis of medical records, but we\u2019re doing it with surgical videos and data from operations, data that we can readily harvest from surgical robots. These are machines that surgeons operate as extensions of themselves, enabling them to perform extremely delicate surgeries, through small incisions, and watch what\u2019s going on inside the patient\u2019s body via a video feed. They can actually see better than if they had cut the patient open. And the machine records every movement made and captures that video of the operation.It is amazing how much a trained human can tell from just looking at a single frame of a surgical procedure. A well-trained surgical resident can walk into an operating room where a surgery is underway, and can glance up and with one look at the screen know what kind of procedure it is, what step you are at in the procedure \u2014 they know what\u2019s going to happen next, and they can tell if it\u2019s going well or not, using clues like if you\u2019ve got a lot of blood in the field, or from looking at the body language of all the people in the operating room. Is the surgeon stressed out? Has the music been turned down? Are people still talking? What are they saying? There\u2019s all kinds of clues.We can use the data in those videos, use machine learning and natural language processing to train an A.I. to be able to pick up on all these same clues and to be able recognize the same things the resident can, and then ideally to be able to help you with what might be the best next step. It would be like providing every surgeon with the perfect surgical resident.To achieve this, it isn\u2019t just recognizing what is in the picture or the sounds; these algorithms need to understand the context, where you are in the procedure, what\u2019s going to happen and what should ordinarily happen next. To do all that, we need to train them on a lot of data, looking at how a thousand different surgeons do exactly that same step, and what best practices are, and maybe clustered into five different styles of doing this particular surgery so you can tell which step to recommend next. The key is that by turning surgery into data, we can now start to use these remarkably powerful machine-learning tools to analyze and learn from these data. But first you need data. We\u2019re lucky with our robots, but in many areas of medicine it is hard to get your hands on the kind of data you need.One implication is that 25, 50, 250 years from now, we become a kind of clinical-trial society in which empirically driven decisions are constantly popping up. But by clinical-trial society, I mean all sorts of questions, because the information net becomes so rich \u2014 and the capacity to understand or deconvolute that information, because of computational power and because of A.I.-dependent algorithms, becomes so rich \u2014 that we begin to subject aspects of human behavior, human selves, that were previously considered outside the realm of assessment to a kind of deeper clinical assessment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "May A.I. Help You?", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "Intelligent chatbots could automate away nearly all of our commercial interactions \u2014 for better or for worse.\u201cTwo-thirds of people will never get in front of a clinician,\u201d says Darcy, who talks in an exuberant flow. \u201cAnd that\u2019s in the United States! The rest of the world? More than half the world doesn\u2019t even have access to basic health care. The idea of mental health care is just completely out of reach.\u201dDarcy happened to be a former computer programmer, so she was able to dream up a very unusual solution to this problem: Woebot, a text-chatbot therapist. Working with a team of psychologists and Andrew Ng, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, Darcy wrote a set of conversational prompts that walks users through the practice of C.B.T. In a chipper style, the bot helps users challenge their \u201cdistorted thinking\u201d; it coaxes users to describe their moods more clearly. Since Woebot is just software, it could be made freely available worldwide, and it could, in Silicon Valley terms, \u201cscale\u201d \u2014 or converse with thousands of people simultaneously. It could check in and nudge users with superhuman diligence; it would be available at all hours. \u201cWoebot can be there at 2 a.m. if you\u2019re having a panic attack and no therapist can, or should be, in bed with you,\u201d Darcy says.Woebot does not pretend to be human; it appears as a cartoon robot when it chats with you on Facebook Messenger, and it acknowledges its own artifice (as when it declares, for example, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a little bit about how I like to work with humans\u201d). But its personality is otherwise upbeat, its conversations peppered with emoji and animated gifs (like the cheering Minions from \u201cDespicable Me\u201d) to congratulate you for doing psychological work.In a study with 70 young adults, Darcy found that after two weeks of interacting with the bot, the test subjects had lower incidences of depression and anxiety. They were impressed, and even touched, by the software\u2019s attentiveness. \u201cWoebot felt like a real person that showed concern,\u201d one of them told Darcy\u2019s team. Last spring, when Darcy put Woebot online, free to all, its use immediately exploded; in the first week, more than 50,000 people talked to it. (\u201cDo you realize,\u201d Ng told Darcy, \u201cthat Woebot spoke to more people today than a human therapist could in a lifetime?\u201d) Nowadays, Woebot exchanges between one and two million messages a week with users, ranging from divorc\u00e9es to the bereaved to young men, a population that rarely seeks treatment. Many tell Darcy that it\u2019s easier to talk to a bot than a human; they don\u2019t feel judged.Darcy argues this is a glimpse of our rapidly arriving future, where talking software is increasingly able to help us manage our emotions. There will be A.I.s that detect our feelings, possibly better than we can. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see robots for weight loss, and robots for being more effective communicators,\u201d she says. It may feel odd at first; indeed, when people email her to say Woebot helped them feel better, nearly every one begins the note by sheepishly explaining, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that this would be helpful.\u201d But there\u2019s something about talking to software that is powerful, they discover, when it responds and seems alive.\u201cIt\u2019s conversation,\u201d Darcy says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been conversing for, what is it, 200,000 years?\u201dThe rise of \u201cconversational agents\u201d is the next great shift in computer interfaces \u2014 one arguably as significant as the \u201cpoint-and-click\u201d interface that emerged in the \u201980s. Before the Apple Macintosh, the first computer to popularize point-and-click, people using home computers had to familiarize themselves with abstruse text commands. The advent of the visual interface opened up computing to the masses, producing a generation fluent in word processing, email and, eventually, web surfing. The next great shift, the mobile phone, put computing \u2014 and nonstop internet access \u2014 into our pockets, and unleashed a tsunami of social media. These sorts of changes don\u2019t come along very often, and when they do, they create new and unexpected behaviors.Talking software gives us computers that not only ride along with us but also socialize with us. Being humanlike \u2014 saying \u201chi,\u201d telling self-deprecating jokes \u2014 is their interface metaphor, much as the first point-and-click computers used the trappings of office life (a wastepaper basket, a tiny pad of paper) to help orient us to the screen. Meaghan Keaney Anderson, a vice president of HubSpot, a marketing and sales software firm, has seen firsthand how voice commands have become second nature in her household, particularly for the next generation: \u201cMy daughter is 22 months old now. At 9 months she said her first word, which was the dog\u2019s name, and then at 13 months she learned to walk, and then by 15 months she started giving Alexa commands.\u201d She added: \u201cI think my daughter is growing up in a world where you just speak what you want into the universe and it provides.\u201dFor years, A.I. programmers fixated on passing the Turing Test \u2014 the famous challenge floated by Alan Turing in 1950 to produce a machine that can fool a human into thinking it is also human. Sci-fi has made dystopic hay of this in movies like \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and \u201cEx Machina.\u201d But the world that\u2019s emerging is simultaneously more mundane and stranger. None of this software is trying to fool us. Bots like Siri or Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are, like Woebot, openly artificial, even proudly so. (When I asked Alexa \u201cAre you alive?\u201d it responded: \u201cArtificially, maybe, but not in the same way that you\u2019re alive.\u201d) We are thus heading into a post-Turing world, one in which we\u2019ll banter all day to software, always aware that it is software.Emma Coats, the \u201ccharacter lead\u201d for Google Assistant, describes the emotional affect of her company\u2019s artificial life form as \u201ca friendly companion that is trustworthy.\u201d She and her team strenuously avoided giving the Assistant even a hint of snark. \u201cYou\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want to ask a stupid question if it\u2019s going to give me a hard time about it,\u2019\u2009\u201d Coats says. Some of their personality writers have backgrounds in improv. Coats herself worked at Pixar on the animated film \u201cBrave.\u201d \u201cPixar is all about finding an emotional reality in a car or a fish,\u201d she says. \u201cSo that\u2019s something we\u2019ve really used with the Assistant. We don\u2019t want it to ever be a human being, right? That\u2019s not what it is. But that doesn\u2019t mean that A.I. or software can\u2019t have a perspective on the world.\u201dAs a literary endeavor, the field of bot creation is booming. The bots need to be equipped to answer the wide variety of weird, playful queries that people lob at them, which requires lots of writers. Coats and her co-workers have found that people like to simply shoot the breeze with their devices \u2014 probing their personalities, searching for the puppet strings. \u201c\u2009\u2018Do you fart?\u2019 is always a popular question,\u201d Coats says dryly.There\u2019s another reason botmakers are embracing a post-Turing mind-set: They\u2019ve realized that the public tends to feel wounded when someone (or something) tries to fool them. This spring, Google gave a demonstration of Duplex, a new voice-chat A.I. When Duplex called a hair salon to book an appointment, it sounded so human \u2014 it even said \u201cum\u201d a few times \u2014 that the salon receptionist apparently never realized it was A.I. The reaction online was harsh. \u201cPeople value authenticity,\u201d says Kate Darling, a researcher who studies the ethics of robotics at M.I.T. \u201cIt matters a lot. It matters hugely.\u201dThis is how computers have always made themselves at home: by offering improved efficiency, vanquishing dull tasks. At TD Bank, coders are building experimental bots \u2014 using tech created by the A.I. firm Kasisto \u2014 to encourage customers to probe their financial life. Rizwan Khalfan, the company\u2019s chief digital and payments officer, told me he imagines customers asking a bot something like, \u201cO.K., tell me about my expenses last weekend.\u201d A question this specific isn\u2019t easy to answer on a website, where the customer might need to hunt through a database. But, Khalfan hopes, a person could one day ask this bot conversationally: \u201cI want to go out to the theater this weekend. Can I actually afford it?\u201dThere are some things audio can\u2019t handle as effectively as screens \u2014 long lists of data, for instance. But in a world where people worry that they\u2019re staring at their phones too much, chat might offer a respite. In \u201cHer,\u201d the voice assistants murmur in people\u2019s ears as they move through the world, functioning as something like E.S.P. The chatbot designer Emily Withrow, who is the director of the Quartz Bot Studio, imagines conversational A.I. working that way soon. \u201cYou turn on N.P.R. midinterview, but you can\u2019t for the life of you figure out who Terry Gross is talking to. You could say out loud: \u2018Who\u2019s she talking to? Who is it? What book are they talking about?\u2019 You can extend it to even seeing someone at a dinner party and saying privately, \u2018Remind me what Jill\u2019s husband\u2019s name is.\u2019\u2009\u201d The elderly might find these efficiencies particularly appealing, because aging eyes and reduced mobility can make screens harder to use. Patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease might find A.I. voice assistants happy to endlessly answer repeated questions, in a way that few human attendants could.There\u2019s another allure for businesses, of course: Talking bots don\u2019t need to be hired and then paid. Once coded, your bot can handle millions of customers simultaneously. We\u2019re already seeing this in customer service, when text chatbots answer rote questions or take orders. Yamato Transport, one of Japan\u2019s largest courier firms, uses a chatbot to schedule deliveries and answer questions about where packages are. Domino\u2019s Pizza runs a chatbot to take delivery orders online. American Eagle Outfitters has a bot that customers can converse with to figure out the perfect gift to buy for someone.Conversational bots thus could bring on a new wave of unemployment \u2014 or \u201creadjustment,\u201d to use the bloodless term of economics. Service workers, sales agents, telemarketers \u2014 it\u2019s not hard to imagine how millions of jobs that require social interaction, whether on the phone or online, could eventually be eliminated by code. Some economists argue that this might not necessarily result in a net loss of jobs, pointing to the example of automatic-teller machines. When A.T.M.s took off in the \u201980s, many predicted that bank-teller jobs would be decimated; indeed, individual bank branches did begin employing fewer tellers. But with those savings in pocket, banks greatly expanded the overall number of branches, so that the total population of tellers nationally rose for years. Of course, as economic history shows, the profits of automation are seldom shared with workers. Even if individual humans keep their jobs, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be paid more. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict,\u201d TD Bank\u2019s Khalfan told me, before adding that the company has committed to retrain workers when their jobs become redundant.Whatever impact talking software has on the labor market, it will surely extend the reach of algorithms more deeply into our lives. Ask Alexa or Siri a question, and you don\u2019t get a page of search results; just one Solomonic answer, selected by the A.I. After all, this is how spoken communication works: Just as nobody wants to listen to a voice mail message, nobody wants to hear a chatbot recite three minutes of data. Algorithms must narrow the field. So for anyone who has watched the inscrutable algorithms of Facebook or YouTube narrow our feeds by \u201crecommending\u201d outr\u00e9 conspiracy theorists, the notion of A.I. finding a new toehold in our cognitive life can be disturbing.\u201cI will literally buy whatever option Alexa puts first for me for paper towels,\u201d Keaney Anderson, the HubSpot V.P., told me. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to search through a million of them. I ask her for paper towels, she delivers. And that may be fine for paper towels, but is it fine for music? Is it fine for news sources?\u201d Talking to bots will also mean new opportunities for tech firms to collect data on what we\u2019re thinking, what we\u2019re doing, all day long. That includes our feelings: Researchers are working on \u201caffective\u201d sensing that enables chatbots to recognize our emotions. These are the familiar trade-offs that tech exacts in return for convenience; they\u2019re never value-free, as Evan Selinger, a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, notes. \u201cWhere are these things now appearing? They\u2019re appearing in our homes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe home has traditionally been the locus of privacy, right? This is where I shut out the rest of the world. This is where I look for my breathing room. This is my sanctuary, you know?\u201dIndeed, the home is where life happens, and that includes its traumas. Those have sometimes caught the large A.I. botmakers \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Microsoft \u2014 off guard. They expected their bots to be asked for jokes; they didn\u2019t, apparently, expect so many different cries for help. In 2016, a study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that, though most popular voice assistants responded to suicidal thoughts by providing help lines and other appropriate resources, when they were told \u201cI am being abused\u201d or \u201cI was raped,\u201d they generally replied with some variant of \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Human conversation being what it is, the list of personal crises one might confide is massive, likely outpacing the ability of botmakers to keep up.One person who bought a Jibo was Erin Partridge, an art therapist in Alameda, Calif., who works with the elderly. When she took Jibo on visits, her patients loved it. They laughed at its jokes; they asked it to sing tunes from the past. One man with advanced dementia called his daughter to describe Jibo in great detail. She found this remarkable, because he could rarely remember any single event so well and rarely initiated calls. Somehow Jibo had made an impression on him. Another resident declared that she \u201cloved\u201d Jibo, and put her arms around the robot. \u201cJust talk to me, don\u2019t talk to anybody else,\u201d she\u2019d tell it, asking, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m beautiful?\u201dTalking bots connect to us in ways that point-and-click software doesn\u2019t. For some technology critics, including Sherry Turkle, who does research on the psychology of tech at M.I.T., this raises ethical concerns. \u201cPeople are hard-wired with sort of Darwinian vulnerabilities, Darwinian buttons,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd these Darwinian buttons are pushed by this technology.\u201d That is, programmers are manipulating our emotions when they create objects that inquire after our needs.The precursor to today\u2019s bots, Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s ELIZA, was created at M.I.T. in 1966. ELIZA was a pretty crude set of prompts, but by simply asking people about their feelings, it drew them into deep conversations. Ordinary household appliances can now pull off the same trick. \u201cYour fridge will know if you\u2019re eating H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and if you sound sad, it\u2019ll say, \u2018Sherry, what\u2019s really going on?\u2019\u2009\u201d Turkle says. \u201cIs that what we want?\u201dWorse, she argues, talking bots could become a social crutch. Rather than pay humans to help the poor and powerless \u2014 students in overcrowded schools, elders in understaffed facilities, customers looking to speak to someone in huge institutions \u2014 we might instead provide software that pretends to care. \u201cThese places are so deprived that it\u2019s easy to argue that putting in some robots is better than nothing,\u201d Turkle says. \u201cThe harder thing is offering actual human support.\u201dA future in which only the wealthy have the luxury of being attended to by actual humans, while everyone else makes do with bots, would certainly be a dystopia. But botmakers themselves \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 are more sanguine. Cynthia Breazeal thinks the coming A.I. wave will actually help level the playing field between the well-off and everyone else. \u201cThe social-justice angle of this wave,\u201d she says, \u201cis that everyone will be able to afford a fabulous personal tutor because it\u2019s an A.I. tutor.\u201d Bots that help the elderly control their home and their lives will let them \u201cage in place\u201d at their own house, something that most older Americans would far prefer to a retirement home. \u201cWhen we talk to assisted-living facilities, they will tell us point blank, there is no way we can build enough facilities and hire enough people to meet the demand,\u201d Breazeal adds. \u201cThey call it the \u2018Silver Tsunami.\u2019\u2009\u201dPerhaps interacting with A.I.s will mean atrophy for our social muscles. If they\u2019re just machines, why bother with pleasantries? The scientific research on that is still unclear: Some studies have found people can actually be remarkably cordial to robots, while other research suggests we\u2019re liable to be rude and curt when we know our conversational partner isn\u2019t human. We could get used to bossing things around, a behavior that could bleed into everyday life. (Amazon, after fielding precisely these concerns from parents, created a politeness mode for its Echo devices that gently reminds its users to say \u201cplease.\u201d)Yet dealing with bots could also make life less prickly for humans on all sides of these small interactions. After all, today\u2019s customer-service calls are pretty bleak, even when you do talk to a live person. Call tech support for your laptop, and odds are you\u2019ll be talking to an employee who\u2019s required to read only from scripts \u2014 a human who is thus, paradoxically, forced to behave exactly like a bot.\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d says Steve Worswick, who worked for years providing I.T. support, talking people through problems like \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten my password.\u201d To keep himself engaged, in the evenings he taught himself to create bots, using an online tool made by an A.I. company called Pandorabots. Over 13 years, he coded a bot called Mitsuku, and wrote fully 350,000 lines for it; Mitsuku has won the annual Loebner Prize competition for the most \u201chumanlike\u201d bot four times.Soon enough Worswick had a new job: In 2018, he was hired by Pandorabots. Now Worswick, as a senior A.I. developer, imagines a world where the bots take over the spirit-crushing sort of conversational work that he used to do, releasing human beings to do something better with their time. Let the bots fix people\u2019s passwords. Real people, he says, have more interesting questions to answer.Clive Thompson is a contributing writer. His book \u201cCoders: The Making of a New Art and the Remaking of the World\u201d will be published in March.Advertisement"}

Its technology (powered by the blockchain!) would churn under dozens of independent newsrooms, its machinery creating a new, utopian model, free from the clutches of miserly businessmen or politically compromised publishers threatening to gum up the works.Civil\u2019s representatives said they could help fix two crises that afflict the media: one of trust and another of financial sustainability. Both, they posited, were within the power of the blockchain to heal.\u201cDo we think that by launching Civil, somebody that thinks that the press is the enemy of the people, are those people suddenly going to go, \u2018Oh, I see the light\u2019? Of course not,\u201d Ms. Schiller said before the token sale began. \u201cBut here\u2019s what we can do: If Civil is successful, it will allow people who are interested in trustworthy journalism, it will be a signal to them for what news organizations meet the criteria.\u201dSo it would be like Facebook, but journalism, but on the blockchain?\u201cAll cryptoeconomic public blockchains are effectively social applications,\u201d Mr. Iles said. \u201cYou need a crowd of people to agree to run it.\u201dWait. What?People who are in a strong position to understand what Civil is doing \u2014 either because they are experts on blockchain technology or because they work for one of its newsrooms \u2014 have openly admitted that they don\u2019t understand how the organization works. The rate of such statements only increased as Civil\u2019s token sale got underway in September.The collective confusion might have something to do with how the Civil token (called a CVL) is meant to work. In essence, that means: Buying CVL isn\u2019t meant to make you money.Or, as Mr. Iles put it: \u201cWe even think that we are going to be able to show people that it\u2019s more fun, it\u2019s more rewarding, to pay for the news using CVL tokens as opposed to cash.\u201d\u201cLook, we sometimes get asked, are we too early?\u201d Mr. Iles said. \u201cAnd the answer is absolutely yes. But you only are ever going to be too early or too late.\u201dCatherine Tucker, an MIT economist who has paid close attention to the rise of blockchain, said that she thought Civil had a targeting issue.\u201cIt is fundamentally a locked box,\u201d he said. \u201cThe token\u2019s not worth anything. The simple fact is, the token isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d\u201cTo me this is a big so what, frankly,\u201d he said of the sale\u2019s then-imminent failure. \u201cJust because we\u2019ve potentially set a price that was higher than the market was willing to bear right now is not a referendum on whether or not we\u2019re ever going to reach critical mass. It just means we potentially overshot now.\u201dIt is still unclear how Civil plans to alleviate people\u2019s confusion in order to achieve its mission. But the company is retrenching, thanks to an additional $3.5 million in funding from its original investor, the blockchain software company ConsenSys. (Civil will also offer refunds to frustrated individuals who want to return their tokens.) A new token sale is in the works, though details have not yet been released.Still, a problem remains: People don\u2019t buy into blockchain applications unless they can make money. There is no evidence that people want to use it to \u201cfix\u201d journalism. There is also no evidence that anyone really understands how that would even work. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Not a Soul Taking Control\u2019: How a Storm in the New York Area Upended the Night", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs residents recovered and demanded an explanation, The Times asked readers to share their experiences. We\u2019re continuing to collect information and provide updates as they become available.On Friday morning, the snow from an early winter storm started to melt, and people in and around New York City wanted answers from their government officials.But on Thursday night, they were just trying to get home. The region was crippled by snow and ice, with the effects ranging from felled tree branches in city neighborhoods to children trapped on school buses for hours. In New Jersey, one person died after an accident involving a train and a car, said Gov. Philip D. Murphy. It usually takes Brian G. Andersson about 45 minutes to travel the five miles from his office in one part of the Bronx to his home in Woodlawn.On Thursday night, the trip took 10 and a half hours. The journey started around 5 p.m., Mr. Andersson said. While he usually travels by subway or bus, he and his wife had planned to see a movie, so she drove to pick him up. They didn\u2019t make the screening. By the time Mr. Andersson left, the snow was heavy enough that they decided to head home. The problem was how to get there. As they plotted a route, Mr. Andersson and his wife looked on Waze and Google Maps to find the least-clogged streets. They didn\u2019t have much luck.\u201cYou were afraid to go anywhere else,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause when you consulted your devices, it was showing you these horrible red lines telling you you couldn\u2019t move.\u201dEventually, they detoured around Yankee Stadium and headed home. They wouldn\u2019t arrive until the next morning.\u201cThere were points when you wanted to get out of the car and scream your lungs out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was not a soul taking control and directing things.\u201dKim Hoyos, 23, who lives in Parsippany, N.J., left her office early to try and beat the rush. By the time she arrived at the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 4:45 p.m., she said, the crowds were massive and escalators to upper floors were blocked.With her phone slow and no working Wi-Fi, Ms. Hoyos wasn\u2019t sure whether her bus had been canceled or delayed. So she waited it out, staying at the bus station for more than two hours as she tried to get more information.As more people kept arriving, the whole area began to feel \u201cvery, very claustrophobic,\u201d she said. Then she started to see law enforcement officials closing doors.\u201cI got really freaked out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were trying to limit foot traffic, but there was no announcement I heard about that, so that was a bit anxiety-inducing.\u201dZeina Farhat, who takes a bus to Wayne, N.J., also said the crowds at Port Authority were intense. She arrived at 4 p.m., then waited in line for her bus for close to three hours, she said.When she was finally at the front of the queue, ready to board the next vehicle, the authorities shut down bus service so they could plow the roads, she said. After that, \u201cI did something I thought I would never do,\u201d Ms. Farhat wrote in an email. \u201cI sat on the Port Authority steps, and I considered myself lucky. Imagine how terrible your situation is to think of yourself as lucky to sit on the disease-infested floor of Port Authority.\u201dMs. Farhat finally got a bus home four and a half hours after she arrived. When she finally reached her car, it was blocked in by heaps of snow created by snow plows. Ms. Hoyos, on the other hand, eventually gave up on her commute and sought refuge with a friend in Brooklyn, where she spent the night.That part of her journey, she said, was easy.\u201cWe took the train to Brooklyn and grabbed an Uber,\u201d Ms. Hoyos said. \u201cNo trouble at all.\u201dChibani Bennasr, 39, a New York taxi driver, said he got stuck on a block of East 46th Street for an hour and a half after snow and falling tree branches stopped traffic.His passenger hopped out of the yellow cab after 20 minutes. That left Mr. Bennasr alone in the car, he said, where he played games on his phone to try to relieve the stress. \u201cThe whole city was a parking lot,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI see people getting frustrated. If I get frustrated, I\u2019ll probably have a heart attack.\u201dMr. Bennasr eventually called it a night and went home to Jersey City. It took him two more hours to get there.All told, he said, he lost $80 because of the storm.Leah Epstein was living in New Jersey during Hurricane Sandy. She has experienced major snowstorms and commuted through their aftermaths. And still, she said, she has never experienced anything like her drive home on Thursday.\u201cIt was hell on earth,\u201d she said.Ms. Epstein, a horse trainer, works at a farm about 10 miles from her home in High Bridge, N.J. If she times it right, she can make the trip in 18 minutes. On Thursday, it took her more than four hours.\u201cI was extremely grateful I had not had another cup of coffee before I left work,\u201d she said on Friday. \u201cBecause I was literally trying to figure out how, if I had to pee, I was going to get out of the car.\u201dAcross New York City, especially in Manhattan, people woke up on Friday to arboreal carnage.Trees and their limbs were strewn across streets and sidewalks. And even as the snow began to melt, the branches and piles of soggy leaves remained.City officials had received close to 1,700 service requests related to damaged trees by 11 a.m. on Friday, according to the New York City parks commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver. Of those requests, roughly 600 of them were for trees that had fallen.Most of the calls were concentrated in Manhattan, Mr. Silver said, which is not common for winter storms.\u201cQueens tends to be the borough with the most trees,\u201d he said.The abundance of fall foliage, usually a gift to city residents eager to soak up the last touches of nature before winter hits, was in part to blame. The wet snow adds extra weight, Mr. Silver said, causing stress to trees that is also exacerbated by the wind.As officials worked to clear blocked roads and walkways, the parks department urged people to stay out of city parks until winds had lessened and workers were able to clear debris.I got to an area with a small hill, and all hell broke loose. It was like a scene from \u201cMad Max\u201d! Cars were abandoned; people were out of the cars pushing others that were slipping back; and those that were on the other side of these cars were in jeopardy of being hit by sliding vehicles. My parents, who are in their 70s, were trapped on the Deegan last night for FIVE HOURS. Traffic was at a standstill. \u2026 They thankfully stayed in their car; others were spinning out in road conditions that seriously should not have caused such a nightmare.My normal commute that takes 40 minutes from Long Island City to Yonkers took four hours and 45 minutes. Much of that time was spent in the Bronx, where multiple cars were stuck on top of bridges causing complete gridlock. On highways, multiple cars were abandoned on the side of the road. I saw one plow truck during the entire drive.Winnie Hu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Are You Actually an M.D.?\u2019: A Black Doctor Is Questioned as She Intervenes on a Delta Flight", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI know I don\u2019t look the part,\u201d Dr. Stanford, 39, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cSo I just carry it with my driver\u2019s license at all times.\u201dThe flight attendant glanced at it and walked away, she said. As Dr. Stanford continued to try to calm the passenger, another flight attendant approached and asked to see the license. She, too, looked at it and walked away. Then the two flight attendants returned together and began another series of questions.\u201cAre you a head doctor?\u201d one of them asked. When Dr. Stanford said she did not understand the question, the flight attendant asked, \u201cAre you actually an M.D.?\u201dThen the second flight attendant spoke: \u201cIs this your license?\u201d When the doctor asked what she meant, the flight attendant repeated the question. \u201cWhy would I carry someone else\u2019s medical license?\u201d Dr. Stanford said she replied.The unguarded skepticism about medical professionals and race is something that Dr. Stanford, who graduated from the Medical College of Georgia in 2007, said she has often discussed with colleagues of color, who have swapped stories of being mistaken for support staff, or asked to remove trays or wipe up messes in the emergency room.\u201cThis is something that the medical community has embraced as a reality,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you Google a doctor, most of the pictures that come up are of a white man.\u201d\u201cThere are other people who look like me,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I should not be called into question about something I have worked for my entire life.\u201dDr. Stanford said she was not challenged for the rest of the two-hour flight. As they were descending, she said, one attendant told her they would not need to check her license anymore because \u201cit seems like you were able to handle everything.\u201dShe interpreted the encounter as biased because of the persistent questioning about whether she was a physician even after she had provided proof. \u201cIt never stopped,\u201d she said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t figure out why we were having this discussion.\u201dDelta apologized to Dr. Stanford on Wednesday and said it was investigating, according to the email it sent her.Mr. Black said the flight attendants working on Dr. Stanford\u2019s flight, Flight 5935, on Tuesday were employed by Republic Airline, a Delta Connection partner.\u201cMoving forward, we are following up with our connection carrier partner to ensure their employees understand and consistently apply the policy,\u201d he said in an email.Jon Austin, a spokesman for Republic, said in an email on Thursday that the airline was working with Delta to make sure its employees apply such policies. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to Dr. Stanford for her medical assistance onboard our Flight 5935 and are sorry for any misunderstanding that may have occurred during her exchange with our in-flight crew.\u201dDr. Cross, who did not have her medical license with her, told The New York Times in 2016 that when she volunteered to help, a flight attendant demanded \u201ccredentials\u201d and confirmation that she was an \u201cactual\u201d physician, nurse or medical personnel.Dr. Cross said she had previously encountered assumptions that being a black woman, she was not a doctor. \u201cI think minorities in general, especially in my field of practice \u2014 I feel that they are always questioned and always assumed to be the nurse or the nurse\u2019s aide or here as part of the janitorial team or ancillary staff,\u201d she said.On Thursday, Dr. Cross said not much had changed since that year, even after her residency training ended.Now at Memorial Hermann Pearland Hospital in Pearland, Tex., with regular patients, she is still occasionally mistaken for support staff.\u201cI think that it is just going to be a lifelong battle,\u201d Dr. Cross said.Dr. Stanford appeared with Dr. Cross on a panel about gender and bias in medicine on Oct. 19, at a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Medical Society.

I sail through the turnstile.But wait \u2014 did one of my neighbors drop the card?The next day, I put a sign up in the lobby: \u201cLost MetroCard?\u201d I include my number.An hour later, I get a text from a woman named Catherine.

Her obituary was included this week in our \u201cOverlooked\u201d series, which tells the stories of remarkable women who never got an obituary in The Times.Her success followed a life of hardship.

In 1978, she finished a half marathon in 1:15:58, setting a world record for women in that race at the time.Now that\u2019s inspiring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In U.S.-India Trade, Trump Sees Only Harley-Davidson", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 When it comes to trade, it often seems that India and the United States are playing a perplexing game of multidimensional chess.\u201cThe sanctions threat and the tariffs are in many ways linked,\u201d said Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the school of international affairs at O. P. Jindal Global University outside New Delhi.Yet Mr. Trump has voiced little interest in such policy questions or the rounds of negotiations that have kept the two countries from an all-out trade war. Instead, he has been publicly riveted by one small pawn in the game: India\u2019s tariffs on a few hundred high-end Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold here each year.Three times this year when Mr. Trump brought up the American trade relationship with India, he complained about the import duties \u2014 currently 50 percent \u2014 that India levies on Harleys and other foreign-made motorcycles.Mr. Trump\u2019s single-minded focus on Harleys has mystified trade experts in both countries.Most of the 3,000 Harleys sold in India last year did not incur any tariffs. That\u2019s because they were cheaper, low-powered models made in a factory outside New Delhi. Even many of the fancier bikes sold here were assembled from kits of imported parts, which are taxed at 15 percent, not 50 percent.Harley-Davidson\u2019s biggest problem in India is a lack of demand.Harleys are bulky and heat up a rider\u2019s legs, making them a poor fit for the country\u2019s traffic-choked roads and sweltering climate. And they are expensive. With an average annual income of $1,700, people here overwhelmingly favor small, cheap bikes, some of which cost less than $1,000. Harley\u2019s iconic big cruisers cost more than most cars, with its top model exceeding $87,000 in Mumbai after all taxes and licensing fees.Darryl Mathias, operations manager for the Mumbai dealership, Seven Islands Harley-Davidson, said sales had dropped about 50 percent in the past two years. He blamed rising gasoline prices and the Indian government\u2019s efforts to crack down on cash transactions more than the tariffs.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to show their wealth,\u201d he said.American officials say the president initially seized on the Harley tariffs after the Milwaukee company\u2019s chief executive, Matthew Levatich, complained to him about them. When Mr. Trump raised the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi this year, India dropped the tariffs from 75 percent to 50 percent.Harley-Davidson executives declined interview requests. In a statement, the company said it \u201csupports President Trump\u2019s efforts to lower tariffs and make American manufacturers more competitive.\u201dIndian and American government officials also declined to elaborate about the trade relationship, citing active negotiations and the pending decisions on tariffs and sanctions.For most officials in the two countries, the trade relationship is much more complicated than just motorcycles.The United States and India have been arguing over trade since the Obama administration, when they tangled over American exports of eggs and solar panels to India as well as India\u2019s weak protections for foreign intellectual property such as drug formulas.Trade hawks in the Trump administration such as Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, have made the $27.3 billion trade deficit in goods and services with India a key issue. American dairy farmers, for example, complain that they do not have fair access to India\u2019s markets because of high tariffs and India\u2019s requirement that all milk comes from cows that have not been fed the internal organs of other animals. That milk certification is important to Hindus, many of whom are vegetarians, but many American farmers cannot meet it.\u201cWe need to have reciprocal trade,\u201d Gilbert B. Kaplan, the American under secretary of commerce for international trade, said at a conference hosted by the U.S.-India Business Council here in September.This year, India irked American companies by increasing tariffs on products ranging from shoes to mobile phones to help balance its budget and stem a fall in the value of the rupee.Separately, the country announced that it would raise tariffs on 29 categories of American goods, including nuts, apples and finished metal products, in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.The items targeted influential industries such as almond growers, who last year shipped $651 million of the nuts to India, their largest market. But India deferred the start of the tariffs from June to September and then to Nov. 2. The government may well delay the tariffs again, Mr. Chaulia said, to assess the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections in the United States and what effect that would have on the American negotiating position.India, for its part, wants the United States to reduce tariffs on its exports of clothing and textiles, for which it pays higher duties than neighboring countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan. The Modi administration is also adamant about maintaining its hefty subsidies for homegrown agricultural products to court Indian farmers, who are a key voting bloc.Looming over everything are geopolitical concerns.In addition to continuing oil purchases from Iran, Mr. Modi signed a deal with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, on Oct. 5 to buy Russian S-400 antiaircraft missile systems. The $5.2 billion purchase violates American trade sanctions against Russia and will eventually trigger penalties for India unless Mr. Trump approves a waiver.Trade experts predict that neither country will be quick to antagonize the other.\u201cUnder no circumstance would the Indian government give up its close relationship with the U.S. government,\u201d said Biswajit Dhar, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi who has represented the Indian government on trade issues and formerly served on the board of the Export-Import Bank of India.Mr. Chaulia said India was also clear about its economic commitment to Iran. India has invested heavily there, including hundreds of millions of dollars in the seaport of Chabahar in southeastern Iran. The Trump administration wants a regime change in Iran \u2014 and India does not, he said.Eliminating the Harley tariffs is a way to ease the trade drama and please the American president, Mr. Chaulia said. \u201cAll Trump needs is to declare a win,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about the nitty-gritty.\u201dAlan Rappeport and Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington, and Maria Abi-Habib from New Delhi.

In the past week, towns have been burned out of existence, people have fled the raging flames, and ashes have been falling from a tangerine sky.As 2018 comes to a close, that edge \u2014 a sense that the end times are near \u2014 has never been more obvious to those in California\u2019s tech business. And while that feeling is nowhere near comparable to the suffering of those fleeing and battling the fires that are burning away the Western landscape, the toxic smoke is a bleak backdrop and an apt metaphor for where Silicon Valley now finds itself.Much of the mess, of course, has been emanating from one company: Facebook. The realization of how much the social media giant has screwed up has dropped slowly, but now we know.In addition to showing how Facebook\u2019s leaders failed to deal forthrightly with the situation, the piece has numerous examples of what I can only call dirty tricks to hurt rival companies and deflect public attention. And that is on Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chief operating officer, as well as a panoply of top executives.One is Facebook\u2019s man in Washington, Joel Kaplan, who could not seem to make any decision that was not a perplexing misjudgment. This was a practice he continued by sitting behind Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearings as his chief cheerleader. Conflict of interest much? Very much.The overall sense of this year is that the brilliant digital minds who told us they were changing the world for the better might have miscalculated.Actually no one wonders that anymore, which is why it\u2019s probably time to think about where the industry goes from here. While I can be hard on tech, I still have hope that it can regain its innovation, inspiration and sunny approach to the future.To do this, I have five suggestions:The fact that no one seems to get fired for anything at these companies is really quite breathtaking. Techies are fond of the obviously false bromide that failure is O.K. If it is so fine, one wonders why no one is being held publicly responsible for anything, aside from the tiresome apology tours that are on replay in Silicon Valley. Privacy breaches at Yahoo and Facebook and Google and everywhere? So sorry. Payoffs to alleged sexual harassers all over the system? So sorry. Questionable financing? So sorry. Yeah, I am sorry that they are so sorry, too, but actions should follow words.After trying several times to get an answer from him, I got frustrated: \u201cWhat kind of responsibility do you feel?\u201d I said I would feel sick to my stomach to know that people died possibly \u201cbecause of something I invented. What does that make you feel like? What do you do when you see that? What do you do yourself? What\u2019s your emotion?\u201dMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s answer left me cold. And also more than a little worried for the future of his company. It\u2019s bad enough not to be able to anticipate disaster; it\u2019s worse, after disaster strikes, to not be able to reflect on how it happened. \u201cI mean, my emotion is feeling a deep sense of responsibility to try to fix the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a \u2026 that\u2019s the most productive stance.\u201dBut it\u2019s not the most productive stance.

That was the future Silicon Valley\u2019s greatest claim to fame in the 1920s, when it was a sleepy landscape of fruit orchards and farms far removed from the nation\u2019s industrial might. Seattle was a city of fishing and timber, where a young entrepreneur named Bill Boeing had so few customers for his airplanes that he briefly pivoted to making furniture. The most innovative companies in the world clustered in the ferociously inventive cities of the East and Midwest \u2014 cars in Detroit; cash registers in Dayton, Ohio; light bulbs in Cleveland.The high-tech geography began to flip in the 1950s, as electronics and aerospace boomed. Before the Eisenhower era was over, cities across the country and across the globe had started racing to capture some of the West Coast\u2019s high-tech magic. Silicon Valley and Seattle are now a long way from biplanes and prunes.So what can the new HQ2 city or cities learn from high-tech history?First and foremost: Yes, tech companies are a prize worth chasing. They offer jobs that are well-paying and productive, and attract a highly educated work force. Under the right conditions \u2014 the presence of strong research universities, access to capital and a quality of life that draws people in and keeps them there \u2014 a well-rooted tech community can seed several successive generations of companies, with the entrepreneurs of one era becoming mentors and investors and civic philanthropists in the next.This is what happened in Boston, in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, whose tech scene includes not only Amazon and Microsoft but also a wide variety of spinoff companies, as well as Facebook, Google, Alibaba and Baidu.San Francisco and Seattle were ill prepared for the tech wave that hit in the past decade. Current responses range from the promising but piecemeal (Amazon subsidizing additional city bus service in Seattle) to the impractical and divisive (San Francisco considering a ban on employee cafeterias in new office buildings to force tech workers to patronize local restaurants). Although tech companies and cities often find themselves fiercely opposed in these debates \u2014 most hotly in the recent attempt by Seattle to tax large employers like Amazon to pay for homeless services \u2014 there is some recognition on both sides that the current patterns are unsustainable.This means breaking out of the bubble and redefining the corporate bottom line to include measures that reduce inequality, sustain existing small businesses and protect housing affordability, and, yes, even supporting cities in raising the tax revenue they need.This isn\u2019t an impossible dream. The secret of Silicon Valley wasn\u2019t tax breaks and cheap real estate; it was a postwar era of generous public spending on research and education, as well as on affordable housing and public infrastructure. These investments were designed to help everyone, but they were critical to helping tech flourish.No place or industry rules forever. Ask Detroit, once the most innovative place in America. The new capitals of tech should not take this prosperity for granted.Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Not the mild suspension of disbelief wherein 23-year-olds play high school sophomores on TV \u2014 some things will never change \u2014 but a more drastic shift appears to be underway onstage.The most visible current example of this can be found at the Shubert Theater, where three pivotal roles in \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d \u2014 Dill, Jem and the play\u2019s narrator, Scout \u2014 are being played by performers double and triple the characters\u2019 ages.What\u2019s the secret to success?

{"Headline": "Good Cheap Flights Still Exist. Here\u2019s How to Find Them.", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you\u2019re willing to search, you can get a vacation deal. You\u2019ll even be able to check a bag at no extra cost. Over the past decade, airlines have developed a reputation for nickel-and-diming their passengers. For the most part, the days of free checked baggage and free seat assignments are long gone. Even the days of free carry-on bags seem to be dwindling. And tickets are still expensive enough to be a major purchase for most fliers, especially around the holidays.We spoke by phone recently about the best ways to search for those fares. A transcript of our conversation, which has been condensed and edited for clarity, follows.Absolutely. You can definitely find cheap fares that include bags and seat assignments and, depending on where you\u2019re headed, even a meal. It\u2019s all about flexibility. You need to be flexible about what date you\u2019re traveling, or even the time of day. Business travelers don\u2019t have that flexibility, so if you fly at times that business travelers aren\u2019t on the road, like Tuesday or Saturday nights, you could find a better fare.Avoiding peak holiday travel days will really make a difference. The Sunday after Thanksgiving will be probably one of the most expensive days to fly of the year. Flexibility is key.My go-to site whenever I\u2019m beginning my search for airfare is Google Flights. You can find a flight on Google Flights almost as easily as any Google search, and you can see pricing for months at a time. The other great benefit of using Google Flights is you can set fare alerts. To do that, it\u2019s really straightforward: You put in your origin, destination and the dates you want to travel and choose the flights you want. If you\u2019re logged into your Gmail account, click \u201ctrack\u201d and you\u2019ll get an email whenever the fare changes. Google will also email you if it\u2019s expecting the fare to change based on historical data.Typically, we see domestic fares increase considerably within two weeks of departure. Of course, there are exceptions to that rule. If an airline has many seats available on a flight that\u2019s going to mostly appeal to leisure travelers, you may even see fares drop on the day of travel. International flights are more likely to drop or stay the same. It\u2019s not unusual to see international airfares stay the same while domestic airfares shoot through the roof. That\u2019s really where frequent-flier miles come into play, for those last-minute flights. Airlines may not drop the cash price, but they may open up awards seats. The general rule of thumb is two weeks out unless you\u2019re traveling during a super peak period.I like to travel in early January, right after the Christmas-New Year\u2019s rush. The first couple of weeks in January tend to be a slower period. As you get closer to Presidents\u2019 Day in the United States, that\u2019s another peak period because it\u2019s usually a three- or four-day weekend.In early January, you can find some great deals both on flights and on hotels. It doesn\u2019t really matter where you go during that period. Caribbean, domestic flights, ski destinations \u2014 those are all accessible.I like to catch the shoulder season, especially if it\u2019s a ski trip. Skiing in Colorado in March can be a great experience. Temperatures are bearable, hotels are cheap, and you\u2019re not dealing with a million people on line for the lift. It\u2019s a challenge. In that case, I recommend falling back on frequent-flier miles if you have them, and booking far in advance. If you know you have to fly on specific days, check award availability almost a year out. This is the time of year to be planning next year\u2019s holiday season trips.You can find great deals even during peak periods to places people are less likely to go. A lot of people are not going to want to take their entire family to Europe for a long weekend. Those flights are going to have tremendous value. If you have no flexibility, that\u2019s when that price tracker from Google is really going to come in handy. Basic economy fares pose quite a challenge to families, and really to all travelers. You really don\u2019t have any flexibility. There\u2019s no way on some of these fares to select your seat in advance. On United, you can\u2019t even bring a carry-on bag. Any savings that you got are essentially erased by the carry-on bag fees. Even if you do pay for a carry-on, you may not have space for it on the plane, so there\u2019s not much upside. Except with American \u2014 on last-minute flights, a basic economy fare can be hundreds of dollars lower than regular economy fares. There can be value in basic economy fares, but it\u2019s rare to come across a ticket that actually makes sense.If you do end up booking a low-cost carrier like Spirit or Frontier, keep all the fees in mind. You may have to dig a little bit to see the exclusions, and you\u2019re definitely going to have to dig to see the fees. Spirit, for example, charges $100 to bring the carry-on on the plane if you haven\u2019t paid for it in advance. You could end up paying quite a bit more than a flight on a full-service carrier.Look at vacation packages. If you know you\u2019re going to need a hotel room as well, all of the major carriers have vacation deals. The price of a package including a hotel can be less than the price of the flights alone. On a trans-Atlantic flight with a lie-flat business seat, you can save a couple thousand dollars by booking your hotel through the airline. Advertisement"}

Instead, the man in charge of arguably the most influential company in the world is Sundar Pichai, a soft-spoken engineer who grew up in Chennai, India. Mr. Pichai was a voracious reader as a boy, and attended the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, then Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, where he received advanced degrees. After stints at Applied Materials and McKinsey, he joined Google in 2004.

He was made chief executive in 2015, and joined the board of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, last year. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in New York. Tell me about growing up in Chennai. There was a simplicity to my life, which was very nice compared with today\u2019s world. We lived in a kind of modest house, shared with tenants. We would sleep on the living room floor. There was a drought when I was growing up, and we had anxiety. Even now, I can never sleep without a bottle of water beside my bed. Other houses had refrigerators, and then we finally got one. It was a big deal.But I had a lot of time to read. I was processing a lot. I read whatever I could get my hands on. I read Dickens. Friends, playing street cricket, reading books \u2014 that was kind of the totality of life. But you never felt lacking for anything. What was it like coming over to attend Stanford? It was the first time I had ever been on a plane. I always wanted to be in the Valley. I kind of knew that\u2019s where everything happened.

I was so wrapped up in that, that to some extent I didn\u2019t understand there was a much bigger shift happening with the internet.You started at Google 14 years ago. Does it still feel like the same company you joined?When I first joined Google I was struck by the fact that it was a very idealistic, optimistic place. I still see that idealism and optimism a lot in many things we do today. But the world is different. Maybe there\u2019s more realism of how hard some things are. We\u2019ve had more failures, too. But there\u2019s always been a strong streak of idealism in the company, and you still see it today.What\u2019s your approach to technology and screen time with your family?

So, I\u2019m always asking the question, \u201cWhy would it be any different this time?\u201d Having said that, I do realize the change that\u2019s happening now is much faster than ever before. My son still doesn\u2019t have a phone.Why does it seem so easy for tech companies like Google to ban pornography and graphic violence from social media platforms, but so much harder for them to root out propaganda, misinformation and disturbing content aimed at kids?There are areas where society clearly agrees what is O.K. and not O.K., and then there are areas where it is hard as a society to draw the line. What is the difference between freedom of speech on something where you feel you\u2019re being discriminated against by another group, versus hate speech? The U.S. and Europe draw the line differently on this question in a very fundamental way. We\u2019ve had to defend videos which we allow in the U.S. but in Europe people view as disseminating hate speech. Should people be able to say that they don\u2019t believe climate change is real? Or that vaccines don\u2019t work? It\u2019s just a genuinely hard problem. We\u2019re all using human reviewers, but human reviewers make mistakes, too.How do you approach this in China, where Google is considering returning to the market with a search engine? People are walking out because they want us to improve and they want us to show we can do better. We\u2019re acknowledging and understanding we clearly got some things wrong. And we have been running the company very differently for a while now. But going through a process like that, you learn a lot. For example, we have established channels by which people can report issues. But those processes are much harder on the people going through it than we had realized.Is there a morale problem at the company?There\u2019s a lot of challenges in the world, and given what Google does, we feel like we are on the cutting edge of many of these issues. But when people say, \u201cWow, there\u2019s a lot of challenges,\u201d I always say, \u201cThere\u2019s no better time to be alive.\u201d I go through the exercise of placing myself at different times in the world. If you were alive during World War I, or influenza, or the Great Depression, and there\u2019s World War II to come. If you were in the 1960s, and Martin Luther King was shot dead, and R.F.K. would later get shot dead, and we were in Vietnam and there was a Cold War and a Cuban missile crisis \u2014 there is no better time to be alive.But having said that, I think as humanity we\u2019re increasingly dealing with bigger things. As a company like Google, we have a deeper mission, and we feel the weight of that on our shoulders. I feel like people are energized and people want to change and make the world better.Do you worry that Silicon Valley is suffering from groupthink and losing its edge?There is nothing inherent that says Silicon Valley will always be the most innovative place in the world. There is no God-given right to be that way. But I feel confident that right now, as we speak, there are quietly people in the Valley working on some stuff which we will later look back on in 10 years and feel was very profound. We feel we\u2019re on the cusp of technologies, just like the internet before.Do you still feel like Silicon Valley has retained that idealism that struck you when you arrived here?There\u2019s still that optimism. But the optimism is tempered by a sense of deliberation. Things have changed quite a bit. You know, we deliberate about things a lot more, and we are more thoughtful about what we do. But there\u2019s a deeper thing here, which is: Technology doesn\u2019t solve humanity\u2019s problems. It was always na\u00efve to think so. Technology is an enabler, but humanity has to deal with humanity\u2019s problems. I think we\u2019re both over-reliant on technology as a way to solve things and probably, at this moment, over-indexing on technology as a source of all problems, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "NASA Chooses Private Companies for Future Moon Landings", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNine companies will vie for more than $2 billion dollars to build small landers to carry science experiments to the lunar surface.Astronauts may one day set foot on the moon again, and small robotic spacecraft will be there waiting for them. NASA announced on Thursday that it had selected nine companies that will compete for billions of dollars in contracts to take small payloads for the agency to the surface of the moon.Cumulatively, the contracts could be worth up to $2.6 billion over 10 years. Flights could begin as soon as next year, and NASA officials are aiming for two a year, or about 20 in all.Rather than relying on NASA engineers to design the spacecraft, the space agency is publishing the capabilities it needs and requesting proposals from companies to provide those services.In this approach, NASA would just be one of many customers, Mr. Bridenstine said. The companies could also carry commercial cargo. For the new NASA program, called Commercial Lunar Payload Services, the moon landers would be far too small to carry people, but they could ferry scientific experiments to the lunar surface. They could also help NASA scout and study potential locations for bases, particularly in the eternally-shadowed craters near the moon\u2019s poles that are filled with frozen water.Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA\u2019s associate administrator for the science directorate, said there were already many experiments that scientists know they want to send to the moon. He gave the example of retroreflectors \u2014 essentially, fancy mirrors that reflect light in the direction it came from. The Apollo astronauts deployed them during their moon landings, but placing additional reflectors on the moon would enable precise measurements of its gravity.The companies, a mix of established NASA contractors and space start-ups, are: Astrobotic Technology of Pittsburgh; Deep Space Systems of Littleton, Colo.; Draper of Cambridge, Mass.; Firefly Aerospace of Cedar Park, Tex.; Intuitive Machines of Houston; Lockheed Martin of Littleton, Colo.; Masten Space Systems of Mojave, Calif.; Moon Express of Cape Canaveral, Fla.; Orbit Beyond of Edison, N.J.Most of the teams said they would not be ready until 2021. NASA officials said they did not expect all of the companies to succeed. Rather, they likened the effort to high-risk, high-reward bets by venture capital investors.Whenever they get to the moon, they may not be alone. Advertisement"}

A treat for fans of neoclassical architecture, perhaps, but the overall effect is more glowering fortress than high-school hangout.Arianna Reyes, a ninth grader from Maspeth and one of the younger members of the school group, recalled her first impression a few days later. \u201cI hadn\u2019t ever been to a court,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve only seen pictures of it and read about it. I felt like I was kind of small, and there was something really big going on.\u201d\u201cHow can we expect the public to support the judiciary and the Constitution and the rule of law when they know so little about it?\u201d Judge Katzmann asked, sitting in his 24th-floor chambers before heading downstairs to meet the students.\u201cThere needs to be a shared understanding of the principles underlying our governmental system,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf that is lost, then what I worry about is that our support for our institutions will go under.\u201dAfter the students finished their tour, Judge Katzmann told them about his family, and about his own experience growing up in the city, attending public schools in Queens and commuting by bus and subway, just as they do. He was joined by Victor Marrero, a senior district judge and co-chairman of the civic-education initiative, who attended public school in the Bronx; and Richard Sullivan, who had been confirmed as a judge for the appeals court only days before, and whose parents grew up a block apart from each other in Queens.As the judges spoke about their lives and various paths to the court, the students, who started out nervous and quiet, relaxed and began to ask questions \u2014 the reaction Judge Katzmann was hoping for. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve done moot courts, I take the students back to the robing room and I say, \u2018Put on the robe,\u2019 \u201d he said later. \u201cAnd these are often kids of color.

Google, really?\u201d In Dublin, dozens filled a sidewalk. And in Silicon Valley, thousands poured out of office buildings into a common outdoor area and chanted: \u201cStand up! Fight back!\u201dSimilar scenes played out in other cities around the world \u2014 from Singapore and Hyderabad, India, to Berlin, Zurich, London, Chicago and Seattle \u2014 as Google employees held a wave of walkouts on Thursday to protest the internet company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment.\u201cI am here because what you read in The New York Times are a small sampling of the thousands of stories we all have,\u201d Meredith Whittaker, a Google employee who helped organize the walkout, said to a crowd of colleagues in New York. After she called out the company\u2019s \u201cpattern of unethical and thoughtless decision-making,\u201d protesters chanted, \u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201dThe walkouts capped a turbulent week for Google. After The Times article was published, the company revealed that it had fired 48 people for sexual harassment over the last two years and that none had received an exit package. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Larry Page, a co-founder of Google and the chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet, apologized. And one of the executives whom Alphabet continued employing after he was accused of harassment resigned, with no exit package.That led some Google employees to call for a walkout. The organizers also produced a list of demands for changing how Google handles sexual harassment, including ending its use of private arbitration in such cases. They also asked for the publication of a transparency report on instances of sexual harassment, further disclosures of salaries and compensation, an employee representative on the company board, and a chief diversity officer who could speak directly to the board.Mr. Pichai, who spoke at The Times\u2019s DealBook conference in New York on Thursday, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult time. There is anger and frustration within the company. We all feel it. I feel it, too.\u201dHe said Google had not lived up to the high bar it set for itself. It has since \u201cevolved as a company,\u201d Mr. Pichai added, and he expressed support for the employees who participated in the walkout. He promised that Google would take steps to address the issues they raised.The walkouts, which started in Asia and spread across continents, were planned for around 11 a.m. in local time zones. Many employees \u2014 both men and women \u2014 posted photos on social media to chronicle their experiences. The images showed dozens of people gathered in different locations, chanting slogans and displaying signs. One read: \u201cWhat do I do at Google? I work hard every day so the company can afford $90,000,000 payouts to execs who sexually harass my co-workers.\u201dBrenda Salinas, a Google employee in London, did not go to work on Thursday because of an injury but expressed her support for the walkout.\u201cLast week was one of the hardest weeks of my yearlong tenure at Google, but today is the best day,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I have thousands of colleagues all over the world who, like me, are committed to creating a culture where everyone is treated with dignity.\u201dMs. Salinas also said contract workers were included in the demands from the organizers of the protest. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t get talked about enough in tech,\u201d she said.Claire Stapleton, a product marketing manager for YouTube, which is owned by Google, who helped call for the walkout, said the number of employees who had turned out at protests exceeded her expectations.\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ve opened a conversation about structural change here and elsewhere,\u201d she said.In New York, elevator-loads of workers emerged from the company\u2019s Chelsea office and congregated in a nearby park.

{"Headline": "U.S. Declines to Sign Declaration Discouraging Use of Cyberattacks", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Reflecting reluctance by the Trump administration to limit its options for using offensive and defensive cyberweapons, the United States declined on Monday to sign a vaguely worded international call to protect civilians against cyberattacks and discourage digital meddling in elections.The United States was one of only a few Western nations that chose not to sign on to the nonbinding declaration, which was released by France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, during the Paris Peace Forum, timed to the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.The declaration, the \u201cParis Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace,\u201d was signed by 51 countries, more than 130 companies and 90 universities and nongovernmental groups, and was the latest in a series of efforts to move toward what some call a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention.\u201dJust as the original Geneva Convention prohibits aiming attacks at civilians, the Paris statement would prohibit \u201cindiscriminate or systemic harm to individuals and critical infrastructure,\u201d such as shutting down an electric grid.It also included a call to \u201cprevent malign interference by foreign actors aimed at undermining electoral processes though malicious cyberactivities.\u201dAll members of the European Union signed the agreement. Australia and Turkey joined the United States in declining.Mr. Macron aimed the accord largely at democracies, which meant that the countries most often accused of conducting state-sponsored attacks \u2014 Russia, China, North Korea and Iran \u2014 did not participate in the process.Israel, which along with the United States conducted the most sophisticated cyberattack in history, the Stuxnet attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program, also declined to sign.The United States did not say why it did not sign the accord, and one diplomat, who would not allow the use of his name because he is not authorized to speak publicly on policy issues, said that it was possible that Washington may sign the principles at a later date.But if past debates over setting norms of behavior for cyberspace are a guide, American officials are leery of any kind of agreement that might make illegal the types of activity \u2014 like espionage, data manipulation or attacks on infrastructure \u2014 that the United States may want to use in a future conflict.Elections are an interesting example. Congress and many others have condemned the 2016 Russian attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the private email accounts of senior officials in Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. But the United States has interfered in foreign elections before, including Italy in the 1940s and Iran and Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s, and some officials say that no American president should be forced to give up that tool if it could prevent a war.Similarly, the Pentagon worries about commitments to avoid using cyberattacks as a prelude to military action. The United States had a secret program, code-named \u201cNitro Zeus,\u201d which called for turning off the power grid in much of Iran if the two countries had found themselves in a conflict over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Such a use of cyberweapons is now a key element in war planning by all of the major world powers.Still, the fact that companies and governments came together on any kind of vision for keeping the internet free of malicious activity was viewed by some key players as a step forward.\u201cMost of the world\u2019s democracies are rallying around the need to protect all democracies from cyberattacks,\u201d said Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, who has been among the most vocal in arguing for a digital Geneva Convention. \u201cYou have to start by building a strong coalition among the democracies themselves.\u201dMuch of the statement of principles calls for restrictions on actions Washington has also condemned in the past: the theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets and industrial designs, and attacks on \u201cthe public core of the internet.\u201dThe United States has indicted Chinese, North Korean, Iranian and Russian hackers for offenses including theft of industrial secrets and for attacking Sony Pictures Entertainment to prevent the distribution of a movie that North Korea found offensive. Nonetheless, the administration\u2019s aversion to international agreements in general may have made it leery of joining the announcement on Monday.Governments were outnumbered by companies and nongovernmental groups as signatories. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and I.B.M. all signed on. Three of the five countries that are part of what is known as the \u201cFive Eyes,\u201d \u2014 the English-speaking victors of World War II who share intelligence information \u2014 also signed: Britain, Canada and New Zealand.Advertisement"}

Kavanaugh and his policies.\u201cCindy is so important, so respected,\u201d Mr. Trump said after taking the stage in Tupelo.And, he noted, her election would further tip the Senate in Republicans\u2019 favor. \u201cIf we win tomorrow,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll be at 53-47.\u201dHis presence in Mississippi was intended to boost Ms. Hyde-Smith, who has struggled to unite her party and move beyond a series of controversial statements, including one in which she said if a particular supporter invited her \u201cto a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row.\u201dIn the hours before Mr. Trump arrived, the race took a disquieting turn with the daybreak discovery of at least two nooses and five handmade signs outside the State Capitol. \u201cWe\u2019re hanging nooses to remind people that times haven\u2019t changed,\u201d one of the signs read.But Mr. Trump brushed off the controversy over Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks.\u201cReally it was something that was sad and it was a little flip,\u201d the president told reporters after a round table on criminal justice legislation in Gulfport. \u201cShe called me, she said, \u2018I said something that I meant exactly very different,\u2019 and I heard an apology loud and clear.\u201dBy some Republican estimations, Mr. Trump\u2019s appearances were a signal of how much Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s standing has eroded in recent weeks and a reminder of just how far Mr. Trump will go to secure the largest possible Republican conference in Congress, particularly in the face of a Democratic House majority come January.Justice Kavanaugh \u201cwas beaten up so badly and so unfairly, but we got through it,\u201d Mr. Trump said in Tupelo, while casting doubt on the accounts of the women who accused him of assault. \u201cThere were a lot of lies.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to start over in 2019,\u201d Mr. Graham told the crowd in Tupelo, \u201cand if you like Kavanaugh, there\u2019s more coming.\u201dBeyond reminding the crowd about battles back in Washington, Mr. Trump briefly sharpened his focus on Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s \u201cfar left\u201d opponent, Mr. Espy, who was also secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton.For his part, Mr. Espy made only a passing reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s trip in a speech on Monday night at an event that toggled between soaring gospel music and get-out-the-vote messages.\u201cThere are some who chose to go to a rally somewhere else tonight,\u201d Mr. Espy said at a church in Jackson. \u201cI\u2019d rather be at this kind of rally because we\u2019re here seeking inspiration.\u201dAs he has done frequently in the past, the president sought to tie Mr. Espy to favorite adversaries in Washington \u2014 among them, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders, and Representative Maxine Waters of California.\u201cYou have deep-state bad people,\u201d Mr. Trump warned in Biloxi. \u201cYou have a lot of phony stuff going on.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to support Ms. Hyde-Smith, a newcomer to national politics who was appointed this year to her Senate seat by Mississippi\u2019s governor, is perhaps a surer bet than his effort to fortify Mr. Moore, among the most controversial Alabama politicians since the segregationist George C. Wallace was governor.Still, the nooses and signs at the Capitol were a chilling reminder of how contentious the Mississippi race has become. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the nooses or the signs, and Gov. Phil Bryant said that he had asked the F.B.I. to assist with the state\u2019s inquiry.The nooses were a particularly searing display in a state that had 654 African-American lynching victims from 1877 to 1950, according to research published by the Equal Justice Initiative. And two of the placards appeared to refer to the election: \u201cWe want leaders who give honest apologies and can be humble enough to admit when they\u2019re wrong!!!!!\u201d one said. And another: \u201cOn Tuesday November 27th thousands of Mississippians will vote for a senator. We need someone who respects lives of lynch victims.\u201dRepublicans noted that Ms. Hyde-Smith had been enlisting Mr. Trump\u2019s help long before controversy swelled around her candidacy.\u201cHe\u2019s seen as a positive influence by most Mississippians, certainly people who would be inclined to vote for Cindy Hyde-Smith,\u201d said State Representative Greg Snowden, the second-ranking Republican in the Mississippi House of Representatives.A Democratic colleague agreed.\u201cHe is going to have some effect because the people who are Trump supporters are so mesmerized by him, they overlook all of his warts,\u201d said State Representative D. Stephen Holland of Tupelo, who owns a funeral home near the airport that hosted one of Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies. \u201cThe real question is whether he\u2019ll get their spirits fired up, and will they actually go to the polls?\u201dEmily Cochrane reported from Tupelo and Biloxi, and Alan Blinder from Jackson, Miss.

It\u2019s not exactly like you\u2019re going to review the DMV to decide where you\u2019re going to get your driver\u2019s license.\u201d\u201cPeople like to be a part of a community, and who doesn\u2019t like making other people laugh?\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to share that with other people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Asked for Examples of Election Misinformation. You Delivered.", "Date": "2018-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReaders submitted more than 4,000 examples of misinformation. Here are the different types being spread this election season.Readers responded. In all, more than 4,000 examples of misinformation were submitted to The Times from social media feeds, text-messaging apps and email accounts.Each legitimate submission was vetted by reporters and editors at The Times, and many have influenced our journalism in the lead-up to the midterm elections. We are grateful for readers\u2019 submissions, and dedicated to continuing the work of fighting digital misinformation.Here is a review of some of the major types of misinformation submitted by readers, as well as some discovered in our own reporting.Some election-related misinformation is about specific candidates and races. Other misinformation coalesces around major news events in what could be called \u201choax floods,\u201d often adding to highly charged partisan conversations.Two news events in particular inspired floods of misinformation in recent months: the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the caravan of Honduran migrants moving through Guatemala and Mexico on its way to the United States border.One typical piece of misinformation was a graphic that was found by readers on right-wing Facebook pages. The graphic claimed that Christine Blasey Ford, one of Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers, had been photographed with George Soros, the liberal philanthropist and frequent target of right-wing conspiracy theories. The photograph, shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook, was actually of Mr. Soros posing with Lyudmyla Kozlovska, a Ukranian human rights activist.One typical example is a post found on numerous right-wing Facebook groups. The post used old and mislabeled photos of injured police officers in order to claim that caravan migrants were behaving violently toward law enforcement. The false post was shared thousands of times.Since 2016, major social media platforms have tried to make themselves less vulnerable to exploitation by bringing more transparency to political ads on their platforms.Readers submitted many examples of confusing and poorly labeled ads in their home districts. One example was an ad placed on Google that took aim at Jared Polis, a Democrat running for Colorado governor. The ad, sponsored by a group called \u201cSave Our State Colorado,\u201d falsely claimed that Mr. Polis supported placing Colorado schools under Islamic Shariah law. No committee under the name \u201cSave Our State Colorado\u201d is registered with the Federal Election Commission, and it is unclear who is behind the ad.Dozens of readers sent in tips about a Russian manipulation campaign playing out on Reddit, the popular online message board.Several readers submitted examples of social media misinformation with the ostensible goal of suppressing voter turnout.Many readers submitted tips about deceptive or exaggerated claims targeting individual candidates. Deliberate misinformation about candidates long precedes the internet. (In 1800, Thomas Jefferson wrote anonymous articles about his rival, John Adams, in partisan newspapers.) But social media has supercharged the distribution of politically motivated smears.False claims were sent to voters offline, too. One reader in Texas sent us a scan of a mailer that falsely warned that Texans displaying lawn signs supporting Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic Senate candidate, would be subject to $500 fines.Dozens of readers sent in screenshots of text messages they received from political campaigns, some of which contained misleading and exaggerated claims.Several readers in Texas reported receiving suspicious text messages purportedly from the O\u2019Rourke campaign. The messages claimed that the campaign was looking for volunteers to drive undocumented immigrants to the polls.Supporters of Andrew Gillum, the Democrat running for governor of Florida, also reported receiving suspicious text messages claiming that Mr. Gillum was under an \u201cactive criminal investigation,\u201d along with other negative messages. These messages were not labeled with the name of a sponsoring organization or campaign.Many readers submitted examples of what could be called \u201cattack pages\u201d \u2014 social media pages labeled with the name and picture of a candidate, but actually operated by a group backing the candidate\u2019s opponent. These pages are then used to buy ads opposing the candidate whose picture appears on the page, usually with a mocking nickname.The National Republican Senatorial Committee has started several Facebook pages mimicking Democratic candidates. A page called \u201cThe Real Heidi Heitkamp\u201d was used to buy negative ads attacking the Democratic senator from North Dakota. \u201cMillionaire Claire,\u201d a page impersonating Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, was also used as a vehicle to attack her and promote her Republican opponent, Josh Hawley. \u201cRadical Kyrsten,\u201d another page operated by the N.R.S.C., was used to go after Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat running for Senate in Arizona.Democrats operated attack pages as well. For Our Future, a liberal PAC, sponsored an attack page for Mike DeWine, the Republican candidate for governor in Ohio. The page, called \u201cThe Real Mike DeWine,\u201d was used to promote articles criticizing Mr. DeWine\u2019s political record.Attack pages don\u2019t technically violate Facebook\u2019s rules, since they are labeled in fine print with the name of the sponsoring organization. But they can be confusing to the casual Facebook user scrolling through his or her feed, which led many readers to submit their own examples.An earlier version of this article misidentified Thomas Jefferson's rival in the 1800 presidential election. It was John Adams, not James Madison.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Would Have Driven Her Anywhere ", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveCaring for a mother who suffers from dementia was really hard. I wish I could do it again.When my mother was booted from an assisted living facility in North Carolina for being \u201ctoo high maintenance,\u201d my husband, Ted, and I agreed to have her live near us in Prescott, Ariz.She had spent seven years of dementia in assisted-living facilities, first near my brother in Austin, Tex., and then near my two sisters in Asheville, N.C. It was our turn. My mother never liked any of these facilities, but she disliked the one here most of all. Sometimes, she disliked me.One of the few things she did like about Prescott was being reunited with her old car, a 1992 Honda Accord she had sold to me years before, shortly after my father had died.The Honda connected her to her life before dementia in Austin, where she had a church, Bible study and friends. In Prescott, she had no church, no friends, and her only outings were when I would take her to get her hair done or to do errands. She was happiest when we were in the Honda and took pride in the fact that the car had been hers, a reminder that she once had been independently mobile.Our outings followed a routine, on account of her dementia. She would scream, \u201cOw!\u201d as I helped lower her into the car. She would sit with her legs facing out and then slowly scoot herself to face forward enough to get both legs inside the car. She would ask for help with the seatbelt, but when I would help, she\u2019d say, \u201cBe careful! Don\u2019t be so rough!\u201dThat day we were headed to Prescott\u2019s only shopping mall. Over the last few months, we had gone there to buy her tennis shoes, underwear, a nightgown and a new dress, all at Dillard\u2019s. But this time she wanted to stay in the car.\u201cYou sure?\u201d I said. \u201cYou like Dillard\u2019s.\u201dShe was sure. She trusted me to find the Clinique makeup remover she needed.I cracked the windows and told her I\u2019d be quick.I didn\u2019t like leaving her in the car, knowing she could forget entirely where I had gone and why she was there without me, but the errand was made so much easier by her absence. No getting the folded-up walker out of the trunk. No protracted process of helping her out. No waiting for her to find and put on her sunglasses. No waiting while she walked so slowly. Without her along, I jogged.Returning minutes later, I was relieved to see her in the passenger seat, right where I had left her. She was leaning forward, rummaging through the open glove compartment.\u201cHey,\u201d I said.\u201cThat was fast,\u201d she said.I gave her the makeup remover, but she was intent on the contents of the glove compartment.\u201cAnything good in there?\u201d I asked.She showed me what was in her lap: a tire gauge, a wine opener, a small screwdriver and a first aid kit. \u201cI used to keep cash in here,\u201d she said.I remembered. She would go to the drive-through at her bank and put the envelope of money in the glove compartment. She liked stashing cash in different places as backup for emergencies. Often she would forget she had done this and go get more. In her condo in Austin, I had found envelopes of $20 bills in spare purses in her closet and in the vegetable drawer of the extra refrigerator.She pulled out the blue zippered pouch that held the insurance and registration. \u201cThis comes in handy,\u201d she said.I agreed.The day the old Honda finally stopped running, without warning, while I was driving within a mile of my house, my mother had been dead for three and a half years. I know this only by looking at a calendar. Emotionally, it felt much closer, maybe a few months. With the car and my mother so connected, I remember thinking: \u201cReally? Now the car?\u201d I took it personally, as if I were being hammered by misfortune.I figured it was the oil, which I had neglected to check. I had neglected the car generally, but I loved it. It had belonged to only two people: my mother and me. A copy of our handwritten payment agreement, detailing a year of monthly checks I paid her, was in the glove compartment, inside the blue zippered pouch.\u201cPaid in full,\u201d it had said for more than a decade, but that sweet contract between my mother and me was something I wanted to keep. Her time in Prescott was so much shorter than we had expected. With the amount of money left for her care, we had budgeted for 12 years. After moving to be near us, she lived only 11 months.I called AAA first, and then Ted, who joined me and brought me a coat, as it would be cold once the sun went down. We had the guy tow the car to Kent, our mechanic.Turned out to be the timing belt, which blew while the car was running, in motion. Kent said to me, so gently, \u201cA car this old isn\u2019t worth investing that kind of money.\u201d He gave me the name of a local guy who might give me $400 to use it for parts.I asked if he could keep the car for two weeks because I was leaving to visit my niece in California. He said no problem; he would move it out to the street for now.My mother had also died in motion, without warning. She was walking from the lunch table to the bathroom when she collapsed.After returning from California, I still didn\u2019t deal with the car. Our mechanic\u2019s garage is in a neighborhood I drive through every day, but I couldn\u2019t bear to see the old car there, radiating abandonment, so whenever I drove by I\u2019d keep gazing straight ahead.Finally, Ted convinced me to have it towed to our carport until I could figure out what to do. Brilliant. Why hadn\u2019t I thought of that? Once the car was home, visible every time I came and went, it rejoined the family, like a low-maintenance version of my mother.Ted was on the job market that winter and had landed several Skype interviews. Our house isn\u2019t big, so on a day he needed quiet to be interviewed, I decided to go down to the carport, sit in the old Honda and write.I put on long underwear, a down jacket, hat, gloves and boots. I got in on the passenger\u2019s side, where my mother used to sit, and reached to open the rear vent window for air. I pushed the seat back all the way and covered my lap with a fleece blanket.Inside, the car was like a time capsule from the day the timing belt failed. There was a receipt from the veterinarian, directions to a friend\u2019s new home on a Post-it note, a piece of chewed gum in a wrapper.I released the parking brake and the car sighed. No need anymore for that tension.Reaching down for the lever to recline the seat, my fingers landed on a piece of round plastic. It was a maroon Boost cap.Funny how something like that can transport you.What would I have given right then to wait patiently as my mother made her long, slow way to the car. To hear her say, \u201cOw, be careful.\u201d To buckle her seatbelt for her, open her drink and witness her satisfied first sip. I would have driven her anywhere.I opened the glove compartment and sifted through its contents: plastic blue pouch, tire gauge, screwdriver, wine opener and plastic fork and spoon. I sat in that seat as if it were my mother\u2019s lap, looked out at yesterday\u2019s snow and closed my eyes.I don\u2019t know how long I stayed there. An hour? More? It was womb-like, a cocoon.Eventually, Ted knocked on the window, smiling, saying, \u201cCome back in. You must be freezing.\u201dI wasn\u2019t able to part with the Honda until a month later when, in preparing to move to California for Ted\u2019s new job, getting rid of the car became just one more item on a very long to-do list.The guy who bought it for parts hooked it up and towed it away. I knew better than to watch.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Business With No End", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "Where does this strange empire start or stop?Part I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InPart I: Zooming OutPart II: Zooming InWhere does this strange empire start or stop? Recently, one of my students at Stanford told me a strange story. His parents, who live in Palo Alto, Calif., had been receiving mysterious packages at their house. The packages were all different shapes and sizes but each was addressed to \u201cReturns Department, Valley Fountain LLC.\u201dI looked into it and found that a company called Valley Fountain LLC was indeed listed at his parents\u2019 address. But it also appeared to be listed at 235 Montgomery Street, Suite 350, in downtown San Francisco.There was little pattern or theme to what these Amazon shops sold. They had everything from hemorrhoid cream to desk lamps, and there were varying levels of inventory. On sale at DeepOceanStoreuk (a storefront on Amazon.uk associated with Bropastures LLC), I found a book on industrial electricity, a set of fake facial wounds and a \u201cNo Stress Tech Guide to Microsoft Works 8 & 8.5.\u201d Another storefront called Kingdom Kber, this one on Amazon.de and associated with Agapao LLC, advertised a miniature whale, nail gel and a copy of \u201cUndocumented Immigrants and Higher Education.\u201d When I clicked on these items, though, none of them were currently available. A good number of the storefronts were completely empty.One thing these LLCs had in common was that their registered agent was named Jonathan Park.Even though the packages being sent to my student\u2019s parents\u2019 home were addressed to Valley Fountain LLC, one of the packages had a return label taped to it that indicated it came from an Amazon store called Sendai Book Store. I looked it up and found that it was on several cautionary lists of unauthorized resellers, and had more than 400,000 things for sale. But once again, the offerings seemed chosen at random.I decided to order something: L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick (3 pcs) for $25.63. (I pretended not to see that the same item was listed at $10.74 by another reseller.)  Amazon informed me that the lipstick would come in two weeks; there was no tracking information. In this case, it seemed that Valley Fountain LLC and other companies were posing as traditional retailers \u2014 usually by setting up Amazon storefronts like Sendai Book Store \u2014 and were just reselling items from other Amazon storefronts at inflated prices. It sounds confusing, but ultimately, it\u2019s pretty similar to scalping concert tickets: A middleman makes money by ratcheting up the price.The items in many of the storefronts associated with 235 Montgomery, Suite 350 had an unusually long shipping time and consistently low stock, so it made sense that items purchased from them might be coming from elsewhere.While I waited for my lipstick, I returned to the list of LLCs, and noticed that there was something else that the companies had in common. According to LinkedIn and Facebook, at least a handful of the listed agents were alumni of Olivet University, a Bible college based in California.If Olivet University sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it has been in the news lately. Earlier this year its offices were raided as part of a fraud investigation being conducted by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. As it also happens, here is where the story converged with another of my interests. My boyfriend had worked at Newsweek as an editor for a year. He was let go in April 2017.Newsweek\u2019s journalists also found that their company had offered about $149,000 worth of free advertising in the print magazine to New York\u2019s Dutchess County, where Olivet was turning an abandoned psychiatric hospital into a satellite campus of Olivet University. The deal \u2014 which resulted in 10 full-page ads promoting local tourism and the Hudson Valley Regional Airport \u2014 was facilitated by Marian Rebro, the president of the company overseeing the construction.\u201cOlivet University was not the subject of the visit,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take anything from the campus.\u201dSeveral of the Newsweek journalists who had worked on the investigation of their company and its relationship with Olivet University were fired earlier this year. A spokesperson for Newsweek Media Group declined to comment. I went to 235 Montgomery Street to check it out, and found a set of locked double doors outfitted with a camera, a blinking light and a card reader. On the building\u2019s directory, Suite 350 was listed as IBPort, Inc.Who could this cosmopolitan shopper be? It\u2019s hard to say.Until recently, Marian Rebro, the president of the Olivet-affiliated management company that is developing the abandoned psychiatric facility in New York, was listed on business websites as the manager of Everymarket Inc. But Mr. Rebro said, in a statement: \u201cI am not the founder of Everymarket.com. I may have advised the company at one point many years ago, but have never been an employee there.\u201d He also said: \u201cI am not, nor have I ever been, a manager or employee of Everymarket.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to see the oddly overpriced Essy Beauty peel-off mask or Asavea hair straightener as a kind of product version of clickbait. After all, what is the experience of clickbait other than realizing we have vastly overpaid, even if only with our attention?News, information and products are simply someone\u2019s inventory.This is what I thought a countless number of times!This has gotten some of the companies listed at 235 Montgomery in trouble.In another legal dispute, from February of this year, Adult Printed Diapers LLC sued Faithfulness LLC, another one of Mr. Park\u2019s companies, for selling \u201cAww So Cute\u201d diapers, which are an Adult Printed Diapers trademark. It\u2019s not clear where Faithfulness LLC got the Adult Printed Diapers diapers, but the lawsuit alleges that Faithfulness LLC\u2019s co-defendant in the lawsuit, Rearz, Inc., made an unauthorized purchase of diaper inventory directly from Adult Printed Diapers\u2019 supplier in Shandong, China.  On a recent visit to Leez, recognizable brands were mixed in with disconcerting objects, like a $59 hat that said \u201cOslo Iceland\u201d on it and something called \u201cGranny Attic Bubble Foam.\u201d Both items appeared to be made by JNG Korea Co. Ltd.Products from Little Martin\u2019s Drawer and Asavea were prominently displayed.A sorry assortment of wooden furniture haunted the second floor, while the third floor remained dark, empty and forbidding; visitors were informed that it is now an event rental space.Business cards displayed at Leez named Chris Liu as the Chief Operation Officer there. Chris Liu\u2019s Linkedin profile lists a previous position in Business Development at IBTimes Australia.Amid all of this, my lipstick arrived! Inside the package was an invoice for $10.75 from \u201cCrispy Beauty,\u201d an unfortunately named Amazon seller that was decidedly not Sendai Book Store, the store on Amazon I paid $25.63 for the lipstick. When I went back to Amazon and generated a return label, the address was for Valley Fountain LLC. I was not prepared for the way a simple question about some mysterious packages would spiral into a dizzying network of Amazon storefronts, web domains and badly written \u201cAbout us\u201d pages. But the more I looked into it, the more it seemed they were being run by a handful of people, each operating in different capacities depending on the needs of the moment. More surreal was how these websites were linked to the physical world. Chris L. also made sure to throw in a plug for the third floor: \u201cThe 3rd floor of the store is open for rent. It\u2019s quite spacious and bright. Good for all kinds of event.\u201d I decided I had to go to the San Francisco store.In what sounds like a thick Eastern European accent, he says that \u201cStevens\u201d is the last name of a man who was in the bookstore business for 60 years. \u201cThis gentleman is actually my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to work a couple years together, and this is in memory of him.\u201d There\u2019s a cut in the video, and then: \u201cHe\u2019s still alive, but this is like a tribute to him. That\u2019s why it is called Stevens Books.\u201d\u201cDo you want to check out those books?\u201d the guy asked. No, I said. I wanted to buy them. \u201cOh!\u201d he said, and then laughed to himself. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2026 we\u2019re not a library.\u201d In an email in response to request for comment, Mr. Volansky wrote \u201cP&J Health anti-snoring devices and Piero Lorenzo wallets are not sold in Stevens Books.\u201d He said he was not the owner, and that the store and the brand were owned by the Stevens Books Group. \u201cI go by my own name, Stevens is a nickname because of Stevens Books,\u201d he wrote.Trying to map the connections between all these entities opens a gaping wormhole. I couldn\u2019t get over the idea that a church might be behind a network of used business books, hair straighteners, and suspiciously priced compression stockings \u2014 sold on Amazon storefronts with names like GiGling EyE, ShopperDooperEU and DAMP store \u2014 all while running a once-venerable American news publication into the ground.Indeed, at some point I began to feel like I was in a dream. Or that I was half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real, the local from the global, a product from a Photoshop image, the sincere from the insincere.Still harder for me to grasp was the total interpenetration of e-commerce and physical space. Standing inside Stevens Books was like being on a stage set for Stevens Books, Stevens Book, Stevens Book Shop, and Stevensbook \u2014 all at the same time. It wasn\u2019t that the bookstore wasn\u2019t real, but rather that it felt reverse-engineered by an online business, or a series of them. Being a human who resides in physical space, my perceptual abilities were overwhelmed. But in some way, even if it was impossible to articulate, I knew that some kind of intersection of Olivet University, Gratia Community Church, IBPort, the Newsweek Media Group, and someone named Stevens was right there with me, among the fidget spinners, in an otherwise unremarkable store in San Francisco.Speaking with Jonathan Park, and reaching out to Olivet, provided some kind of clarification. Mr. Park said: \u201cI currently own and operate several businesses that I started while I was at Olivet,\u201d but added that he does not operate many of the entities that he helped incorporate, and that some entities have been spun off and are not related to him anymore.He said he mentored students, including interns and graduates of Olivet, and helped them set up businesses from time to time: \u201cMy collaboration with Olivet was one of my life\u2019s best experiences because the University and its students have an entrepreneurial spirit and great aspirations. It is truly a privilege to work together with these bright and gifted individuals.\u201d The school and students, he said, \u201cpartnered and envisioned an incubating program similar to those of the leading research universities; including Stanford and Cornell. While Olivet and my businesses are of a different scale than that of Stanford\u2019s and Google\u2019s, this type of collaboration is commonplace today and has proven to be very successful and rewarding for the economy at large. Our results and volumes are not odd, but, I believe, are rather impressive and something to be proud of.\u201dOlivet was more vague in its statement, made through its spokesperson Ronn Torossian. He wrote, in full:\u201cFollowing the legacy of our (late) Honorary Chairman Dr. Ralph D. Winter, Olivet University has always looked for ways to encourage growth in mission frontiers. This influence shaped the founding vision from Dr. Jang, who, as a devout Christian, believes a Biblical worldview can be applied across all varieties of fields. In that same spirit, the University has always been happy to help evangelical business owners, and we\u2019ve had a good working relationship with IBTimes over the years. We are also proud of our business-as-mission network with various entrepreneurs going into the marketplace as part of our ongoing exploration into models about how to best plant churches and expand mission frontiers. We will continue to explore this paradigm. These are challenging times for Christian and secular higher education institutions alike. Olivet is continually learning the best ways to provide high quality education to raise leaders while developing sound and diversified income sources. One model is Stanford University, which derives 85% of its revenues from non-tuition sources including sponsored research. Olivet similarly recognizes the importance of finding new models for supporting education, and therefore the school encourages innovation and entrepreneurship for its student and alumni base. Many of our alumni are successful entrepreneurs in the U.S. and other countries and contribute to and partner with the University by donating, partnering on research projects, providing internship/training opportunities, and in other ways. We will continue promoting these values that have made America into the great country it has become. And we are proud of all our successful alumni and are thankful to all the friends, benefactors and partners of Olivet University.\u201d In the end, I decided to return the lipstick.The alleged schemes include fictitious auditors (named \u201cKaren Smith\u201d and \u201cLynn Chen\u201d) who came complete with their own fictitious emails, phone numbers and websites; networks of corporate bank accounts; and the computer server company, Oikos Networks, that is listed at 22 Cortlandt Street, which also happens to be the address where Olivet Institute, Stevens Books and Christian Media Corporation are all registered.The indictments include charges against Etienne Uzac, a co-owner of IBT (and one of the original founders of International Business Times); William Anderson, an Olivet trustee, former chief executive of Christian Media Corporation (and husband of Yen-Yi Anderson); and John Xiao, Olivet\u2019s finance director and dean of Olivet Business School. The general manager of Oikos is named only as an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator.\u201dI wondered about the fate of my overpriced L.A. Girl Matte Flat Velvet Lipstick and who, at the New Jersey warehouse, would be there to receive it. I imagined a person sitting surrounded by rejected dinosaur costumes, butane fuel canisters and butt-enhancing creams. Soon they would receive my lipstick, neither a return nor quite a gift, purchased, at one point, from a faraway place called Crispy Beauty. I wondered if they knew their place in this vast and vertiginous network \u2014 if they knew that they were helping to achieve Everymarket\u2019s dream: A dream of being a marketplace \u201coffering practically everything from everywhere for everyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sheryl Sandberg Asked for Soros Research, Facebook Acknowledges", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySheryl Sandberg asked Facebook\u2019s communications staff to research George Soros\u2019s financial interests in the wake of his high-profile attacks on tech companies, according to three people with knowledge of her request, indicating that Facebook\u2019s second in command was directly involved in the social network\u2019s response to the liberal billionaire.Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, asked for the information in an email to a senior executive in January that was forwarded to other senior communications and policy staff, the people said. The email came within days of a blistering speech Mr. Soros delivered that month at the World Economic Forum, attacking Facebook and Google as a \u201cmenace\u201d to society and calling for the companies to be regulated.Ms. Sandberg \u2014 who was at the forum, but was not present for Mr. Soros\u2019s speech, according to a person who attended it \u2014 requested an examination into why Mr. Soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks. At the time, Facebook was under growing scrutiny for the role its platform had played in disseminating Russian propaganda and fomenting campaigns of hatred in Myanmar and other countries.The people with knowledge of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s email asked for anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the message and feared retribution.In a statement, Facebook said that the company had already begun researching Mr. Soros when Ms. Sandberg made her request.\u201cMr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,\u201d the company said. \u201cThat research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook\u2019s stock.\u201d The company said that while Ms. Sandberg \u201ctakes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch,\u201d she did not personally direct any research on Freedom from Facebook, an anti-Facebook coalition whose members were among the subjects of Definers\u2019 later work.Eddie Vale, a spokesman for Freedom from Facebook, said he was skeptical of the company\u2019s account.\u201cIn light of Sandberg\u2019s continuously changing story on the Soros research, there\u2019s no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value,\u201d Mr. Vale said. \u201cFacebook must immediately release any emails and any research about targeting the Freedom from Facebook coalition or any member organizations.\u201d\u201cWe had not heard such criticism from him before and wanted to determine if he had any financial motivation,\u201d Mr. Schrage said of Mr. Soros. \u201cDefiners researched this using public information.\u201dFacebook has defended its inquiries into Mr. Soros as a prudent and necessary step for any public company under attack by a high-profile figure \u2014 particularly one like Mr. Soros, a onetime currency trader who made a fortune in the 1990s betting against the British pound.But the revelations are likely to escalate pressure on Ms. Sandberg, an embattled Silicon Valley star and feminist author.The Times investigation found that Ms. Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, had ignored warnings about abuse on the platform and sought to conceal from public view evidence that Russia had used it to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and help elect President Trump. The Times also found that when Facebook was confronted last spring with revelations that the privacy of tens of millions of users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-linked data firm, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg sought to downplay the problem and deflect blame.But it is Ms. Sandberg who oversees Facebook\u2019s policy and communications arms, which starting last year embarked on a hard-edged lobbying campaign to discredit the company\u2019s critics and push back on the growing chorus of voices calling for Facebook and other big tech companies to be broken up or more tightly regulated.Facebook hired Definers last year to monitor media coverage and then expanded its role to include campaign-style research and other public relations work.In a private meeting on Thursday, Ms. Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Mr. Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Mr. Soros.Mr. Robinson said that while meeting with Ms. Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm\u2019s research.\u201cShe very much placed it on the now departed communications chief\u201d \u2014 Mr. Schrage \u2014 \u201cand also worked to assure us that Joel Kaplan had nothing to do with it either,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. Mr. Kaplan is the company\u2019s vice president of global public policy.Mr. Robinson said he was pleased Ms. Sandberg had agreed to release a progress report on a previously announced internal audit into how Facebook\u2019s policies affected minority users and employees. But when he pushed for more on Facebook\u2019s involvement with Definers, Mr. Robinson said, Ms. Sandberg kept stressing that Facebook had fired the firm.\u201cWe were not satisfied with that answer,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Sheera Frenkel, Jack Nicas, Cecilia Kang and Mike Isaac.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s New Neighbor: The Nation\u2019s Largest Housing Project", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil recently, the most important thing to know about Amazon for residents of the Queensbridge Houses, the country\u2019s largest public housing project, was that any packages left in a lobby would likely be stolen.But Amazon will soon be a far larger presence in their New York City neighborhood.Here, where livings are eked out on meager paychecks, or social service assistance, with nearly 60 percent of its households relying on food stamps, the new neighbor will be one of the world\u2019s most profitable high-tech companies, bringing what could be a work force of 25,000 people making salaries upward of $100,000.The stark contrast amplifies some of the social and economic tensions coursing through American society \u2014 a widening income gap, a lack of access to high-paying jobs for many minorities and a technology sector struggling to diversify.The planned location for the new headquarters is still unclear, as is whether Amazon will deliver any benefits to the roughly 6,000 people who live in the Queensbridge Houses and other disadvantaged parts of the neighborhood.\u201cWhat are they going to do for the community? Are they going to guarantee us employment opportunities?\u201d said April Simpson, the president of Queensbridge Tenants Association. \u201cI\u2019m worried about, when they come, they\u2019re not going to have opportunities for people. Not just people from Queensbridge \u2014 but other lower- and middle-income people in this area.\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re leery about them coming in.\u201dAs New York City seeks to challenge Silicon Valley\u2019s dominance as a tech hub \u2014 Google recently announced plans for a significant expansion in New York \u2014 the explosion of jobs has helped propel the local economy. But it has not mitigated the \u201ctale of two cities\u201d narrative of economic disparity that Mayor Bill de Blasio has vowed to address in a city where the poverty rate in 2016 was 19.5 percent, significantly higher than the national rate.That stratification is keenly felt in Queensbridge, a gritty complex just across the East River from the East Side of Manhattan and some of the wealthiest neighborhoods and real estate in the country.Hard by the Queensboro Bridge, the Queensbridge Houses have been plagued with crime and drugs. Those problems have eased in recent years, Ms. Simpson said, and community programs have improved the quality of life. Last year, the housing project did not record a single shooting, something that had not happened in more than a decade and was a source of pride.But the neglect that afflicts many public housing developments and has led to harsh criticism of the de Blasio administration, persists here, residents and other local leaders said. \u201cThere are still a lot of problems with the apartments \u2014 the lack of heat and hot water, non-working elevators, mold and broken front doors,\u201d said Jimmy Van Bramer, the city councilman whose district includes the Queensbridge Houses.Tyshema Basnight, 42, said she had been trying to rejoin the work force after raising a family. She has an associate degree in computer science and a tech job at Amazon would be a dream job, she said.\u201cFor now, I\u2019m just looking for secretarial work,\u201d said Ms. Basnight, who was among several residents lined up for one of the few aging computers available in the tenants association office for residents who do not have computers of their own.The office is not on the cutting edge of the digital frontier. And all the buzz over the e-commerce behemoth transforming Long Island City into a gleaming new-economy tech hub was met with skepticism, if not outright hostility.Many businesses \u2014 including travel and financial companies and hotel chains \u2014 have opened in recent years in the area, but Ms. Simpson said they have not hired local residents.\u201cThey did not hire here \u2014 they brought in their own people,\u201d she said. \u201cMy thing is: If you build here, hire here.\u201dA spokesman for Amazon, Sam Kennedy, declined to comment on its plans in New York, but said that the company has a proven track record of funding and creating programs for the needy in Seattle, where Amazon has its main headquarters. This includes donating tens of millions of dollars, creating affordable housing, opening a shelter in its office complex for homeless families and creating a training program for the food service and culinary industries for less-advantaged residents.In Queens, the new companies that have come to Long Island City have helped transform the semi-industrial waterfront neighborhood into a haven for moneyed professionals. Since 2010 more apartment buildings have been built in Long Island City than in any other neighborhood in the city. Apartments in the more than 40 new buildings sell for an average of over $1 million.But past the gleaming skyline of high-rises, many residents fear that Amazon\u2019s arrival will only intensify the gentrification that is making the neighborhood less affordable for people of limited means.It is still unknown what financial incentives city and state officials may have offered Amazon or what, if any concessions, they have extracted from the company to help the neighborhood.Amazon\u2019s arrival, city officials insisted, would yield tangible gains for area residents.They said they were considering setting up programs similar to a city-funded employment center in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\u201cSecuring training and good jobs for local residents \u2014 especially those living in Nycha \u2014 is central to the way we craft major economic development initiatives,\u201d said Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, referring to the New York City Housing Authority.\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity to bring tens of thousands of good jobs to our city and open up good-paying careers in technology for New Yorkers.\u201dStill, Mr. Van Bramer questioned the city and state\u2019s eager courting of Amazon at a time when the housing complex is still in need of funding for basic repairs.\u201cIf we are helping a headquarters with 25,000 employees move in, a stone\u2019s throw from the largest housing development in the United States of America, we need more than lip service for the people of Queensbridge,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore we throw corporate welfare at the richest man in the world, we should think about the crisis in Nycha, and address the needs of the community, including training Queensbridge residents for tech jobs \u2014 or they will be looking through the glass from the outside.\u201dHe spoke of belonging to the Queensbridge \u201cfamily,\u201d and taking pride in its success stories. Mr. Jones said he trained on computers in high school and if his rap career fizzles, he would happily take a job at Amazon. \u201cIf Amazon doesn\u2019t hire from this community, we should boycott them,\u201d he said.\u201cNot everyone here has a Ph.D., but anyone eager to work should be able to get job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be nothing but a plus.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company also deployed a public relations firm to push negative stories about its political critics and cast blame on companies like Google.Those efforts included depicting the billionaire liberal donor George Soros as the force behind a broad anti-Facebook movement, and publishing stories praising Facebook and criticizing Google and Apple on a conservative news site.Sensing Facebook\u2019s vulnerability, some rival tech firms in Silicon Valley sought to use the outcry to promote their own brands. After Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped in an interview that his company did not traffic in personal data, Mr. Zuckerberg ordered his management team to use only Android phones. After all, he reasoned, the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.This past summer, as Facebook\u2019s troubles mounted, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, who by then had emerged as Facebook\u2019s most insistent inquisitor in Congress.

I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at Businessweek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.Advertisement"}

And given the extensive reach of these companies through their multitude of contractors, they should prohibit their contractors from forcing employees into arbitration, as well.Of course, workplace violations of different types are often intertwined: The same employers that permit or perpetrate sexual harassment also commit a host of other violations \u2014 underpaying workers, discriminating in other ways or preventing workers from organizing. A case I handled long ago captures this. A group of women who worked for a dry cleaner came to our office because they were underpaid, working 56 hours a week for subminimum wages and no overtime.As I investigated, I quickly learned how interrelated their problems were. The women, who were Latina, were paid less than their male co-workers. All of the Latino workers, male and female, made less than their non-Latino counterparts. No one made enough to live on, and everyone there was surely exposed to highly toxic chemicals. Over repeated meetings, another story also emerged: The boss routinely made leering comments to the women workers, told them to wear short skirts and, as I later learned, had sex with one of them in a La Guardia Airport hotel \u2014 consensually, he insisted. When I questioned him in sworn testimony about his behavior toward his female employees, he said, \u201cSpanish women like it.\u201dHow do you tease apart the sexism, racism and economic exploitation in this situation? You can\u2019t. They\u2019re inseparable. What brought the women to our office was their unlawfully low pay. But this was partly a result of discrimination against them based on their sex and national origin, and from an even broader viewpoint, it was a result of their lack of power or a voice on the job.So why would it make sense to end forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment only? Why should any company still block people from filing in court when they\u2019re racially harassed or underpaid or paid less because of their national origin? All are offenses against human dignity, and in all of these cases, there is the same tremendous power differential that makes it so hard for people to speak up.The workers who walked out at Google have lives very distinct from the immigrant women who spend their days pressing clothes. But at the root of sexual harassment, or any kind of workplace abuse, is abuse of power. Even a Hollywood legend like Gwyneth Paltrow didn\u2019t speak up about Harvey Weinstein because she thought she would be fired.Even if these companies stop using forced arbitration, their workers will still have plenty of reasons not to speak up: fear of retaliation (even though it\u2019s illegal), fear of being blacklisted, difficulty finding a lawyer to take the case. And with President Trump remaking the judiciary in his image, federal court may soon not be such a great option, either. But at the very least, working people should have the chance to have their day, together, in court.By ending forced arbitration only in cases of sexual harassment, Google, Facebook and their fellow technology companies have responded to public pressure, to the day\u2019s news cycle. But it\u2019s time to be proactive, not just reactive. There\u2019s no logic to ending forced arbitration for sexual harassment only and leaving it intact for so much else.In the end, the most compelling reason for a company to foist arbitration on its work force is to avoid liability and public exposure that might result from a court case. But if a company wants to avoid liability, blocking workers from court isn\u2019t the best way to do that. The answer is to create a fair and lawful workplace, the best possible workplace, for everyone who contributes to a company\u2019s success and to give workers a voice. That, and not a new phone or new app, is the kind of vision and disruption we need more of.Terri Gerstein is the director of the Project on State and Local Enforcement at the Harvard Law School Labor and Worklife Program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Amazon Finally Makes an HQ2 Decision", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello from Seattle. I\u2019m Karen Weise, the new tech correspondent here. As you might imagine, the announcement of Amazon\u2019s decision in what it had billed as a search for a second headquarters, a.k.a. HQ2, has dominated news here this week.I\u2019ve found the HQ2 search and the obsession around it fascinating because of the blatant display of Amazon\u2019s power to promise jobs and lobby politicians, thanks to the company\u2019s market dominance and consumer adoration.The choice to enter New York is particularly interesting because Amazon will need to deal with a local political environment that is far more complex than its hometown\u2019s.Seattle has plenty of activism \u2014 from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests to becoming the first big city to pass a $15 minimum wage \u2014 and certainly there\u2019s some antagonism toward Amazon. But the labor, media and electoral politics of New York are a different breed.That\u2019s been evident in the blowback to the more than $2 billion in planned tax subsidies there. That the state promised to help Amazon get access to a helipad didn\u2019t help.The New York Post cover blared \u201cQueens Ransom\u201d next to a picture of the company founder, Jeff Bezos, laughing in a helicopter holding bags of cash. A hundred people protested at the Long Island City site, waving signs like one that read \u201cStay the Helipad Out.\u201dUntil recently, Amazon barely involved itself in Seattle\u2019s civic politics. Its growth was steady for more than a decade, only kicking into high gear the past few years. For a while, Amazon\u2019s main involvement with city hall was more about small things like approvals for street vacations than major politics.That began to change in 2015, when Amazon\u2019s real estate head, John Schoettler, who was deeply involved in the HQ2 search, led the local Chamber of Commerce. Earlier this year, Amazon publicly fought a new tax to pay for homeless services and affordable housing. But there was never a singular moment like this when Seattle got to ask: Do we want Amazon here? If so, do we want taxpayers to pay for it?When news of a split HQ2 broke, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said, \u201cI\u2019d call those branch offices.\u201d It\u2019s a good zinger, but while Seattle may want to call it a win, several experts pointed out to me that Amazon will now have three cities to pit against one another for decades to come. Talk about leverage.And Amazon is still calling the two new locations headquarters. \u201cWe know there will be leaders and teams in all three headquarters as we map out the growth,\u201d Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, told me. \u201cWe are already a company that spans the country, with employees in over 45 states. I\u2019m on the leadership team but live in D.C. and am in Seattle today. It reinforces what already exists for us.\u201dHow that division shakes out will be interesting to track. The New York office is already home to much of Amazon\u2019s growing advertising group, which has become almost an obsession among investors because of its high margins. That\u2019s a mix of the technical and creative work that\u2019s already thriving in the city.Many had suggested that a Washington-area choice could signal a growing dependence on government contracts, like a $10 billion cloud deal for the Defense Department that Amazon is favored to win.But Amazon\u2019s agreement with Virginia specifically states that the incentives Amazon gets will decrease if more than 10 percent of the work done at that location is for federal contracts, something that reflects the state\u2019s goal of diversifying its economy away from government work. So what\u2019s Amazon\u2019s vision there?Some other tech stories of note this week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Paying Off Men Accused of Sexual Harassment, Google Says It Will Meet Many of the Protesters\u2019 Demands ", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company will announce today that it is finally taking these issues seriously. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. One, they said, was a \u201cgood guy.\u201d Another didn\u2019t deserve to have his life ruined because of his indiscretion. Still another might walk his giant cache of tech knowledge over to a competitor, and that would not stand.These were the inane reasons put forward over the years by top Google executives for a series of hush-hush agreements and payoffs to far too many high-ranking men who had been accused of sexual harassment, according to numerous sources who were in the private meetings where the decisions were debated.Yesterday, all of Google\u2019s vice presidents met, and today, the company will deliver some answers. According to an internal memo from the head of human resources, Eileen Naughton, Google leadership will address the issues at a town hall at its Charlie\u2019s cafeteria in Mountain View, Calif. Global offices can call in at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. According to a just-released letter to employees from Sundar Pichai, the Google chief executive, that I obtained, Google will meet many of the protesters\u2019 demands. Those protesters had a long list, which included: An end to forced arbitration when filing a sexual harassment allegation, which has become a tool to suppress the accuser instead of protecting him or her; equality in pay and opportunity, which, by giving a wider range of people money and power, would help stop these kind of abuses; a public report on sexual harassment (news flash: sometimes shame is a perfectly fine motivator of good behavior); a uniform process for reporting sexual harassment charges in offices worldwide, which would prevent a piecemeal approach from hindering best practices; a chief diversity officer who reports to the chief executive officer, because clout comes with access; and creating an employee representative to the board, which seems like the smartest idea of all.\u201cWe recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that,\u201d Mr. Pichai wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need to make some changes.\u201d His letter said that arbitration will no longer be mandatory, announced improvements to sexual harassment reporting and training, and emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to diversity. It\u2019s just unfortunate that it took a public protest by its employees for the company to move these issues to the front burner. Google shouldn\u2019t stop here. Next, and perhaps more painfully, all the executives who paid off their colleagues or let them off the hook should explain in detail to employees how that happened. That would include releasing all pertinent emails and other communications to help figure out how these decisions were made. While some think such disclosures are legally problematic, truth and reconciliation is the first step to true change. One of Silicon Valley\u2019s worst characteristics is an inability to reflect on itself. This is part of its laudable proclivity to push forward, but in this case, looking back is the best way to move ahead.Finally, these issues aren\u2019t limited to Google, and the company now has a chance to become a real leader of changes across tech and all of business. Imagine if it took the tens of millions of dollars it had given to each of the problematic executives and instead handed it over to a range of public advocacy organizations that could hold companies like Google to account.True that. None of the Googlers who walked out last week want technology to solve anything. They want the very human humans who run the place to do it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Will We Outsmart A.I. Liars?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 Things We\u2019d Really Like to KnowFor better and worse, humans are only improving their ability to deceive themselves with technology.During the summer before the 2016 presidential election, John Seymour and Philip Tully, two researchers with ZeroFOX, a security company in Baltimore, unveiled a new kind of Twitter bot. By analyzing patterns of activity on the social network, the bot learned to fool users into clicking on links in tweets that led to potentially hazardous sites.The bot, called SNAP_R, was an automated \u201cphishing\u201d system, capable of homing in on the whims of specific individuals and coaxing them toward that moment when they would inadvertently download spyware onto their machines. \u201cArchaeologists believe they\u2019ve found the tomb of Alexander the Great is in the U.S. for the first time: goo.gl/KjdQYT,\u201d the bot tweeted at one unsuspecting user.Even with the odd grammatical misstep, SNAP_R succeeded in eliciting a click as often as 66 percent of the time, on par with human hackers who craft phishing messages by hand.A neural network can learn to recognize a dog by gleaning patterns from thousands of dog photos. It can learn to identify spoken words by sifting through old tech-support calls.And, as the two researchers showed, a neural network can learn to write phishing messages by inspecting tweets, Reddit posts, and previous online hacks.And a few we\u2019d rather not discuss\u201cIt would be very surprising if things don\u2019t go this way,\u201d said Shahar Avin, a researcher at the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. \u201cAll the trends point in that direction.\u201dExperts have long had the power to doctor audio and video. But as these A.I. systems improve, it will become easier and cheaper for anyone to generate items of digital content \u2014 images, videos, social interactions \u2014 that look and sound like the real thing.Inspired by the culture of academia, the top A.I. labs and even giant public companies such as Google openly publish their research and, in many cases, their software code.With these techniques, machines are also learning to read and write. For years, experts questioned whether neural networks could crack the code of natural language. But the tide has shifted in recent months.This technology could improve phishing bots such as SNAP_R. Today, most Twitter bots seem like bots, especially when you start replying to them. In the future, they will respond in kind.Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, can see a not-too-distant future in which governments create machine-learning systems that attempt to radicalize populations in other countries, or force views onto their own people.\u201cThis is a new kind of societal control or propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernments can start to create campaigns that target individuals, but at the same time operate across many people in parallel, with a larger objective.\u201dIdeally, artificial intelligence could also provide ways of identifying and stopping this kind of mass manipulation. Mark Zuckerberg likes to talk about the possibilities. But for the foreseeable future, we face a machine-learning arms race.Consider generative adversarial networks, or GANs. These are a pair of neural network systems that can automatically generate convincing images or manipulate existing ones.The second network does its best not to be fooled. As the pair battle, the image only gets more convincing \u2014 the A.I. trying to detect fakery always loses.Detecting fake news is even harder. Humans can barely agree on what counts as fake news; how can we expect a machine to do so? And if it could, would we want it to?Perhaps the only way to stop misinformation is to somehow teach people to view what they see online with extreme distrust. But that may be the hardest fix of them all.\u201cWe can deploy technology that patches our computer systems,\u201d Mr. Avin said. \u201cBut we cannot deploy patches to peoples\u2019 heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Climate Change Insurance: Buy Land Somewhere Else", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn case global warming makes their homes uninhabitable, some millennials have a Plan B: investing in places like the Catskills, Oregon and Vermont.Mr. Dalski, 33, lives in Greenwich, Conn., but he can envision a time when his home there might be besieged by extreme weather and rising sea levels. So he bought four acres of land in the Catskill Mountains, in Roxbury, N.Y., where he is building a home that is as sustainable and self-sufficient as possible.To date, he has drilled a well, set up poles for power lines and designed a septic system that has been approved by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. (The property is in the city\u2019s watershed.)He is working on designing and then securing building permits for the house. He wants it to be no more than 1,200 square feet \u2014 \u201cit should be simple, small and sustainable,\u201d he said \u2014 and to have an open floor plan and a lofted master bedroom. The windows will look out over land where he can grow corn, collard greens and root vegetables.\u201cWill I need it 10 years from now, or 30 years?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d But if his part of Greenwich is ever in jeopardy, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll have a safe space.\u201dThis fall, the United Nations stunned the world when it released a report saying that if no action was taken, the catastrophic effects of climate change could be felt as early as 2040. It painted a bleak picture of a world plagued by fires, food shortages, extreme heat, droughts, floods and disease. Entire populations might have to migrate away from coastal or Southern cities. There would be a strain on resources and damage to the economy. Some believe that prices on Northern land will surge. There is one group, however, that is slightly less anxious than the rest of us about this news: a small number of young professionals who are preparing homes away from the places where climate change is expected to strike the hardest. They are following in the footsteps of billionaires like Peter Thiel, who is investing in real estate in New Zealand in case a climate apocalypse occurs. Although they are doing it on a far more affordable scale.Not quite survivalists, they are nonetheless teaching themselves essential life skills \u2014 like how to grow their own food and make their own electricity \u2014 just in case things spin out of control, and the government can\u2019t step in to help. They believe they are making sound real estate decisions by buying land on high ground that will appreciate in value, while at the same time developing a Plan B.\u201cWe are blatantly facing a catastrophe, and all we\u2019re doing is getting rid of straws,\u201d Mr. Dalski said. \u201cThere are things I\u2019m going to do for preservation.\u201d That includes buying land on a wooded, undeveloped part of Plattekill, a 3,500-foot mountain in the Catskills, because the area is filled with natural resources. The land is at a high elevation but it is also in a bowl, so it collects precipitation. Also, there are creeks that run through the area year-round, and he has family nearby.Michael Phelan, 26, a Ph.D. student in bioengineering in Philadelphia, is deeply concerned about life in a post-climate change world as well. \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing people talk about moving north to places like Michigan or Maine,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing how recent government reports have detailed the threats of mass migration or economic loss, I wonder if it\u2019s even possible to move away from it.\u201dMr. Phelan has entertained the idea of going someplace less vulnerable to the effects of climate change. He is also more focused on preparing for the natural disasters that are projected to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a survivalist at this point, but I\u2019m trying to learn more about preparedness,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives me a degree of confidence to know what to do in situations like that. At least in the very short term, if an emergency occurred, I would have enough of a plan to not panic.\u201dOthers his age have parents and grandparents who are buying shelters they can use if and when climate-related disasters occur.Dave Anderson lives in Houston, not far from his 27-year-old daughter, Casey Delperdang, her husband and their toddler. They all love being there; they are close to family and friends and get together often. But five years ago, Mr. Anderson decided that his family needed another place to congregate: a ranch in Oregon.He bought a 70-acre property with plenty of space for hiking and relaxing in nature. There are rivers where the family can fish for salmon and steelhead trout, and forests where they can hunt for elk. One of his new neighbors assured him that they would never go hungry in this part of the world. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll always like what you eat,\u201d the neighbor told Mr. Anderson, \u201cbut you\u2019ll eat.\u201dMr. Anderson said he was looking for more than a vacation home; he wanted his family to have a place to escape to if living conditions in Houston became unbearable. \u201cI\u2019m no doomsday prepper,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, we intentionally purchased a relatively remote property well above sea level, with ample water and wildlife, with the expectation that the property would survive for generations of family use.\u201dWhile Mrs. Delperdang said she would be hesitant to move there, she acknowledged that her Plan B home could become a primary residence in a worst-case scenario. \u201cDuring Hurricane Harvey, homes flooded that never had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of those people had looked at flood maps and thought they were in protected areas.\u201dIn the past year, Mr. Shandas, of the Sustaining Urban Places Research Lab, said he has seen an increase in parents worried about the next generation\u2019s safety. \u201cA few venture capital and investment bankers have taken me out to lunch or coffee to ask for a secret location, a place where their 18-year-old nephew or son or daughter should move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they want to find a secret fishing spot. I always have to say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a magic ball, I can only tell you the conditions we are likely to see in the future in each place.\u2019\u201dBut hedging against climate change with an isolated home or piece of land isn\u2019t a fail-safe strategy.Mastering surgery would certainly be a lot harder than learning to grow tomatoes. A better strategy, Mr. Riordan suggested, would be to find a community that is intelligently preparing for whatever climate change may bring. He equated the situation to what California has done about earthquakes: They can\u2019t be avoided, but we can build safer buildings, get better at predicting them and establish systems to care for vulnerable populations when they occur.Ms. Ferorelli is well aware that her city is at high risk for wildfires and heat waves. \u201cWe are not taking good care of Lake Michigan; it\u2019s possible we could have a Flint-type scenario,\u201d she said, referring to the water-quality issues in Flint, Mich. But she trusts her community, from the nonprofits to her neighbors, to handle whatever comes. \u201cThese are the people I want to depend on during hard times,\u201d she said.As Mr. Shandas said, \u201cThe most resilient have been those that have had communities of people working together to try to respond. Pulling away and isolating yourself is one of the most dangerous things you can do.\u201dThere is also the likelihood that no matter where you set up your Plan B home, it won\u2019t be immune to climate change.Montana, for example, with its ample land, cooler climate and natural bodies of water, is considered an appealing place to move in the future. But Bill Milner, the former owner of a real estate agency in Whitefish, Mont., said his state is under siege as well.\u201cOur glaciers are melting, our summers are hotter and longer, winters less severe, forest fires have become annual events,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change lives here, too.\u201dThen there is the reality that many younger people can\u2019t afford to buy any home \u2014 let alone one in a place with a better climate. But some of those who can afford to buy land \u2014 or have planned carefully to be able to do so eventually \u2014 are confident that they aren\u2019t just making an investment in their safety, they\u2019re also making a good financial move.If \u201cI can pick up a few acres, it is going to triple in value,\u201d Mr. Dalski said. \u201cIn 100 years\u2019 time, it will be worth something. People are going to have to move north at some point.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Workers Reject Silicon Valley Individualism in Walkout", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is part of a growing movement,\u201d the organizers wrote in a news release, \u201cnot just in tech, but across the country, including teachers, fast-food workers and others who are using their strength in numbers to make real change.\u201dAt the beginning of their protest near the company\u2019s San Francisco offices, the organizers even expressed support for Marriott workers on strike in the city.For decades, Silicon Valley has been ground zero for a vaguely utopian form of individualism \u2014 the idea that a single engineer with a laptop and an internet connection could change the world, or at least a long-established industry. Class consciousness was pass\u00e9. Unions were the enemy of innovation, an anchor to the status quo.\u201cThe myth of Silicon Valley is that all the power you need is embodied in you as an individual \u2014 if you want more money, go somewhere else,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWhat they were saying here was that all the economic power they had as individuals wasn\u2019t enough.\u201dAnd the consequences of that dawning realization, Mr. Shaiken and other labor experts said, could reverberate across the entire tech sector.Google, for example, points to countless ways for workers to communicate with senior executives: Employees can raise a concern with the chief executive at a T.G.I.F. meeting that happens a few times each month. They can ask questions on an internal company platform before meetings, and management will respond to the ones that receive the most \u201cup-votes.\u201d Workers can even circulate petitions, and those that prove especially popular can earn their authors a sit-down with management.Underlying the back-and-forth is the belief that truth bubbles up from an unregulated exchange of ideas. But some employees complain that it rarely leads to lasting change.\u201cAs far as mechanisms for expressing feelings, there are plenty of them,\u201d said Meredith Whittaker, a 12-year Google veteran who oversees a research group at the company and helped organize the walkout. \u201cBut as far as opportunities for agency and power \u2014 for real power over decision-making \u2014 some of what you\u2019re seeing is a recognition that the former doesn\u2019t equal the latter.\u201dThough unusual, there is precedent for well-paid, in-demand workers who stand up to their employers.Two generations earlier, another group of affluent workers successfully faced down their employer: Major League Baseball players.\u201cFrom time immemorial, the baseball powers-that-be force-fed the players propaganda,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote in his autobiography, citing the claims that \u201cthe commissioner (although appointed and paid by the owners) represented the players\u201d and that \u201cplayers were privileged to be paid to play a kid\u2019s game.\u201dBut, according to Daniel A. Gilbert, an expert on the baseball union at the University of Illinois, the owners\u2019 demeaning posture helped galvanize members \u2014 including a famously counterproductive 1969 meeting in which the St. Louis Cardinals owner aired concerns that \u201cplayers are getting fat\u201d and that they \u201conly think of money.\u201d The players, many of whom were well compensated by this point, would within a few years overturn league rules that had prohibited them from accepting offers from rival teams.As in baseball, where African-American players were among the first to reject the owners\u2019 self-serving narrative, those on the margins of the tech world\u2019s largely white male establishment were quick to see the flaws in its meritocratic ethos, Ms. Whittaker said. They understood that just because anyone could offer an opinion didn\u2019t mean anyone\u2019s opinion would be taken seriously.The question is how far this sense of individual powerlessness has spread within Google. The walkout organizers argue that the feeling is quite widespread \u2014 extending from software developers to hardware engineers and from employees to contractors.Some observers agree. Michelle Miller, co-founder of CoWorker.org, which educates workers in tech and other industries on how to assert their labor rights, said that employees at Google \u201chad to start thinking of themselves as some kind of collective\u201d last year after a memo by an employee asserted that women tend to be innately less capable of certain technical work.Since Mr. Damore\u2019s ouster, Google workers have steadily received evidence that management will heed only collective action, Ms. Miller argued. That includes an ad hoc worker revolt that preceded the end of the company\u2019s controversial Pentagon contract.Google may have been uniquely vulnerable to a worker uprising given its ostensibly progressive values, including the company\u2019s longtime exhortation, \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d and the openness of its corporate systems. Organizers note that they executed the entire walkout using Google\u2019s internal platforms and other company resources.They say they\u2019re confident that the protests will only escalate if the chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and his team don\u2019t put forth a plan to act on some of their demands, among them a worker representative on the board of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and an end to employment contracts that prevent class-action lawsuits and require individual arbitration for discrimination and harassment cases.\u201cEmployees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,\u201d Mr. Pichai said in a statement. \u201cWe are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action.\u201dLabor experts said any changes precipitated by the walkout could spread through Silicon Valley.\u201cThese companies are competing for employees,\u201d said Matthew Bodie, a law professor at St. Louis University who is a former lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board.\u201cIf employees at Facebook are looking at this and saying, \u2018Wow, that was impressive,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bodie said, then Facebook may have to follow suit.Still, Bob Kocher, a partner at Venrock, a venture capital firm, expressed skepticism that Google would have to meet any of the organizers\u2019 demands. He pointed out that most employees appeared to enjoy working there and were satisfied with the way they were treated and compensated.\u201cIf I worked at Google, I\u2019d be upset and think, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they paid $90 million to a person who allegedly violated his employment agreement,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cThen I\u2019d go back inside and be glad I work at Google and keep working, and I would think my management would respond to that message and never do that again.\u201dBut Mr. Kocher added that Google did not have a limitless ability to straight-arm angry workers and postpone substantive changes. If there are more walkouts, \u201cproductivity is impacted, recruiting gets harder,\u201d he said.Follow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s HQ2 Will Benefit From New York City. But What Does New York Get?", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe innovation myth used to involve the back of a suburban garage or an office park in Silicon Valley. The tech industry was incubated not on the mean streets of the big city, but in sleepy hamlets like Murray Hill, N.J., and Mountain View, Calif.So with Amazon splitting HQ2, its second headquarters, between Crystal City, a part of Arlington, Va., and Long Island City, in Queens, what are we to make of tech\u2019s steady migration to marquee cities?Amazon is hardly alone, after all. Google and Facebook already have headquarters here (established, not incidentally, without state subsidies). Google intends to double its work force in the city to nearly 20,000. Twitter\u2019s second-largest office is in Manhattan. Its largest is in downtown San Francisco.On one level, this all seems inevitable. A handful of the wealthiest American cities today have a magnetic attraction. Today\u2019s biggest tech platforms seek them out to recruit top talent and gain access, at scale, to housing, schools and transit. The process means the rich get richer, the biggest companies, bigger. And the gulf widens between the country\u2019s haves and have-nots.On another level, the tech industry isn\u2019t culturally urban. Its insularity, secrecy, its bedrock libertarianism and algorithmic notions about progress, land use and corporate independence have never easily meshed with the slow, open-society, regulatory-heavy, greater-good mission that defines city living. Disruption is a virtue and instrument of efficiency in tech circles. But it isn\u2019t necessarily welcome where protections and a focus on collective welfare remain abiding democratic ideals.That said, New York City is not Seattle or San Francisco. Here, tech is one sector in a megalopolis, sharing the limelight with finance, media, fashion, advertising and art. It\u2019s absorbed into the immensity.And Mr. Dorsey wasn\u2019t alone. In Seattle, Amazon raised a ruckus when officials proposed a tax on large employers to help pay for services to the homeless. The company threatened to halt construction on a new high-rise.So the city dropped the plan.This is certainly not how New Yorkers like to operate.Silly as it sounds, where bosses live turns out to be as good a predictor as any of where tech companies will settle.For years, suburbia has offered these companies acres of disposable, cheap, anonymous office parks: mostly one- or two-story concrete structures surrounded by loads of surface parking. These sites minimized costs, maximized security and allowed companies to scale up, contract or split into different units quickly \u2014 at the same time they promoted sprawl and traffic jams and transformed once-quaint bedroom communities south of San Francisco into phenomenally expensive places to live.Not that young tech workers, more and more of them immigrants, wanted to live in suburbia, anyway. Increasingly they demanded the diversity and benefits of city life. And so did successful innovation companies, following the lead of workers.Another way to put it is that companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon became attracted to cities like New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington because these cities had already made transformative public investments in assets like culture, parks, universities and transit.The question for city residents is what these companies give back. I\u2019m not saying companies move, or should be expected to move, for any reason other than to make money. Amazon promises tens of thousands of new jobs in New York, with all sorts of ripple effects beyond employing more coders, sales executives, baristas, nannies and yoga instructors. In one fell swoop, it bids to make good on 20 years of the whole post-Manhattan, cool-outer-borough narrative.But that isn\u2019t the only balance sheet. \u201cUrban life is built around a social compact,\u201d said Vishaan Chakrabarti, a Columbia professor and founder of the architecture firm PAU. Economic value creation in superstar cities like New York fuels a feedback loop that companies and cities both want to lean into.What does this mean? For starters, it means that the city and state now have even more reason to funnel money into subways, buses and a new tunnel under the Hudson River, and to pony up for the stalled BQX streetcar project linking Brooklyn and Queens, all of which would serve Amazon.In turn, Amazon, which dominates the book market, could, up front, make self-interested commitments in local school programs and, as Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University, advocates, in public libraries, our most vibrant, multipurpose community hubs.As for housing, the city\u2019s regulatory and zoning policies are more responsible for driving up costs than tech companies. But, in an ideal world, Amazon would reverse what it did in Seattle and commit resources to affordable housing in areas where its workers are moving; and it would pitch in for homeless services, which, by extension, would improve the daily lives of Amazon employees.Mr. Chakrabarti has a modest proposal, as well: The company could extend a hand toward Long Island City neighbors like LaGuardia Community College and Queensbridge, the largest public housing development in North America.There\u2019s no reason to presume Amazon will do any of this, of course.New York\u2019s abundance of resources, talent and ideas derives from its exceptional diversity and social infrastructure \u2014 urban virtues. Amazon could profit from its enhancement of New York as much as New York could profit from Amazon\u2019s presence. It\u2019s not how tech tends to work.But it\u2019s how this city works.Advertisement"}

Many of the pictures ran in The Times between the late 19th and 20th centuries.\u201cOur first photo was published in 1896, which means we have a visual record of the entire 20th century of life in this country and beyond it,\u201d said Monica Drake, an assistant managing editor at The Times.The first chapter of Past Tense appears as a special section in Sunday\u2019s paper and focuses on how The Times covered California in the 20th century. The 48-page tabloid section features dozens of photographs that show how California\u2019s free-spirited culture, prizing recreation and innovation, appeared to Times reporters 3,000 miles away in New York City.\u201cLooking at the same image 50 years later, you can tell a totally different story than the one we originally ran,\u201d Ms. Drake said.The Times morgue was the brainchild of Carr V. Van Anda, the managing editor of the newspaper from 1904 to 1932. Long before the days of Google, Mr. Van Anda created the morgue to be a library of newspaper clippings and a research resource for reporters. Historically, dozens of people staffed the morgue, working in three shifts until 3 a.m., clipping news from The Times and other outlets. The photo library, once the province of the art department, later became part of the morgue.\u201cIt\u2019s The New York Times\u2019s capsule of history,\u201d said Nakyung Han, a photo editor at The Times.\u201cHaving it digital does kind of open up the possibilities,\u201d Ms. Han said.Currently, on the second floor of The Times, in a white room, decorated with a single television and a floor lamp, a team of six employees is scanning all six million images individually.Megan Paetzhold, who works on this team, said she scans about 1,500 images a day. They show a range of subjects: markets in Rio de Janeiro; women exercising at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College in 1904; Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio hanging out in a dugout. Many of the prints are yellowed, their edges worn. Others are covered with crop marks from photo editors and stamped with publication dates.Ms. Paetzhold recently found an old illustration of the moon, or what people thought it looked like in the 1930s.\u201cIt brought to mind for me how imaginative humanity is,\u201d Ms. Paetzhold said. \u201cAnd how we were having that desire to go to the moon and to imagine what it looked like before we had been there.\u201dThese are the sort of ideas and images Veronica Chambers, who is leading the Past Tense team, hopes to explore. She said California was an intriguing subject because in the 20th century, the state was fertile ground for innovation.\u201cWhen we looked at the pictures, they represented changes that changed the nation,\u201d Ms. Chambers said. \u201cThere just seemed to be no shortage of things that happened there that then affected how the world was.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about looking at the interplay between history, photography and memory,\u201d Ms. Chambers said. \u201cThis is a really great opportunity to use this treasure trove of photographs to tell stories about who we were and who we\u2019ve become.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cut Was Supposed to Change Corporate Behavior. Here\u2019s What Happened.", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a year after the tax cut, economic growth has accelerated. Wage growth has not. Companies are buying back stock and business investment is a mixed bag. The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law late last year has already given the American economy a jolt, at least temporarily. It has fattened the paychecks of most American workers, padded the profits of large corporations and sped economic growth. Those results weren\u2019t a surprise. Economists across the ideological spectrum predicted the new law would fuel consumer spending, in classic fashion: When the government borrows money and dumps it into the economy, growth tends to accelerate. But Republicans did not sell the law as a sugar-high stimulus. They sold it as a refashioning of the incentives in the American economy \u2014 one that would unleash more investment, better efficiency and higher wages, along with enough growth to offset any revenue lost to the government from lower tax rates.Ten months after the law took effect, that promised \u201csupply-side\u201d bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus. It\u2019s still early, but here\u2019s what the numbers tell us so far: Proponents of the tax overhaul said it would supercharge the recent lackluster pace of business spending on long-term investments like buildings, factories, equipment and technology. Such spending is crucial to keeping economic growth strong. And strong growth is central to Republican claims that the tax cuts would ultimately pay for themselves.Capital spending did pick up steam earlier this year. For companies in the S&P 500, capital expenditures rose roughly 20 percent in the first half of 2018. Much of that was concentrated: The spending of just five companies \u2014 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, and Facebook, Intel, Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs \u2014 accounted for roughly a third of the entire rise. Much of that spending went toward technology, including increased investment in data centers and computing, server and networking capacity. For the full year, Goldman Sachs analysts expect that capital expenditures for companies in the S&P 500 will be up about 14 percent, to $715 billion. Research and development spending, another component of business investment, was expected to be up 12 percent, to $340 billion.For the economy as a whole, the surge in business investment was a bit less impressive. It\u2019s true that business spending on fixed investment \u2014 such as machinery, buildings and equipment \u2014 rose, jumping 11.5 percent and 8.7 percent during the first and second quarters. The first-quarter jump was the fastest for investment since 2011. But that pace fizzled during the third quarter. Recently data showed third-quarter business investment rose at an annual pace of 0.8 percent. The last quarter of the year \u2014 traditionally a big one for capital spending \u2014 will fill out the picture, but that data won\u2019t be released until early 2019. It will likely take years to get a better sense of whether the law fundamentally reshaped American corporate investment. But there\u2019s little clear evidence that it is drastically reshaping the way in which most companies invest and spend.The results of a survey published in late October by the National Association for Business Economics showed that 81 percent of the 116 companies surveyed said they had not changed plans for investment or hiring because of the tax bill. Cheerleaders for the tax cut argued that the heart of the law \u2014 cutting and restructuring taxes for corporations \u2014 would give the economy a positive bump, giving companies incentives to invest more, hire more workers and pay higher wages. Skeptics said that the money companies saved through tax cuts would merely increase corporate profits, rather than trickling down to workers. JPMorgan Chase analysts estimate that in the first half of 2018, about $270 billion in corporate profits previously held overseas were repatriated to the United States and spent as a result of changes to the tax code. Some 46 percent of that, JPMorgan Chase analysts said, was spent on $124 billion in stock buybacks. Supporters of the tax cuts repeatedly claimed the bill would increase economic growth enough to offset the decline in tax receipts. \u201cI'm totally convinced this is a revenue-neutral bill,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, when a preliminary version of the bill was approved in the Senate in December 2017. It\u2019s highly unusual for deficits and borrowing needs to grow this much during periods of prosperity. A broad variety of analysts attribute the widening deficit to the tax cuts (along with increased military and other domestic spending ushered in through a bill Mr. Trump signed earlier this year). The growing budget gap means the Treasury must borrow more to keep the government running. The Treasury expects to borrow a total of $1.338 trillion from global investors this calendar year. That would be 145 percent higher than the $546 billion the federal government borrowed last year. That would be the highest level of borrowing since 2010, when the American economy was struggling to recover from the great recession. Data from large public companies, however, suggest that most workers received relatively small shares of their employers\u2019 corporate tax savings. Workers for those companies were more likely to see their wages rise if they lived in states where the minimum wage was relatively low \u2014 and where companies do not have to pay workers more to compensate for high housing costs. California workers at those companies saw an average benefit of about $160 each, which is less than half the average benefit for workers in Kentucky.Many companies also said they would use tax savings to create jobs. But the Just Capital research finds that, since the tax cuts were passed, the 1,000 largest public companies have actually reduced employment, on balance. They have announced the elimination of nearly 140,000 jobs \u2014 which is almost double the 73,000 jobs they say they have created in that time. About half of those net losses came from companies in the restaurant and leisure industries, the analysis found. By Republicans\u2019 own economic theories, it should take a while for corporate tax cuts to translate into higher worker pay. First, the cuts need to stimulate increased capital investments, which in turn raise worker productivity. More productive workers would then see their wages rise accordingly. Productivity grew 3 percent in the second quarter of this year and 2.2 percent in the third \u2014 healthy numbers, which will need to continue apace to deliver the sort of long-term economic jolt Republicans promised.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Money and Muscle Pave China\u2019s Way to Global Power", "Date": "2018-11-25", "News": "They didn\u2019t like the West\u2019s playbook. So they wrote their own.Beijing is leveraging its commercial and military might to redraw the terms of trade, diplomacy and security, challenging the liberal democratic order.Under a merciless sun, a dozen Chinese construction workers survey an empty expanse of desert, preparing to transform it into the heart of a new Egyptian capital.The workers are employed by China\u2019s largest construction conglomerate through a $3 billion contract from an Egyptian company, with financing from Chinese banks. They are erecting a thicket of 21 skyscrapers, one as tall as the Empire State Building.The presence of Chinese labor and largess on the sands of Egypt is a testament to China\u2019s global aspirations. After centuries of weakness and isolation, China is reclaiming what its leaders regard as its natural destiny \u2014 supremacy in Asia, and respect around the planet. Through the ventures in Egypt and elsewhere, China is exploiting its formidable economic clout to expand its geopolitical influence, directing investment to woo governments that control vital assets.A traditional ally of the United States, Egypt controls the Suez Canal, a vital shipping passage where a threat to access could impede China\u2019s movement around the globe. In constructing a central piece of the futuristic capital, China is ingratiating itself with the canal\u2019s ultimate gatekeeper, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while rendering his grandest visions dependent on friendly relations with Beijing.How China became a superpowerChina\u2019s reach for commercial expansion along with diplomatic influence guides an array of Chinese undertakings, from rail networks and highways taking shape across Africa and Latin America to ports and power stations being constructed in Eastern Europe and South Asia. In Southeast Asia, Chinese entrepreneurs are engineering a crop of web companies just as China projects growing military power in the South China Sea.Little more than a decade ago, China\u2019s forays beyond its borders were mainly about bringing home energy, minerals and other resources, often from countries forsaken by the West as pariah states like Iran, Sudan and Myanmar. In foreign policy, China pursued a sole obsession \u2014 peeling off diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its territory. Even as China skirmished with neighbors over contested islands, it accepted the dominance of the United States Navy.Those days are over.Under the muscular leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has cast off previous restraints, rejecting deference to an American-dominated global order as an impediment to national revival. In matters of commerce and national security, China is competing with the United States, even in traditional American spheres of influence.From a Chinese perspective, this reordering is merely an overdue reversion to historical reality as Beijing demands consideration commensurate with its stature.In the telling of the ruling Communist Party, China\u2019s modern history is the story of Chinese mastery degraded by colonial depravity. China is the land that invented the compass, gunpowder, paper and printing, amassing stupendous wealth while Europe was still backward. Then came centuries of humiliation \u2014 Britain\u2019s profiting from forcing opium on the populace, Japanese brutality, demeaning lectures about human rights from hypocritical Americans. Now, China is intent on securing its own fate.\u201cChina wants to be a great power in the world,\u201d says Paul Heer, a former chief national intelligence officer in East Asia for the United States, who now teaches at George Washington University. \u201cThey think the rest of the world owes them recognition, and a return to what the Chinese see as their rightful place.\u201dNowhere are China\u2019s designs clearer than in Asia. China has overtaken the United States as the leading trading partner with Asian nations while pushing back against American naval primacy in the South China Sea. China is disrupting American alliances in the region, from Japan to Singapore to Australia.Beyond its backyard, China\u2019s ambitions are boundless. It celebrates its Belt and Road Initiative, a vast collection of infrastructure projects around the world, as the means of recreating the Silk Road, the trails navigated in ancient times by merchants carrying goods between Asia and Europe.\u201cXi Jinping is leading a China that has influences in all corners of the globe,\u201d says Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cThe 2008 financial crisis in the West was the turning point for China. Beijing started to embrace a triumphal mind-set, and pursued global leadership with new confidence on the back of the West\u2019s perceived flaws.\u201dChina\u2019s assertive role in world affairs is grounded in its domestic needs. It is at once spreading into new markets, generating fresh demand for its factory wares just as growth slows at home. It is projecting military strength and influence when the legitimacy of the Communist Party rests on bolstering economic fortunes and international esteem.Among its neighbors, China\u2019s rise provokes fears that an unwanted piece of history is being resurrected \u2014 the old tribute system that cemented China\u2019s status as the Middle Kingdom. For centuries, other nations bowed in recognition of China\u2019s imperial might, bestowing gifts on the emperor and accepting vassal status to secure trade and peace.For the Western powers whose order has prevailed since the end of World War II, China poses a foundational challenge. The United States and its victorious allies erected institutions that were \u2014 at least rhetorically \u2014 designed to keep the peace by promoting trade and fair competition. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have dispensed aid with conditions, though frequently drawing accusations that they have failed to comply with their standards on protecting human rights and the rule of law.China\u2019s investments come with no such strictures. China bankrolls autocrats who control geopolitically valuable real estate. China demands only that its companies gain a piece of the action while recipients eschew criticizing Beijing.China\u2019s challenge to the Western-dominated order is amplified by the reality that its primary architect, the United States, is now led by an avowed nationalist. As President Trump wages a trade war and derides international cooperation, he has generated doubts about the perseverance of the liberal democratic philosophy the United States has long championed.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the United States gives China this golden opportunity to portray itself as the defender of the international order,\u201d says Jessica Chen Weiss, a China expert at Cornell University.If the new Silk Road is in part about moving goods from Chinese factories to customers in the rest of the world, the trail seems certain to pass through Central and Eastern Europe.This reality frames the proceedings of the \u201c16-plus-1\u201d group, an economic bloc that China has forged with 16 Central and Eastern European nations. Its latest summit meeting convenes on a drizzly day in July in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Officials from the 16 governments \u2014 among them the newest, least-affluent members of the European Union \u2014 pose for photos with the delegation from China, the one nation wealthy and ambitious enough to finance their visions.Leaders in the rest of the European Union construe the group as a stealth assault on the rules and cohesion of their bloc. In offering financing for infrastructure projects, China has positioned itself as an alternative to European Union development funds.Europe\u2019s money comes with rules protecting labor and the environment, while requiring that projects be awarded to companies on the basis of competitive bidding to ensure fair competition. China tends to distribute its funds with far simpler demands: Chinese companies must gain work, free of competition, while Beijing secures an international ally.European Union officials are especially worried that Chinese money could weaken the pressure Europe is applying on members that have been breaching democratic norms. Europe has threatened to withhold development funds from Poland and Hungary as punishment for their turns toward authoritarianism. Both have packed courts with government-friendly judges and menaced the press.\u201cIt\u2019s a mutually beneficial cooperation based on mutual trust without any kind of attempts to interfere into domestic issues,\u201d Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, says in an interview before the summit meeting in Sofia.\u201cWe are talking about different conversations, concrete conversations related to infrastructure, and other conversations related to the level of democracy and human rights in China,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev of Bulgaria says in an interview the day before the event. \u201cIt would not be polite and constructive if we try to merge them into one.\u201dThe summit meeting convenes in a hulking convention center that harks back to era of Soviet domination. At a news conference, the Chinese and Bulgarian prime ministers offer assurances that the 16-plus-1 bloc does not aim to divide Europe.Mr. Li seeks to allay European worries that China poses a challenge to its rules. He promises that Chinese-financed projects will be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding.\u201cThere needs to be open and transparent tendering,\u201d the Chinese premier declares.But the Serbian prime minister, Ana Brnabic, has just undercut that assertion. Asked moments earlier about the high-speed rail from Belgrade to Budapest, she says Chinese companies have been promised construction work.\u201cChina is a strategic partner,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not putting out tenders.\u201dAs a currency crisis ravaged Indonesia two decades ago, angry mobs tore through West Jakarta, killing hundreds of ethnically Chinese merchants. Yet Cheng Tao, a Chinese software engineer turned venture capitalist, can look down from his high-rise office on the same neighborhood and see a tranquil center of Chinese life \u2014 grocery shops, restaurants and his own son\u2019s school.Mr. Cheng, 34, is part of an influx of young Chinese financiers, engineers and web designers who rent space in an area full of technology companies. He first came to Indonesia a decade ago with the Chinese telecom company Huawei. He and other veterans of large Chinese conglomerates are increasingly unleashing their own start-ups.\u201cTen years ago, there were no mainland Chinese here,\u201d Mr. Cheng says as he sips tea imported from China. \u201cWe see opportunities here that no longer exist in China.\u201dThe thriving Chinese start-up scene in a neighborhood once devastated by anti-Chinese terrorism illustrates China\u2019s deepening engagement in Southeast Asia. Only a few years ago, Chinese companies in the region were mainly focused on purchasing natural resources. Today, China is investing for the future, seeding innovative industries with money and brainpower.Last year, Chinese investors participated in funding rounds for Indonesian start-ups that accounted for 95 percent of the value of those companies, according to a survey by Google and A. T. Kearney, a global management company.\u201cChina is Indonesia\u2019s Silicon Valley,\u201d says Adrian Li, a venture capitalist who has a Stanford M.B.A. and moved to Jakarta from Beijing in 2014.China\u2019s place in Southeast Asia has proceeded deliberately, and just as the United States has ceded ground.While heads of state forge ties amid pageantry, Chinese businesses have been quietly yet persistently making inroads in Indonesia, guided by bottom-line concerns. At home, Chinese web companies are running out of new customers. Indonesia, a land of 260 million people, is adding more internet users than anywhere else on Earth.Jack Ma, the founder of the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, was early to appreciate this reality, pouring major investments into local shopping start-ups, including $1.1 billion last year into Tokopedia, a thriving online marketplace. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan this spring, the Tokopedia site drew 78 million people, a 70 percent increase from the previous month.Such potential fortifies Mr. Ma\u2019s determination to stay ahead of his biggest global competitor \u2014 Amazon. The American e-commerce company operates in Singapore but has yet to significantly penetrate Southeast Asia.Alibaba has put more than $3 billion into a former regional competitor, Lazada. Its Alipay digital payment system operates across Southeast Asia. Mr. Ma sits on advisory boards in the region that will help set standards and shape consumer perceptions, expanding China\u2019s traditional reach.Beyond money and clicks, China projects its power through a more traditional display of strength \u2014 military might.Alex Pama has watched it unfold from uncomfortable proximity. In the 1990s, when he was a junior officer in the Philippine Navy, he saw Chinese boats landing on Mischief Reef, a glorified collection of rocks claimed by the Philippines in the South China Sea. Chinese crews erected shelters to mark the territory, then began pouring concrete for larger buildings.The Philippines sought help from its former colonial overseer, the United States. But the Clinton administration demurred. The American Navy was still smarting over losing access to Subic Bay, its longtime base in the Philippines.That decision was a historic turning point, says Mr. Pama, who would rise to become admiral of the Philippine Navy. From then on, the United States shrank from the region, relinquishing the seas to China.\u201cThat\u2019s when the appeasement started,\u201d Mr. Pama says.Two decades later, President Xi ordered the buildup of Mischief Reef and other outcroppings in the Spratly archipelago into islands bristling with reconnaissance gear, aircraft hangars, runways, deepwater harbors and, most recently, short-range missiles. Those bases and China\u2019s maritime buildup have given Beijing effective control over one of the most heavily trafficked waterways on the planet.\u201cThe U.S. should have been more assertive back then and now,\u201d says Mr. Pama, now retired.Dominating the South China Sea and unseating the United States have become central objectives in Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to return China to glory. Last year, China for the first time staged aircraft carrier drills using advanced fighter jets in the South China Sea.China has presented these moves as defensive. But the United States and its Asian allies warn that Beijing has positioned itself to hold global trade hostage while diminishing the American presence. China\u2019s emergence as the region\u2019s dominant commercial power combined with its moves toward maritime supremacy has heightened the sense that a changing of the guard is underway.\u201cOver the long term, China\u2019s power and influence will undoubtedly weaken and ultimately abolish U.S. dominance in the region,\u201d says Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, who advises the government.The perspective gained momentum during the 2012 standoff at Scarborough Shoal, a horseshoe-shaped chain of reefs that is much closer to the Philippines than to China.As the Philippine Navy challenged Chinese fishing boats, the Obama administration brokered a deal in which both sides would withdraw. The Philippine vessels departed, but some of the Chinese boats stayed.China has controlled the shoal ever since. Emboldened, China began construction of seven artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago.China appears reluctant to build a full-fledged military base on the shoal, lest it stoke nationalist anger in the Philippines, damaging relations with its pro-China president, Rodrigo Duterte.\u201cAny reclamation will outrage the Duterte government,\u201d says Zhu Feng, the executive director of the Center for the South China Sea at Nanjing University. \u201cChina can\u2019t afford to lose a good friend like that.\u201dBut many Philippine officials fear that this is merely a pause before an inevitable Chinese expansion.Two large maps of the South China Sea cover the walls of the office of Gary Alejano, a Philippine congressman and former marine. He shows visitors how the Scarborough Shoal sits on the edge of the Bashi Channel, the Chinese Navy\u2019s entryway into the western Pacific. He points out the artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago. He notes Mischief Reef, where Chinese fighter jets have landed.Unless someone confronts them, those jets will remain there, using the hangars China built, Mr. Alejano says. Philippine Navy vessels rarely patrol the area, he laments.\u201cRight now, you can feel that China controls the South China Sea,\u201d Mr. Alejano says. \u201cAnd the U.S. comes in and out.\u201dAs China charts its global reach, six zones demand special attention: the maritime choke points.The entryway to the Black Sea from the Mediterranean. The passageway from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean via the Strait of Malacca. The corridor separating Europe from Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar. Bab el Mandeb, off Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. The Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Access to the Mediterranean from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal.At any one, an outbreak of hostilities could imperil China\u2019s free movement around the globe, jeopardizing its exports and access to resources.These zones have historically been policed by American naval power, which has made China\u2019s access dependent on peaceful relations with the United States. To liberate itself, China has been lavishing investment on governments that control the choke points.Which is how China became financier and developer for the grandiose capital being constructed by President Sisi in the reddish-brown desert east of Cairo. Mr. Sisi craves investment and allies at a time when much of the world has recoiled from his brutal crackdown on dissent.In an interview, Gen. Ahmed Zaki Abdeen, who heads the Egyptian state-owned company overseeing the new capital, railed against American reluctance to invest in his country.\u201cStop talking to us about human rights,\u201d he says. \u201cCome and do business with us. The Chinese are coming \u2014 they are seeking win-win situations. Welcome to the Chinese.\u201dIn backing the new capital, China has furthered an age-old aspiration for the Egyptian powers that be: taming the desert. The project aims to construct a city of 6.5 million people, replacing crumbling Cairo with a technological metropolis engineered to rival Dubai. Construction is expected to take 15 years while costing 200 billion Egyptian pounds, more than $11 billion.Under a master agreement signed in October 2017, China Construction is building the capital\u2019s central business district. A consortium of Chinese state-owned banks is lending $3 billion to finance a first phase expected to be completed in three years. Egypt is obligated to spend the money by hiring the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. A second phase is expected to run $3.2 billion.Yu Wenchuan dons a yellow safety vest as he works security at the China Construction site. Born and raised in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, Mr. Yu, 24, complains about the 100-degree heat and the conspicuous absence of spicy noodles. But he is resigned to spending the next eight years in Egypt.\u201cThis is a good way to get experience,\u201d he says.Under the contract, 35 percent of construction materials can be brought from China. Even some of the 65 percent procured from domestic sources stands to enrich China, given the presence of entrepreneurs like Xin Zhu.Seventeen years have passed since Mr. Xin landed in Cairo from his native Hubei Province. There, he oversaw a factory that processed slabs of granite and marble into flooring and countertops. He had heard that Egypt was rich with quarries full of high-quality, low-priced rock.He took control of a lot in an industrial area outside Cairo. He endured terrible roads and power failures. \u201cI was like a pioneer,\u201d he says.Today, Mr. Xin\u2019s company employs more than 100 people, mostly migrants from China. He ships most of his production to China. But he aims to sell into the new capital, profiting as Beijing erects a veritable Pharaonic monument for Egypt\u2019s authoritarian leader.\u201cI was looking for new opportunities outside China,\u201d Mr. Xin says. \u201cMore development is good for our business.\u201dDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaMore China RulesDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui   Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt   Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen   Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anhaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Amazon Ruin or Revitalize New York City?", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York\u2019s not ready for Amazon\u2019s HQ2, but here\u2019s how the city can get there.After a nationwide campaign, Amazon selected Long Island City in New York as one of two locations for expanding its headquarters. The company\u2019s decisions about whom it hires and how quickly, and where those workers choose to live, will affect how much the expansion changes the city. Jenny Schuetz from the Brookings Institution and Elizabeth Goldstein from the Municipal Art Society offer two views on how to prepare.Ms. Schuetz is a fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program.Business, manufacturing and commercial zonesResidential and other zonesQUEENSMANHATTANAmazon\u2019sexistingManhattanofficeAmazon\u2019sproposedlocationGoogle\u2019sofficeTwitter\u2019sofficeFacebook\u2019sofficeBROOKLYNNew York1 MILEBusiness, manufacturing and commercial zonesResidential and other zonesMANHATTANQUEENSAmazon\u2019sexistingManhattanofficeAmazon\u2019sproposedlocationGoogle\u2019sofficeTwitter\u2019sofficeFacebook\u2019sofficeBROOKLYNNew York1 MILEBy The New York TimesWith Amazon\u2019s HQ2 announcement, residents of Long Island City, Queens, are worried that the rapid growth in housing prices that has plagued the South Lake Union area of Seattle, where Amazon has its headquarters, will soon come to their neighborhood.They certainly have cause for worry: The steepest increases in housing prices in Seattle have occurred in the past five years as Amazon has rapidly expanded. The expected buildup for Amazon\u2019s HQ2 outpost in New York, 25,000 employees over 10 years starting next year, mirrors the company\u2019s recent growth in Seattle.But there are no indications that the impact on New York will be apocalyptic. First, the number of jobs is small relative to the city\u2019s labor market and population. Second, Long Island City is better equipped than many parts of the city to accommodate a corporate campus and the additional office space, housing and services it would require. The neighborhood\u2019s zoning rules allow for taller buildings than in areas like, say, brownstone Brooklyn.Still, there are many unknowns.How many of Amazon\u2019s highly paid employees will want to live close to the campus? Young workers without children are likely to prefer living within one or two miles of the office, driving demand for studio and one-bedroom rental apartments, and amenities such as coffee shops, restaurants and bike paths.By contrast, highly paid employees with school-aged children are more willing to tolerate longer commutes to live in neighborhoods with larger apartments, high-performing public schools and family-friendly parks, such as TriBeCa, Carroll Gardens and Jackson Heights.Another question is how many lower-paid employees Amazon plans to hire. Administrative assistants and maintenance staff workers will earn much less than the $150,000 average salary Amazon promises for HQ2. The proposed campus is near the nation\u2019s largest public housing development, Queensbridge Houses, and the community district that includes Long Island City has nearly 19,000 subsidized housing units. But low- and moderate-income workers who don\u2019t already live in subsidized or rent-stabilized apartments may get priced out of the area.The city needs to build more housing, more cheaply, especially in affluent neighborhoods closer to business districts. The aging and dwindling supply of subsidized and rent-stabilized units will require infusions of public resources to remain habitable and affordable.Finally, it\u2019s not yet known how many current city residents Amazon will hire. If it recruits engineers from Google or Twitter in Chelsea, or from Facebook near Union Square, that won\u2019t create demand for new apartments, although those engineers might move to shorten their commutes.With so much unknown, the city and the state can make smart choices now by investing in more housing, school capacity and upgraded transit citywide.Ms. Goldstein is the president of the Municipal Art Society.Queensbridge Houses,the nation\u2019s largestpublic housing projectQUEENSAnable Basin,proposed locationfor Amazon\u2019s HQ2SPECIALPURPOSEDISTRICTEast RiverThe Special Long IslandCity Mixed Use Districtallows for taller buildingsand greater densityP.S. 78,which isalreadyat 131%capacity1,000 FEETQueensbridge Houses,the nation\u2019s largestpublic housing projectEast RiverQUEENSAnable Basin,proposed locationfor Amazon\u2019s HQ2SPECIALPURPOSEDISTRICTP.S. 78,which isalreadyat 131%capacityThe Special Long Island City Mixed Use District allows for taller buildings and greater density1,000 FEETNote: Area boundaries approximate. Sources: City of New York; Municipal Art Society of New York | By The New York TimesTo Jeff Bezos, I want to say, \u201cWelcome to Queens!\u201d I want to tell you more about the neighborhood you and Amazon are moving into.Long Island City is an exhilarating, diverse and rapidly growing community. Much of this growth was the result of a 2001 rezoning in which the city sought to spur commercial development in what had been a manufacturing area. But a boom in commercial development is not what we got.Instead, the zoning changes led to the construction of 10,000 new residential units, vastly more than the 300 projected, according to the Municipal Art Society\u2019s latest report. Residential neighborhoods need things that commercial districts do not, and it turns out that if you underestimate the number of new residences by more than 3,200 percent, something has to give.Your arrival may indeed catalyze the central business district envisioned in 2001. But Long Island City is now a primarily residential neighborhood with critical needs that must be addressed.Today, seven out of nine elementary schools in Long Island City are overcrowded; one of them operates at 212 percent of capacity. Ridership at the neighborhood\u2019s two subway stations, Court Square and Queensboro Plaza, has increased at seven times the citywide rate.With one-third of an acre of open space for every 1,000 people, Long Island City residents enjoy only one-fifth of the median open space available to New Yorkers. And the Anable Basin, on which Amazon\u2019s proposed campus sits, is within a federally designated high-risk flood zone.Meanwhile, median household income in Long Island City jumped to $123,000 from $53,000 from 2000 to 2016. The housing that has been built is largely high-end luxury, out of range for the average New Yorker.Even the affordable units planned as part of a recent rezoning of Anable Basin now appear to be in jeopardy, as the site will instead be used to create office space for as many as 25,000 Amazon workers.The company cannot insulate itself from the difficulties facing this neighborhood by relying on the same campus model used in Seattle and Silicon Valley. A self-contained office park is a distinctly un-New York concept. Amazon employees may want to live in Long Island City to be close to work, and the fragile state of mass transit and overburdened schools will be an everyday issue. Amazon won\u2019t be able to ignore the subway crisis with corporate shuttle buses.Mr. Bezos, your influence over the politics of New York is enormous right now. Our governor and mayor spent months to win you over, and your satisfaction is important to them.But you will also have to contend with a large and diverse City Council that has so far been cut out of the process that brought you here. Will you choose to leverage that attention to demand long overdue relief for the residents of this neighborhood, and work with our local leaders to build a vision for a strong city of the future?Elizabeth Goldstein is the president of the Municipal Art Society.

{"Headline": "You Already Email Like a Robot \u2014 Why Not Automate It?", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyIn 1996, Microsoft unleashed Clippit, better known as Clippy, on users of Microsoft Office. The legendarily irritating mascot-helper spent the following years hovering around the edges of documents, blinking dumbly under his lascivious eyebrows and blurting out, \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re writing a letter,\u201d until he was sidelined by the company in 2001, officially recognized as a mistake. Clippy\u2019s problems were manifold. He announced his presence, via a personified avatar, to tell us something that we already knew (or that should have been obvious in the first place) and then proudly offered us little in the way of actual help. He sat and watched us and learned nothing, and repeated himself. He said too much and did too little.Nevertheless, over 20 years later, the spawn of Clippy are hiding everywhere, guessing what we\u2019re trying to do and offering to help. But Clippy\u2019s successors are doing their best to avoid his mistakes. Most of the time they are faceless, and if they speak, they do so in a disembodied but humanlike voice. They tend to wait to be asked for help, rather than telling us what they think they know unprompted. And when they do offer help, they tend to be more subtle, more accurate or both. They have perhaps more in common with Clippy\u2019s unassuming partners, like Spelling and Grammar Check or AutoCorrect, which spoke through red underlines or small actions carried out on reasonable assumptions (who would intentionally type \u201cteh\u201d?). These tools have followed us and our clumsy fingers to our new smartphones, where they have become both more assertive and more useful, correcting us and only occasionally requiring us to correct them back, and learning all the while.What does the tech industry want to assist us with now? Email. If you use Gmail, you\u2019ve probably interacted with either Smart Reply or Smart Compose, whether or not you know them by name. Google introduced Smart Reply in 2015, and Smart Compose began rolling out this year. Both, in execution, are self-explanatory. Smart Reply suggests canned responses to inbound emails, based on the company\u2019s best guess at what most emailers might be about to type. The suggestions are short, peppy and often adequate, at least as a start. Sometimes their tone prompts unhappy realizations about what Gmail sees in us. The frequency with which they use exclamation marks emphasizes just how peculiar the language of professional email communication has become (\u201cSounds great!\u201d \u201cVery cool!\u201d \u201cLove it!\u201d). Smart Compose, in contrast, offers word and phrase suggestions, based on similar judgments, as the user types in real time. You write \u201cTake a look,\u201d and ghostly text might appear to its right: \u201cand let me know what you think.\u201d Its assumptions are more personalized, and they feel that way because it is constantly, visibly, guessing what you\u2019re thinking.Smart Compose and Smart Reply are, at their core, artificial-intelligence technologies: They are programmed to perform tasks, but also to adapt. To start, Smart Reply was trained on publicly available bodies of email text. (Among the most widely used for such projects is the cache of some 500,000 emails collected during the discovery phase of the Enron investigation.) \u201cWhat makes machine learning different from regular programming is you look at corpuses of data to make guesses about things,\u201d says Paul Lambert, a product manager for Gmail. \u201cYou create a model.\u201dOnce that model was trained to deal with some of the more obvious idiosyncrasies of email communications \u2014 corporate disclaimers and phrases like \u201cSent from Outlook\u201d \u2014 Google began training it on anonymized text from actual Gmail users. Phrases that appear frequently enough come under consideration for inclusion in Smart Reply. This, too, requires cleanup. Early testers reported seeing \u201cI love you\u201d as a suggested response to work emails.Armed with this catalog of phrases \u2014 currently more than 20,000, according to the company \u2014 the model can then start incorporating more contextual clues: What was the subject of the email? Is the email asking a question? Is it expressing a happy sentiment, or is it offering condolences? Phrases are scored based on their utility \u2014 how much typing they save, basically \u2014 as well as the A.I.\u2019s confidence in the prediction.Both features then take into account how people use them. If, for example, it suggests a certain completion, and enough users take it, that one will be more likely to appear in the future. If a canned reply is never used, this is a signal that it should be purged; if it is frequently used, it will show up more often. This could, in theory, create feedback loops: common phrases becoming more common as they\u2019re offered back to users, winning a sort of election for the best way to say \u201cO.K.\u201d with polite verbosity, and even training users, A.I.-like, to use them elsewhere. Such a dynamic would take root only where a behavior is already substantially automated \u2014 typed, at work, more as a learned performance rather than as an expression of will, or even an idea. Smart Compose is, in other words, good at isolating the ways we\u2019ve already been programmed \u2014 by work, by social convention, by communication tools \u2014 and taking them off our hands.Using these features is a bit like minding a machine that is trying to learn how to do what you do for a living. And even if it\u2019s the part of the job you wish you didn\u2019t have to do, it still prompts uncomfortable thoughts of replacement \u2014 or, if not replacement, then something close to it. It is not remotely implausible that in the near future, a tremendous amount of communication could be conducted in tandem with an A.I.But constant sweeping changes in office communication \u2014 from speaking and writing to phones and printing to emailing and instant messaging \u2014 do not tell a tidy tale of increased efficiency or decreased workload, even as they represent progress. Already, an undefined but undeniable portion of workplace email amounts to human self-automation: an uncanny form of communication where clich\u00e9s aren\u2019t shunned so much as recognized for their usefulness; where a tone of polite enthusiasm is taken to its exclamatory extreme to mash any ambivalence you may have about, say, \u201ccircling back later.\u201d One can visualize in the near future hundred-email chains between colleagues unfurling from a single human starting point, composed of nothing but routinized replies.Depending on what your current inbox looks like, this might not require much imagination at all. A study conducted in 2016 by researchers at Carleton University\u2019s Sprott School of Business in Canada tried to understand the role email had come to play in the modern office. They surveyed \u201chighly educated baby boomer or Gen X\u201d subjects who were mostly \u201cmanagers or professionals\u201d working in office jobs and found that they spend on average a full third of their workweeks \u201cprocessing\u201d email. Whatever their titles, they are \u2014 like many office workers \u2014 to a large extent professional emailers. Even if their roles are otherwise highly specialized, in this significant way they are not. They are their own assistants.In 1930, John Maynard Keynes wrote that, thanks to new efficiencies, workers of the future could expect \u201cthree-hour shifts or a 15-hour week.\u201d He guessed that this would happen within a century. Automation and the abundance it produced has indeed led to countless economic changes, but it did not negate or replace the entire order. Asked for evidence of the success of this newest tool, Google says that Smart Compose is already \u201csaving people a billion characters of typing each week.\u201d This statistic supports one half of what Keynes might have predicted at the dawn of automated communication \u2014 the abundance and the glut \u2014 but is tellingly silent on the other half, the same half he couldn\u2019t quite see the first time. Self-automation can free us only to the extent that it actually belongs to us. We can be sure of only one thing that will result from automating email: It will create more of it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Metropolis of 200 Million Termite Mounds Was Hidden in Plain Sight", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat amount to garbage piles \u2014 some are 4,000 years old \u2014 are spread over an area the size of Britain in a remote Brazilian forest.Stephen J. Martin noticed large mounds, some 10 feet tall, 30 feet wide, along the side of the road as he drove through a remote part of northeast Brazil. He thought they might be piles of dirt displaced from the construction of the road. Instead, his companions told him, \u201cOh, they\u2019re just termite mounds.\u201dDr. Martin recalled his incredulous reply: \u201cAnd I went, \u2018You\u2019re really sure about that?\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know. I think so.\u2019\u201dOn a subsequent trip, Dr. Martin met by chance Roy R. Funch, an ecologist at Brazil\u2019s State University of Feira de Santana who was already arranging to conduct radioactive dating to determine the age of the mounds. \u201cI said, \u2018Look at those, there must be thousands of these mounds. And he went, \u2018Nah, there\u2019s millions.\u2019\u201dDr. Funch undercounted too. How many mounds? Some 200 million, the scientists estimate.\u201cThey\u2019re all over the place,\u201d Dr. Funch said.The cone-shape mounds are the work of Syntermes dirus, among the largest termite species at about half an inch long. The mounds, spaced on average about 60 feet apart, are spread across an area as large as Britain. \u201cAs humans, we have never built a city that big, anywhere,\u201d Dr. Martin said.The scientists were also surprised when they received results of the radioactive dating of 11 mounds. The youngest was about 690 years old. The oldest was at least 3,820 years old, or close in age to the great pyramids of Giza in Egypt. \u201cThat just kind of blew me out of the water,\u201d Dr. Funch said.Dr. Martin said they used the minimum age suggested by the data, but the oldest mound could conceivably be more than twice as old.The scientists also estimated that to build 200 million mounds, the termites excavated 2.4 cubic miles of dirt \u2014 a volume equal to about 4,000 great pyramids of Giza. \u201cThis the greatest known example of ecosystem engineering by a single insect species,\u201d the scientists wrote.Another surprise was that the mounds turned out to just be mounds. Other termites build mounds with complicated networks of tunnels that provide ventilation for underground nests.But cutting through some of the mounds, Dr. Funch and Dr. Martin found only a single central tube leading to the top, and they never came across any nests. That might also explain the regular spacing between the mounds. At first, Dr. Funch and Dr. Martin thought that to be the result of competing colonies. But when they put a termite from one mound next to one from a neighboring mound, there was no conflict, indicating they were from the same family.They concluded the pattern was simply an efficient spacing of garbage piles.Young, active mounds grow to four to five feet tall in a couple of years, Dr. Funch said. Most of the older mounds appear inactive. The scientists do not know if that means the termites have left or if they simply have no need for additional digging in the area after constructing the needed tunnels.\u201cThat's why they were undiscovered for so long,\u201d Dr. Funch said. \u201cYou cannot see them in the native vegetation. And not many scientists pass this way.\u201dFor most of the year, with temperatures reaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter, the trees are scorched white. The landscape turns green after a short rainy season, and then the leaves fall, and the landscape grows desolate again. \u201cThese termites live on dead leaves, and they get to feed once a year,\u201d Dr. Martin said.As parts of the forest were cleared, the mounds became visible, and about a decade ago, Google Earth\u2019s satellite images became sharp enough that Dr. Funch could spot individual mounds. He drove to some of the sites to verify that the mounds were there.Dr. Martin said he wanted to better understand the intertwining between the insects and the vegetation. When part of the forest is cut down, the mounds remain, but the termites move away as there are no longer any leaves for them to eat.They also want to observe the termites during the burst of feeding after the blooming of the forest and study what the termites are doing the rest of the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "That Virus Alert on Your Computer? Scammers in India May Be Behind It", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 You know the messages. They pop up on your computer screen with ominous warnings like, \u201cYour computer has been infected with a virus. Call our toll-free number immediately for help.\u201dOften they look like alerts from Microsoft, Apple or Symantec. Sometimes the warning comes in a phone call.Most people ignore these entreaties, which are invariably scams. But one in five recipients actually talks to the fake tech-support centers, and 6 percent ultimately pay the operators to \u201cfix\u201d the nonexistent problem, according to recent consumer surveys by Microsoft.Law enforcement authorities, working with Microsoft, have now traced many of these boiler rooms to New Delhi, India\u2019s capital and a hub of the global call-center industry. On Tuesday and Wednesday, police from two Delhi suburbs raided 16 fake tech-support centers and arrested about three dozen people. Last month, the Delhi authorities arrested 24 people in similar raids on 10 call centers.In Gautam Budh Nagar, one of the suburbs, 50 police officers swept into eight centers on Tuesday night. Ajay Pal Sharma, the senior superintendent of police there, said the scammers had extracted money from thousands of victims, most of whom were American or Canadian.\u201cThe modus operandi was to send a pop-up on people\u2019s systems using a fake Microsoft logo,\u201d Mr. Sharma said. After the victims contacted the call center, the operator, pretending to be a Microsoft employee, would tell them that their system had been hacked or attacked by a virus. The victims would then be offered a package of services ranging from $99 to $1,000 to fix the problem, he said.Such scams are widespread, said Courtney Gregoire, an assistant general counsel in Microsoft\u2019s digital crimes unit.Microsoft, whose Windows software runs most personal computers, gets 11,000 or so complaints about the scams every month, she said, and its internet monitors spot about 150,000 pop-up ads for the services every day. The company\u2019s own tech-support forums, where people can publicly post items, also see a steady stream of posts offering fake tech-support services.\u201cThe success of the legitimate industry has made it easier for the illegitimate industry there,\u201d Ms. Gregoire said. As in any con, experience helps. \u201cYou have to convince them they have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to have the touch.\u201dFor tech companies, combating the impersonators is complicated by the fact that many legitimate tech-support operations, including some of Microsoft\u2019s, operate from India.Najmeh Miramirkhani, lead author of the research paper, said the network of entities involved in the scams was complex, with some making their own calls and others running the sites but outsourcing the calls to India. Many of the scammers also share data with one another.\u201cThis is an organized crime,\u201d she said.Microsoft said it was working with other tech industry leaders such as Apple and Google, as well as law enforcement, to fight the scourge, which is migrating beyond the English-speaking world to target other users in their local languages. In the 16 countries surveyed by Microsoft, people in India and China were the most likely to pay the con artists.Mr. Sharma said that in a similar con broken up by his department, call-center agents had impersonated Canadian tax authorities.Like the I.R.S., Microsoft and other legitimate technology companies do not call their users out of the blue. Nor do they send security alerts to the screen telling customers to call them.Ms. Miramirkhani had some simple advice to avoid being conned: Don\u2019t pick up the phone.Vindu Goel reported from Mumbai, and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Encyclopedic Collector to \u2018Wikipedian-at-Large\u2019", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileAUCKLAND, New Zealand \u2014 In the grand library of the Auckland War Memorial Museum on a Saturday morning in August, a small group of new and slightly nervous Wikipedia editors gathered for a day of training that would arm them to tackle New Zealand\u2019s lackluster representation on the crowdsourced online encyclopedia.Leading the so-called Wikiblitz was New Zealand\u2019s official Wikipedian-at-Large, Mike Dickison, 49, who has in some senses been preparing his entire life for this post. As a collector of things and knowledge, he has pursued a string of enthusiasms, beginning with insects, shells and feathers (he put together his own museum as a boy), then giant flightless birds (a Ph.D. on those), that ended, appropriately enough, with a job as the natural history curator at a museum. He once taught a class in knitting as therapy for stressed-out men after a major earthquake.\u201cBe bold! Don\u2019t be stymied by worry,\u201d Mr. Dickison told the group, assuring them that early in his Wikipedia career, he had accidentally \u201cblanked\u201d more than one entire page by mistake.As the country\u2019s roving Wikipedian-at-Large, he is spending a year coaxing New Zealanders to take up volunteer editing on what is the world\u2019s fifth-most-visited website. His salary and travel are funded by a grant from the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia, as part of its investment in \u201cemerging communities\u201d on the site, including New Zealand.The South Pacific country is underrepresented on Wikipedia, and Mr. Dickison described the state of many of the country\u2019s pages as \u201cdire.\u201dHis skills are self-taught, but Mr. Dickison\u2019s affinity with Wikipedia\u2019s gathering of community knowledge is the culmination of his lifelong obsession with collecting. Growing up in Christchurch, on the South Island of New Zealand, the son of an apprentice boilermaker father \u2014 who later ran a sporting goods store \u2014 and a homemaker mother, Mr. Dickison felt he was \u201cdestined\u201d for a museum curator\u2019s job.Even then, Mr. Dickison was irked by the lack of available information about New Zealand\u2019s native fauna.\u201cI was mad on insects, and in 1983 you had one book on New Zealand insects, which was written in the \u201970s, with just a few color plates,\u201d he said, adding that he is now writing his own children\u2019s book on New Zealand\u2019s natural history.His preoccupation with the moa led Mr. Dickison to complete a Ph.D. on the subject of giant flightless birds at Duke University decades later.\u201cI had no idea where North Carolina was or any fact about it whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Dickison said. \u201cThe only Duke I knew was \u2018The Dukes of Hazzard.\u2019\u201dThe appeal of giant flightless birds, to Mr. Dickison at least, seemed simple: \u201cThey\u2019re just enormous. They\u2019re really big. I mean, why do kids like dinosaurs? Because they\u2019re huge.\u201dHe dreams of traveling back 1,000 years to see the moa in its natural New Zealand habitat before it was wiped out by Polynesian settlers 500 years ago. He has even investigated the taxonomic origins of the \u201cSesame Street\u201d character Big Bird (his conclusion: a giant flightless crane).His edit history, which began in 2009, is not quite as lettered as his museum pedigree: Mr. Dickison made some of his first contributions to pages about Jaffas, a type of New Zealand candy, mandolins and the film \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap.\u201dHe realized toward the end of his tenure as a natural history curator, he said, that the work he did on Wikipedia in his free time had \u201cmuch more impact\u201d than what he did at his day job.After his application for a Wikimedia Foundation grant for the national Wikipedian-in-residence role was successful, Mr. Dickison said, he left his job, \u201cfilled my four-wheel-drive with plastic bins of worldly possessions and launched off around the country on an adventure.\u201dMr. Dickison is no stranger to connecting unlikely groups of people. Upon his return to New Zealand from Duke, the sometime ukulele player was frustrated by the lack of sheet music for New Zealand standards. So he wrote a book of local songs for ukulele and traveled the North Island, teaching and performing them.In the 1990s, he had hosted sessions in internet cafes to help newcomers explore the World Wide Web.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why I do these things,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be an introvert.\u201d\u201cBut if I find something I\u2019m passionate about, I need to share it and get other people involved too,\u201d he added.The fate of Christchurch was a cautionary tale about the need for societies to preserve their information, Mr. Dickison said. When the 2011 earthquake struck, every formative place from his childhood was destroyed, including his family home and former schools.\u201cGoogle Street View was still running images of pre-quake Christchurch for a while after the earthquake, and there was a huge worry that they would take those down and replace them with up-to-date views,\u201d he said, adding that images of the city before the disaster had now been archived and preserved.\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been a bit cavalier about looking after knowledge in New Zealand,\u201d Mr. Dickison said. \u201cToo often, it just slips away.\u201dAs part of his Wikipedian-at-Large role, he is charged with recruiting others to help preserve that knowledge online, with a particular emphasis on women and minorities, who are underrepresented in New Zealand\u2019s small editing community. He plans more meet-ups and training sessions like the one at Auckland Museum, and will be resident around the country at locations including a government department and a bird sanctuary.Mr. Dickison also hopes to entice reticent public and private institutions to crack open their vaults of knowledge and expertise, making them more accessible for editors to use while editing Wikipedia.\u201cI often have experts tell me they read a Wikipedia article that they know something about and it was full of inaccuracies,\u201d he said.\u201cI always say, \u2018Well, did you fix them? And if you didn\u2019t fix them, why are you complaining to me? It\u2019s like walking outside and complaining that it\u2019s raining and not putting up an umbrella. Of course you\u2019re wet!\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Dive After Apple Supplier Slashes Outlook", "Date": "2018-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks dropped on Monday, giving back a slice of their recent gains as investors dumped shares in some of the large technology companies that hold outsize sway over major market indexes.The Nasdaq composite was one of the hardest-hit among the major benchmarks. The technology-heavy index was down 2.8 percent. The S&P 500 fell 2 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.3 percent.Apple\u2019s stumble seemed to weigh on other previously high-flying technology companies. Amazon shares dropped 4.4 percent, and Facebook fell 2.4 percent. The social network was briefly offline for many users Monday afternoon, giving visitors an error message saying \u201csorry, something went wrong.\u201dAlphabet, the parent company of Google, declined 2.6 percent, and Netflix stock fell more than 3 percent.The slump in technology shares on Monday was a reminder of the ugly drop stocks suffered in October. Worried about rising interest rates, trade tensions and a potential peak in corporate profits, investors briefly pushed the broader market down nearly 10 percent below its late-September peak and into negative territory for the year.More recently, stocks had regained much of that ground. Wall Street jumped after last Tuesday\u2019s contentious midterm elections were resolved, with the S&P 500 finishing the next day up more than 3.5 percent.Monday\u2019s pain wasn\u2019t exclusively due to tech stocks.General Electric\u2019s stock fell 6.9 percent in its fourth straight decline after comments by its new chief executive failed to calm investors\u2019 worries.But Apple remains a key concern. The company has a market value above $900 billion, so moves in the share price have an outsize effect on stock indexes \u2014like the S&P 500 \u2014 that are weighted by market size.That dynamic mostly has been a boon for the stock market in recent years. Apple shares rose more than 45 percent last year.But Apple\u2019s recent stumble suggests that some investors are questioning the ability of major tech companies to continue to carry the broader markets.Apple\u2019s tumble on Monday followed another slide after its Nov. 1 earnings report, when the company said it would no longer report the number of iPhones it sells each quarter.

{"Headline": "Black Friday 2018: A Not-So-Wild Day for American Shoppers", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere we are again: Mildly annoyed by the obvious consumerism, but totally in love with the deals. It must be Black Friday.Shoppers won\u2019t want for time this year: The gap between Thanksgiving and Christmas \u2014 32 days if you don\u2019t count the holidays themselves \u2014 is long (next year it will be just 26 days). That means procrastinators get more time to put things off and retailers get one more shot at luring you in. But beware: Hanukkah is coming on the early side this year.We\u2019ll be covering it all here, with reporters weighing in from near and far.Just before 11 a.m. at the Fashion Island mall in Orange County, Calif., the line to see Santa Claus was about 15-people deep, including parents and grandparents. Laura Natale, who lives nearby, brought her three-year-old son Christopher to see Santa. Asked if the crowds were any larger than a typical Friday, she said: \u201cNot really.\u201dOthers had anticipated more bustle at this palm-and-Christmas-tree-laden outdoor mall near Newport Beach, saying they remembered a bigger post-Thanksgiving rush last year. \u201cIt\u2019s more empty than I expected,\u201d said Michelle Gorczyza, who also lives in the area. She did encounter a long line at Anthropologie, so she skipped the store, deciding she could just as easily buy online.Her husband Danny said that nowadays people come to the mall more for the food and the experience than the shopping. \u201cYou don\u2019t see people running around with 10 bags,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy to spend $50 on lunch and just soak in the atmosphere.\u201dThat\u2019s what 28-year old Mitch Williams did on this sunny morning, sitting beneath one of the palm trees. \u201cMy grandpa is visiting from Ohio, so we\u2019re having coffee and omelets.\u201dWas he doing any shopping? He shook his head no: \u201cI do that online.\u201d\u2014 Cade MetzRetailers start marketing it months in advance. Hordes of shoppers turn out in person and online. Google even programmed it into its calendar as an official holiday.But Black Friday has competition. Lots of it.Those are just the free-for-alls, where all retailers can participate.\u201cIf we\u2019ve seen anything in retail over the last 20, 30 years, it\u2019s that consumers need to be motivated to shop,\u201d said Michael Brown, a partner with A.T. Kearney\u2019s retail practice. \u201cThey need to be provoked.\u201dFor anyone above all that crass consumerism? There\u2019s a day for them, too.\u2014 Tiffany HsuRetailers and analysts said Black Friday 2018 got off to a strong start \u2014 and all indications were that it finished strong, too.Though the cold weather in the eastern United States may have kept some shoppers home, Mastercard SpendingPulse said that generally \u201conline sales appear to be filling in any weather related soft spots in brick and mortar sales.\u201d The clothing, electronics and interior furnishing sectors were seeing especially good traction, the analysis said.\u201cStores are busy, there\u2019s good traffic, the queues are manageable and well-staffed, and inventory levels appear to be good for the time of day too,\u201d said Frank Layo, managing director of Kurt Salmon, which is part of Accenture Strategy. \u201cRetailers helped themselves by starting promotions much earlier this year to spread out the holiday shopping traffic and mitigate chaos. Their efforts appear to be paying off.\u201d\u2014 Matt StevensEarly in the day, J. Crew wrote on Twitter that it was \u201cexperiencing some technical difficulties\u201d with its website. The site appeared to be functioning fine soon afterward.Still, analysts monitoring Black Friday said online sales were chugging along, driven in part by the cold, wet weather in some parts of the country, which they said may have nudged some shoppers away from stores and toward their computers or smartphones.\u2014 Matt StevensHere\u2019s the upshot: Black Friday is a great time to buy a new video game console, a television, headphones or a smart home product like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. One of the most notable deals we\u2019ve seen: Best Buy, Amazon and many retailers are selling Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 with a new Spider-Man game for $200, down from the normal price of $300 for the console alone. So come prepared: Jot down a list of things you\u2019d like to buy in those categories and look out for price drops.\u2014 Brian X. ChenYou clearly have an insatiable appetite for The Times\u2019s Black Friday coverage! Here are a few recent stories you might enjoy about this very American \u201choliday\u201d and how it fits into the broader economy.\u2014 David EnrichBelieve it or not, not everyone is a fan of Black Friday.\u201cWe\u2019re fighting for respect and a fair wage at work,\u201d David Holt, one of the organizers of the demonstration, said in an interview on Wednesday. He added that Black Friday was an especially appealing time for labor movements to organize. \u201cOne of the things this Black Friday protest is about is consumerism.\u201dMr. Holt said he hoped that holding the demonstration in front of a Walmart would encourage shoppers to think about labor conditions for the store\u2019s employees.\u2014 Zach WichterThere is no Thanksgiving holiday in Europe, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the associated consumer bonanza from hitting shops there. French retail brands like Darty, Fnac and Monoprix joined Apple, Sephora and Uniqlo in efforts to attract bargain hunters on Friday.In Britain, where sales used to take place after Christmas, shops have added Black Friday to their promotional calendars. Offers have been trickling in for at least a week. Amazon started its sales on Nov. 16.Most other stores have joined the fray with even discount supermarkets offering money off everything from vintage turntables to legs of ham.\u2014 Amie TsangYes, Black Friday is everywhere \u2014 even Canada.The \u201choliday\u201d \u2014 in French-speaking Montreal, they call it \u201cVendredi Fou\u201d \u2014 has reportedly become Canada\u2019s busiest shopping day of the year, eclipsing Boxing Day (or Dec. 26), when the traditional post-Christmas Day sales would bring out hordes of shoppers.This Black Friday, the stores in Montreal were packed, especially in the underground, labyrinth-like malls such as Eaton Center, which was crowded with people seeking shelter from the subfreezing weather. Athletic wear, women\u2019s shoes and men\u2019s suits were marked off at 50 percent or more in the Eaton Center mall. Outside one electronics store, velvet ropes were set up to keep the queues under control.It\u2019s said that Black Friday first migrated to Canada in the early 2000s, when the American and Canadian dollars were roughly on par. These days the greenback is worth 1.32 Canadian dollars, making these discounts even greater. \u2014 Stuart EmmrichThe Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said it sold $30.8 billion worth of goods on Nov. 11, the annual online bonanza known as Singles Day. The company rang up $1 billion in sales in the first 85 seconds of this year\u2019s frenzy. It took an hour to reach $10 billion. All in all, the company says it generated more than a billion delivery orders that day.For some context: In the United States last year, online shopping from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday totaled about $19.62 billion, according to Adobe Analytics. (Yes, it\u2019s true, that doesn\u2019t include all the in-store shopping that took place on Black Friday.)In addition to inundating phone owners with coupons and deals for weeks in advance, Alibaba deploys subtler methods to gin up sales on Singles Day. This year, users of the company\u2019s Taobao shopping app could see how their spending on Nov. 11 compared to that of other people in their area.\u2014 Raymond ZhongFor many shoppers, Black Friday actually begins right in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner.\u2014 Nellie BowlesOnline shoppers, too, were busy on Thanksgiving Day. They shelled out $3.7 billion on Thursday, an increase of about 28 percent compared to last year, according to a report from Adobe Analytics, which tracks transactions from 80 of the country\u2019s top 100 online retailers.And many of those online shoppers aren\u2019t heading to their desks or even grabbing their laptops. Thanksgiving marked the first day during which $1 billion in sales came from smartphones, Adobe said. And consumers spent more on their phones, with average order values up 8 percent compared with Thanksgiving Day last year.\u2014 Zach WichterIt could help retailers offset some of the deep discounts that consumers expect on Black Friday.\u201cIf you can grab people in the inspirational moment, they\u2019re not going to be as price-sensitive and maybe they won\u2019t shop around,\u201d said Jill Standish, Accenture\u2019s global lead for retail.Another advantage? Online, Ms. Standish said, it can be easy \u201cfor a small brand to look big\u201d if they know how to present themselves, and know how to attract the right influencer profiles to promote their products. A strong social media presence can make a company seem instantly reputable.\u2014 Zach WichterThere are three reasons that Black Friday is so popular, and two of them are the deals, according to Tulin Erdem, a marketing professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.\u201cThe economic savings, feeling good about yourself having found a good deal, being a shrewd consumer,\u201d she said, all add up to one key factor. Plus, because so many stores offer Black Friday sales, it\u2019s easier to find discounts without having to search as hard as you might during the rest of the year.But, Dr. Erdem said, another reason Black Friday remains so popular is tradition.\u201cIt still has its appeal because of this ritualistic aspect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a big important baseball game or Super Bowl as an American family.\u201dConsider that the National Retail Federation surveyed 7,516 consumers about their shopping plans this year, and 26 percent of those who planned to shop on Black Friday said it was because of tradition. An additional 23 percent said they would shop because it\u2019s just something to do. (As far as we know, nobody was asked whether they\u2019re shopping just to get away from family members.)Of course Black Friday is just the start of things. If retailers don\u2019t start discounting before Thanksgiving \u2014 and most seem to \u2014 they are certainly using the holiday shopping season to push merchandise at every turn. The biggest discounts tend to come on \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d \u2014 the last Saturday before Christmas, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail analysis firm.But Black Friday does matter. Consumers surveyed by the retail federation said they planned to shop more on Black Friday than on any other day of the Thanksgiving weekend.And Black Friday maintains cultural cache, especially for \u201cnew Americans,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, as recent immigrants are more likely to take part. \u201cThat\u2019s how you learn to be an American consumer, by showing up and shopping on Black Friday.\u201d\u2014 Zach WichterAdvertisement"}

We want to hear from you.]\u201cThis solidifies New York\u2019s importance and significance in tech,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the dean of New York\u2019s venture capital community and co-founder of Union Square Ventures.Amazon, like most big tech companies, is no stranger to New York. It already has over 2,000 workers in New York, from e-commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers.Facebook has over 2,000 New York employees, including Yann LeCun, its chief artificial intelligence scientist and a pioneer in the field. Salesforce employs more than 1,000 at its new offices in New York. And tech stalwart IBM chose the city as the headquarters for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.Most technology work in New York has traditionally been in service of other industries. That market, too, is growing briskly as banks, retailers, advertising and consulting firms \u2014 major employers in New York \u2014 are all getting digital makeovers and hiring. Goldman Sachs, for example, employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including data analysts, app developers, digital security and blockchain experts. Manuela Veloso, head of the machine-learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, joined JPMorgan Chase this year to lead its A.I. research team.The five companies with the most tech-related job listings in New York over the last three months on Indeed.com, the jobs listing site, are Amazon, BNY Mellon, Capgemini, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.Measurements of tech sector jobs vary, depending on definitions. But the broad picture is a growing labor market for well-paying jobs. From 2010 to 2017, according to government statistics, tech sector employment grew by 53,000 in the city, or 65 percent, to an estimated 134,700. And the average salary of $147,300 in 2016, the most recent estimate available, was far higher than the citywide average of $89,100 for all private employers.Types of tech jobs in New York City, 2016Manufacturing15%TelecommunicationsIncludes internet serviceproviders like Verizon22Internet-relatedIncludes Google andsimilar companies48Computer systems design12OtherTypes of tech jobs in New York City, 2016Manufacturing15%TelecommunicationsIncludes internet serviceproviders like Verizon22Internet-relatedIncludes Google andsimilar companies48Computer systems design12OtherSource: Office of the New York State ComptrollerBy The New York TimesThe Bay Area, to be sure, remains the nation\u2019s high-tech epicenter. New York is growing impressively, but its tech work force, according to most analyses, is less than half and perhaps one-third that of the Bay Area.But the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Silicon Valley, took in $12.8 billion. Start-ups in the Washington, D.C. region, where Amazon plans to put another large headquarters, received $575 million in the third quarter.In the past, New York start-ups typically sold out to larger tech companies. That, too, is changing. Mr. Wilson, the venture capitalist, pointed to MongoDB, a database supplier, and Etsy, an e-commerce seller, as examples of start-ups that held out and went public in recent years.MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share.\u201cNew York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.The rise of New York\u2019s tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education \u2014 a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city\u2019s work force, whose progress enhanced New York\u2019s appeal to Amazon.After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition.The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazon\u2019s board.For technologists who have recently come to New York, part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked: New York\u2019s huge and diverse economy, and its culture.\u201cEverything is tech-driven on the West Coast,\u201d said Jeannette Wing, who left Microsoft Research last year to become the director of Columbia\u2019s Data Science Institute. \u201cBut the East Coast is more well rounded. It is about technology, but not just technology for its own sake.\u201dKeith Collins contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Mike Isaac here, your trusty, San Francisco-based reporter covering all things Facebook, ride-hailing and other Silicon Valley ephemera. It has been a while since I wrote my last newsletter, so bear with me if I\u2019m a bit rusty.Social media was the thing to watch this week. The midterm elections finally took place, with Americans poised to see whether or not a widely predicted \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democrats would sweep the country. As it turned out, that wave was more of a choppy surf; Dems took back the House, while Republicans held onto their majority in the Senate.As Americans made their way to the polls on Tuesday, another big story was whether we would see a repeat of the 2016 presidential election: Everyone was looking for trolls and disinformation.Facebook, home to more than two billion regular users, was the obvious target. Since Russian-backed trolls succeeded in a widespread influence campaign that reached millions of Americans in 2016, Facebook has been under pressure to safeguard its network against the threat of further foreign meddling. The company, to much ado from the press, set up a \u201cWar Room\u201d to catch any last-minute information operations.Jair Bolsonaro, often called the Donald Trump of Brazil, surged to an Election Day victory, aided \u2014 at least in part \u2014 by voter suppression and disinformation tactics that flooded private groups in WhatsApp. That problem is more difficult to deal with on WhatsApp because it is encrypted. And users generally trust private messaging services more than they do more public venues like Facebook.Election Day in the United States was indeed a spectacle for Facebook, but for different reasons than we thought. Save for one episode, the day went off without much of a hitch. We\u2019re still holding our breath, but according to Facebook, there were no enormous reveals, no last-minute election night disasters, nothing that seemed to throw the electoral process completely off the rails.I guess we should be happy that things didn\u2019t go completely sideways after two years of scrutiny and preparation. Perhaps, at least for a moment, we can breathe a collective sigh of relief.Here are a handful of other things you may have missed last week:When Nintendo\u2019s game designers were struggling to name the character, Mr. Segale knocked on their office door. He was there to yell at Minoru Arakawa, then the president of Nintendo of America, for being past due on the rent. As soon as he left, the team knew it had its name: \u201cSuper Mario!\u201d Mr. Arakawa said.Mike Isaac is a technology reporter based in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Behind the G.M. Cutbacks, and Why Trump Is Angry ", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House signaled that the automaker could suffer for planning thousands of layoffs, but the company says the course is essential to its future.When General Motors announced that it would idle five North American plants and eliminate thousands of jobs, it said the move would ease the burden of spending billions of dollars to develop the battery-powered vehicles of the future.But the White House put a question mark over those plans on Tuesday when President Trump \u2014 irate over the cutbacks \u2014 threatened to punish G.M. by ending federal tax credits that have helped underwrite that automaker\u2019s electric-vehicle fleet.Apparently referring to G.M.\u2019s federal rescue from bankruptcy in 2009, the president added: \u201cThe U.S. saved General Motors, and this is the THANKS we get! We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies, including for electric cars.\u201dSo a day after announcing a plan meant to put it on firmer financial ground by shedding money-losing operations and refocusing its resources, the biggest of Detroit\u2019s automakers found itself on the defensive.At a White House news briefing, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of disappointment, even anger\u201d in the administration over G.M.\u2019s decision \u2014 a sentiment he said he had shared in a \u201clengthy conversation\u201d with Ms. Barra. He cited the recent renegotiation of a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico on terms that he said were \u201ca great help to the automobile industry, and to autoworkers.\u201dG.M.\u2019s shares rose almost 5 percent on Monday, but they gave back about half of those gains on Tuesday in the face of the administration\u2019s unhappiness and its threat over the tax credits.A bright future for electric vehicles is one of G.M.\u2019s goals. Here are some of the calculations, and the uncertainties, behind the course it has chosen.Tesla is the only carmaker to have sold more than 200,000 electric cars in the United States. At the end of this year, the tax credit on Tesla vehicles falls to $3,750.G.M. says it has sold about 190,000 \u2014 mostly hybrid Volts, a model it said Monday it was discontinuing, and fully electric Bolts \u2014 and will pass 200,000 early next year. There are proposals in Congress that would extend or expand the credit, but the Trump administration\u2019s opposition could dim or kill those prospects. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at certain subsidies regarding electric cars and others and whether they should apply or not,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said Tuesday. \u201cCan\u2019t say anything final about that, but we are looking into it.\u201dOf the five factories that G.M. is mothballing, three are assembly plants: Lordstown, Ohio; Oshawa, Ontario; and the Detroit-Hamtramck plant in Michigan. All are almost certainly losing money, and make cars whose sales have plunged. As a result, the plants are operating well below capacity. Production in Lordstown fell by more than half last year from 2016. This year it has operated just a single, eight-hour shift each day. Typically, car plants must operate two shifts to generate profits.Moreover, the outlook for each plant is grim. With gas prices low, American consumers have flocked to S.U.V.s and all but abandoned small cars, like the Cruze, which is made in Lordstown, and the Impala, the Buick LaCrosse, and the Cadillac CT6, made at Detroit-Hamtramck. The plant in Oshawa also produces the Impala.Not necessarily. G.M. specifically announced that the plants were now \u201cunassigned\u201d \u2014 that is, they have not yet been assigned new vehicles to make after they stop production in 2019. Next year the company and the United Auto Workers union will negotiate a new labor contract. In past negotiations, the union has given concessions on wages and other cost-saving measures in exchange for the company\u2019s keeping plants open. Idling the plants now gives G.M. a powerful bargaining chip in the contract talks.In addition, G.M. is working on a dozen or more electric vehicles that it plans to roll out in two to four years. Those models will have to be made somewhere, and some could end up in one or more of the three idled plants.It\u2019s not clear. Tesla has proved that tens of thousands of people are willing to buy upscale electric cars. It has not yet proved definitively that it can make money doing so. That\u2019s also a big hurdle for G.M., as well as Ford and most other major automakers. G.M. and others have produced electric vehicles, but sales for each model have usually amounted to a few thousand cars a month \u2014 far too few to turn a profit. G.M. produces the Chevrolet Bolt, an electric car that is supposed to go up to 238 miles before needing a recharge. But so far this year, it has sold only about 13,000 Bolts.As for the huge investments in self-driving technologies, their profit potential is even less certain. G.M. has poured billions of dollars into its autonomous-driving unit, G.M. Cruise, and has recruited Honda and SoftBank, the Japanese technology giant, as partners.G.M. Cruise is working on a self-driving car with no steering wheel and no pedals, and it intends to use the car in driverless and delivery services that the company hopes will become a lucrative line of business.G.M. may be one of the first to rush into this field, but it faces an unfamiliar path and plenty of competition. Ford, Uber, Lyft and Waymo, the self-driving company started by Alphabet, the parent of Google, are all working on driverless services. Even if these services generate profits, it could be years before the companies earn back their investments.Not a lot. The halting of production at these three sites doesn\u2019t mean G.M. is struggling. On the contrary, the company continues to report billions in profits, thanks to buoyant pickup and S.U.V. sales.G.M. took this action because it is being squeezed. It is losing money on the small cars and sedans these plants make, and it needs to keep investing in new technologies. By idling the three assembly plants \u2014 the other two make transmissions \u2014 it hopes to use the savings to help fund its electric-vehicle and autonomous-driving ambitions. That particular need to shift capital investment is not an issue in other sectors. And while the industry is the largest manufacturing sector, it makes up only about 4 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.A broader economic slowdown could certainly cause grief for automakers. While Ms. Barra said one factor in G.M.\u2019s move was to \u201cimprove our downturn protection,\u201d she also made a point of saying the automaker was acting \u201cwhile the company and the economy are strong.\u201d So a few idle auto plants are not necessarily a leading indicator for the broader American economy.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Tesla's electric car sales. Tesla is the only company to have sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles in the United States, not the only company to sell 200,000 over all.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zur\u00fcck ins Gleichgewicht", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNach dem Tod unseres Sohnes f\u00fchlten wir uns traurig, stolz auf ihn und auf uns - und leer. Und so haben wir als Familie versucht, auf den Weiten der Landstra\u00dfen wieder zu uns selbst zu finden.Im Januar starb unser Sohn im Alter von f\u00fcnf Jahren \u2013 pl\u00f6tzlich, aber nicht unerwartet. Von Geburt an litt er an einer komplizierten Herzkrankheit, die mehrere Operationen und h\u00e4ufige \u00e4rztliche Behandlungen erforderlich machte. Sein kurzes Leben war voller Wunder und er besa\u00df ein ruhiges Gem\u00fct, das ein Gegengewicht war zu der normalen kindlichen Energie seiner beiden Br\u00fcder.Zu f\u00fcnft machten wir oft gemeinsame Ausfl\u00fcge in unserem schon etwas betagten, aber meist zuverl\u00e4ssigen 1998er Subaru Outback, wobei die Jungen auf der R\u00fcckbank Songs der Blues Brothers mitsangen - bei strahlendem Sonnenschein hinunter zum Strand, raus zu den Gro\u00dfeltern bei Matsch und Schnee oder zur\u00fcck \u00fcber den Interstate Highway ins heimische Brooklyn nach monatelangen Aufenthalten in einem weit entfernten Krankenhaus.Nach dem Tod unseres Sohnes f\u00fchlten wir uns traurig, stolz auf ihn und auf uns - und leer.In Gespr\u00e4chen mit Therapeuten erfuhren wir, dass Menschen Verluste auf unterschiedliche Art und Weise verarbeiten. Meine Frau brauchte diese Bew\u00e4ltigung durch \u201cTeilnahme\u201d, bei der sie der Realit\u00e4t des Todes unseres Sohnes ins Auge sehen und sich ihrer Trauer direkt stellen konnte.Ich hingegen floh in die \u201cAblenkung\u201d und besch\u00e4ftigte mich mit unz\u00e4hligen Kleinigkeiten, um nicht in tiefe Verzweiflung zu versinken. Arbeit war nat\u00fcrlich ein probates Mittel, aber das reichte nicht aus. Ich r\u00e4umte in unserer kleinen Wohnung gr\u00fcndlich auf. Ich half unserem \u00e4lteren Sohn, einen Computer zusammenzubauen. Und ich plante eine verr\u00fcckte Autotour, denn eigentlich wollte ich nur weg von hier - am liebsten mit mehr als 100 km/h.Meine Frau hatte einmal erw\u00e4hnt, dass sie gern Mount Rushmore sehen wollte. Das schien weit genug weg zu sein und die Sache war entschieden. Und dann las ich noch, dass es dort Ende August eine totale Sonnenfinsternis geben sollte, weit weg von zu Hause und nur zu beobachten innerhalb eines etwa 100 km breiten Landstreifens.Also bat ich auf meiner Arbeitsstelle um einen Monat Urlaub im Sp\u00e4tsommer und sie sagten Ja. Ich fragte meine Frau, ob ihr die Idee gefiele, und sie sagte nicht Nein. Und da ich die Ablenkung suchte, begann ich zu planen.F\u00fcr die Route hatten wir ein paar Grundregeln aufgestellt. Wir wollten nicht mehr als drei oder vier Stunden pro Tag fahren - ein Reisetempo, das uns binnen f\u00fcnf Wochen nach Rushmore und zur\u00fcck bringen w\u00fcrde und uns trotzdem Zeit gab, unterwegs Amerika zu erkunden. Dabei wollten wir versuchen, nur solche Orte zu besuchen, an denen wir vorher noch nie waren. Und um der hektischen Verlockung zu widerstehen, nichts verpassen zu wollen, w\u00e4hlten wir f\u00fcr jede Zwischenstation nur eine Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeit aus.Google Maps war sehr hilfreich bei der Sch\u00e4tzung der Fahrzeiten, aber ich ging dennoch zum AAA-Autoclub und holte mir jede kostenlose Landkarte, derer ich habhaft werden konnte. Immer wenn mich der Kummer packte, holte ich eine Karte hervor und vertiefte mich in die mir unbekannten Weiten eines Landes, das ich nie wirklich gesehen hatte.Die von mir gew\u00e4hlte Route begann an unserem Haus in Brooklyn und erstreckte sich \u00fcber den Mittleren Westen hinweg bis nach South Dakota und dann zur\u00fcck \u00fcber Nebraska und Missouri zu den Great Smoky Mountains. Von dort aus sollte es dann heimw\u00e4rts gehen durch South Carolina, North Carolina und Virginia. 37 Tage sollte die Reise dauern.Jedes Detail wurde in eine immer volumin\u00f6sere Tabelle eingegeben, die beinhaltete, wo wir jede Nacht schlafen w\u00fcrden, was wir jeden Tag unternehmen k\u00f6nnten und wie weit wir zum n\u00e4chsten Zwischenstopp fahren m\u00fcssten. Immer wenn mir meine Emotionen zusetzen, nahm ich mir die Tabelle vor und f\u00fcgte eine neue Zeile oder Spalte hinzu und verlor mich in Tagtr\u00e4umen von endlosen Stra\u00dfen.Alles in allem w\u00fcrde unsere Route durch 17 Bundesstaaten f\u00fchren und knapp 10.000 km lang sein. Au\u00dfer Rushmore und der Sonnenfinsternis sollte es diese H\u00f6hepunkte geben:Ein ohrenbet\u00e4ubendes Nascar-Truck-Rennen am Pocono Raceway; die Besichtigung einer \u201cButterkuh\u201d-Skulptur auf der Ohio State Fair; eine Bustour entlang der Rennstrecke des Indianapolis Motor Speedway; Pr\u00e4sident Lincolns ehemaliges Wohnhaus in Springfield, Illinois; Baseballspiele der unteren Liga in Davenport, Iowa, und Omaha, Nebraska; ein Baseball-Fangspiel, dort wo der Film \u201eFeld der Tr\u00e4ume\u201c gedreht wurde; eine Besichtigung der Winnebago-Fabrik; ein Blick auf den ber\u00fchmten Corn Palace in South Dakota; f\u00fcnf Tage Erholung in den Black Hills; ein f\u00fcnfst\u00fcndiger Tagesausflug zum Devils Tower, Wyoming; ein Rafting-Trip auf dem Niobrara River in Nebraska; zwei N\u00e4chte in einem Union Pacific Caboose, einem historischen Zugabteil au\u00dferhalb von Omaha; eine Fahrt in kleinen Waggons hinauf zum Gateway Arch in St. Louis; eine Geburtstagsfeier f\u00fcr unseren \u00e4lteren Sohn in einer Nashville Honky-Tonk-Bar; Zelten in den Great Smoky Mountains; und Camping, keine 300 Meter von der Meeresbrandung entfernt in einem State Park s\u00fcdlich von Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Die Planung hatte sich gelohnt. Es war ein unglaubliches Abenteuer.Auf der gesamten Tour sammelten unsere S\u00f6hne Andenken: Von dreckigen Kronkorken bis hin zu den beliebten Junior-Ranger-Abzeichen, die man in Nationalparks, Museen und Gedenkst\u00e4tten erwerben kann. (Unser \u00e4lterer Sohn hatte gerade die vierte Klasse abgeschlossen, so dass diese Besuche im Rahmen des Programms \u201eEvery Kid in a Park\u201c f\u00fcr ihn kostenlos waren.) Nach dem Ausf\u00fcllen eines Aktivit\u00e4ten-B\u00fcchleins wurden sie vom Park-Ranger feierlich mit einem kleinen Plastikabzeichen dekoriert. Sie sammelten auf der gesamten Reise jeweils 17 Abzeichen, darunter ein spezielles \u201cSonnenfinsternis-Forscher\u201d-Abzeichen, auf das beide besonders stolz waren.Doch ein zerm\u00fcrbend langer Tag in Charleston, South Carolina, - \u201cWir k\u00f6nnen hier drei Abzeichen bekommen!\u201d - verpasste unserer Jagd auf Abzeichen einen D\u00e4mpfer. Fort Sumter war beeindruckend und Fort Moutrie auch recht interessant. Doch als ich dabei helfen sollte, noch ein weiteres Wortr\u00e4tsel auf der Veranda des historischen, aber relativ unspektakul\u00e4ren Charles Pinckney National Historic Site auszuf\u00fcllen, schwor ich, nie wieder nur wegen eines Abzeichens in einem Nationalpark Halt zu machen.Nat\u00fcrlich gab es ein paar Orte, die den Kindern weniger Spa\u00df machten. Nach einem peinlichen Wutanfall in Frank Lloyd Wrights Stockman House in Mason City, Iowa, legte ich ihnen nahe, demn\u00e4chst ihren Unwillen auszudr\u00fccken, indem sie sagen sollten: \u201cIch bin noch nicht alt genug, um das sch\u00e4tzen zu wissen.\u201dDieser Spruch wurde von nun an zum Running Gag, vor allem zu den Mahlzeiten. \u00c4lter und weiser wie wir beide sind, haben meine Frau und ich alle m\u00f6glichen neuen Speisen ausprobiert \u2013 vom Maid-Rite-Sandwich Iowa-Style \u00fcber geschmorten Bison bis hin zum Missouri Barbecue. Doch unsere S\u00f6hne, noch immer etwas m\u00e4kelig, blieben lieber bei Hamburgern. Leider hatten sie den guten Vorsatz schon l\u00e4ngst vergessen, als wir das National Quilt Museum in Paducah, Kentucky, besuchten und sie sich, Schmerzen vorspielend, auf dem Boden herumw\u00e4lzten, bis wir sie besch\u00e4mt aus der Ausstellung herauszerrten.Wahrscheinlich war das H\u00f6rbuch der sinnvollste Bestandteil unseres Reisegep\u00e4cks. Wir h\u00f6rten uns durch die ersten vier B\u00fccher hindurch, also insgesamt 50 Stunden (so dass uns die restlichen 67 f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Reise verblieben). Unser \u00e4lterer Sohn hatte bereits alle B\u00fccher gelesen, aber als die Meilen an uns vorbeiflogen, war er genauso fasziniert wie wir alle. Das einzige Problem: Falls wir anhielten, bevor ein Kapitel endete, weigerten sich die Jungen, das Auto zu verlassen und bettelten uns an, den Player wieder einzuschalten, indem sie mit verstellten Babystimmen \u201cHawwy Potttoooo!\u201c kreischten.Zur allgemeinen Unterhaltung hatte ich au\u00dferdem einige Spotify-Playlisten erstellt, darunter eine Auswahl von motivierenden Road-Songs: \u201cMoving Right Along\u201d von den Muppets, Willie Nelsons \u201cOn the Road Again\u201d, \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard Theme\u201d gesungen von Waylon Jennings und Johnny Cash mit \u201cI\u2019ve Been Everywhere\u201d. Wir spielten diese jedes Mal bei der Abfahrt, und am Ende der Tour sangen wir die Songs alle zusammen. Und wenn Cash einen Ort erw\u00e4hnte, den wir auch besucht hatten, sangen wir mit aus vollem Halse.Wir hatten auch Playlisten f\u00fcr den jeweiligen Bundesstaat, die wir stets abspielten, wenn wir eine Grenze \u00fcberquerten. Diese begannen mit der Hymne der \u00f6rtlichen Universit\u00e4t, gefolgt von einer bunten Mischung von Songs, die ich online gefunden hatte. Nicht alle davon gefielen den Jungen, denn sie klangen wie Werbejingles (So wie \u201cSweet Virginia Breeze\u201d).Es gab aber auch ein paar ausgefallene Hits wie Bobby Vintons \u201cPennsylvania Polka\u201d, Patsy Clines \u201cBlue Mooo-oo-n! Of Kentucky\u201d und Groucho Marx mit seinem charmant-albernen Song \u201cOmaha, Nebraska\u201d (\u201cin the foothills of Tennessee \u2026 I\u2019ll meet you on the corner of Delancey Street and Avenue B\u201d).Auch diese haben wir mitgesungen, und selbst nach unserer R\u00fcckkehr nach Hause tun wir das noch immer. Sie sind unsere besten Souvenirs.Doch wir haben auch andere Souvenirs gesammelt.In den Monaten nach dem Tode unseres Sohnes war Reisen verbunden mit der st\u00e4ndigen Erinnerung an unseren Verlust. Ohne ihn waren wir irritiert und desorientiert. Kamen wir an einen neuen Ort, so w\u00fcnschten wir uns, er m\u00f6ge dabei sein, um den Ort mit uns zu erkunden.Um den Schmerz zu lindern, sammelten wir \u00fcberall Steine, beschrifteten sie mit Ort und Datum und bewahrten sie in einem kleinen Leinenbeutel auf. Wenn der Grabstein unseres Sohnes dann endlich aufgestellt sein w\u00fcrde, k\u00f6nnten wir den Beutel zum Friedhof mitnehmen und die Steine nach j\u00fcdischer Tradition \u00fcber seinem Grab aufstapeln.Das Ritual des Steinesammelns half uns, sein Andenken zu bewahren und uns mit seiner Abwesenheit abzufinden. Am Schluss der Reise hatten wir 12 Pfund Steine und Kiesel gesammelt sowie einen Krabbenpanzer und einen zerbrochenen Seeigel, den die Jungen am Strand von South Carolina gefunden hatten.Manchmal zogen wir weiter und verga\u00dfen, ihm einen Stein mitzunehmen, weil wir einfach zu viel Spa\u00df hatten. Dann plagte mich das schlechte Gewissen und es war fast so, als h\u00e4tten wir ihn dort zur\u00fcckgelassen.Im Sommer davor war das anders gewesen, denn den hatten wir meist in Krankenh\u00e4usern verbracht \u2013 in einem sauberen und sterilen Umfeld, weitab von jeglicher Natur. Selbst Blumen und Pflanzen waren dort zum Schutz der Patienten verboten.Einer der \u00c4rzte war der Meinung, unser Sohn solle so oft wie m\u00f6glich hinaus an die frische Luft, selbst als die Krankheit sich dramatisch verschlimmerte. In einem Krankenbett wurde er dann nach drau\u00dfen gerollt, wobei seine Begleiter die Atemhilfe stets sorgenvoll im Blick behielten. Er beobachtete dann meist aufmerksam seine Br\u00fcder, die sorglos in der Sommersonne spielten, unbelastet von der \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigenden B\u00fcrde des Krankenhauses.Irgendwann wurde er dann in ein anderes Krankenhaus verlegt, wo wir bei einem entfernten Fl\u00fcgel des Komplexes einen kleinen Kr\u00e4utergarten entdeckten, 20 Minuten zu Fu\u00df von seinem Zimmer entfernt. Schon bald war dieser Platz zu seinem Lieblingsort geworden.Irgendwie half frische Luft, Wunden zu heilen.In der Hoffnung auf blauen Himmel und gutes Wetter hatten wir f\u00fcr unsere erste Reise ohne ihn ein gutes Zelt und bequeme Isomatten angeschafft. Unser vorheriges Zelt war n\u00e4mlich kaum gr\u00f6\u00dfer als unser Wohnzimmer und deshalb brauchten wir ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Modell. Was sollte das f\u00fcr ein Urlaub werden, wenn es in unserem Zelt enger sein w\u00fcrde als unsere Wohnung?Die H\u00e4lfte der N\u00e4chte verbrachten wir unter freiem Sternenhimmel und ich w\u00fcnschte, es w\u00e4ren mehr gewesen. Drau\u00dfen konnte ich besser schlafen und das Sitzen am Lagerfeuer erzeugte seltene Momente der Ruhe, Stille und Besinnung.Den Jungen gefiel das ebenfalls, aber sie waren auch gern drinnen. Sie a\u00dfen leidenschaftlich gern Hotelwaffeln, sprangen in den Pool (falls es einen gab), und schauten heimlich ein paar Minuten der TV-Show \u201cTeen Titans Go!\u201d im Cartoon Network, w\u00e4hrend wir duschten.Doch die Hotels mit ihren Klimaanlagen, ihren wei\u00dfen W\u00e4nden und ihrer typischen Kunst erinnerten mich zu sehr an Krankenh\u00e4user. Meistens w\u00e4lzte ich mich im Bett herum, weil ich in dem klinisch sauberen, gemangelten Bettzeug nicht einschlafen konnte.Schlie\u00dflich wollten wir ja auf dieser Reise auch herausfinden, wie wir als vierk\u00f6pfige Familie (statt zu f\u00fcnft) weiterleben sollten, w\u00e4hrend jeder von uns versuchte, die Trauer auf seine pers\u00f6nliche Art zu bew\u00e4ltigen.Auf dem ersten Streckenabschnitt, der Fahrt durch den Mittleren Westen, fragten wir uns nach jeder Aktivit\u00e4t: \u201cGlaubst du, das h\u00e4tte ihm auch gefallen?\u201d. Hierin waren wir uns alle einig: Er h\u00e4tte den Kaninchenpavillon auf der Ohio State Fair gemocht, die Kuh-Skulptur aus Butter m\u00f6glicherweise nicht. Er h\u00e4tte sich in Lincolns Wohnhaus in Springfield gelangweilt und er h\u00e4tte in Iowa am Drehort des Films \u201eFeld der Tr\u00e4ume\u201c begeistert das Maisfeld erkundet.Als wir South Dakota erreichten, hatte ich jedoch genug von dieser Frage. \u201cEs spielt keine Rolle, was wir glauben, oder?\u201d, platzte es eines Abends aus mir heraus. \u201cWeil wir es nie erfahren werden.\u201d Dennoch war mir klar, dass dies unsere Art war, seiner zu gedenken, uns vorzustellen, er sei bei uns, selbst wenn eine solche Reise undenkbar gewesen w\u00e4re, als er noch am Leben war.Gelegentlich lie\u00dfen auch unsere Jungen ihrem \u00c4rger freien Lauf, denn wie bei uns vermischte sich ihre Trauer mit normalen Stimmungsschwankungen und dem \u00dcberdruss, mit drei anderen Menschen auf kleinstem Raum, weit weg von Zuhause, eingeengt zu sein. Der Aufenthalt im Freien schuf Abhilfe - frische Luft schnuppern, auf freier Fl\u00e4che Bison spielen oder als Harry Potter mit Zauberst\u00e4ben Verw\u00fcnschungen aussprechen.Trotz der vielen Dinge, die wir auf unserer Tour erlebt haben, blieb unsere Trauer allgegenw\u00e4rtig - noch immer frisch, schmerzhaft und real.Solche Erinnerungen wurden manchmal direkt und schonungslos geweckt, wie durch den Grabstein im Lincoln-Museum in Springfield zum Gedenken an Eddie, den Sohn des Pr\u00e4sidenten, der kurz vor seinem vierten Geburtstag starb. Im n\u00e4chsten Raum, der in historischer Detailtreue eingerichtet und mit Wachsfiguren ausgestattet war, stand das Sterbebett ihres elfj\u00e4hrigen Sohnes Willie im Wei\u00dfen Haus.Manchmal kamen diese Erinnerungen auch v\u00f6llig unerwartet, wie der kleine Baum, den ich auf einem Naturwanderweg im Black Moshannon State Park in Pennsylvania entdeckte. Als ich ihn sah, wie er dort so ganz allein auf einem Fleckchen Wiese stand, wusste ich genau, an was er mich erinnerte. Meine Eltern hatten ein paar Monate vorher in einem Park in der N\u00e4he unserer Wohnung einen \u00e4hnlichen Baum gepflanzt. Nat\u00fcrlich hatten seine Gro\u00dfeltern es sich nicht nehmen lassen, am Fu\u00dfe des Setzlings eine kleine Gedenktafel zum Andenken an einen kleinen Jungen anzubringen.Manchmal wurden die schmerzhaften Erinnerungen auch nur ganz unterschwellig geweckt. F\u00fcr mich gab es diese Momente, wenn ich die beleuchteten Schilder der Notaufnahmen sah, wenn wir sp\u00e4t in der Nacht in eine uns unbekannte Stadt mit leeren Stra\u00dfen hineinfuhren. F\u00fcr meine Frau waren es die Landkarten und die schmalen rotgef\u00e4rbten Stra\u00dfen darauf, die sie an das Geflecht von Adern erinnerten, die von seinem unvollkommen geformten Herzen in alle m\u00f6glichen Richtungen f\u00fchrten.Nach der R\u00fcckkehr stellte ich eine Kollektion zusammen: Meine alln\u00e4chtlichen Notizen, alle Quittungen f\u00fcr Eink\u00e4ufe, Postkarten und verschiedenste Papierschnipsel (entwertete Tickets und dergleichen), und zusammen mit \u00fcber sechshundert Fotos umfasste die Sammlung schlie\u00dflich vier gro\u00dfe Ordner.Die Ordner sind nun prall gef\u00fcllt mit frischen Erinnerungen an unsere gro\u00dfartige Tour durch Amerika und abgesehen von zwei laminierten Familienfotos, die noch aus den Lebzeiten unseres verstorbenen Sohnes stammen, gibt es keinerlei Hinweise auf die unterschwellige Traurigkeit, die uns \u00fcber die gesamte Reise begleitete.Um ganz ehrlich zu sein: M\u00f6glicherweise war die Reise ein paar Tage zu lang geraten. Es kommt der Moment, an dem der Schwung nachl\u00e4sst. Man steuert gen Heimat und ganz egal, was noch auf dem Plan steht, es f\u00fchlt sich weniger an als ein Ziel, sondern mehr als ein Umweg. Die letzten Etappen auf dem Wege zur\u00fcck - im sanften Nieselregen durch Roanoke, Virginia, (Transportmuseum), das Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, (Viehauktion) und Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, (Minigolf) - brachten zwar eigentlich eine Menge Spa\u00df, aber wir alle versp\u00fcrten die Anziehungskraft, die uns nach Hause zog.Mir brach die R\u00fcckkehr fast das Herz. Wir hielten an einer Tankstelle in einem alles andere als anheimelnden Teil von New Jersey (Benzin ist dort auch nicht mehr so billig wie fr\u00fcher) und all das, was ich glaubte hinter mir gelassen zu haben, st\u00fcrzte wieder auf mich ein.Bei der \u00dcberquerung der Outerbridge Crossing schalte ich oben auf dem Scheitelpunkt der Br\u00fccke die Playlist f\u00fcr New York an und Frank Sinatras schmachtende Stimme erklang im Gedr\u00e4nge des Autoverkehrs. Und war es nun perfekte Planung oder einfach nur Gl\u00fcck - genau in dem Moment, als wir die Verrazano-Narrows-Br\u00fccke erreichten, Staten Island hinter uns lassend, sangen die Beastie Boys \u201cNo Sleep Till Brooklyn\u201d.Und w\u00e4hrend wir den Bogen der Br\u00fccke hinauffuhren und ich sah, wie sich Brooklyn aus dem grauen Nebel erhob, brach ich in Tr\u00e4nen aus.\u00dcbersetzung von Melissa YamanAdvertisement"}

Now, it\u2019s about meeting student and community needs.Supported byWhen Jean Kaneko started volunteering at her son\u2019s kindergarten class in Santa Monica, Calif., she was surprised by how hesitant the children were to play with toys they didn\u2019t recognize, to make a mess and, well, to be kids.\u201c\u2018I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m not good at that,\u2019\u201d she remembered them saying. Even at 4 or 5 years old, there was already a \u2018be perfect, don\u2019t fail\u2019 attitude, she said.So she started bringing in blocks, strange clay creations, crafts, and handing them to the students with no instructions. They warmed to it. The craft supply grew, the activities changed and soon teachers were asking her to go into classrooms and even host after-school programs and camps.Ms. Kaneko describes herself as a maker, and she brings maker spaces to schools all over her area. Now, those include 3-D printers and virtual reality technology.\u201cMaker\u201d is a vague term \u2014 and that\u2019s intentional.Making should be practical and relevant to some problem a student sees, Dale Dougherty, who is considered by some to be the founder of the maker movement, said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s this sort of creative process of taking an idea, developing it, using tools and techniques to make it real,\u201d he added.Some who attend are educators who want to learn about it; some are students showing off their maker projects in a supersize show-and-tell; some work for education nonprofits and want to keep up with trends. Some are not so sure about it.\u201cI\u2019m a little unclear about what being a maker is about,\u201d said James Bacchi, a biology teacher at Brooklyn Technical High School who was at the event in Queens in September. He grew up working in his dad\u2019s garage, fixing fuel pumps, modifying his bicycle. He was a hands-on learner. \u201cI guess that\u2019s missing from today\u2019s kid culture,\u201d he said.He was interrupted by one of his former students, James DeLaura, who was there with his physics professor at Kingsborough Community College. He reminded Mr. Bacchi that he had been one of his environmental sciences students a few years ago.\u201cI have a 3.8 now,\u201d Mr. DeLaura said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not a terrible high school student anymore.\u201d And he has become a maker himself, teaching 3-D printing in middle school classes.Carolyn Barnhart, a science teacher at Fredericton High School in New Brunswick, Canada, was about two decades into her teaching career when she heard about making, and cautiously began to apply it to her classroom. She had been accustomed to airtight lesson plans and scripted lectures.It was an adjustment: \u201cYou\u2019re not the expert anymore. You\u2019re not seen as the sage on the stage,\u201d she said of making. She found herself searching Google to answer things her students asked her, and sometimes simply saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dAt first, she was terrified. But the students never pushed back on her new methods. In fact, they grew more and more excited and engaged in her classroom \u2014 especially, she said, the students she had trouble energizing about math and science before.\u201cThe kids need to be solving real-world issues in our classrooms, not just taking notes about it, not just reading about it,\u201d she said. \u201cScience is dirty. Science needs to be messy, and we have to be confident enough to get messy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Is Said to Be Shopping for More Real Estate in New York", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Amazon may not be the only technology giant considering a big expansion in New York.Google is in discussions to move into a planned 1.3 million square foot office complex at the St. John\u2019s Terminal building on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, according to a person with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans but not permitted to speak about it publicly.The property, which is expected to be completed in 2022, would allow the internet giant to significantly increase its presence in the city. Google employs around 7,000 in New York, and a space that size could allow it to more than double its local work force.Amazon\u2019s so-called HQ2 effort, a search for a second corporate headquarters outside of Seattle, has dragged on for about a year. Many were surprised when word leaked last week that the e-commerce company could end up with two new big offices instead of one. The other would be in Northern Virginia, outside of Washington.Google opened its first office in New York 18 years ago, but the company\u2019s ever-expanding work force has driven demand for larger offices and more staffing in the city.In March, Google spent $2.4 billion to buy the Chelsea Market building in Manhattan, where the company had set up some of its New York offices. The Chelsea office is Google\u2019s main workplace in the city, housing product and business teams for web search, ads and sales. A Google spokeswoman said it was also planning to add an additional 320,000 square feet of space with the redevelopment of Pier 57.The search for local real estate is part of a general expansion in the United States for Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Last month, Alphabet said it had hired 9,000 employees in the United States this year, raising its total to 94,372 as of September. That was an increase of more than 16,000 from a year earlier.St. John\u2019s Terminal is being developed in Hudson Square by Oxford Properties, a Toronto-based developer. The 12-story building will incorporate a former freight terminal for the High Line and showcases rail beds as a central design feature.As tech companies expand in New York, they are likely to compete with Wall Street for engineering talent.New York has always had a significant technology industry of its own, though it has been dwarfed by the financial industry. For years, the city has ranked second or third among communities in the United States in total tech venture capital investment \u2014 with Silicon Valley and its surrounding area far and away the leader.But one thing the city has not been able to claim in a long time is a technology powerhouse of its own. The closest home of a tech heavyweight is Armonk, N.Y, about 40 miles away, where IBM is based. (IBM also has major offices in Manhattan.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Went to a Steak Dinner Annuity Pitch. The Salesman Wasn\u2019t Pleased. ", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyLOS ANGELES \u2014 The pitch arrived in my aunt\u2019s mailbox, just after her 80th birthday and in the wake of a few frightening weeks for retirement investors. \u201cTired of the stock market roller coaster ride? Want to protect your principal and lock in interest earnings?\u201d the invitation read. It offered the opportunity to hear all about it at a \u201ccomplimentary gourmet meal,\u201d featuring \u201cNew York steak.\u201d Even better, it would be at a restaurant in Granada Hills that her mother, Vi, had loved.The mailer was addressed to another member of the family who no longer lives there, but my aunt had no problem registering when she called the number on the card. It said a guest was welcome, too. I volunteered, and she registered me as well. I had long wanted to attend one of these steak dinners, and if you are in or near retirement, or sort the mail of people who are, you might be curious about them as well. Such dinners have been a cause for concern.I genuinely hoped not to encounter any such thing Tuesday night. But I did.In short (and short is hard when trying to break down products like these), equity indexed annuities tend to work something like this: You hand over a sum of money to an insurance company for a period of time, and at the end you are guaranteed to get at least that much money back if you don't take some money out along the way. You generally don\u2019t get a monthly check, and you agree not to take large amounts out during that period unless you are willing to pay a penalty. As for that equity index part, the insurance company will generally add money to the amount you initially plunked down, providing a portion of the gains reflected in whatever stock index the insurance company is using. Mr. Halaby\u2019s staff distributed material before dinner that included a chart that looked like the one at the front of the room. It showed an equity indexed annuity performing 8.29 percent better, after an 18-year period from 1998 to 2016, than the S&P 500 stock market index.But the pamphlet\u2019s chart has some fine print \u2014 so small that my 47-year-old eyes could barely make it out \u2014 that disclosed the following: The index it was using was not accounting for the reinvestment of dividends from all those stocks.A quick email the next morning to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, confirmed the following: When you do reinvest dividends, that basket of stocks does 33.72 percent better than the annuity.I had hoped to ask our host some questions after the steak, which was cooked medium unwell (no one asked how I wanted it prepared). But by then, Mr. Halaby, who has an active license to sell insurance, including annuities, was gone.I made an appointment to meet him at his office the next morning, and he did not seem happy to see me once I told him who I was. He disparaged my employer and profession and accused me of attending under false pretenses. I tried to ask him a long list of questions, starting with a few about that chart. At first, he said he would talk to me if I gave him five references of other people I had written about. (I sent him several names later that day.) Then, he gave me the name of a person he identified as his lawyer and told me to contact her about the chart. (She eventually declined to answer any of my questions.)When I turned my line of inquiry to the cease-and-refrain order, he got up from his chair and said, \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d Then he showed me the door.He told me over the phone on Thursday night, after I returned to New York, that he did not deliberately send mail to people over 70 years old and resented what he called the \u201cdog whistle\u201d effect of writing about someone older than that, as if I were trying to imply that he was preying on people well into their older years. I said no one had asked my aunt\u2019s age when she R.S.V.P.\u2019d. Another point I made: I know that mailing list rental firms aren\u2019t perfect \u2014 the 50-something relative whose invitation arrived at my aunt\u2019s hadn\u2019t lived there for 15 years \u2014 but my aunt had also given me an identical invitation that a 76-year-old friend received at his home address. To learn more about the chart in the pamphlet, I contacted the annuity company that created it, American Equity Investment Life Holding Company. I asked Steven D. Schwartz, vice president of investor relations for the company, why the chart doesn\u2019t show the returns for the S&P 500 with reinvested dividends. He said it was because the point of the chart is to show the lack of volatility of an equity indexed annuity compared with the S&P 500.Of course, showing the S&P 500 with reinvested dividends would also do that.In any event, Mr. Schwartz said, Mr. Halaby should not be using that chart, because the company has discontinued the annuity it depicts. \u201cIt is expected that our independent producers will use current materials,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote in an email, using industryspeak for salespeople who don\u2019t work directly for the insurance companies. When I asked Mr. Halaby about that, he told me that someone who had not been working for him for very long put the old chart in the pamphlet. He added that the chart behind him at the dinner, which to my eyes looked identical to the one in the pamphlet, was in fact different. He would not tell me what company had created it. While the steak dinner pitch might not be a con game, it is a bit of a psychological dance. You attend, you eat free food and by the time the cheesecake arrives, you may feel you owe a salesperson a one-on-one meeting.Then you\u2019re on the hook. If these meals didn\u2019t catch lots of people, salespeople wouldn\u2019t keep paying for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Cuts Ties With Washington Firm That Sought to Discredit Social Network\u2019s Critics", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook said Thursday that it had ended its relationship with a Washington-based consulting firm, Definers Public Affairs, which spread disparaging information about the social network\u2019s critics and competitors.Late Wednesday, Facebook decided to terminate its relationship with Definers after the publication of the Times article prompted an outcry, said a person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Top Facebook executives including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg were not aware of the specific work being done by Definers, the person said.In a statement, Facebook said it had not hidden its ties to Definers and disputed that it had asked the firm to spread false information.\u201cIt is wrong to suggest that we have ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook\u2019s behalf, or communicate anything untrue,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in the statement.\u201cThe relationship with Facebook was well known by the media \u2014 not least because they have on several occasions sent out invitations to hundreds of journalists about important press calls on our behalf,\u201d the spokeswoman added.Facebook initially hired Definers to monitor news about the social network. It expanded its relationship with the firm in October 2017 when scrutiny of Facebook was increasing over how Russian agents had used the social media site to sow discord before the 2016 United States presidential election.The Times reported on Wednesday that earlier this year, a conservative website called NTK Network began publishing stories defending Facebook and criticizing Facebook rivals like Google. NTK is an affiliate of Definers.In addition, Definers circulated a research document this summer casting Mr. Soros, the billionaire liberal donor, as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement. Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros and groups that had criticized Facebook, including a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros\u2019s son and Color of Change, an online racial justice organization.An official at Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but that no grants had been made to support campaigns against Facebook.\u201cWe are proud to have partnered with Facebook over the past year on a range of public affairs services. All of our work is based on publicly available documents and information,\u201d a Definers spokesman said in a statement.He added, \u201cThe document referenced in the Times story regarding the anti-Facebook organization\u2019s potential funding sources was entirely factual and based on public records.\u201dAfter the Times article, other organizations also began re-evaluating their relationship with Definers. One of those was Crooked Media, which runs the popular political podcast Pod Save America. Mr. Miller is a frequent contributor to the podcast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Killer Robots the Future of War? Parsing the Facts on Autonomous Weapons", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarIt\u2019s a freezing, snowy day on the border between Estonia and Russia. Soldiers from the two nations are on routine border patrol, each side accompanied by an autonomous weapon system, a tracked robot armed with a machine gun and an optical system that can identify threats, like people or vehicles. As the patrols converge on uneven ground, an Estonian soldier trips and accidentally discharges his assault rifle. The Russian robot records the gunshots and instantaneously determines the appropriate response to what it interprets as an attack. In less than a second, both the Estonian and Russian robots, commanded by algorithms, turn their weapons on the human targets and fire. When the shooting stops, a dozen dead or injured soldiers lie scattered around their companion machines, leaving both nations to sift through the wreckage \u2014 or blame the other side for the attack.The hypothetical scenario seems fantastical, but those battlefield robots already exist today in an early form. Milrem Robotics, a company based in Estonia, has developed a robot called THeMIS (Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry System), which consists of a mobile body mounted on small tank treads, topped with a remote-weapon turret that can be equipped with small or large-caliber machine guns. It also includes cameras and target-tracking software, so the turret can pursue people or objects as programmed. This is a human-controlled system for now (and Milrem, for its part, insists that it will remain that way), but the components are there for a robot that can interpret what it sees, identify likely combatants and target them, all on its own. \u201cThe possible uses for the THeMIS,\u201d the robot\u2019s builders gush on the website, \u201care almost limitless.\u201dUnder what circumstances can and should militaries delegate the decision to take a human life to machines? It\u2019s a moral leap that has raised fundamental questions about the nature of warfare and that military planners, human rights organizations, defense officials, research analysts and ethicists have yet to reach a consensus on.The most advanced automated American weaponry has focused on defensive applications. When rocket and mortar attacks threatened large American bases in Iraq in 2003, the Army developed the Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar system (C-RAM) \u2014 a rapid-fire 20 mm cannon that can identify an incoming airborne threat, alert a human operator and \u2014 with the operator\u2019s press of a button \u2014 track and destroy it with a burst of special ammunition that self-destructs in midair to minimize damage to friendly personnel or civilians below.Those weapons were based on a naval gun system, the Phalanx, that\u2019s considered a last line of defense against antiship missiles. The Phalanx was just one of the Navy\u2019s automated answers to late Cold War pressures: Soviet naval doctrine relied on overwhelming enemy ship squadrons with as many as 60 cruise missiles at a time. \u201cWhen large salvos come in, it\u2019s impossible for humans to be able to say, \u2018O.K., you\u2019ve got to take this missile out first,\u2019\u201d says Robert Work, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cThere was no way for humans in the combat information center to be able to keep up with that.\u201d So American planners developed Phalanx and the Aegis Combat System, which links sensors on fleet ships and aircraft to identify airborne threats and, with operator input, automatically attack them with shipboard missiles. It was programmed, Work says, \u201cto have a totally automatic setting, and literally the human at some point pushes the button and the machine makes all the decisions.\u201dIt depends on how autonomous they are. \u201cThere\u2019s a type of fire-and-forget weapon where the weapon itself decides, \u2018O.K., this is what I see happening in the battlefield, and I think I\u2019m going to have to take out this particular tank because I think this tank is the command tank,\u2019\u201d says Work. This is his definition of a true lethal autonomous weapon system: an independent weapon that decides everything about who and what it destroys once a human has unleashed it.Darpa (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has a program called CODE, or Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment, to design sophisticated software that will allow groups of drones to work in closely coordinated teams, even in places where the enemy has been able to deny American forces access to GPS and other satellite-based communications. CODE \u201cis not intended to create autonomous weapons,\u201d says Paul Scharre, author of \u201cArmy of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War,\u201d but rather adapting to \u201ca world where we\u2019ll have groups of robots operating collaboratively together under one person in supervisory control. The program manager has compared it to wolves hunting in coordinated packs.\u201dCODE\u2019s human operators monitor the swarm without micromanaging it, and the autonomy of the drones means that they are programmed to improvise and adjust as they pursue their preset mission. \u201cThe idea here is that CODE is going after mobile or rapidly relocatable targets, so the target locations cannot be specified precisely in advance by humans,\u201d Scharre says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a Tomahawk cruise missile, where you just program in the coordinates and then the missile goes and strikes it. The drones have to be able to search an area and find targets on the move.\u201dA simpler autonomous system is the loitering munition: a drone that can fly for some time on its own, looking for specific signals, before finding a target and crashing into it with an explosive payload. Israel produces a loitering munition, dubbed the \u201cHarpy,\u201d which is designed to hunt out and destroy enemy radar stations and which became a sticking point in U.S.-Israeli relations when some were sold to China in the late 1990s. Companies in several nations, including Slovakia and the United States, have also produced loitering munitions.\u201cImagine that we are fighting in a city and we have a foe that is using human life indiscriminately as a human shield,\u201d says Tony Cerri, who until recently oversaw data science, models and simulations at the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. \u201cIt\u2019s constantly in your face as you\u2019re out walking in the street. You can\u2019t deal with every situation. You are going to make a mistake.\u201dAutonomous weapons, he suggests, are much less likely to make such mistakes: \u201cA robot, operating with milliseconds, looking at data that you can\u2019t even begin to conceive, is going to say this is the right time to use this kind of weapon to limit collateral damage.\u201d This argument parallels the controversial case for self-driving cars. In both instances, sensor-rich machines navigate a complex environment without the fatigue, distractions and other human fallibilities that can lead to fatal mistakes. Yet both arguments discount the emergent behaviors that can come from increasingly intelligent machines interpreting the world differently from humans.Even advocates concede that autonomous military robots could behave in new and unforeseen ways, inducing new errors \u2014 the way trading algorithms unleashed on the stock market can cause flash crashes or a pair of dueling book resellers\u2019 algorithms on Amazon could end up pricing a $70 biology text at $23 million, which happened in 2011. Those possibilities \u2014 and the danger that lethal machine errors could precipitate bloodier conflicts \u2014 will require close cooperative measures between robot-armed nations. Delegations to the United Nations have begun discussions on regulating lethal autonomous weapon systems under an existing Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which governs things ranging from booby traps to blinding lasers.In August, a United Nations working group set down principles that could be used to guide future international regulations on lethal autonomy. Chief among them is the idea of ensuring human responsibility for any weapon throughout its life cycle, which could create new liabilities for arms manufacturers. The United Nations group is set to release a formal report, with recommendations for future action, this month. Besides governments, the group\u2019s meetings attract their share of activists, like Mary Wareham of Human Rights Watch, who is the global coordinator for the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, an initiative launched in 2013 with the explicit mission of keeping humans in charge of lethal decisions in war.\u201cWe\u2019ve focused on two things that we want to see remain under meaningful, or appropriate, or adequate, or necessary human control,\u201d Wareham says. \u201cThat\u2019s the identification and selection of targets and then the use of force against them, lethal or otherwise.\u201d Those are the key decision points, critics say, where only a human\u2019s judgment \u2014 capable of discriminating between enemies and civilians, and keeping a sense of proportionality in responding \u2014 can be accountable and satisfy the conventions of war.The way in which we tend to justify war or condemn certain acts \u201chas to do with the fact that human beings are making decisions that are either moral or immoral,\u201d says Pauline Shanks Kaurin, a professor specializing in military ethics at the U.S. Naval War College. \u201cIf humans aren\u2019t making those decisions, if it\u2019s literally machines against machines, then it seems like then it\u2019s something else, right?\u201dFor Work, the question of morality might come down to America\u2019s adversaries. \u201cThere may be a place and time in the future where we\u2019re up against an opponent who is less worried about delegating lethal authority to a machine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s a long way off, and we have a lot of time to think about that and a lot of time to take action and make sure that we can still control all the weapons.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: The Homeless Millennial Connection", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.It\u2019s similar to the $1.2 billion bond that Los Angeles voters approved two years ago to build thousands of homes for the chronically homeless.Will these measures work? Much depends on how quickly and how well they are carried out, and what happens to the economy.Dennis Culhane, an expert on homelessness at the University of Pennsylvania, says there is also a much more unappreciated factor: demographics.A previous bout of severe homelessness came in the 1980s, when the second half of the baby boomers were in their 20s.These large groups of young people can push up rents as they search for apartments, aggravating the housing shortage.\u201cWe certainly see that homelessness in this population is bigger relative to the generation before them,\u201d Dr. Culhane said.And by dint of their numbers, millennials may be also straining the mental health system.\u201cThere is anecdotal evidence from cities I\u2019ve been to where people are saying that this young adult population with severe mental illness is overwhelming the health system,\u201d Dr. Culhane said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take many people to have a big impact.\u201dWhat does demography say about the future of homelessness in California?Nationally, births declined for seven years from the millennial generation peak of 4.2 million. There may be some hope in that. Yet the millennial cohort will be with us for decades longer \u2014 and Dr. Culhane believes it will take a \u201cmassive infusion of resources\u201d to assist the neediest among them.\u201cAt the scale of homelessness we are witnessing on the West Coast, little pilot efforts here and there are not going to make a dent,\u201d he said.This is the 10th and final puzzle in our series of California-themed crosswords, written by the veteran Times crossword constructor and San Diego resident Bruce Haight.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)If you happened to be wandering around downtown San Francisco on Halloween night, you might have noticed an unusual sight at the top of Salesforce Tower: flames with an ominous flickering eye in the middle.\u201cIt has been said that bonds are formed through shared experiences, the strongest of which are forged in fire,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cWe ask of you to help us unite the city, and raise the torch on Halloween night as one community, together.\u201dPerhaps it was the petition\u2019s begrudgingly inclusive ending that persuaded the Salesforce gods: \u201cOakland can come, too.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

The company will also require verification that they are citizens, legal residents or groups lawfully allowed to participate in the election.The European Parliament elections, in May, will be for 705 seats across 27 countries. The vote doesn\u2019t often draw widespread attention, but the coming campaign is being closely watched as a wider referendum on the role of the European Union in the region.

{"Headline": "James H. Billington, 89, Dies; Led Library of Congress Into Digital Age", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames H. Billington, the librarian of Congress for nearly three decades, who led the nation\u2019s treasure house of knowledge into the digital age and added millions of books, films and cultural artifacts to its historic collections, including a trove of tweets, died on Tuesday in Washington. He was 89.His daughter Susan Harper Billington said the cause was complications of pneumonia.Mr. Billington, a distinguished authority on Russian and Soviet history, was named by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 as the 13th director of the library, the repository of the American experience founded in 1800 under legislation that shifted the capital from Philadelphia to Washington.He arrived at the dawn of a new era. The internet was in its infancy, newspapers and printed books were thriving, computers were relatively unsophisticated, and Google, Facebook and Twitter were still over the horizon. For all its millions of books and manuscripts in 450 languages, its 550 miles of shelves and 19 reading rooms, the Library of Congress was terra incognita to most Americans, even to many scholars.Unlike thousands of public libraries in America \u2014 descendants of the one founded by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia in 1731 \u2014 it was never a lending library. Begun as a research arm of Congress, the Library of Congress evolved into a resource for the government and scholars, a custodian of the nation\u2019s written, artistic and cultural heritage, with the added duty of overseeing the United States Copyright Office.\u201cFifty or 100 years from now,\u201d Mr. Billington told a Senate panel in his appropriations request in March 2015, \u201cmembers and constituents will turn to the national collection to read, learn from and build upon the creative output of American authors, composers, filmmakers, artists and others \u2014 just as citizens today are reaping the value of creative works that were added to the collections in 1965 and in 1915.\u201dMr. Billington, who succeeded the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, was not a librarian. He was 58 at the time and had studied, written and taught Russian history for most of his life, notably at Harvard and Princeton. He was fluent in Russian and skilled in Polish, German, Italian, French, Yiddish and Dutch. He had also led the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Smithsonian Institution for 14 years and advised President Reagan on Soviet Russia.Supervising 3,100 employees and a $600 million budget as the librarian of Congress, Mr. Billington was the library\u2019s chief public relations promoter and protagonist in the annual fight for funding from Congress. He usually projected increasing expenses, rising tides of acquisitions and dwindling staffs to cope with problems of storage, preservation and services to library users.Like his predecessors, Mr. Billington had the task of preserving the world\u2019s greatest collection of books, maps, manuscripts, photographs, prints, recordings, motion pictures and other artifacts, and of cataloging all of it to keep the materials safe and retrievable.He was also charged with enlarging that trove, and he did so energetically. Under his watch the collections almost doubled in size, growing to 160 million items, from the 85 million he had inherited in 1987. His critics said his acquisitions became an unmanageable torrent of 12,000 new items a day.In many ways Mr. Billington had to reinvent the job. He had many materials copied digitally, making them available to wider audiences. In 1991, he linked the library to educational institutions around the country. He also took advantage of the end of the Cold War, which enabled the library to create links to institutions in Russia and former Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe, and to exchange materials and help them establish parliamentary libraries.Accessing archives of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, Mr. Billington and other scholars hoped to answer questions of history: Did the American diplomat Alger Hiss spy for Moscow? How many people died in Stalin\u2019s purges in the 1930s? What Kremlin secrets can be told of the Berlin crisis of 1958-61 and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962? And how did the Soviet Union last so long and fall apart so fast?Mr. Billington also promoted the American Memory National Digital Library program, which since 1994 has made many of more than 24 million books and historical and cultural documents from the library and other research institutions available online.The digitized items, only a fraction of the library\u2019s holdings, are used in classrooms across the nation. They include manuscripts by Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson, the Gettysburg Address and photographs of the Civil War, the wreckage of the Johnstown Flood of 1889, the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and Atlanta in 1864, before Sherman\u2019s infamous march to the sea.\u201cLibrarians are the gatekeepers to the new technological possibilities of the electronic culture,\u201d Mr. Billington told Library Journal. \u201cBut they are also the dream keepers. They are the custodians of the past.\u201dFilm and broadcast holdings were given particular emphasis under Mr. Billington. In 1989 he created the National Film Registry, which has added 25 movies each year. In 2007, David W. Packard and the Packard Humanities Institute gave $155 million, the largest gift in the library\u2019s history, to create the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, Va. It has six million films, television broadcasts and recordings, including Al Jolson singing \u201cSwanee\u201d and Edward R. Murrow broadcasting from London in the blitz.Expanding into social media, the library in 2010 acquired Twitter\u2019s digital archive of billions of tweets from around the world sent since the company\u2019s inception in 2006. Among them is President Barack Obama\u2019s celebratory election-night tweet from 2008.Responding to a barrage of derision for linking the likes of Thucydides and the founding fathers with Justin Bieber, Mr. Billington said the tweets would be valuable to historians someday. \u201cThe Twitter digital archive has extraordinary potential for research into our contemporary way of life,\u201d he said.Though Mr. Billington was rarely a focus of controversy, the library\u2019s inspector general, in a 2013 audit, warned that millions of items, some acquired as long ago as the 1980s, remained piled up in overflowing buildings and warehouses, virtually lost to the world.And the Government Accountability Office in 2015 accused Mr. Billington of mismanaging the library\u2019s information technology systems, and of ignoring for years a legal requirement to hire a chief information officer. In three years, the report said, there had been five acting information officers, each without full authority to manage the library\u2019s systems.\u201cThe library does not have the leadership needed to address these I.T. management weaknesses,\u201d the G.A.O. said after its yearlong investigation.Mr. Billington defended his management but did not fulfill a promise to develop a new digital information plan and hire a permanent chief information officer.He retired on Sept. 30, 2015, and in 2016 President Obama nominated Ms. Hayden, the longtime head of Baltimore\u2019s library system, to fill the post.James Hadley Billington was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa., on June 1, 1929, to Nelson and Jane (Coolbaugh) Billington. His father, an insurance executive, was a descendant of Mayflower pilgrims; his mother was a writer and a homemaker.Though his father never attended college, he instilled a love of books in James, who attended public schools in the Philadelphia area and was valedictorian of his class at Lower Merion High School in 1946 and then at Princeton in 1950. He studied at Oxford University on a Rhodes scholarship, earning a doctorate in 1953. He then joined the Army and became a first lieutenant.In 1957 he married Marjorie Anne Brennan, who survives him. In addition to her and his daughter Susan, he is also survived by another daughter, Anne Billington Fischer; two sons, James Jr. and Thomas; and 12 grandchildren. Mr. Billington, who died in Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, lived in McLean, Va.He taught history at Harvard from 1957 to 1962, then moved to Princeton, where he taught until 1974. He was a visiting professor at universities in Helsinki, Leningrad, Moscow and Paris.As director of the nonpartisan Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars from 1973 to 1987, he founded the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies and The Wilson Quarterly. He received more than 40 honorary degrees.Mr. Billington wrote six books on Russia and revolutionary traditions. His \u201cMikhailovsky and Russian Populism\u201d (1958) was the first major biography of the 19th-century Russian social critic Nikolai Mikhailovsky. In \u201cThe Icon and the Axe: An Interpretive History of Russian Culture\u201d (1966), he examined 1,000 years of intellectual life in Russia. Leonard Shapiro, in The New York Review of Books, called it a \u201cmagisterial survey of the past.\u201dMr. Billington\u2019s other books were \u201cFire in the Minds of Men: Origins of the Revolutionary Faith\u201d (1980), which assessed revolutions in many countries over 200 years; \u201cRussia Transformed: Breakthrough to Hope, August 1991\u201d (1992); \u201cThe Face of Russia\u201d (1998), a companion to a PBS documentary that he wrote and narrated; and \u201cRussia in Search of Itself\u201d (2004), a post-Soviet analysis.His family said he had been writing his memoirs in retirement.Ana Fota contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Walmart Lot, a Rough Refuge for California Wildfire Evacuees", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICO, Calif. \u2014 After Jarrad Winter escaped on foot from the wildfire that destroyed his home in Magalia, Calif., and then caught a hair-raising ride with a neighbor through the flames and out of the hills to safety in Chico, he was at wits\u2019 end. Like dozens of other survivors, he found refuge in the field by the local Walmart.\u201cI never thought I\u2019d live in a tent city,\u201d said Mr. Winter, 39, a Marine Corps veteran and software developer who had recently emerged from a stretch of homelessness, only to lose everything he owned in the devastating Camp Fire, the deadliest California wildfire on record. \u201cI mean, this is America; we\u2019re not supposed to live this way. But here we are, man, the new normal.\u201dFirefighters are still battling the colossal blazes in California that have already claimed 80 lives, 77 of them in Butte County north of Sacramento, where the Camp Fire has raged. Nearly 1,300 people remain missing and unaccounted for.As of Sunday evening, the Camp Fire, which has already burned nearly 150,000 acres, was about 65 percent contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.While the struggle to contain the fires continues, many evacuees are collecting in makeshift settlements outside the scorch zones, and wondering how they will pick up the pieces to extricate themselves from this tragedy.Some who fled from Magalia, Paradise and other burned towns in the forested Sierra Nevada foothills of eastern Butte County are staying in the tent city at the Chico Walmart. Others sleep in their cars over at the Target parking lot. Then there are those who are relying on the kindness of strangers, or going from one shelter to the next.California is the richest state in the country, home to technology giants like Google and Facebook and the multimillionaires who lost luxury homes around Malibu to wildfires this month. But the blazes are also laying bare the economic inequality that distinguishes the state, as shallow-pocketed survivors grasp for the kinds of ad hoc strategies commonly seen after disasters in the developing world.\u201cWe were always a paycheck-to-paycheck kind of town,\u201d said Anjeanette Ramey, 30, who had worked in customer service in Magalia but was unemployed when the fire hit.\u201cAll I made it out with were the clothes on my back,\u201d she said on Sunday morning, gazing at the Walmart tent city, where she has stayed for several days. \u201cMy house, my car, gone. No money, no job. I have no idea what happens next.\u201dHer boyfriend\u2019s reaction was more about suspicion and anger. He declined to give his name, saying he didn\u2019t want to be known as a victim, and said the couple was avoiding formal shelters because he thought they were unsafe for people like him and his neighbors, who he thought counted for little with the rich and powerful.With reliable information in short supply, dark rumors and speculation spreads easily in the tent city and other places where evacuees are camping.People in the tents said there had been talk a few days ago that the authorities were planning to clear them out. But guards with the private security firm that patrols the Walmart property said there were no plans to evict the evacuees.Clad in bulletproof vests, they pointed to the portable toilets that had been set up in the parking lot, and the donated food and clothing that had been made available to those in the tents.The Walmart lot, which had emerged as an unofficial distribution site for aid, also features a whiteboard with names of people who are missing from the fires, and a list of shelters that have available beds.Some of the tent people say they have not gone to shelters because they find security in numbers at the Walmart; others say they like being near friends and neighbors who also lost their houses.\u201cThis is my home now,\u201d said James Reed, 65, a retired tow-truck driver, pointing to his 1968 Chevrolet El Camino. His house in Magalia, bought two years ago, was destroyed, he said, and \u201cbeing here, in this parking lot, I\u2019m reminded I\u2019m not the only one.\u201dMr. Reed, wearing an AC/DC baseball cap, said he was still trying to make sense of what had happened. He said he was getting used to sleeping in his car, enduring temperatures that have been dipping down close to freezing at night.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m like a snake on a rock, warming up a little bit,\u201d Mr. Reed said around midday. \u201cGetting out of that fire was like a B-rated horror movie. I never thought I\u2019d see something like this in this country.\u201dThe camp at the Walmart has become a place for fire evacuees to connect and share information with another group they suddenly have a lot in common with. People who were already living on Chico\u2019s streets before the blazes started have flocked to the parking lot, not least to partake in some of the free food.Robert Talk, 61, a former amusement park worker, said he enjoyed telling jokes and sharing gossip with the evacuees. He said that his small dog, Princeton Peabody, interacts effortlessly with strangers, making it easy to start conversations with people in the camp.\u201cWe\u2019re kind of all in the same boat now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Mr. Talk remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s good for normal folk to realize we\u2019re just like them. A lot of us are in this situation through no fault of our own. Maybe this\u2019ll open eyes, so we can start helping each other more.\u201dOne new resident of the tent camp, Kelly Clark, said that she appreciated meeting Mr. Talk and his dog and talking about how the fires were still raging around them. With a smile, she pointed to her tent and said: \u201cLook at my new condo. Luxurious, isn\u2019t it?\u201dMs. Clark, 39, said that money was now a problem after the house where she lived with her boyfriend was destroyed. She said she was unemployed, and wondered how much longer they could sleep rough outside the Walmart. She, too, was wary about going to one of the shelters, saying she had heard talk that viruses were spreading there.\u201cI just feel freer out here, like I\u2019m not locked up inside with a bunch of other people crying about what they lost,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cWhen it starts raining, maybe then we\u2019ll make a move. But until then, we\u2019re staying put.\u201dThere is rain in the forecast for Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon could have transformed a city. It could have created 50,000 high-paying jobs in a place with higher-than-average unemployment. It could have become the largest employer in a midsize city, or the central player in a new regional tech hub. That decision suits a company that has long worn its power and size in Seattle awkwardly. And it has been clear since early in its HQ2 search that Amazon wasn\u2019t interested in leveraging its growth for a civic reinvention project.The ratings agency Fitch shrugged on Tuesday at what it considered the \u201cmuted impact\u201d on the economies and credit ratings of New York and Washington.Amazon quickly would have become the largest employer, the permanent front-page story and the obvious scapegoat for civic problems in any of these midsize cities. In Seattle, the company has chafed at all these roles as residents have increasingly demanded that Amazon give back to the city that helped make it so successful.\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is a company that frankly engages very little, certainly in city politics \u2014 frankly, even in civic life,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Brien, a member of the Seattle City Council for the past nine years. \u201cFor a company whose power has increased dramatically, they haven\u2019t used that power in a way that I am used to seeing from other prominent name brands that are based here in Seattle.\u201dOther companies keep lobbyists in close contact at City Hall. They buy expensive tables at charity dinners. They publicly campaign for transit improvements. Mr. O\u2019Brien said of Mr. Benioff, \u201cHe\u2019s pretty explicit that, \u2018Hey, this is our city, too, and any problem that\u2019s the city\u2019s problem is our problem.\u2019\u201d That was in stark contrast to Amazon\u2019s behavior, Mr. O\u2019Brien said.

{"Headline": "The Commonality of A.I. and Diversity", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow to create more diverse workplaces and how to use artificial intelligence ethically are among the more challenging dilemmas facing business and government.These topics were the subject of two separate task forces that met at last week\u2019s DealBook conference. Each task force, composed of about a dozen experts and industry leaders, met for an hour, emerging with some specific guidelines and focus areas that were shared with the conference and could be taken back to companies and other organizations for discussion.Companies must be aware of and recognize that algorithms are not neutral, but created by humans with biases and beliefs and make every effort to eliminate those biases.It is far too easy to assume that technology has an objectivity that humans don\u2019t. But the reality is that \u201cartificial intelligence and machine learning and algorithms in general are designed by none other than us \u2014 people,\u201d said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School.\u201cA.I. takes input data and races off to make inference and decision making about the world at lightening pace,\u201d he said, and those inferences will include unacknowledged biases unless people are willing to recognize them and invest the time and money to weed them out.Frida Polli, co-founder and chief executive of Pymetrics, which uses A.I. to recruit employees for companies, showed how biases could arise and how they could be diminished.Algorithms used in A.I. are created using training data sets. If a training data has an overrepresentation of any gender or ethnicity, the features that distinguish that group may be overweighted.To confront the problem, she said her company tested an algorithm on a reference group of people of different genders and ethnicities to check for bias. If there\u2019s an imbalance in the test run \u2014 far more men, for example, or whites are predicted to be good hires rather than women or other races \u2014 then \u201cwe can look at de-weighting features,\u201d she said, that alter the algorithm.Technology companies can and should help the government \u2014 and the military in particular \u2014 develop and use artificial intelligence, but it must be done thoughtfully and carefully.\u201cThe debate is ongoing about when and how to share technology with the government and specifically should companies share digital technology with the military,\u201d said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft.Most of the task force agreed that partnerships between technology companies and government on A.I. could be beneficial, but Serkan Piantino, founder and chief executive of Spell, a company that builds tools for those building A.I. technology, said there should be limits.\u201cAutomating the process to use lethal force is something I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable doing, given how little we know with what is going on with A.I. algorithms,\u201d he said.A.I. requires transparency within the companies building and using it and with the public.Having company employees debate and speak out on potentially controversial issues involving A.I. \u2014 such as at Microsoft \u2014 is one form of transparency. Dennis Crowley, co-founder and executive chairman of Foursquare, said his company had internal discussions when making business decisions that might have ethical implications.\u201cSometimes we have the opportunity to create more evil than good, and we need to talk about that,\u201d he said. One example, he said, was whether his company would work with fast-food chains that wanted to target those using cannabis dispensaries where it was legal. It hadn\u2019t been done before.\u201cThis was right on the edge, so we went to the ethics committee,\u201d Mr. Crowley said. In the end, \u201cwe decided to do the campaign. It was legal and clever and a good use of technology around a category where we don\u2019t see a lot of advertising.\u201dCordell Schachter, the chief technology officer for the New York City Transportation Department, noted that transparency would be crucial with those creating the city\u2019s future transportation technology, which would be driven by A.I.\u201cWe want to see the data \u2014 and not cherry-picked data \u2014 before it goes on the streets,\u201d he said.Companies should set targets and goals, along with incentives, as a way to foster a more diverse staff, but they shouldn\u2019t be used in a vacuum.\u201cAspirational goals are important, but \u201c it\u2019s just not enough,\u201d said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say you want to get the world or your company to 50-50 \u2014 there needs to be transparency around that.\u201dThat means what specifically is the goal, and what is the company doing to achieve that goal \u2014 \u201cboth good and bad,\u201d she said.\u201cThere is a growing body of evidence that suggests cognitive diversity contributes to better decision making at the board level,\u201d said Cyrus Taraporevala, president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. \u201cStudies show that diverse boards pay more attention to risk management and are less susceptible to cronyism and group think.\u201dBut there\u2019s a danger that goals become items to be checked rather than real change. Damien Hooper-Campbell, chief diversity officer at eBay, said that while setting goals and targets for diversity was important \u2014 and backing it up with real costs, such as bonus deductions, if the goals aren\u2019t met \u2014 you also have to \u201cmeet a company where it is.\u201dIf a company has just begun to focus on diversifying its work force, it needs to be educated on how to do it over time, he said. \u201cPeople talk about how businesses measure widgets and productivity, so they can measure this, too. But there\u2019s a big difference between widgets and human beings.\u201dFederal policies and legislation can play a role in promoting diversity in the workplace.Developing laws and policy to create diversity is not always a popular idea, but some say they believe that there are areas where government can help. John Hope Bryant, founder and chairman of Operation HOPE, a community organization, said there was a need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships. When the effort is aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get double credit for that double reach.\u201dA federal policy to encourage paid family leave would also play a crucial role in promoting diversity, said Sallie Krawcheck, chief executive and co-founder of Ellevest, a digital financial adviser for women.Federal policy could also help ensure that the information companies report on the makeup of their work forces and the compensation are truly transparent. For example, in Britain, many public-, private- and voluntary-sector companies are required to disclose average pay for men and women, including bonuses.In the United States, said Lauren Taylor Wolfe, managing partner of Impactive Capital, \u201ca lot of companies decide what they disclose and what not to disclose. If it\u2019s not done by level, it\u2019s not real transparency.\u201dTo be truly diverse and inclusive, a company must change its culture \u2014 and that has to come from the top down.\u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it, it will be an organ reject,\u201d said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase.Or as Ms. Taylor Wolfe noted, \u201ccompanies get what they celebrate, and if they celebrate diversity, they\u2019ll get it.\u201dNo one expects cultural change to happen quickly, but one of the important elements, Ms. Duckett said, is that bosses need to \u201cmanage to the difference.\u201d Don\u2019t manage everyone the same and expect the same results.After all, parents don\u2019t expect each child to be the same \u2014 they parent differently depending on a child\u2019s personality, strengths and weaknesses, she said. Managers have to do the same.She also noted that diversity was not the same as inclusion and companies must be aware of that. \u201cDiversity,\u201d she said, \u201cis being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance.\u201dFinally, change may seem glacially slow, but Mr. Hooper-Campbell said people shouldn\u2019t be surprised. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t but 100 years ago that I couldn\u2019t go to school with some of the people in this room.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: How Orange County Foiled Kevin McCarthy\u2019s Plans", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, had hoped to become the House speaker next year. Instead, Mr. McCarthy, a California Republican, will be returning as the minority leader after Democrats seized control of the House.No small part of the reason for this is that his 14-member California congressional delegation took a shellacking: Democrats picked up six Republican-held seats, out of seven on their target list. The latest Republican setback came Saturday, when The Associated Press declared that Gil Cisneros, a Democrat, had beaten Young Kim, a Republican.Mr. McCarthy tried to avoid this, directing money to endangered candidates and engineering a voter initiative to repeal the state\u2019s gas tax in a move to draw more Republicans to the polls.But a big factor in the wipeout may be that Mr. McCarthy forced members of his delegation to, if you will, walk the plank on the Republican tax bill.Whatever its other merits, the legislation proved costly for many California homeowners by capping the deduction for state and local taxes, which are famously high in California. Only two members of the California Republican delegation \u2014 Dana Rohrabacher and Darrell Issa, both of whom represent parts of Orange County \u2014 voted against the tax bill. Mr. Issa did not run again (he was replaced by a Democrat). Mr. Rohrabacher ran and lost.Democratic candidates like Katie Porter, who defeated Representative Mimi Walters, an Orange County Republican, said she reminded voters at every turn that Ms. Walters had supported the tax bill.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue in the district,\u201d Ms. Porter said over lunch a few days before Election Day. \u201cShe\u2019s blown a $1.9 trillion hole in the deficit. People are very concerned about the cuts in Social Security and Medicare that that is going to prompt.\u201dDrew Godinich, a strategist for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said candidates like Ms. Porter were pressed to seize on the tax bill in speeches, advertisements and debates. They portrayed it as a Republican giveaway to corporations that would lead to cuts in Social Security and Medicare.\u201cCan\u2019t underline how much that backfired on them here,\u201d Mr. Godinich said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Fires Coverage From Across the StateIn Other News\u201cAnderson, I feel like in my opinion, he\u2019s putting Oxnard on the map to the world,\u201d Dr. Dre said, according to The Star. \u201cIt reminds me of when I started, nobody knew where Compton was.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "On My Wedding Day, Wishing I Looked Like Someone Else", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMy eyes were too swollen for me to walk down the aisle. It wasn\u2019t from crying.I could hardly open my eyes because my eyelids were so swollen. In despair, I called out to Damian, my soon-to-be-husband. Then we called my doctor, who said, \u201cLooks like your bone marrow transplant came to your wedding.\u201dI had received a bone-marrow transplant several years earlier, which vanquished the leukemia in my blood and saved my life. But my new immune system sometimes went haywire. Submerging myself in the hotel bathtub the night before with a moist, fragrant washcloth over my eyes had probably been a bad idea; it likely vexed my sensitive system.Or maybe this was caused by stress? It hurt to look at myself. Why did my body have to go rogue today of all days?Just two and a half years before, I didn\u2019t think this day would happen. At lunch with my mother, I said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m probably not going to find a partner.\u201d I was 30 then and full-body irradiation had made me infertile. \u201cI\u2019m not what guys are looking for.\u201dI wasn\u2019t sad about this. On the contrary, I felt relieved. Finally free from hope and longing. But my mother couldn\u2019t stop crying.\u201cI\u2019m going to be O.K.,\u201d I said.The next day I boarded a plane for Arkansas and a Buddhist retreat center in the Ozark Mountains I had been to before. When I was ill, my parents worried I wasn\u2019t turning to Jesus, but Buddhism seemed to make more sense. My life had become an immersive education in impermanence and suffering.After releasing the pressure of needing to partner, after making my mother cry, I arrived at the retreat center. And there was Damian, wearing tan cargo pants, a beige button-down shirt and a Tilley hat. He looked Australian, but I knew he was British.I knew because I had heard about him during a previous visit, when I met his then-wife, Angela. Damian\u2019s green card had expired and he was stuck in England, unaware that Angela was lusting after a new guy. I actually advised her to ditch the new guy and stay with her husband, because he sounded so awesome. I even emailed her afterward to encourage her again, and I was sad when I learned they had divorced.\u201cSo, you\u2019re the Damian I\u2019ve heard so much about,\u201d I said.With a new green card, he was there for the same retreat and was helping build cabins for the center. I knew from Angela that he was in his late 40s, but he looked closer to my age.Damian would later say that after he met me, he kept thinking, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ibby?\u201d I did get the sense he was always finding me around the center, but not in a creepy way \u2014 more how a Labrador greets you at the door, tail wagging, ready to receive you.I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle rugged conditions, so I chose to camp the first night, but I didn\u2019t know how to set up my borrowed tent, so Damian set it up with me.As I organized my things, Damian lay half in the tent staring at the stars. He later told me he kept thinking he should leave, but he felt remarkably comfortable. I kept thinking he should stay, because I was afraid to camp alone. But I decided that sharing a tent with a stranger wasn\u2019t the best way to start a meditation retreat.And this was a silent retreat, or meant to be. The first day, I was eating lunch on the ledge of a cabin. With no room next to me, Damian plopped himself on the grass directly in front, grinning. I found the obviousness of his interest refreshing, but I couldn\u2019t say anything, so I stood up and moved next to him on the grass and we ate our lunch quietly, staring at a cabin wall.The second day, eating lunch under a tree, we watched a cricket jump onto another cricket and they started mating. Talk about an awkward silence!We went for a walk to a swimming hole, where we skipped rocks. Then I broke the silence. I had been sick, I told him, and I didn\u2019t want to waste my time or his, so I asked him every question I could think of. Do you like your mother? What about children? Cats or dogs? Would you get married again? Do you mind that my ovaries don\u2019t work?All those questions, and not one red flag.Damian wasn\u2019t fazed by my cancer-survivor status either. I was healthy by then, with a negligible chance of relapse, but my immune system could be wonky. I have already been through menopause, and I can no longer make tears \u2014 all side effects of the treatment that gave me more time on earth.Illness changes you in nonphysical ways too, aging your spirit. It can make you wiser but also more aware and scared of life\u2019s potential for pain.\u201cWell,\u201d Damian said, \u201cyou seem fearless to me.\u201dOn the third day, he kissed me. Then he told me he loved me.\u201cNo, it\u2019s too soon!\u201d I said. Then I remembered the meditation instructor told us to \u201cbe spacious.\u201d Maybe that meant, don\u2019t freak out?What I wanted was a man I could admire and a love that was abundantly clear. Damian was unafraid, attentive, generous and compassionate. It seemed as soon as I had let go of my hope and longing, he appeared.By the end of the retreat, I knew that while there had been life before Damian, now there could only be life with him.My parents, however, were not happy when I told them about him and us, concerned about our age difference and Damian\u2019s previous marriage.My father, an attorney, said, \u201cWhen one of my clients wants to marry a divorced man, I tell her to talk to the ex-wife first.\u201d\u201cBut Dad, I did that.\u201dHe also worried that Damian, who designs, builds and remodels homes, wasn\u2019t a college graduate. I had an answer for this too.The year Damian was sorting out his green card, the BBC interviewed him for a story about the benefits of meditation. Because he had meditated for more than 10,000 hours, neurologists figured his brain activity might look different from the brain of an average person, so they put him into an M.R.I. machine.\u201cMeet Damian, a man who can seemingly turn happiness on,\u201d the reporter, David Sillito, said, adding that the neurologist who read Damian\u2019s M.R.I. had called his brain \u201cbeautiful.\u201d I sent the link to my father.But the morning of our wedding, not even Damian could turn on my happiness. I had become Buddhist, found the retreat center and met the man I love because I once had cancer. Still, if ever there was a day that I didn\u2019t want to be reminded of this, it was today, and it was staring me in the face.My doctor prescribed antibiotics, Benadryl and steroids. Damian and I sat on the edge of the bed and meditated for an hour, which was our practice at the time. Then he went off with his best man and I tried to pull myself together. At the salon, as my hair was being twisted into a bun, my mother begged me to stop being so upset, saying it would only make my eyes worse.Damian says that my family, which is prone to stress-induced squabbles, didn\u2019t have a chance to fight that day because my eyelids elicited such sympathy. That\u2019s a very Buddhist interpretation. All I can say is I wish my eyelids had asked permission before sacrificing themselves to keep the peace.But later, as my mother and sister and sister-in-law helped me into my wedding gown, I looked in the mirror and thought, \u201cWow, I actually look pretty.\u201d One \u2014 or all three \u2014 of the drugs had worked. The swelling had left in its wake a burnt orange color that looked like makeup on my eyelids.Still, I didn\u2019t really arrive to my own wedding day until the doors to the chapel opened and I saw my niece dropping petals on the path I was about to walk. Everyone I love was there, staring at me, smiling. Some were crying. I just kept walking.We had a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony in a glass and wooden chapel in the woods of Eureka Springs, Arkansas. We included a Bible reading about love, since our families are Catholic, but most of the ceremony was in Tibetan: chants sung by a monk, accompanied by the ringing of a bell. Damian and I sat together silently, soaking it all in, as I experienced firsthand how suffering can transform into something beautiful.Advertisement"}

Dui! I am going to Lanzhou, too,\u201d I said, nodding vigorously to the kind-faced woman in her 40s, as we established that we were both alone and flying to the capital of China\u2019s Gansu Province \u2014 a spot in the country\u2019s interior along a northwestern part of the ancient Silk Road trade route \u2014 and that neither of us spoke the other\u2019s language.I had taken notice of Wei Zhaohan in the Beijing airport when she started listening to Chinese pop music videos next to me without headphones. This was my sixth or so visit to China, but my first without my relatives, who mainly hail from Shanghai and Beijing, and I\u2019d been missing that familiar element of noise and chaos: everyone talking over each other, picnic spreads of steamed buns and fruit laid out across airport waiting room chairs.\u201cYou can trust that I am a good person!\u201d she wrote into Baidu, and laughed as her friend drove us down a dark highway toward Lanzhou after midnight, which might be the midpoint of a Stephen King novel under other circumstances. But she was just one in a series of people who jumped in to help me \u2014 ordering for me at restaurants, getting me safely to my hotel, as Ms. Wei did. Most of them didn't realize I was Chinese-American at first; they just seemed to see a woman on her own in a strange land looking rather lost.A magnificent stretch of desert sandwiched between mountains, Gansu was once China\u2019s Wild West, containing the westernmost structures of The Great Wall, built to ward off attacking nomadic hordes, and legendary shrines dug into cliffs for the westward spread of Buddhism. But easier is relative and Gansu in November was not easy. Temperatures were below freezing in a landscape so beautifully barren it's hard to believe it can sustain life. There were few foreigners; almost no one spoke English; and I couldn\u2019t read menus or street signs. (I speak only basic, familial Chinese, like \u201cI already ate,\u201d and \u201cno, really, I can\u2019t eat any more.\u201d) They\u2019d already eaten, but insisted on ordering five more dishes just for me, all of them vegetarian, because Ms. Wei had noticed I\u2019d ordered a vegetarian meal on the plane. They drank hot water, which is a thing people do in the chilly North. And in between specialties like shredded potatoes stir-fried with chili peppers, Leader poured me shot glass after shot glass of baiju liquor. I know from many a banquet with my family that there\u2019s only one thing to do in that situation: lift your glass and shout, \u201cGanbei!\u201dIt was hard not to marvel at sheer human will up there, including the amount I\u2019d had to employ just to get to the view.The afternoon after my dinner with Ms. Wei, I had boarded a 6.5 hour train to Jiayuguan, which was the shortest I could find from the downtown Lanzhou train station \u2014 after I learned all the high-speed trains were sold out and left from a new train station, Lanzhou West, on the outskirts of the city, anyway.Onboard, a police officer introduced me to Jo, an English teacher from Jiayuguan. She not only woke me up when we had to get off the train at 2:30 a.m., but had her husband drive me to my hotel, where she negotiated my rate down to $29 for two nights (as opposed to the $90 I\u2019d booked online). I showered and huddled under my covers with all my winter clothes on because I couldn\u2019t figure out the heater. But I sure was glad I wasn\u2019t paying $60 more for that.The next morning, at Jo\u2019s suggestion, I walked on Jiayuguan\u2019s wide, relatively empty boulevards to a local restaurant, Wu Mai Er, to try a regional specialty: Lanzhou hand-pulled beef noodles. When I couldn\u2019t communicate my order, a man in line bought my bowl for me and showed me how to pick it up, put chili sauce, or lajiao, in it, and then sit at a counter to slurp the noodles from the steaming broth. The fortress underwent an impressive renovation in 2014. The evening I went, as the desert temperatures dropped precipitously with the sunset, I had the entire place to myself, walking up stone ramps used for bringing horses to lookout points and rolling down logs to crush enemies. At the exit, I caught up with Wei Gong, who was waiting for her taxi. A man who ran a shop selling tea sets made out of a local stone invited us to sit inside next to his wood-burning stove to warm our freezing hands.MONGOLIACHINAGREAT WALLSILK ROADN.

I\u2019d sprung for a luxurious \u201csoft sleeper\u201d car, with a comfortable bed and a door that closed. After four glorious hours of sleep, and a couple more waiting around in a taxi for the site to open, I walked into my first Mogao Cave to see 1,400 year-old Buddhas from the Tang dynasty.You can\u2019t get into the caves without a guide. After a bit of asking around I found an English-speaking tour, which had three people on it, including me. The caves, whose ceilings are covered in hundreds of little Buddha portraits to convey Buddha\u2019s infinite nature, date back to the year 366, when a monk named Le Zun went for a walk in the desert, had a vision of a thousand Buddhas bathed in a golden light, and was inspired to dig a shrine out of sandstone. For centuries, devotees would dig caves and decorate them with enormous Buddhas, until the Silk Road declined, and people stopped coming. The caves remained intact and untouched (save for the work of a few shrine robbers) only to be revived over the last century with the discovery of a huge trove of Buddhist documents from the 11th century.The centerpiece of the site is a five-story pagoda-like structure. As I walked in, a crowd of people were leaving and the light was so dim it was difficult to see. There was something big ahead. Was that a foot? I looked up to see a 98-foot-tall Buddha.There are bigger Buddhas in China and the world, but likely none feel as intimate as standing inside a building that\u2019s basically the same size as the Buddha, forcing you to crane your neck up to look at him and stay always in a supplicant position. The feat of human determination and faith that brought this massive statue into existence is overwhelming to contemplate. I think about that Buddha a lot and how close I had to stand to him to see him, and how tiny I felt in that moment. A planning committee had gathered outside my compartment on an overnight slow train. I had, it turned out, a certain love for the more social, populist \u201chard sleeper\u201d cars \u2014 with no doors and six bunks to a room \u2014 where the inability to sit up straight on any bed but the bottom meant lots of congregating in corridors. I also had a pile of logistical dilemmas, which piqued the interest of some English-speakers who\u2019d overheard me discussing them with the conductor.For my last day in the country, with a flight to Japan at 9 p.m., I had concocted a harebrained plan to spend the morning at Zhangye Danxia Landform National Geopark, or the Rainbow Mountains, then hop on a three-hour bullet train to the Lanzhou West station, and take another 40-minute train from there to the Lanzhou airport. But the trip was going to require precision engineering.First, Lien Shaoyong, a fellow eastward-bound traveler I had met at the grottoes, struck a deal for me with the conductor. I had a ticket for only part of the journey because the final leg to Zhangye had been sold out. The solution: pay cash for the difference and the staff would wake me in the middle of the night to move me to an empty slot since my bed was already spoken for.Next on the scene was Song Xu, my bunkmate and a businessman with excellent English. He began plotting my day backward from my last possible arrival time at the airport. A college student, Liu Haocheng, joined us, as did another businessman sitting nearby. The family of three whose bottom bunks we\u2019d commandeered listened in with bemusement as Mr. Liu translated the action into Chinese. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this by yourself?\u201d the mother said, nodding with approval. \u201cVery brave.\u201dMr. Tao picked me up while it was still dark and we drove to the park, past trucks making early morning deliveries, and droves of children riding their bicycles to school. Private cars can\u2019t go inside, so I boarded the first hop-on-hop-off bus of the day, which was carrying all the security guards and park workers, in their fur hats and winter coats, to their posts. The temperature gauge read minus-seven-degrees Celsius (19 degrees Fahrenheit).WeChat messages began flooding in from the planning committee, who wanted to know how it was all going, and from Mr. Yu and both Ms. Weis, as well as from my aunt, uncle and cousin from Queens who happened to be visiting Shanghai for Thanksgiving but whom I wouldn\u2019t be able to see. The other tourists had gone and I was alone on a freezing cold mountaintop across the world from a life I\u2019d left behind almost a year ago, overlooking what could have been Mars, and I felt at home.Mobile signals proved significantly more reliable (and less restrictive) than Wi-Fi in Gansu. Pick up a local SIM card or portable Wi-Fi hot spot, which runs off cell signals, at the airport.All translation apps are flawed, but I like Google Translate for its free archive of conversations. iTranslate Voice is easiest for other people to read and SayHi seems to be the most accurate.To take a high-speed train, look for the station with a direction in the name, like Zhangye West or Jiayuguan South. Save time and hotel charges by taking overnight trains. Book a \u201csoft sleeper\u201d if you need sensory deprivation to rest. \u201cHard sleeper\u201d cars are way more fun. Keep your valuables away from the doorway. Whole meals, including corn on the cob are sold onboard, but most people bring their own food.

Widely considered friendly with the tech industry, Mr. Khanna criticized Facebook on Friday for its aggressive tactics, and said the company should \u201ccertainly fire the people who were in any way involved in the decision to peddle opposition research.\u201dThe clash intensified on Friday when four Democratic senators wrote to the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to provide more details about Facebook\u2019s lobbying activities. The lawmakers also raised a potentially more explosive issue: whether Facebook had ever used its own data and platform against critics.\u201cWe need to know if Facebook, or any entity affiliated with or hired by Facebook, ever used any of the vast financial and data resources available to them to retaliate against their critics, including elected officials who were scrutinizing them,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of the Democrats who wrote the letter.\u201cAs more and more information comes out about how these guys operate, it\u2019s becoming conventional wisdom among Democrats that there is a serious policy problem here,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated.\u201cThese companies are not credible,\u201d Mr. Stoller added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s becoming clear to Democrats that they aren\u2019t friends \u2014 they are the problem.\u201dFacebook cut ties with the opposition research firm this past week even as executives there denied acting improperly.\u201dOur strategy was to shore up the security on Facebook and make major investments there,\u201d said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, in an interview with CBS on Friday. \u201cIt was not what I was doing, nor was it the company\u2019s strategy, to deflect, to deny or to hire P.R. firms to do things.\u201dBut Facebook and other tech companies now face increasing criticism from within their own ranks. In an interview, Marc Benioff, the billionaire co-founder of the software company Salesforce and a major donor to Democratic causes, said his industry faced \u201ca tension between trust and growth.\u201d\u201cThese companies are going to have to recognize that they have to change,\u201d Mr. Benioff added. \u201cAnd the C.E.O.s have to change. And if they don\u2019t change, those C.E.O.s will be removed by boards and by shareholders.\u201dNo Democrat embodies the tensions between tech and Washington like Mr. Schumer himself. In 2011, he joined Ms. Sandberg to announce the opening of the company\u2019s first East Coast engineering office, in New York City, where he had worked to promote start-ups and other tech businesses.In 2015, Ms. Sandberg co-hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Schumer in her Bay Area home, according to a Facebook employee briefed on the event. (The same trip featured a Schumer fund-raiser held by Bruce Sewell, then Apple\u2019s general counsel, and attended by Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, according to an executive who declined to be named.).By the end of the 2016 cycle, Mr. Schumer had raised more money from Facebook employees than any other Washington lawmaker. All told, Senate Democrats have benefited from over $3 million in political contributions from Facebook\u2019s employees and founders over the years.Relations began to cool after the 2016 elections, when evidence mounted that Facebook and YouTube had become fertile ground for foreign interference and domestic misinformation, threatening not only the party\u2019s values but also its electoral prospects.Early last year, Senator Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat, walked over to the Capitol to deliver a warning to Mr. Schumer, newly elected as Democratic minority leader.Mr. Tester\u2019s warning grabbed the attention of Mr. Schumer and other Democrats, who began to press Facebook and other social media companies to fix the problem.Disinformation was a particular focus for Mr. Schumer, according to an aide with knowledge of the senator\u2019s thinking. In March last year, Mr. Schumer summoned Adam Mosseri, then a vice president overseeing Facebook\u2019s News Feed feature, for a briefing on how the company would limit the spread of bogus news and propaganda. He later sent two aides to Silicon Valley to keep pressure on executives at Facebook, Google and Twitter.But as it became clear that the companies had understated their problems \u2014 and were moving slowly to fix them \u2014 the senator steered a middle course. When he and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, unveiled the party\u2019s \u201cBetter Deal\u201d platform for the midterm elections, a proposal to attack \u201ccorporate monopolies\u201d focused on airlines, beer companies and eyeglass makers.\u201cI am more sympathetic because I think they\u2019re in very difficult position and I worry about government regulation,\u201d he said.Mr. Warner\u2019s growing focus on privacy concerns led to a clash with Mr. Schumer, who confronted Mr. Warner in July, The Times reported this week, warning him to back off Facebook.Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said that the senator \u201cworried that Facebook would bow to pressure from Republicans, who oppose the purging of the fake accounts and bots, and has urged Senator Warner and the Senate Intelligence Committee to make this the priority in their ongoing investigation of the company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important for Facebook to recognize that this isn\u2019t a public relations problem \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental challenge for the platform and their business model,\u201d Mr. Warner said.Facebook previously signaled that it was ready to work with Mr. Warner and others in Congress on new regulation. Yet at the same time, Facebook turned to a conservative opposition research firm that sought to undermine detractors by publicizing financial links to Mr. Soros, a harsh critic of both Facebook and Google.\u201cTheir mantra has been, \u2018We\u2019re different, we\u2019re special, we\u2019re tech, all we do is good,\u2019\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee that oversees consumer protection and data security. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to find out, very graphically, that they do a lot of harm, and in fact they cover up the harm they do.\u201dHe added, \u201cTech is now like every other industry, in my view.\u201dJack Nicas and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finally, a Machine That Can Finish Your Sentence", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "Completing someone else\u2019s thought is not an easy trick for A.I. But new systems are starting to crack the code of natural language.Supported byOn stage, a woman takes a seat at the piano. SheFor you, that would be an easy question. But for a computer, it was pretty hard. While humans answered more than 88 percent of the test questions correctly, the lab\u2019s A.I. systems hovered around 60 percent. Among experts \u2014 those who know just how difficult it is to build systems that understand natural language \u2014 that was an impressive number.Bert\u2019s arrival punctuated a significant development in artificial intelligence. Over the last several months, researchers have shown that computer systems can learn the vagaries of language in general ways and then apply what they have learned to a variety of specific tasks.\u201cEach time we build new ways of doing something close to human level, it allows us to automate or augment human labor,\u201d said Jeremy Howard, the founder of Fast.ai, an independent lab based in San Francisco that is among those at the forefront of this research. \u201cThis can make life easier for a lawyer or a paralegal. But it can also help with medicine.\u201dBut there is a downside: On social media services like Twitter, this new research could also lead to more convincing bots designed to fool us into thinking they are human, Mr. Howard said.Each system learned a particular skill by analyzing all that text. OpenAI\u2019s technology learned to guess the next word in a sentence. Bert learned to guess missing words anywhere in a sentence. But in mastering these specific tasks, they also learned about how language is pieced together.If Bert can guess the missing words in millions of sentences (such as \u201cthe man walked into a store and bought a ____ of milk\u201d), it can also understand many of the fundamental relationships between words in the English language, said Jacob Devlin, the Google researcher who oversaw the creation of Bert. (Bert is short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.)The system can apply this knowledge to other tasks. If researchers provide Bert with a bunch of questions and their answers, it learns to answer other questions on its own. Then, if they feed it news headlines that describe the same event, it learns to recognize when two sentences are similar. Usually, machines can recognize only an exact match.Bert can handle the \u201ccommon sense\u201d test from the Allen Institute. It can also handle a reading comprehension test where it answers questions about encyclopedia articles. What is oxygen? What is precipitation? In another test, it can judge the sentiment of a movie review. Is the review positive or negative?This kind of technology is \u201ca step toward a lot of still-faraway goals in A.I., like technologies that can summarize and synthesize big, messy collections of information to help people make important decisions,\u201d said Sam Bowman, a professor at New York University who specializes in natural language research.Sebastian Ruder, a researcher based in Ireland who collaborates with Fast.ai, sees the arrival of systems like Bert as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for him and other A.I. researchers because they had assumed language technology had hit a ceiling. \u201cThere is so much untapped potential,\u201d he said.The ideas that drive Bert have been around for years, but they started to work because modern hardware could juggle much larger amounts of data, Mr. Devlin said.\u201cBert is a first thrust in that direction,\u201d said Jeff Dean, who oversees Google\u2019s artificial intelligence work. \u201cBut actually not all that big in terms of where we want to go.\u201d Mr. Dean believes that ever larger amounts of processing power will lead to machines that can better juggle natural language.But there is reason for skepticism that this technology can keep improving quickly because researchers tend to focus on the tasks they can make progress on and avoid the ones they can\u2019t, said Gary Marcus, a New York University psychology professor who has long questioned the effectiveness of neural networks. \u201cThese systems are still a really long way from truly understanding running prose,\u201d he said.Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, another prominent voice who has pushed for research that extends beyond neural networks, made the same point.Though Bert passed the lab\u2019s common-sense test, he said, machines are still a long way from an artificial version of a human\u2019s common sense. But like other researchers in this field, he believes the trajectory of natural language research has changed. This is a moment of \u201cexplosive progress,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Marica Coniglio, 33, a tourist from Sicily, stopped in after visiting the Museum of Modern Art (\u201cIt was very peaceful and unusual,\u201d she said). David Niles, 57, a New Yorker, was picking up a Citi Bike nearby when he ducked in. (\u201cIt was an unexpected surprise,\u201d he said.)The Bach Store is both an effort to make live Bach more accessible and available and something of an inward journey for Mr. Shinners, who is 32. It is also a marathon.\u201cMy arms are falling apart,\u201d he confessed on the 20th day as he took a break from playing preludes and fugues from \u201cThe Well-Tempered Clavier\u201d to a small crowd ranging in age from toddlers to older adults who had paid the suggested $10 admission charge. He practices in the shop daily from noon to 5:30 p.m., and evening concerts are at 6:15.There is merchandise, too: The shop sells T-shirts emblazoned with the name of Mr. Shinners\u2019 alter ego, W.T.F. Bach; Bach cigarette lighters; stress balls shaped like brains that say \u201cYours \u2260 Bach\u2019s,\u201d and condoms that note on their wrappers that Bach had fathered 20 children.Mr. Shinners said the marathon was partly inspired by an experience he had seeking the tutelage of the French harpsichordist and great Bach interpreter Pierre Hanta\u00ef, who rebuffed him with a deep, two-page letter that he wound up taking very much to heart.\u201cI took it upon myself to face this quote for five hours a day and to try to elevate myself spiritually,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to put myself in a public setting where I could expose myself in a way that I was probably previously afraid to expose myself.\u201dAn excerpt from Mr. Hanta\u00ef\u2019s high-minded letter, translated into English, is painted on the wall behind the piano that Mr. Shinners plays each day. \u201cBach is above all thought,\u201d it begins.As the end approached, Mr. Shinners, who had initially envisioned playing only during the month of November, decided to extend the run into the first week of December. And he is already thinking about a reprise. \u201cSo many people come in here and leave so exalted, and that\u2019s moving,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think I will have to do it again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 52 Places TravelerRising out of the mist and pine trees on South Korea\u2019s mountainous eastern coast was a serpent. Or at least it looked that way, as I awoke, groggy, and peered out my hotel window at a colossal undulation of orange, purple and teal stripes snaking through the forest canopy. Two blinks later, the shapes and colors morphed into what they actually were: the twisty, tubular slides of a waterpark.The Games brought a new high-speed KTX train and gleaming white hotel towers with infinity pools overlooking the ocean (see: Golden Tulip Skybay and the Richard Meier-designed Seamarq). Those mountains, though, loom largest, keeping the new Gangwon in harmony with the old.But on my last stop, in the city of Sokcho, just south of the Demilitarized Zone, I was on my own \u2014 and possessed with the Korean language skills of a mime.\u201cGo straight, walk five minutes,\u201d the hotel clerk told me when I asked how to find the jjimjilbang entrance. I did as told and got lost on a dirt path next to a stream lined with trees whose vivid yellow and red leaves were still clinging to their branches, just barely. There were tasteful bronze sculptures of naked women here and there, and a path around a placid lake built for contemplative strolls. I passed young families pushing strollers and old men meditating on stone steps built into a hillside. And then there was the child on a bicycle playing a video game at full volume, just as nature intended.When I finally got inside, those twisty slides were closed for the season but there was still a wave pool and rivers of warm water and tiers of hot springs. Inside, men and women filed into separate facilities, which involved stripping naked, soaking in a really hot bath, jumping into a cold one, and repeating. It's a sensation everyone should try at least once.Later, I walked onto a pavilion over the lake and had to laugh. I was standing under a mock temple roof, looking across a body of water to the mountains, with a grove of red Korean pine trees to the right and that glorious gaudy waterpark on the left. It was a scene so perfectly Gangwon it could have been a scroll painting.I hadn\u2019t taken a two-hour night bus to Sokcho from Gangneung to see a hotel waterpark, though. My personal must-do of the trip was to hike in Seoraksan National Park, home to the region\u2019s highest mountain, and legendary fall foliage. I\u2019d missed peak leaf peeping by a week or two, but there were still a few trees that looked like they\u2019d been dipped in red and yellow Kool-Aid.At the top of the park\u2019s cable car was a 20-minute climb to a rock face known as Gwongeumseong Fortress, the highest peak in the park and bare, with the exception of an occasional pine, bent over from the wind. I saw a woman hiking in heels, and a couple in matching red, black, and white, Mickey-Mouse-themed outfits. The only safety barriers between selfie-takers and precipitous cliffs were little four-inch signs featuring a tumbling purple cartoon bear and the words \u201cdrop\u201d or \u201cfall.\u201dBack at the cable car, I spotted a sign reading, \u201cAallack Temple,\u201d with an arrow pointing down a steep set of stairs no one else seemed to be taking. Metal gave way to slabs of stone laid flat between tree roots. Instead of a railing there were thick ropes attached to poles, and with so much slack and weight from recent rain I had to bend down to grab them. The sensation was less like walking on stairs than rappelling, sliding the rope through my hands and hoping that it would catch me if I fell the rest of the way, which seemed possible.After many more stairs than I\u2019d anticipated, I reached the temple, a single structure overlooking a valley. The steps continued to a dead end. Just as I was taking my final photos and heading back, a bald man in gray robes with a big smile poked his head out of the door.\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d the monk asked, in hesitant English.\u201cU.S.A.\u201d I told him. He nodded vigorously and invited me inside. There, in front of a gold Buddha, under a ceiling alight with lanterns shaped like lotus flowers, I told him my name and he told me his, Jee-Woon, and we\u2019d pretty much exhausted our language skills.He offered me tea he\u2019d been warming on a wooden stove, and this time I pulled out my phone to try Google Translate, which seemed to be a new thing for him. He spoke into the microphone and told me that he\u2019d made the tea, which was delicious and earthy, out of five medicinal ingredients that were supposed to be good for health, like jujube and licorice.Was he alone, or \u201chonja\u201d in Korean? I asked.He was.I was honja, too. We smiled and sipped our tea.I told him I was grateful he\u2019d shown me his beautiful temple.As I walked out the door, he crouched down to make sure I got my shoes on. \u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d he said, again and again; I think it was the last English phrase he knew.\u201cSee you tomorrow!\u201d I said back. And really wished I could.Jean\u2019s last, most stringent directive had been to eat. Eat well, eat often, and when out in the country, get to restaurants well before 8 o\u2019clock at night if you want to eat at all. Both she and Hahna told me that Koreans in Seoul consider the food so much better in Gangwon they make special trips for it \u2014 while foreigners make trips around the world to eat in Seoul. Hahna taught me to tell the chef, \u201cJal meogeosseumnida,\u201d or \u201cI ate well.\u201dPrevious dispatches:Next dispatch: Gansu, ChinaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Make Your Friends and Family Less Irksome This Holiday Season", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixGetting a big group together this time of year can be a hassle. So spare everyone the endless phone notifications and email threads and try these methods instead.With the holiday season upon us, our phones will soon explode with messages and calls from friends and family hoping to catch up and make plans.As heartwarming as that sounds, the simple task of coordinating a group feels acutely painful this time of year, especially when people with widely varying levels of digital literacy all rely on the same tech to congregate.Everyone is familiar with the endless email threads scattered with replies from people saying when they are available, where they would like to meet and what they would like to do \u2014 with no one seeming to agree on anything. Same goes for the big group text message and that one relative who floods our phones with multiple consecutive texts to convey a single thought. (You know who you are.)And here we thought technology was supposed to make our lives more efficient. Fret not. I share your pain and so tested various tools to help people get together and stay connected this holiday. Here were the best ones.Let\u2019s start with the most frustrating situation: getting a big group of people to agree on when and where to meet. There are plenty of approaches, like sharing calendars or sending lots of emails, but the simplest solution I\u2019ve found is creating a poll.After you make your selections, you punch in your name and get a web link that people can click on to view the options, cast their votes and type in their name. From there, you can choose the time slot that got the most votes, close the poll and then communicate the plan to the group. I\u2019ve used this tool for groups big and small, and it spares me dozens of notifications and messages before meeting up.When it comes to staying in touch or catching up over the holidays, using a group text message is fine if everyone is using an iPhone. That\u2019s because Apple\u2019s default texting service, iMessage, gives you the option to leave the conversation when it becomes too distracting. But if there are Android users among the group, the chat bubbles turn from blue to green, meaning that the messages are being sent as traditional text messages. Unfortunately, with traditional texting you can\u2019t exit a group chat, and the only option is to turn off alerts for the entire conversation.Then there\u2019s the annual exchange of photos during the holidays. You could just send a dozen photos of your trip to Europe or your newborn in a group text message, but that would burn through everyone\u2019s cellular data plans and make you unpopular.These methods aren't completely hassle-free, of course. Some of them require goading less tech-savvy friends and relatives into trying new tools. But once they are persuaded, your holiday gatherings will be less vexing to create, organize and reminisce about for years to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Raises Prices, and Profits Keep Booming", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since Apple introduced the iPhone 11 years ago, smartphones have become ubiquitous, and the market for them is saturated. To maintain growth, Apple has employed a shrewd strategy: Charge more for the devices.Journalists and analysts have explained how Apple is doing that by dividing the number of iPhones sold in a given quarter into the revenue Apple earns from them to calculate the average selling price.That\u2019s not going to be so easy anymore.Apple said Thursday that it sold about as many iPhones in the latest quarter as it did a year earlier but that iPhone revenue rose 29 percent. That was because customers paid nearly 29 percent more for the devices. (The average selling price is now $793.)The price increase helped propel Apple\u2019s profits 32 percent higher, to $14.13 billion.But after those figures were reported, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call that the company would no longer disclose how many iPhones, iPads or Mac computers it sold. As a result, journalists and analysts will no longer be able to track how Apple\u2019s swelling prices are improving its profits.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, explained the rationale with an analogy: \u201cIf you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier \u2014 and she says or he says, \u2018How many units do you have in there?\u2019 \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what\u2019s in the cart.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein, said Apple was trying to shift investors\u2019 attention away from the number of devices it sold. \u201cCompanies always try to put their best foot forward,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir best foot doesn\u2019t appear to be iPhone unit growth.\u201dAnother wildly profitable quarter for Apple showed its business has mostly avoided the turbulence that has roiled its Silicon Valley peers. Facebook, Google and Twitter have faced questions about their influence in the spread of disinformation and the proliferation of hate speech.Apple has tried to separate itself from other tech giants by trumpeting that it values its customers\u2019 privacy and hires people to curate its services rather than relying on computer algorithms. The company responded to criticism about the addictive nature of its smartphones by adding tools for people to track their time spent on them.Last month, Apple released its most expensive iPhone ever, the XS Max, which starts at $1,100. On Tuesday, it raised the starting price of its iPad Pro to $800 from $650 and of its MacBook Air to $1,200 from $1,000, while also making the devices faster and more powerful.Apple\u2019s strategy has worked for more than iPhones. Apple said that it sold 5.3 million Mac computers in the quarter, down 2 percent from a year ago, but that its revenues from Mac sales rose 3 percent to a record $7.4 billion. That was because customers paid nearly $1,400 on average for a Mac, up 5 percent from a year earlier.Apple\u2019s overall revenue increased nearly 20 percent in the quarter to $62.9 billion.Apple\u2019s other bet to maintain growth is its services business, which includes its cut of app sales and revenue from its own apps, like Apple Music, among other things. Services revenue rose 17 percent to nearly $10 billion in the quarter.Some analysts were concerned about Apple\u2019s prospects in China, where sales fell sharply several years ago. But revenues in the quarter there rose 16 percent from a year earlier.Apple\u2019s share price was down more than 6 percent in after-hours trading Thursday, likely because of its plans to stop reporting unit sales and because its revenue guidance for the current quarter was \u201clighter than expectations,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Advertisement"}

Shares of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, are down more than 10 percent since the market peaked, while Facebook and Amazon have dropped more than 20 percent.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing extreme selling in the only favored area that everybody ran to,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a slowdown underway globally,\u201d said James Bianco, president of financial market research firm Bianco Research in Chicago. \u201cThe U.S. has definitely been stronger than the rest of the world. But the fear is, that can\u2019t hold. If the rest of the world slows down, that will eventually slow us, too.\u201dThe potential for higher borrowing costs is also weighing on smaller companies that often borrow money by issuing floating rate debt, which can become more difficult to pay off as interest rates rise. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks is down 14 percent from its high. \u201cThis is simply a continuation of the recent repricing of risk, or growth scare, that we\u2019ve basically been seeing since the end of September,\u201d said Talley Leger, an equity strategist with Oppenheimer Funds. When the stock market hit its peak in September, technology had led the way, accounting for 50 percent of the gains for the year. The tech giants, at first, seemed immune to the sell-off that followed on broader economic worries. Not anymore. Through Friday, roughly a quarter of the market\u2019s decline since September was because of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet, according to data collected by S&P Capital IQ. The sharp sell-off on Monday will only add to that tally. Investors appear especially focused on any signs that extraordinary profits generated by these giant tech companies are under threat. Whether technology stocks can slough off the worries will depend, in part, on whether the companies can continue to deliver strong earnings growth even if the global economy does soften significantly. Recent earnings reports from major tech companies have done little to reassure investors. Since Apple\u2019s share price peaked at just over $232 on Oct. 3, the stock has plummeted by nearly 20 percent, lopping more than $200 billion off the company\u2019s market value. Its shares were down nearly 4 percent Monday.Amazon reported a slowdown in its core retail revenue growth in late October, sending the shares lower. To investors, who often view revenue numbers as a good gauge of the strength of demand in the economy, that was more important than the $2.9 billion in profit the company reported.But if they actually produce the numbers that Wall Street analysts expect, the recent slump in large technology stocks could present a buying opportunity for some investors. Key valuation measures of Apple and Alphabet hit multiyear highs this summer. But the recent drop has left those valuations substantially lower. Prices of Facebook and Amazon are relatively low compared with expected profits, meaning these stocks look \u201ccheap\u201d for certain investors. But they might have to get even cheaper before investors are tempted to snap them up. That\u2019s why some expect the sentiment in the market to get much worse before stocks can resume their climb. \u201cI\u2019m sort of looking for a little more bearishness,\u201d said King Lip, chief strategist at the wealth management company Baker Avenue. An earlier version of this article misstated which company Alphabet is the parent company of. It is Google, not Apple.Advertisement"}

Gwyneth Paltrow rushes to catch a train in London after being fired from her job. In one universe, she makes the train and gets home early and finds her man in bed with another woman. In the other, she misses it, comes home to her boyfriend alone, and stays with him to her own detriment and despair.The big \u201cWhat if?\u201d What if I didn\u2019t go to a magazine party in the fall of 1986, with my agent? What if I had not just partaken of the free wine and cheese and instead hobnobbed and made connections like I was supposed to? What if I hadn\u2019t tried to leave early so I could go dancing with my high school friends?If none of those things had happened, my agent wouldn\u2019t have said to me, \u201cYou can\u2019t leave without talking to at least one person you don\u2019t know,\u201d and I wouldn\u2019t have said, \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll talk to the bartender. He\u2019s cute.\u201dAnd I wouldn\u2019t have ended up five years later marrying said bartender.That was 31 years ago. My husband is still cute, but he is forever cutting it too close when we need to be somewhere, which sometimes makes him less cute in my eyes. I was thinking about all of this as I was waiting for him at the clock at Grand Central Terminal a few months ago. We were heading to a fund-raiser at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.I used to meet people at that clock while I was growing up. The Grand Central of my youth was nothing like the Grand Central of now, which is bright and gleaming, full of good restaurants and bars and shops. My Grand Central was filthy, dangerous, home to pickpockets and thieves and drug addicts.My junior high school was two blocks away, on the 40th floor of an office building. When classes were over, my best friend, Melissa, and I would run around Grand Central buying greeting cards, getting free samples of coconut patties at a little chocolate shop, skirting perverts.I loved Melissa then, and I love her now. She\u2019s like a sister to me. What would have happened if one of us had messed up the bubbles on the entrance exam to Hunter College High School? Where would I be now without her?I looked at my iPhone and texted my husband: \u201cWhere are you?\u201dNo answer.Bored, I walked around the clock, which is also an octagonal information center. Was my husband oblivious enough to be standing on the other side? I used to stand on that side in high school, waiting for my boyfriend to come down from Inwood. We were both so skinny back then that when we hugged, our hipbones would grind.We went out for a long time before he finally dumped me during my sophomore year of college. Waiting for my husband, I started to get that buzzy feeling I sometimes get when I\u2019m traveling, as if maybe I was going to bump into somebody I used to know.Could it be that old boyfriend? I doubted it. He lives in Florida, and someone recently told me he has six grandchildren.We went to high school in the Bronx. When I was young, we used to go to the New York Botanical Garden on field trips, which back then seemed like a jaunt to the country. One of my close friends was raped there one afternoon after class let out.Would that have happened if any of her classmates had stuck around, too? Or made her come to the doughnut shop? I thought a lot about this back then, the missed opportunity to save her. And I think about it now, how terrible it was and how angry I still am that someone did that to her.Back in high school, I thought about a lot of things, but not about one day taking the train to a fancy fund-raiser. I wrote poetry (that I never showed anyone) but never dreamed I would grow up to be a writer. When I was 17, I thought it was possible I would marry my high school boyfriend.I looked at my phone. My husband had texted: \u201cI\u2019m running late. Had to take a call. If I don\u2019t make the 5:40 u can go without me.\u201d\u201cO.K.,\u201d I replied. But I was angry.When our children were small and I had vague ideas about the importance of family dinner, he would call and say, \u201cI\u2019m leaving work now.\u201d And then he wouldn\u2019t arrive for hours.As I started walking toward the track, I thought maybe if I hadn\u2019t gone up to him that night at the party so many years ago, I would be married to a man who not only was on time for this train but also had already bought the tickets. I started to stew. I thought about his younger sister\u2019s wedding 25 years earlier, when he came back from his run sweaty just as we, all dressed up, were leaving for the church.As I boarded the train, I checked my phone again. A text from him: \u201cI\u2019m on the shuttle from Times Square. If I make it, I\u2019ll go straight to train and try to find u.\u201d\u201cKK,\u201d I wrote. \u201cJust get on we\u2019ll find each other when we get off.\u201dBut I thought: \u201cHe\u2019s going to miss it.\u201dI sat back in my seat, wondering who would be at the party. Would the mystery person I felt destined to run into be someone I didn\u2019t expect to see that night?And then I wondered what would have happened if I had taken that West Coast fellowship I had applied for before I met my future husband but was promised to me after I fell in love with him.By that time, I was too happy where I was, in New York City, with him, temping and being a fledgling writer. Still, maybe if I had taken that fellowship I would be living in San Francisco now, having a picnic lunch down at the beach, watching whales spout and drinking local white wine straight from the half bottle.The doors on the train closed. I gazed at some guy sitting several rows away, facing me: graying, kind of cute, the right age. What would have happened if I had married this guy? Would I have a house and a dog and live in Larchmont?I took out my phone. The train was moving. I was going to text my husband and let him off the hook, tell him to turn around and go home. He was just sweetly keeping me company anyway.But he had already written: \u201cMade it! What car you on?\u201dI meant: How like him to make it by the skin of his teeth. As he had at his sister\u2019s wedding. Then I remembered walking down the aisle holding the hand of my little niece, because her mother was maid of honor, my little niece who is now all grown up and engaged to be married herself. I remembered turning, before I sat down with her in the front pew, to look toward the church doors to see if my husband had finally arrived.He is the oldest of four. Their father was dead, and my husband was supposed to escort his sister down the aisle. I felt such relief when I saw the two of them emerge from the doorway, my sister-in-law gorgeous in her gown and my husband a little geeky in his tuxedo, his hair still wet from his shower.Then I looked up to see what car I was in, as my husband had asked me to, so I could write and tell him, and there was my very own husband sitting directly across the aisle from me. He was staring at his phone, waiting for my response. He didn\u2019t even know I was there.And he looked so handsome! Uncharacteristically wearing a jacket and tie, because we were going to a fancy party, anticipation on his face.I took a moment to savor it, his silver, close-cropped hair, the eagerness of his expression as he waited for my text \u2014 the triumph of once again making it just in time!And I realized: This is the person I was destined to run into today, and also 31 years ago, and again and again, in this multiverse and hopefully all the others.\u201cI\u2019m right next to you,\u201d I typed.Startled, then smiling, he looked up.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Five Takeaways From Our New China Project", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did China do it?How did the land once commonly \u2014 and with some disdain \u2014 known in the West as Communist China come to lead the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires?How did a once-cloistered nation with a flailing economy drive extreme poverty down to less than 1 percent? How did it achieve social economic mobility unrivaled by much of the world?And perhaps most of all, how did a country that rejected all of the conventional wisdom Western economists had to offer arrive at a moment when it is on track to surpass the American economy and become the world\u2019s largest?When The Times launched China Rules, the series that began last Sunday, these were the questions we asked our reporters to try to answer. The last four articles in the series will appear this Sunday, when a special print section will also be published.Here are some takeaways about what they found. In the uncertain years after the death of Mao Zedong \u2014 the founding father of the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 Chinese leaders struggled to find a way forward. It was the 1980s, and the country was still recovering from decades of political and economic turmoil.After decades of centralized planning and state control of the economy brought much of the country to its knees, Chinese officials knew they had to try something else \u2014 but what? The answer was far from clear. \u201cThe Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation,\u201d writes Philip P. Pan in the opening article of our China Rules reports.The world may have thought that it could change China, and in many ways it has, but China has also changed the world.Now, the question for China has turned from how to compete to how to pull ahead in an era of American hostility that has realigned the global dynamic. As President Xi Jinping pushes a more aggressive agenda overseas and tightens controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war that has brought the countries to the cusp of a new Cold War. When Henry A. Kissinger, President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s national security adviser, made a secret trip to Beijing in 1971, he opened a new era of engagement between the United States and China. It was grounded in the mind-set that increasing trade and investment would benefit both countries by making America safer and China more prosperous. But the decades of engagement that followed have given way to a trade war encouraged by China hawks like Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Trump. Mr. Bannon\u2019s view that China is the greatest long-term threat to the United States has influenced Mr. Trump\u2019s policymaking.And now, China has begun clamping down even more. President Xi has reversed course on some of the decades of reforms that the former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made to drag the economy forward. New internal and external pressures will test this model like never before. Its relationship with the United States may be contentious, but China has been busy making its mark in a bid for global influence, even as America turns increasingly inward.From Cambodia to South Africa, it has been funding major infrastructure projects like dams, bridges, ports and power plants. Some describe the effort as a modern-day Marshall Plan, the American reconstruction campaign after World War II that laid the foundation for many enduring military and diplomatic alliances.China\u2019s take on that, the so-called Belt and Road Initiative, is bolder, more expensive and far riskier. As it works to win new allies and develop new markets, Chinese-funded projects are reshaping financial and geopolitical ties. But the costs for both aid recipients and China can be high. And Beijing is sometimes accused of using its infrastructure investments to ensnare partners in debt traps \u2014 and then seize their assets.We examined nearly 600 projects that China helped finance in the last decade. They show the scope of China\u2019s strategy on a global scale. As China focuses attention on its immediate neighbors, it has overtaken the United States as the leading trade partner in Asia. It is also projecting power through military might in the South China Sea, where Mr. Xi has ordered the development of several contested islands.The American Dream has long promised a pathway to a better life for those willing to work hard. But unprecedented economic expansion in China has created an environment where upward mobility may now be more attainable in Beijing than Baltimore.While China is still much poorer than America over all, it is outpacing its Western rival in some crucial areas.Its population is among the most optimistic in the world, according to public opinion surveys. Eight hundred million people have risen out of poverty since the 1990s. Incomes are rising across generations, with children out-earning their parents. Life expectancy has soared. It\u2019s more complicated than that, of course. Education and a growing private sector have offered a path to social mobility, but they can also function as a means of social control. The government offers an unspoken pact to its people: A good life is possible for anyone who works hard, even the children of peasants \u2014 as long as they stay out of politics.China charted a new manufacturing model in a bid to build cutting-edge industries that could rival Western giants.Defying the conventional wisdom of economic development, it is trying to do it all. The Communist Party is throwing the full financial weight of the state behind these efforts.Beyond manufacturing, China has begun getting more involved in all types of industries.Mr. Xi has emphasized the need to \u201ctell China\u2019s story well.\u201d Chinese companies have long mimicked their American corporate counterparts, but Chinese tech firms have evolved quickly from copying Silicon Valley\u2019s successes to making huge strides of their own, from mobile payments to social media innovations. Now the inspiration flows both ways, with American companies taking notes from Chinese counterparts.Advertisement"}

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.It\u2019s a lot to process, even for those of us whose job is reporting it all. But, as we said when we started this newsletter, we\u2019re here to help! So today, we\u2019re going to answer a few of your questions from this week.Jeff Gordon writes: I would love to know how Beto O\u2019Rourke spent $68 million on his campaign.That\u2019s something I\u2019d like to know, too! As many of you know, Mr. O\u2019Rourke, a Texas Democrat, raised nearly $70 million for his Senate campaign. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a complete picture of his spending quite yet. The last disclosures candidates were required to file to the Federal Election Commission covered spending only through mid-October.What Democrats want to know now is how much Mr. O\u2019Rourke has left over. As of mid-October, his campaign had about $10 million in the bank. That money, or whatever is left of it, could be donated to other candidates \u2014 or repurposed for Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s own political ambitions. Kathie Whelchel asks: Do you have any thoughts on President Trump offering Kris Kobach a position in his administration as a consolation prize?You aren\u2019t the only one wondering whether Mr. Kobach, a Republican who lost his bid to be the governor of Kansas, could join team Trump. Given the value the president places on loyalty, it wouldn\u2019t be all that surprising if Mr. Kobach ended up in the administration.Over the past 48 hours, his name has emerged as a top pick to replace Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Mr. Kobach was an early supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and served as vice chairman of the president\u2019s voter fraud commission. He was also a source behind Mr. Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that millions of people illegally voted in the 2016 presidential race.Majda Jones wants to know: What can the lame duck House do between now and when the Democrats take over? Lame duck sessions are notoriously unpredictable. But we know there\u2019s one big issue that has to be tackled: Funding for some of the government, including the Department of Homeland Security, expires on Dec. 8. The president has threatened a shutdown if Congress doesn\u2019t fund his border wall. The final appropriations bill has to get 60 votes in the Senate, which means it can\u2019t pass without some Democratic support. But, Democrats are in no mood to fund the wall after winning the House \u2014 a victory they view as a referendum on Mr. Trump. So it\u2019s unclear how \u2014 or even whether \u2014 the government gets funded.And there are a few other legislative loose ends, like negotiating a new five-year farm bill and extending some annual tax breaks.Both parties also need to select new House leadership, a fight that\u2019s particularly interesting for Democrats, given the number of new members who pledged during their campaigns to oppose Nancy Pelosi as speaker. On the Republican side, Kevin McCarthy, the outgoing majority leader, and Jim Jordan have already announced bids for minority leader.____________________About 72 hours after the first polls closed, we are still waiting for some results. Here are a few marquee races that remain undecided:Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican nominee for Senate, has filed two lawsuits over voting results.

She will be replaced by Thomas Kurian, who oversaw product development at Oracle until his resignation in October. Ms. Greene will remain a board director at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet.Ms. Greene, a widely respected technologist and entrepreneur, said that after leaving Google Cloud, she planned to help female founders of companies by investing in and mentoring them.Ms. Greene joined Google in 2015 when it acquired Bebop, a start-up she had founded, for $380 million.She is best known as a co-founder and former chief executive of VMware, whose software for juggling many programs across many computers is widely used in corporate data centers. That kind of \u201cvirtual machine\u201d software is one of the technologies that make computing clouds efficient and relatively inexpensive.Google said this year that its cloud business was generating more than $1 billion in revenue per quarter \u2014 which is dwarfed by the tens of billions of dollars that Google generates quarterly from selling online advertising.\u201cWhen this journey started, some people would say that Google had great technology but they weren\u2019t sure that customers would rely on Google as their enterprise partner,\u201d Ms. Greene wrote in the blog post. Now, no one is \u201cquestioning our seriousness or our abilities.\u201dHer leadership of Google Cloud came under scrutiny this year when employees protested the company\u2019s pursuit of a Defense Department contract for the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes.Announcing that decision, Ms. Greene said that Google would not have sought the Maven contract if company officials had anticipated the criticism from employees and that the decision was made when Google was more aggressively going after military work.She found herself in the spotlight again last month when she was one of the last technology and business executives to pull out of speaking at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia after the slaying of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was tied to Saudi leadership.In March, Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-run oil giant, announced a partnership for \u201cnational cloud services and other technology opportunities\u201d as part of a push to modernize the kingdom.Advertisement"}

Jack Nicas, who covers Apple, relies on some old-school methods.How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jack Nicas, a technology reporter for The Times in San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You write about Apple and other Silicon Valley companies. What are your most important tools for reporting?Reporting is not typically sexy. We spend a lot of time sending emails, leaving voice mail messages, chasing dead ends and trying to persuade people to tell us stuff they shouldn\u2019t. We don\u2019t have any shiny gadgets you see in spy movies. Some of my most reliable reporting tools are a pen and paper.Arguably my most interesting gadget for a time was a flip phone I bought from Target. Burner phones are great for talking to paranoid sources, contacting unsavory characters or trying to reach people who are screening my calls. But now, of course, there\u2019s an app for that. It\u2019s called Burner and it lets you make calls and send texts with different phone numbers. I can even pick the area code so my subject thinks I\u2019m calling from nearby, just like the spammers! (We have a lot in common, some people say.) For sensitive communications, I still use Signal, the encrypted messaging and calling app.I record some interviews with TapeACall Pro, an app that requires dialing in a third number that records the call\u2019s audio. But because that can store the audio in the cloud, for sensitive calls I revert to a tangled setup that involves a decade-old Olympus WS-400S voice recorder, headphones and an auxiliary cord. That keeps the audio on a recorder that never connects to the internet. For particularly sensitive conversations, I ditch all of that and try to meet in person.If I had to choose one favorite old-school reporting technology though, I\u2019d pick the doorbell.When has going door to door helped with your reporting? And when did it not work out so well?When I covered crime in Boston and Florida, I typically knocked on doors to find families and friends of victims. That often led to harrowing but fruitful interviews. Now I\u2019m usually trying to find people who don\u2019t want to be found \u2014 and that sometimes means I\u2019m not well received.That was the case on one of my first door-knocking experiences. My professor at Boston University, Dick Lehr, a longtime investigative reporter, took me under his wing to examine a 30-year-old questionable arson murder conviction. We showed up to the apartment of the man we suspected had actually started the fire in question. He was home, and appeared to be on drugs. We were invited in and, as we questioned where he was the night of the crime, we eyed a large knife on his table. When he became belligerent because I began writing, we left.In a past life you covered Google. Now you cover Apple. So, iPhone or Android?I\u2019ve had both and have a controversial opinion: They\u2019re basically the same. (Apple will not like this answer.) The top phones for either operating system are excellent, easy-to-use devices with virtually the same features and apps. The biggest difference is the business model.How so?Apple makes money by selling consumers expensive iPhones. Google makes money by giving away its Android software and services \u2014 and then charging advertisers for access to the billions of users it attracts.Google\u2019s approach has given it enormous data about the world and its inhabitants. Google is well positioned to use its mass collection of personal data for new products, like artificial intelligence, but it also draws new scrutiny to the company.Apple\u2019s less data-focused approach has allowed it to take the high road on privacy. That strategy has potentially insulated the company from regulations and public scorn, but it also could leave Apple with dumber products than its rivals.Internet trolls have targeted you for your coverage. What happened and how did you fend them off?I wrote a series of articles when I previously worked for The Wall Street Journal about problems with YouTube\u2019s algorithms that led the company to make changes that affected some YouTube video creators. One YouTube star accused me of doctoring evidence, and thousands then descended on my Twitter account and flooded my email inbox with hate mail and death threats.While Journal security and I monitored the attacks for any credible threats, I found a very effective approach to frustrating the trolls: ignore them. Their oxygen is attention, so when they realized I wasn\u2019t going to respond or get upset, they moved along.Outside of work, what tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with? \u201cThanks,\u201d it replies. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One word in that statement \u2014 arrival \u2014 is, however, doing a disproportionate amount of work.With this radical shift in driving comes questions about the viability of traditional business models based on the private ownership of cars and the dominance of the large carmakers.Still, Reilly Brennan, a general partner at Trucks Venture Capital and a lecturer in transportation at Stanford University, is cautious about how quickly a commercial market will develop for new companies.\u201cFully unstructured driving by go-anywhere cars is a long time away,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cFew start-ups actually understood the commitment required to create a complete vehicle.\u201dInstead, Mr. Brennan suggests, autonomy will first come to specialized applications like agriculture, mining and fleets dedicated to city delivery routes.The vast amount of data that must be digested by an autonomous car gives rise to another class of participants: the suppliers of the underlying technology like analysis tools and sensor systems. Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia, a partner with several prominent autonomous-vehicle developers, emphasizes the crucial role of such companies in making possible the cars that will be built without pedals or steering wheels.\u201cOur approach was to build an artificial intelligence brain, a supercomputer the size of a laptop to interpret the data from a car\u2019s sensors and build a 3-D picture of its surroundings,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said.While creeping along in a highway traffic jam may not be so demanding, detecting a distracted pedestrian on a city street and plotting a safe reaction is far more rigorous.\u201cWhen it comes to dealing with those situations, there\u2019s no such thing as having too much computing power in the car,\u201d he said.Following are some of the start-ups that are expected to play a role in developing the diverse ecosystem of autonomous vehicles.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.This week\u2019s show is produced by Alex Laughlin for Transmitter Media, with help from Caitlin Pierce.

There was someone in the world, your soul mate, as the movies told me, who would become the person you spent the rest of your life with. Your task was simply to wait until you met him or her.As I grew older, my na\u00efvet\u00e9 wore off. I learned that this kind of romance clashed with reality \u2014 and with the way my generation dates.Despite all of this, my faith in fate and in the power of the rom-com endured.I once planned an elaborate picnic to pour out my heart to a girl who loved mangoes, and she canceled last-minute, leaving me with that sad empty feeling and a ton of homemade mango salsa. A couple of years later, a girl I liked asked me to pick her up from work because her car had broken down. I viewed it as my knight-in-shining-armor moment until the ride home, when she informed me that she had to get back because she was going on a date later that evening.Dating sometimes felt like a series of disappointments, but I still held firm to the belief that my soul mate was out there, somewhere.I met her a year-and-a-half ago, when she worked at the same school as my mom. We had gone to the same high school and knew of each other, but were never close.I knew from the early stages of the relationship that it was something big. She encouraged my romantic gestures \u2014 flowers and dinners and love letters \u2014 and listened to my fears and insecurities. She danced with me on the balcony of my apartment, biked next to me for hundreds of miles as I ran, and left the only place she\u2019d ever lived to move with me to another state. For the first time in my life, I knew what it meant to be in love.The rational, boring part of me knew that we were in a good place financially and in our careers to take the next step, but the dramatic, Bon Iver-fueled, romantic part of me didn\u2019t really care about any of that. I just wanted to be with her.Tara Roach, a student at the University of Wisconsin, sent us a problem to figure out:I\u2019m graduating this May and have lived with the same group of friends since my freshman year. We\u2019re going different directions next fall and I\u2019m already preoccupied about how different my life will be without seeing them every day. What\u2019s your advice for appreciating the time we still have together without worrying about the future?Your life will be very, very different after college, there\u2019s honestly no way around it. I graduated six months ago from Ithaca College. When I was in school, I lived with my best friend and most of my friends were walking distance from our apartment. Impromptu wine nights, study sessions and deep dives into our biggest insecurities were regular weekly activities.While the distance will be hard at first, it will make the time you put into keeping those friendships alive all the more valuable. Focus on how the integral parts of your friendship will still be there even if seeing them every day isn\u2019t. It may be hard to recreate the proximity and intimacy you have now, but know that a lot of those friendships won\u2019t just end in May.

Flexibility is your friend when it comes to planning your ski vacation, and it will help you target some good deals.Users can get ideas from the app and then further whittle down their preferences. For example, I set New York City as my home and looked for three-day getaways to Salt Lake City that began on either a Friday or Saturday. The app yielded a slew of options, one of which was a $326 flight on JetBlue for the first weekend in December.But no app is perfect. When I went to book the flight, the price jumped to $362. During the course of trying different bookings, I encountered inconsistencies with pricing and availability on the app. It was a valuable lesson: It never hurts to cross-reference your in-app or online findings with another site, or directly with an airline or hotel.You\u2019re looking to get away with the entire family, but are somewhat hemmed in by school vacations and swim practice. You\u2019ll likely need to pounce the moment a good deal arises. Another wrinkle: You\u2019re competing with thousands of other parents who are looking to get away at the same time, which will likely include the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day.If you\u2019re watching a particular route or date range closely, I recommend enabling push notifications on your phone \u2014 when prices drop, they don\u2019t always last very long. Hopper and Kayak also allow you to set alerts hotel rooms, in addition to flights.You work a lot, but your main requirements are a laptop and good internet connection.

Facebook, Apple and Amazon have endured the greatest declines, all down $250 billion or more from their respective peaks.That is a marked reversal for one of the most popular trades on Wall Street. Investors piled into shares of the largest tech companies, betting their revenue would continue to grow strongly as these behemoths upended industries from retail to communication to media.By the end of August, the market value of Apple and Amazon had each surpassed $1 trillion, and Alphabet was flirting with $900 billion. The combined market value of the five had reached $3.6 trillion.But worries about global economic growth as well as lackluster earnings and outlooks the past two quarters have shaken investors\u2019 confidence. In particular, concerns have mounted about how many new iPhones Apple will manage to sell. Facebook has spent much of the year mired in scandal, raising the specter that the United States government will tighten regulation of big tech. All of that has investors questioning whether the values of these big tech companies have become too lofty.Of course, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet have faced steep sell-offs before, only to bounce back quickly.

I think the Congress and the administration at some point will pass something.\u201dThe comment is another effort by Mr. Cook to distance Apple, which focuses on selling hardware, from companies like Facebook and Google that make money from selling ads based on user data.He also argued that tech companies should embrace regulation. \u201cThis is not a matter of privacy versus profits, or privacy versus technical innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a false choice.\u201dIn the years after Mao\u2019s death, China had to recover from decades of political and economic turmoil.

{"Headline": "In Florida Recount Fight, Democratic Lawyer Draws Plaudits and Fire", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 He has been accused of rigging the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries to thwart Bernie Sanders and facilitating a deluge of big money into politics. He helped arrange financing for the dossier of sometimes salacious and unverified claims about President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia and now is under direct fire from the president, who has said he is trying to steal the Senate race in Florida from the Republican candidate, Gov. Rick Scott.For an election lawyer, Marc E. Elias has drawn unusually intense attention and criticism.But then, Mr. Elias, who is representing Senator Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, in the Florida recount, has been at the center of an unusually large number of high-stakes political fights.The work has yielded tens of millions of dollars in legal fees for his firm, Perkins Coie, from corporations, campaigns and political committees. In the process, Mr. Elias has earned a reputation as one of the most formidable election lawyers in the country, and arguably one of the most influential of unelected Democrats in Washington.That approach, however, has earned him the ire of activists who support increased transparency and decreased money in politics. They say he has been among the biggest impediments to both causes, and has often put the short-term interests of the Democratic Party ahead of the interests of the party\u2019s base, and even of American democracy more broadly.\u201cHe\u2019s doing really important work for voting rights that benefits all voters, but he\u2019s also pushed for a deregulation of money in politics that serves the interests of the wealthy,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation for the nonpartisan government watchdog group Common Cause.Yet Common Cause and other government-reform groups have consistently opposed Mr. Elias\u2019s efforts to shape campaign finance rules, through legislative maneuvering, Federal Election Commission filings and court cases, to allow his clients to raise more money with fewer restrictions.In some ways, Mr. Elias\u2019s efforts to expand big-money fund-raising and spending undermine his efforts to protect and expand voting access, said Craig Holman, an official at the government watchdog group Public Citizen.\u201cWhile he supports leveling the playing field when it comes to the right to vote, it\u2019s ironic that he opposes any legislation or policies that would level the playing field when it comes to money in politics,\u201d Mr. Holman said. \u201cMarc does not understand that in a world of unlimited and undisclosed money in politics, the Republicans generally hold a strategic advantage.\u201dRight now, though, the Democratic Party\u2019s leadership and base appear united in cheering for Mr. Elias\u2019s aggressive tactics in the Florida recount, and galvanized by Republican attacks on him.In announcing his role leading the recount efforts last week, Mr. Elias declared that \u201cwe believe that at the end of this process, Senator Nelson is going to be declared the winner.\u201dThat prompted umbrage on the right, with Governor Scott asserting it proved that Mr. Elias did not care about a fair recount, and was, in fact, \u201chere to steal this election.\u201dThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, one of Mr. Elias\u2019s clients, has gone so far as to send out summaries of the coverage of Mr. Elias\u2019s conference calls with reporters, a treatment more typically reserved for the candidates themselves.\u201cMarc is a very smart campaign finance and election lawyer, but his legal positions are usually designed to serve the best interests of his Democratic Party clients in winning elections rather than any particular legal principle,\u201d said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican election lawyer who has worked against Mr. Elias in several recounts, including in Florida.Mr. Elias did not respond to requests to be interviewed.A fast-talking native of Rockland County, N.Y., Mr. Elias, 49, joined the Washington office of Perkins Coie shortly after graduating from the Duke University Law School in 1993.He rose through the ranks to become a partner, joining with the head of the firm\u2019s political practice, Robert F. Bauer, to build Perkins Coie into the dominant Democratic firm in the lucrative election law industry.The firm has been paid nearly $80 million since 2001 by federal candidates and committees, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Those fees, which do not include the millions more paid by nonprofit groups represented by Mr. Elias, are most likely rising further with the Florida recount, in which several of his clients are active.He brought a team from Perkins Coie with him to Orlando, where its members set up a command center in the building that housed Mr. Nelson\u2019s campaign headquarters, though the team has since moved to another building. They have filed lawsuits on behalf of several clients, including the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which sued to extend the deadline for mailed-in ballots to be counted. And Mr. Elias filed suit on behalf of the Nelson campaign challenging the state\u2019s ballot signature-validation process as unconstitutional.\u201cElias is a really sharp, credible attorney,\u201d said Jon Soltz, a co-founder of VoteVets, another group that signed on to one of his lawsuits in Florida. \u201cIf you\u2019re credible and you\u2019re dangerous to the president, his playbook is to attack. So Marc Elias should wear this as a badge of honor that he\u2019s being effective.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mystery of the Midterm Elections: Where Are the Russians?", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Shane Huntley has seen every form of state-sponsored cyberattack, first as an Australian intelligence officer and now as director of Google\u2019s most advanced team of threat detectors.So when he was asked what surprised him the most about the 2018 midterm elections, his response was a bit counterintuitive. \u201cThe answer is surprisingly little on the hacking front, at least compared to two years ago.\u201d He paused, and added: \u201cAnd that reassures some people, and it scares some people.\u201dHe is right. From the cyberwar room that the Department of Homeland Security runs round the clock in a bland office building in Arlington, Va., to Microsoft\u2019s threat-assessment center at the other end of the country, in Redmond, Wash., every form of digital radar is being focused on America\u2019s election infrastructure \u2014 and particularly on the Russian military intelligence agency once known as the G.R.U.This weekend, some of those radars began to sound a few warnings \u2014 but faintly, and in strange places. Cybersecurity firms and some election officials reported seeing an increase in cyberattacks on websites and infrastructure surrounding the vote, but not on systems that are part of the voting process. Hackers have targeted websites across the United States \u2014 including in Georgia, Florida and California \u2014 that allow voters to look up the location of their local polling stations or to verify that they are registered to vote.It is unclear where the attacks are coming from, but the sources appear to be a mix, everything from other countries to lone hackers looking to make a name for themselves, investigators say. \u201cThe attackers are trying to make a lot of noise,\u201d said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, a cybersecurity firm that is tracking the action.He said the incursions were not an effort to disrupt the vote, but merely to bolster rumors of election fraud and interference. \u201cThey are going after anything that can undermine the process itself,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir aim is to put the outcome in doubt,\u201d which could enable President Trump or losing candidates, come Wednesday, to declare that the outcome was rigged.There is no evidence yet that the Russians have had anything to do with this latest set of malicious activities, and many experts say they believe that President Vladimir V. Putin is sitting out this election. After all, the argument goes, the scrutiny is intense, and 470 House and Senate races make it just too hard for the Russians to figure out their interests, much less manipulate the outcome. But after the 2016 debacle, suspicions run deep, and some think that the Russians just haven\u2019t played their hand yet.Whether a Russian change of tactics is unfolding is just one of many mysteries surrounding this first national election in the United States after the most sophisticated effort ever discovered to divide Americans, and ultimately seek to alter the outcome, by a foreign power.If there is a lesson from 2016, it was that America was constantly taken by surprise \u2014 by the hacking of the D.N.C. and prominent Democrats, by the publication of internal emails, by efforts to get inside the voter-registration rolls of 20 states. In 2018, there are new and different warning signs: The Iranians have shown up, and states and local governments have done surprisingly little to harden their infrastructure. The Chinese are players, but not in the ways that President Trump and Vice President Pence have suggested.And the Russians haven\u2019t exactly gone away. While there are few signs of pre-election intrusions into voter-registration systems, the social media campaigns never ended; some accelerated immediately after the 2016 elections. When the United States indicted Maria Butina, a Russian who was accused of running influence campaigns while an American University student, the government suspected Russian groups budgeted millions of dollars for continuing influence campaigns.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised by any of this,\u201d Mr. Huntley said last week at a Zeitgeist, an annual gathering of the company\u2019s leadership and many of its customers outside of Phoenix. \u201cIt\u2019s like fighting the last war. When I was in the military academy people told us all the next wars were going to look like the first Gulf War. They didn\u2019t. And in cyber, the next war won\u2019t look like 2016.\u201dSo in the last days of the campaign, here are six points from the 2018 cyberpolitical battlefield:In 2016, the Iranians were nowhere to be seen in the American election process. This year, they showed up in such force that Facebook announced last Friday that it was taking down a series of Iranian posts, mostly, it seemed, to demonstrate that the company\u2019s radar, switched off two years ago, is now on high alert.Intelligence officials and cybersecurity companies say the Iranians mostly appear to be copying techniques that they learned from watching the Russians, especially in social media. But there is a twist: The Russians and the Iranians are clearly not in political agreement here. While both have sought to exacerbate political and social divides, the Russians clearly showed a preference for Mr. Trump as Election Day approached, according to the conclusions published after the election by American intelligence agencies.The Iranians are playing the other side. \u201cThey don\u2019t like what happened to the nuclear deal,\u201d Yasmin Green, the director of research and development for Jigsaw, a unit of Alphabet, which is Google\u2019s parent company. Speaking at a TimesTalks event held by The New York Times and Deloitte on Tuesday night in Washington, Ms. Green, one of the country\u2019s leading experts on the uses and abuses of social media, noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and his reimposition of drastic sanctions, has made the Iranians determined to cripple him.\u201cNot only are they anti-this administration,\u201d she said, they are \u201cpro-liberal.\u201dBy comparison to the Russians, the Iranian hackers are still pretty unsophisticated and are largely inept at imitating down-the-street-neighbors when posting to Facebook and Reddit. One ad showed a frowning Mr. Trump, and declared him \u201cThe Worst, Most Hated President in American History,\u201d the kind of extreme declaration one might expect of Mr. Trump himself. Others sought to undercut American confidence in the way Washington operates, by showing two men shaking hands above a conference table and passing money below it. (\u201cWe call it bribery \u2014 they call it lobbying.\u201dSo it is no surprise, said Tom Burt, the vice president for customer security and trust at Microsoft, that the most active battleground is, once again, Ukraine. In the Microsoft Cybercrime Center, a giant digital map of the world shows cyberattack activity, but the number of attacks are adjusted for the size of the population. Ukraine shows up in bright red. The United States, with 330 million people, or seven times the population of Ukraine, shows up in white, a sign of relative calm.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing activity in the U.S., but we\u2019re seeing it at levels less than we saw in 2016, said Mr. Burt, cautioning that Microsoft, with its network of machines using Office software and its Azure cloud computing services, is more likely to see hacking of accounts than social media activity.Still, Mr. Burt\u2019s group alerted two senators last year that a hacking group long linked to the G.R.U. had attacked their Capitol Hill offices, unsuccessfully. It was unclear if the goal was to affect their re-election campaigns or get into emails, because both sit on national-security-related committees. One of the senators was Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who is considered highly vulnerable. Microsoft also detected intrusions on two politically conservative think tanks in Washington in August.To get a sense of what is coming to the United States, Ms. Green and Jigsaw\u2019s chief executive, Jared Cohen, a former State Department official, visited Ukraine in recent weeks and found that it was still Mr. Putin\u2019s petri dish, a place where sophisticated new experiments were underway to deluge separatist parts of the country with disinformation ahead of military actions and a presidential election next March. Ukraine is \u201calways on the leading edge,\u201d she concluded.The question of China\u2019s involvement was raised first by Mr. Trump and then by Mr. Pence, who said in a speech that \u201cBeijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans\u2019 perception of Chinese policies,\u201d and said a \u201csenior career member of our intelligence community recently told me what the Russians are doing pales in comparison\u201d to Chinese interference.But Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were borrowing the terminology of cyberattacks to describe something very different: Efforts by China to publish policy arguments, often in newspaper supplements that have been paid for by the Chinese government for years, to make its case. There is no evidence, officials and outside experts say, of the kind of hacking that Russia has engaged in, or even much social-media use. (In Asia and Australia, in contrast, the Chinese have been busy on social media.)When three Democratic senators asked Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, for an unclassified letter explaining what the Chinese were doing in the 2018 election, to truth-test the administration\u2019s arguments, Mr. Coats avoided any potential contradictions with his boss by sending a classified answer.\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said. Mr. Coats, he said, \u201chas an obligation to the American people to provide a public response to our questions, particularly since this is about America\u2019s elections and the security of our democracy.\u201dIf awards were handed out for most-bungled-election-machine-management, Texas would be a strong contender for the top prize. It\u2019s just that the problem is the machines or the voters, not Mr. Putin\u2019s hackers.Bad publicity followed, and Texas blamed voters who couldn\u2019t keep their hands off the machines, which were decades old. But in these nervous times, the incident underscored how susceptible many election machines are to quirks. That is another reason that paper backup for electronic voting machines is so important, so that voters can look over their selections, and so vote-counters have a nonelectronic way of conducting a recount, if the machines cannot be trusted.One would think that after all the concerns in 2016, states and counties would have been racing to update their systems. \u201cMost did almost nothing,\u201d Douglas Lute, a former American ambassador to NATO and Army general, who has taken up the cause of reforming the election infrastructure, said in an interview. The $380 million that Congress allotted recently mostly went to funding assessments of vulnerabilities.Yet while states and counties made changes, New Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana still use no paper backup, and parts of Pennsylvania, a vital swing state, do not either. That has not changed since 2016, and it is unclear that it will be solved by 2020.The vulnerabilities of voting machines have gotten a lot of attention, especially at the Def Con conference over the summer in Las Vegas, which drew 25,000 hackers. At the conference\u2019s Voting Village, it took an 11-year-old just minutes to hack into a voting machine using a simulation of Florida\u2019s system. (The machine\u2019s manufacturers called it a stunt, noting that physical security of the machines at Def Con was nonexistent. Still, the speed of the intrusion was impressive.Almost all voting machines in the United States are off-line and come in many varieties, making it hard to hack them unless you are sitting in front of the machine. But the computers that prepare the ballots are not, and at the conference, J. Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan professor who has published devastating work on the vulnerability of voting machines, held a mock vote that pitted George Washington against Benedict Arnold. Thanks to manipulation of the ballot software, America\u2019s most famous traitor trounced the man who was, until the software was rigged, first in the hearts of his countrymen.That is only part of the problem. Many counties use old, insecure websites for their voter registration; it would be relatively simple to create \u201cspoofed\u201d alternative sites or break into them, to manipulate data or post notices that polls have been closed or Election Day moved. That could be the next move in the county-by-county activity seen in recent days.There is also room for mischief as votes are tabulated and reported to the state, and ultimately to media outlets.The Department of Homeland Security said there had been little evidence this year of the kind of \u201cprobes\u201d into the voter registration systems that created such fear in 2016. But Election Day hasn\u2019t arrived yet.It wouldn\u2019t take much to disrupt Tuesday\u2019s vote in a few important swing districts, and that\u2019s what the United States government \u2014 and many private security experts \u2014 are worried about.The Department of Homeland Security says it will be deploying small teams of cyberexperts to important states \u2014 presumably those that are most vulnerable, or have close races \u2014 just before the election. But it is not hard to imagine different scenarios that could cause disruption, or just create the illusion of disruption.A last-minute attack on county or state voter-registration systems, just to knock them off-line, would create an uproar from voters who might show up at the polls and find they could not vote. A strike at power grids, turning out the lights at polling places, or just disrupting transportation systems could suppress turnout and lead to charges of manipulation.Mr. Rosenbach\u2019s group simulated such events in a series of scenarios with election officials, piling one attack upon another in an effort to get them to think ahead about how they would respond, all part of an election \u201cplaybook\u201d that the Defending Digital Democracy program has given to campaigns and officials.And then there is another fear: Come Wednesday, if there are still races that are too close to call, just a rumor campaign about possible election manipulation might be enough to cast doubt about the integrity of the results. And in the end, that\u2019s what election disruption is all about \u2014 undermining the citizens\u2019 confidence that their vote counts.In 2016, the evidence of the extent of Russian operations on social media did not become clear until months after the election was over \u2014 and then, time and again, Facebook had to admit it missed all the warning signs. Mark Zuckerberg, a company founder, moved from arguing that to think fake news and divisive posts \u201cinfluence the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea\u201d to ordering the hiring of thousands of Facebook monitors to make sure it never happened again.But there are no guarantees. Months after the midterms are over, evidence of covert internet action that is currently going unnoticed may well surface. As the Russians and others embrace artificial intelligence techniques, and get better at targeting messages, they may well find ways to route around the phalanx of new social-media police. Ms. Green says that is unavoidable.\u201cIt\u2019s still retroactive,\u201d she said of monitoring social media. \u201cWe haven\u2019t figure out how to do this in real time.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misidentified the state that Senator Ron Wyden represents. He is from Oregon, not Washington.An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which some social media campaigns accelerated immediately after elections. It was 2016, not 2018.David E.

{"Headline": "Cups of Tea, Pashminas and Momos, Seeing India\u2019s Himalayas on a Budget", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal travelerIn the Ladakh region of northern India, the town of Leh is known for its beauty and culture, and for the experience of buying a cashmere scarf.I told the owner, George Sher Ali, that I\u2019d been in his shop before, several years before, and his ears perked up. \u201cTell me what you bought,\u201d he said, and reached for a tall stack of old assignment notebooks. \u201cI will tell you exactly when you came in.\u201d I said I\u2019d been into his art and print shop, L\u2019Araba Fenice, roughly eight years ago on a trip to Leh, a town in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, in the far north of India. I bought two or three postcards, as had a friend who had come with me. He flipped through the pages of a few dog-eared notebooks for several minutes before announcing decisively, \u201cThis is you. Five postcards.\u201d And he pointed at a hand-scrawled entry in a ledger dated Sept. 19, 2010. It was eight years ago to the day that I\u2019d visited his store.Leh (pronounced LAY), once the royal seat of a former Buddhist kingdom, is a place with a seemingly undying memory, ageless and eternal as the mountains that surround it. The Ladakh region, dotted with poplars and dominated by the Himalayas, has changed noticeably over the last decade, welcoming more tourists, restaurants and guesthouses. But it remains a wondrous destination for the adventurous traveler, full of captivating scenery, generous and friendly people, and accessible monasteries and holy places nearby. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that it can all be done fairly inexpensively.After arriving in Delhi, I spent a couple of days sightseeing and getting used to the time change before heading up to Leh early one morning. My trip was part of a longer journey to India, to places that will be featured in future columns. You can expect a good deal of bureaucracy when it comes to travel in this country. Have copies of your itinerary printed out, and a copy of the credit card with which you made a given ticket purchase, or the card itself.The bazaar is a good destination for your first day in Leh \u2014 you\u2019ll want to take it easy and drink plenty of water as your body acclimates to the noticeable change in altitude. The bazaar, once open to cars, but now a pedestrian walkway, is bedecked with banners from the local mosque and colorful Buddhist prayer flags. Street dogs trot lazily between vendors peddling local apricots (200 grams, almost half a pound, will run about 100 rupees), while hawkers call from their storefronts, promising the best prices for pashmina shawls and handmade crafts. In the distance, the nine-story Leh Palace surveys the activity below.\u201cAnd let me tell you, my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cThe machine-made pashminas are 10 percent nylon. No one else will tell you this. But it is the truth.\u201d The handmade pashminas ran in excess of 8,000 rupees, more than $100, as opposed to half that for the machine-woven scarves. I bought a machine-woven pashmina for myself (I honestly thought both were great; they both felt like spun cumulus clouds.) and a couple of beautifully patterned, very soft Merino wool scarves for 2,500 rupees apiece.A couple of bartering tips: While it\u2019s not the American way, try your best to get into it. Think of it as a dance or courting process, not as adversarial. Don\u2019t jump right in with numbers. Chat, have some tea and relax. If you don\u2019t like the price, act as if your heart has been broken, and walk away. Haggle hard, but if you know you\u2019re going to buy something, let the vendor feel like they\u2019ve won \u2014 they likely need the extra $5 or $10 more than you do.Lamayuru is a trek from Leh; If you want to visit somewhere a bit closer, Thikse Monastery is less than 20 kilometers west of town. Thikse, whose different white buildings cascade regally down a hillside, bears a resemblance to the Potala Palace in Tibet. We visited early, as the sun was rising, to catch morning prayers. Two young monks dressed in robes and orange headpieces stepped onto the roof and blew into their dung dkar, or conch shell horns. The ritual stunned us for its simplicity and beauty. Advertisement"}

Organized by the venture capital firms Basis Set Ventures, Index Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank, it was intended to help them understand how China has become a tech rival to the United States in barely two decades.It started the moment the group members entered their rooms at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Beijing\u2019s central business district, where a notice listed some of the websites they would be unable to call up \u201cdue to Chinese internet regulations\u201d: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Google, Bloomberg and The New York Times.Online payments represented another telling metaphor. Mobile payments are almost ubiquitous in the biggest Chinese cities, but setting up an account requires a local mobile number and a Chinese bank account.\u201cChina\u2019s internet is a walled garden,\u201d Mr. Chan said. \u201cNo one can break in unless you\u2019re from here.\u201dWithin that walled garden, everything seemed to be moving at an extraordinary speed. While Silicon Valley start-ups raise funding every 18 to 24 months on average, the group was told that the most successful Chinese companies do it every six months. It isn\u2019t unusual for a hot start-up to raise funding three to four times a year.Their hosts kept reminding them of the advantages China had over the United States in A.I. development. China\u2019s vast population and loose privacy laws give them access to much more data. A.I. companies also have considerable government support and are willing to pay more for top talent.\u201cThe U.S. competitive edge over China may not be long,\u201d Kai-Fu Lee, chief executive of Sinovation Ventures and former head of Google China, told them. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he added, \u201cthe Americans now have the information disadvantage.\u201dBut it was also obvious to the group what China was missing. For starters, everybody is Chinese. Even in its early days, Google had employees from 39 nationalities speaking 40-plus languages.\u201cChina is a bit homogeneous,\u201d said Mr. Chan, an early Google employee. \u201cYou don\u2019t find as much the perspectives of the world here compared to Silicon Valley.\u201dThen there are the work schedules. The Silicon Valley natives were introduced to the Chinese start-up concept of 996: Work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. Once they got over their shock, they had to ask: Does that punishing schedule make sense?\u201cI\u2019m not worried so much about my portfolio companies not working as hard as the Chinese companies,\u201d said Mr. Chan, now a partner at Felicis Ventures. \u201cI\u2019ll worry when they\u2019re less creative and less efficient.\u201dWhile China is becoming more innovative, many members of the group said they believed \u2014 and some of their Chinese counterparts agreed \u2014 that the United States still led in some areas.Although some Chinese tech companies can look very Silicon Valley-esque \u2014 with sprawling campuses that include dining halls, gyms and nap rooms \u2014 their preferred management style is still top down and results driven. Unlike Silicon Valley, smart underlings have less freedom to start something new.Technology itself is neutral, some of the Chinese executives said. It depends on how people use it \u2014 an argument that Silicon Valley companies used to make.Still, the Silicon Valley delegation did not expect facial recognition technology to be so widespread in Chinese life. Companies they visited used it at office entrances and at retail kiosks inside their facilities. They also saw demo videos of how the Chinese police could use the technology to monitor potential crimes in crowded public spaces and learn how many suspects had been arrested.After grasping how prevalent the cameras were, they started counting them. Even the van they rented from the hotel in Shenzhen had a handful of cameras installed, blinking from time to time to signal that they were on.Then, like many people in China, they got used to it, as if the cameras weren\u2019t even there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intrepid Business Travelers Are Finding Another Way to the Airport: Bike", "Date": "2018-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravelers have a bunch of choices on how to get to the airport. They can drive and pay to park. They can take a taxi or car service, or, perhaps, a bus or train. But whatever way they choose, travelers usually face delays in traffic or as they arrive at the terminal.That\u2019s where a new option comes in, at least at some airports: the bicycle.Conor Semler, a transportation planner for a private firm who lives in Somerville, Mass., north of Boston, rides his bicycle to Boston Logan International Airport when he travels for work, about twice a month.\u201cI prefer not to be in a car,\u201d he said.He said the seven-mile trip to the airport takes about 45 minutes compared with 25 minutes by car. And it has obstacles, including rutted streets through an industrial area. If it snows, cycling is out. And once, he said, he was flagged for a pat-down by airport security after the initial scanner screening picked up an anomaly \u2014 perspiration. Still, the trip and parking are free, and he has a choice of seven bike rack locations at the airport.Other airports around the country have also become bicycle accessible, among them Baltimore-Washington and the airports in San Diego and Portland, Ore. Of course, some airports were built far from residential neighborhoods or, like Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, are accessible only from highways that restrict bicycles.In many cases, it\u2019s not just travelers using bicycles but airport employees.The nascent phenomenon comes as bike-sharing systems expand and the travel industry looks to reduce its environmental impact.At the same time, it has been aided by technology apps and a growing recognition that cycling is integral to the transportation network in many cities. It\u2019s the ability to \u201ccombine technology with forms of transportation,\u201d said Marcello Gasdia, the research lead for Deloitte\u2019s travel, hospitality and services practice.\u201cRegional and state transportation planners are rethinking airport access and who travels to the airport, and how and why,\u201d said Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared-Use Mobility Center, a national public interest organization in Chicago dedicated to affordable transportation. \u201cAirports can facilitate bicycle travel for employees and some travelers.\u201d\u201cOne aspect that has changed is the penetration of cargo bikes that can now easily accommodate bags for short airplane trips,\u201d said Offer Grembek, a co-director of the center who was not involved in the study. \u201cAnother aspect is electrification of bikes that increase the range and reduce the level of effort needed.\u201dThere is also increased economic muscle behind bicycling. Last April, Uber bought Jump Bikes, a dockless electric bicycle sharing system operating in 12 cities in the United States. (A dockless bike can be picked up wherever the last rider left it.) In July, Lyft bought Motivate, a New York company that organizes and operates bike-sharing systems in New York, Boston, Chicago and Washington.On trips to Washington, Mr. Semler walks about 10 minutes from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to a Capital Bikeshare station in Crystal City, a neighborhood in Arlington, Va., for the 30-minute ride to his company\u2019s office at the Navy Yard. He uses Google Maps for directions. \u201cWith biking, I have a more reliable trip. With Metro, I could be stuck in a tunnel for 15 minutes,\u201d he said.Some airports are trying to make life easier for cyclists.Ten bicycles are in a rack directly outside the airport rail station. \u201cIt\u2019s for members of the community, customers and employees,\u201d said Jonathan Dean, an airport spokesman.The path for bikers and pedestrians was paid for by the Port of Portland. The airport said it was aware of the shortcomings, but did not have the funding for all the suggested improvements.As bicycling for transportation becomes more widespread, the federal government might help defray some of the cost of bike paths. The Federal Aviation Administration has jurisdiction over airport safety, which includes access roads \u2014 and those are eligible for funding as long as they meet all access road requirements, the agency said in a statement.As for Mr. Semler, he has expanded his cycling habits to include travel to meetings and family outings. \u201cThe first time I rode my bike to Logan, it was mostly for the novelty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after trying it I realized it was not just possible but kind of easy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Business Reaches a Turning Point", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI think as a group of business leaders, we have to think about the impact to our society of what\u2019s happening in the political discussions in our country.\u201d That\u2019s what Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck & Co., said last week, just days before the midterm elections. It was the crystallization of a theme that has emerged louder than ever over the past several years among a c-suite that for much of the last half century tried to avoid politics and considered its role in society in simple terms: delivering profits to shareholders, often at the expense of other constituencies.But as our society appears more polarized than ever, and as Washington seems in no hurry to heal this divided country, executives are finding themselves in the unwanted position of trying to play the role of uniter \u2014 or in some cases, picking sides.\u201cWe\u2019re not here to take political stands,\u201d Mr. Frazier told me. \u201cMy employees don\u2019t need to know what I believe about politics. But I do think, frankly, if you look around at what\u2019s happening in our society, there\u2019s more division than I think I can ever remember.\u201cPolitical discourse is such that we think that people who disagree with us are our enemies now,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd if you look at our society, our public schools are more segregated than they have been in generations; we live in communities that are essentially enclaves of people that are like us.\u201cThe media we consume now because of cable and social media \u2014 you can choose to go and just talk to people who agree with you. I actually think the workplace is the last place in our society where people can\u2019t choose necessarily who they work with.\u201dMr. Frazier, the most prominent African-American chief executive in the country, articulated the challenge that business faces in the middle of this political maelstrom, but also the chance: \u201cBusiness leaders have an opportunity to help bridge some of these chasms in understanding in our society.\u201dExecutives, of course, have long liked to talk about leadership and made proud declarations about their role in society, but all too often the promises have rung hollow.This time may actually be different.Over the course of a day of conversations with some of the top executives in the nation during last week\u2019s conference \u2014 DealBook: Playing for the Long Term \u2014 a common refrain was heard, echoing the sentiments of Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the largest investor in the world with more than $6 trillion. He implored other chief executives in a letter earlier this year to be more thoughtful about their roles in society.\u201cWhat\u2019s driving a lot of the change now is millennials,\u201d Mr. Fink said, expanding on the letter. \u201cThey are asking more of their companies.\u201dHe said he believed that we were at an inflection point.\u201cI do believe that the demand for E.S.G. is going to transform all investing,\u201d Mr. Fink said, referring to how investors are beginning to meaningfully evaluate companies based, in part, on environmental, social and governance metrics.\u201cThat may be one or five years away from now, but it\u2019s not that far away.\u201dResponding to a critique that his words are just public relations and that business shouldn\u2019t get involved with issues beyond the bottom line, Mr. Fink said, \u201cI\u2019m not a nanny.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not telling companies what their purpose should be. But I do believe it\u2019s up to the company to identify what their purpose is.\u201dSundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, said that although he started as an engineer, the way he spends his day has changed; increasingly, he devotes much of his time to thinking about how \u201ctechnology impacts society at scale.\u201dHe said part of his job description had turned into \u201ctechnologist-policy-maker-diplomat.\u201dIndeed, companies like Google are at the center of the debate, facing questions about their size and their impact on issues like privacy but also whether they support working with the United States government on sensitive projects like artificial intelligence for the Defense Department \u2014 a project Google chose to end, in part, because of a backlash from its employees. That outcome bolstered Mr. Fink\u2019s analysis that employees have become remarkably powerful inside some of these companies, especially as the job market continues to tighten.Mr. Pichai said he didn\u2019t run the company \u201cby referendum,\u201d but the day we spoke he was grappling with the fallout from a walkout by Google employees around the world over accusations of sexual harassment in the workplace, which some employees argued was prevalent in the company\u2019s culture.At most companies, such a walkout would be unthinkable. Mr. Pichai said he welcomed it. And while he said the debate was painful for the company, there is something unique even about the shift in business culture that would allow for such a widespread outcry.The technology industry, perhaps more than any other, is scrambling to defend itself against arguments that its products, once viewed as changing the world for the better, might be having the opposite effect.Evan Spiegel, chief executive of Snap, was candid. \u201cThese platforms have created an environment,\u201d he said, \u201cthat incentivizes negative behavior.\u201d He added: \u201cI think we\u2019re in this weird moment in time where this behavior\u2019s been enabled technically, and the regulatory framework actually hasn\u2019t caught up to that reality.\u201dAnd while Washington seems woefully behind, at least some companies are taking things into their own hands.Edward W. Stack, chief executive of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, recalled how he decided that his company would no longer sell AR-15 rifles after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. He described crying after watching the news. \u201cI said: \u2018This system doesn\u2019t work. This system is broken and we need to do something about it,\u201d he said.He said he \u201cwent to Washington and talked about the inconsistencies in the gun laws. A number of people in Washington didn\u2019t even know this, but you have to be 21 years old to buy a handgun from a federally firearms licensed dealer,\u201d but you can be 18 to buy an AR-15.Companies are not all going to be virtuous, and many decisions business leaders will make are hardly black and white, but the idea that executives are starting to consider their impact is at least the beginning of progress.Advertisement"}
