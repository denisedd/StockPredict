{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: How Facebook Wrestled With Its Scandals", "Date": "2018-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are some of the biggest takeaways from the investigation.\u201cIn the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss [Alex Stamos, then the company\u2019s security chief]. Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. \u201cIts leadership squirmed over Russian meddling investigations:\u201cMr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of [Sheryl] Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal. \u2018You threw us under the bus!\u2019 she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.\u201dThe company hadn\u2019t prepared for the worst on its platform:\u201c \u2018We failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u2019 Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.\u201dBut pushed its messaging hard:\u201cFacebook also expanded its work with [the P.R. firm] Definers. On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called [Apple\u2019s C.E.O. Tim] Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users.\u201dAnd Mark Zuckerberg was apoplectic about the criticism:After Mr. Cook publicly derided Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg was so furious that he later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.The bottom line:\u201cAs evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view.\u201dThose moves will be important when the company tries to convince public-market investors that it\u2019s worth a sky-high valuation when it files for an I.P.O. But it remains to be seen if investors will believe that argument.More from Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT:\u201cI\u2019m very happy about the state of the economy now,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cThere\u2019s pretty good reason to think we\u2019re going to continue in a positive vein like that.\u201dHe added that the Fed deserved credit for its role in the long and steady expansion. \u201cOur policy is part of the reason the economy is in such a good place now,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell also noted that Congress \u2014 not the White House \u2014 oversees the Fed, and added that the central bank would continue to raise rates for now.China, Germany and Japan have all seen their economies struggle in recent months. America\u2019s has not, and it looks set to avoid that \u2014 but there\u2019s still reason to worry.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

Now an early foray into fashion is also coming to market.\u201cThey were both very pleasant people who endeavored to produce good and enduring designs, which is why I agreed to the re-edition of what is essentially a very private design,\u201d Mr. Rams said. There was, he said, another compelling reason that eventually prompted him to change his mind: \u201cI wished to dedicate the handbag to Ingeborg, who has been my companion for so long and who has always been my alter ego,\u201d he said. \u201cBy making this public now, it is also a homage to her.\u201dUsing Mr. Rams\u2019s original 931 designs, Ms. Schulze-Tsatsas said that they had needed to change very little to update the bag for a 21st-century lifestyle.\u201cWe added an extra shoulder strap to make it hands-free, tweaked the lining to become a soft blue nappa, and created an interior zip pocket, but the exterior remains untouched,\u201d Ms. Schulze-Tsatsas said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to do anything to it.

When asked whether the handbag could lead to future forays in the accessories space, he said, \u201cI believe I have now designed enough.\u201dIndeed, he is not a great admirer of fashion in general. \u201cJil Sander is the only haute couturier to impress me,\u201d Mr. Rams said of the German fashion designer who paved the way for sophisticated minimalism with the introduction of her namesake label in 1968, and collections featuring strong tailoring and androgynous separates. \u201cI believe we have a similar outlook on things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Is Worth as Much as Apple. How Did That Happen?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world.It was big and still quite profitable, but the company had lost its luster, failing or trailing in the markets of the future like mobile, search, online advertising and cloud computing. Its stock price languished, inching up 3 percent in the decade through the end of 2012.It\u2019s a very different story today. Microsoft is running neck and neck with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company, both worth about $850 billion, thanks to a stock price that has climbed 30 percent over the last 12 months. At the end of trading Friday, Microsoft was just ahead of its longtime rival.So what happened?There is a short-term explanation for Microsoft\u2019s market rise, and there is a longer-term one.The near-term, stock-trading answer is that Microsoft has held up better than others during the recent sell-off of tech company shares. Apple investors are worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Facebook and Google face persistent attacks on their role in distributing false news and conspiracy theories, and investor concerns that their privacy policies could scare off users and advertisers.But the more enduring and important answer is that Microsoft has become a case study of how a once-dominant company can build on its strengths and avoid being a prisoner of its past. It has fully embraced cloud computing, abandoned an errant foray into smartphones and returned to its roots as mainly a supplier of technology to business customers.Microsoft\u2019s path to cloud computing \u2014 processing, storage and software delivered as a service over the internet from remote data centers \u2014 was lengthy and sometimes halting.Its forerunners to cloud computing go back to the 1990s, with Microsoft\u2019s MSN online service and later its Bing search engine. In 2010, four years after Amazon entered the cloud market, Microsoft introduced its cloud service. But it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.Even then, Microsoft\u2019s cloud service was a side business. The corporate center of gravity remained its Windows operating system, the linchpin of the company\u2019s wealth and power during the personal computer era. That changed after Mr. Nadella replaced Steven A. Ballmer, who had been chief executive for 14 years.Microsoft has also retooled its popular Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a cloud version, Office 365. That offering caters to people who prefer to use software as an internet service and gives Microsoft a competitive entry against online app suppliers like Google.The financial payoff from the shift came gradually at first, but is accelerating. In the year that ended in June, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 15 percent, to $110 billion, and operating profit increased 13 percent, to $35 billion.\u201cThe essence of what Satya Nadella did was the dramatic shift to the cloud,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cHe put Microsoft back into a high-growth business.\u201dIt is the perception that Microsoft is on a high-growth track that has fueled its rising share price.Microsoft would not try to compete with the smartphone technology leaders, Apple, Google and Samsung. Instead, Microsoft focused on its developing apps and other software for business customers.Microsoft does have a successful consumer franchise in its Xbox video game business. But it is a separate unit, and though it generates revenue of $10 billion, that is still less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s overall sales.Microsoft products, in the main, are about utility \u2014 productivity tools, whether people use them at work or at home. And its Azure cloud technology is a service for businesses and a platform for software developers to build applications, a kind of cloud operating system.\u201cIt\u2019s really the coming together of the professional cloud and the professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella explained at the time.Under Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has loosened up. Windows would no longer be its center of gravity \u2014 or its anchor. Microsoft apps would run not only on Apple\u2019s Macintosh software but on other operating systems as well. Open source and free software, once anathema to Microsoft, was embraced as a vital tool of modern software development.Mr. Nadella preached an outward-looking mind-set. \u201cWe need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft,\u201d he wrote in his book \u201cHit Refresh,\u201d published last year.The company\u2019s financial performance \u2014 and its stock price \u2014 suggest that the Nadella formula is working.\u201cThe old, Windows-centric view of the world stifled innovation,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThe company has changed culturally. Microsoft is an exciting place to work again.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s P.R. Firm Brought Political Trickery to Tech", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Tim Miller, a longtime Republican political operative, moved to the Bay Area last year to set up a public relations shop, he brought with him tradecraft more typical of Washington than Silicon Valley.He was well versed in opposition research \u2014 the pursuit of damaging intelligence about a political enemy. He had ties to online media provocateurs. And, above all, he understood the value of secrecy.Mr. Miller had arrived at the right moment with his company, Definers Public Affairs. With customers and lawmakers questioning the avowed good intentions and power of tech\u2019s biggest companies, Facebook and others were on the defensive.Definers quickly found plenty of business, from start-ups like Lyft, Lime and Juul to giants like Facebook and Qualcomm, the influential chip company that was in a nasty legal fight with Apple over royalties, according to five people with direct knowledge of Mr. Miller\u2019s work who declined to be named because of confidentiality agreements.While working for Qualcomm, Definers pushed the idea that Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was a viable presidential candidate in 2020, according to a former Definers employee and digital records. Presumably, it was an attempt to chill the cordial relations that Mr. Cook had cultivated with the Trump administration.The campaign by Definers signaled an escalation of Silicon Valley\u2019s already brass-knuckled approach to public relations.\u201cThis type of dirty P.R.? It\u2019s always been there, but it\u2019s definitely on the upswing,\u201d said Jonathan Hirshon, who was a public relations representative for technology companies for three decades, including Apple and Sony. \u201cThe idealism is still there, but the truth is, the big companies have become a lot more authoritarian in their approach to the media.\u201dDefiners\u2019s strategy played to a target\u2019s pressure points. Most of what Definers produced for Qualcomm had nothing to do with its beef with Apple, which was a complex legal fight over the royalties Apple should pay for the Qualcomm chips it was using in iPhones.Definers employees distributed anti-Apple research to reporters and would not say who was paying for it. Definers distributed a 13-page memo titled \u201cApple Bowing to Chinese Cyber Regulators\u201d that detailed how Apple\u2019s activity in China contradicted its public stance on privacy elsewhere. It also planted dozens of negative articles about Apple on conservative news sites, according to a person familiar with the work and emails reviewed by The New York Times.Qualcomm officials did not respond to requests for comment.The feuds among the tech industry\u2019s giants have hardly been genteel over the years. Big companies often tip reporters to bad news about other companies and urge regulators to examine competitors.A campaign by Microsoft, referred to as \u201cScroogled,\u201d highlighted what it called Google\u2019s privacy violations. From 2012 to 2014, it took out print and television ads that claimed Google was reading people\u2019s emails, a charge the internet company denied.Matt Rhoades, Definers\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the firm\u2019s work \u201cis absolutely no different than what public affairs firms do every day for their clients across industries and issues across the country. We are proud of the work we do for our clients.\u201dJuul, which has been accused of marketing its e-cigarettes to children, is working with Definers to improve its public image and communicate with reporters.The ride-hailing company Lyft used Definers to help navigate regulatory challenges in statehouses across the country, including choosing which Lyft drivers to pitch to the media for interviews, according to a person familiar with the work.And the scooter company Lime hired Definers in August because it wanted an outside contractor to take a more aggressive tack against rivals, according to a person familiar with that work. Lyft and Lime have since ended their work with Definers.To promote clients and attack its clients\u2019 enemies, Definers regularly used NTK Network, a news aggregator with a conservative slant and 122,000 followers on Facebook.Definers and its sister firm, the political-opposition group America Rising, share some staff and one floor of an office building in Arlington, Va., with NTK. Joe Pounder, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns who describes himself as \u201ca master of opposition research\u201d in his biographies, is listed as a co-founder of Definers and America Rising and editor in chief of NTK.Mr. Pounder and two colleagues distanced NTK from Definers after The Times\u2019s report last week. \u201cWe do not and did not work with Facebook. We share offices with a firm that does,\u201d they wrote in a blog post.But Mr. Miller promoted how Definers used NTK in a proposal sent to a potential Definers client last year, under a section labeled \u201cDigital Platform Echo Chamber.\u201d\u201cDefiners manages NTK Network, a news aggregation platform that targets Washington D.C. influencers. Through NTK we can directly re-publish favorable news from other outlets, and work with like-minded individuals to help create an echo chamber effect,\u201d he wrote in a copy of the proposal reviewed by The Times.This year, NTK has published at least 57 articles criticizing Apple and Mr. Cook. Some of the posts needled Apple for issues at the center of the legal dispute between Apple and Qualcomm and repeated Qualcomm\u2019s complaints. Apple had also started to move away from using Qualcomm chips.Mr. Pounder said in a statement on Tuesday that NTK is regularly pitched by people in public relations and the media. \u201cWhat NTK writes and posts on is what NTK chooses to write and post on,\u201d he added.Definers also used other outlets to disseminate its work. In July 2017, Mr. Miller wrote an article that accused Mr. Cook of lying to President Trump about building Apple factories in the United States, according to an email reviewed by The Times.Mr. Miller said in a text message to The Times that Definers pitched the angle to a range of news outlets. \u201cTwo years into the administration it\u2019s clear we were right,\u201d he added.Mr. Johnson said he had a falling out with Mr. Miller because of Mr. Miller\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump.Mr. Schrage, a longtime confidante of Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, had already announced plans to leave Facebook. Ms. Sandberg, who had previously said she did not know about Definers, admitted in an online comment attached to the memo that she had been informed about the company in emails and other materials.Erin Griffith contributed reporting from San Francisco and Matthew Rosenberg contributed from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Dolce & Gabbana Draws Fire and Accusations of Racism on Social Media ", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Italian luxury brand said its Instagram accounts had been hacked after racist messages purportedly from one of its designers were made public. But some in China aren\u2019t buying that.Instagram may be blocked in China, but it can still make waves there. Dolce & Gabbana, the Italian luxury brand, found that out on Wednesday with stunning swiftness. It abruptly canceled a Shanghai fashion show it had been planning to hold that night as waves of online Chinese users accused Stefano Gabbana, one of the two designers of the fashion line, of being racist. They pointed to private Instagram messages from Mr. Gabbana\u2019s account that the recipient posted publicly.Zhang Ziyi, the Chinese actress best known in the West for the film \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d took the brand to task online. Two dozen models said they would pull out of the show.Dolce & Gabbana said its account and the account of Mr. Gabbana had been hacked and disavowed the messages. \u201cWe are very sorry for any distress caused by these unauthorized posts,\u201d Dolce & Gabbana said on its Instagram account. \u201cWe have nothing but respect for China and the people of China.\u201dOn his account, Mr. Gabbana posted an image of the offensive comments with the words \u201cNot Me\u201d superimposed in big red letters.\u201cI love China and the Chinese culture,\u201d Mr. Gabbana said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened.\u201dThat makes it potentially dangerous territory for someone like Mr. Gabbana, who is famous for picking online feuds and in the past has used his Instagram account to make barbed attacks. He has clashed with Elton John after the fashion designer criticized in vitro fertilization, leading the pop star to create a hashtag, #boycottdolcegabbana, in response.Mr. Gabbana has called the singer Selena Gomez \u201cugly\u201d and hit back at critics of a sneaker with the phrase \u201cI\u2019m thin & gorgeous\u201d written on the side, posting, \u201cDarling, you prefer to be fat and full of cholesterol??? I think u have a problem.\u201d Most of the posts with offending comments have since been taken down.The fashion blogger Bryan Yambao, who blogs under the name BryanBoy and has over 600,000 Instagram followers, expressed skepticism about the brand\u2019s claim that it was hacked \u2014 a sentiment echoed widely online. \u201cI am having a hard time believing the notion that both social media accounts were hacked, especially when Mr. Gabbana has a proven track record of trolling everyone under the sun, from celebrities like Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez to influencers like Chiara Ferragni, both on public feed posts or on comments,\u201d he said in a message on Wednesday. Dolce & Gabbana has been the subject of boycotts so often that the company makes T-shirts inviting people to \u201c#Boycott Dolce & Gabbana,\u201d with a red heart. It is listed for $295 on the company\u2019s website. The latest online flap began with a Dolce & Gabbana ad for the Shanghai show that it posted on Instagram. It features a young Chinese woman in a glittery red dress and dangling jewelry trying to eat a cannoli with chopsticks. Traditional Chinese-sounding music plays in the background. As she flirts with the camera, a male narrator asks, \u201cIs it too huge for you?\u201dThe ad was meant to play on Italian and Chinese cultural differences. In a previous ad, the woman tried to use chopsticks to eat a pizza. But Chinese viewers who saw the cannoli ad \u2014 some overseas and some using special software to circumvent Chinese censors \u2014 found it crass and patronizing. They put screenshots online in China, where they quickly found an audience.In another message, Mr. Gabbana appeared to imply that Chinese people ate dog meat.Dolce & Gabbana said its legal offices were investigating the incidents. \u201cWhat happened today was very unfortunate not only for us, but also for all the people who worked day and night to bring this event to life,\u201d the designers said in a statement, referring to the fashion show.The controversy could be especially damaging for the fashion brand because it has made using Instagram stars in its runway shows a tent pole of its strategy to court millennials.In China, some internet users were unimpressed with the company\u2019s apology.\u201cDo you think Chinese people are three-year-olds?\u201d an Instagram user, Elainee_Hu, wrote in a comment that was liked 691 times. \u201cWe don\u2019t need your apology. Please take your clothes and your brand and leave China.\u201dBy Wednesday afternoon, the controversy was the most-talked-about topic on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter. The hashtags #DGgreatshowcanceled, #DGdesigner and #DGofficial response were trending on the website. The backlash marks the second time in more than a year that Dolce & Gabbana has courted controversy in the country.In April 2017, the brand started a campaign that featured migrants and sanitation workers. Critics said the label could have featured more stylish people.Vanessa Friedman and Matthew Schneier contributed reporting. Claire Fu and Zoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sending Lewd Nudes to Strangers Could Mean a Year in Jail", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRebecca Odorisio was traveling home on a crowded A train on Tuesday when a photo suddenly appeared on her phone from someone identifying himself as \u201cThe Enterprise.\u201dIt was a picture of an erect penis, sent to her over AirDrop, an iPhone feature that allows users to send photos and documents to anyone within 30 feet who has left that feature open. Disgusted, she quickly rejected it.\u201cI felt like I had been punched in the gut,\u201d Ms. Odorisio, 31, a Brooklyn-based actress and singer, said Wednesday. She said it was not the first time something like that had happened to her, adding, \u201cIt was extremely violating.\u201dKathe Hannauer, 58, had a similar experience last month, as she traveled from Brooklyn to Manhattan on a crowded train during the evening rush.When an image of male genitalia suddenly appeared on her screen, she said she felt more surprised than flustered. \u201cIt was kind of like, \u2018At my age?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNo one has harassed me in the longest time.\u201dBut she worried about what would happen if a young girl was sent such a photograph, so she quickly wrote about the incident on Facebook to warn her friends to turn their AirDrop feature off when they are in public.The two women were victims of what has become known as cyber flashing, a growing trend of technology-enabled sexual harassment. It has become so common that two lawmakers introduced a City Council bill on Wednesday to explicitly make it a crime, punishable by a $1,000 fine or up to a year in jail.One of the first news reports of cyber flashing was in London in 2015, when a female commuter told the British Transport Police that she had received lewd photos on her phone via AirDrop as she traveled to work. Since then, people in New York, Toronto and other cities have written articles, tweeted and posted on Facebook and Instagram about how explicit pictures have showed up on their phones, often while on crowded public transportation.Because AirDrop allows people to send images anonymously, there is no way for a commuter to know who in a busy train car might have sent it. And unlike traditional public lewdness crimes, the sender might not know who exactly within 30 feet is receiving the picture, because the feature identifies nearby phones only by the phone\u2019s nickname.\u201cIn the old days, you had to have a long trench coat and good running shoes,\u201d said Councilman Joseph Borelli, a Republican from Staten Island who is co-sponsoring the anti-flashing bill. \u201cTechnology has made it significantly easier to be a creep.\u201dSome people interpret the images as a harmless prank. About a month ago, Michael May, a medical resident in Manhattan, said he was on the A train when a stranger sent him a photo of a completely nude man covering his genitals with a glowing light saber.\u201cI thought it was funny,\u201d Mr. May, 26, said. He looked up from his iPhone to try to determine who had sent it, but everyone around him was staring intently at their phones.Donovan J. Richards, a Democratic councilman from Queens and a co-sponsor of the bill, said the legislation was intended as a bipartisan effort to raise awareness \u2014 and to remove the sense of impunity that may embolden those sending the images.\u201cKeep your pic in your pants,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf you do it, the message we are sending is that the repercussion is a fine or jail time.\u201dAirDrop, which first debuted in 2011, is specific to iPhones and other Apple products. It uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to communicate over a short range to other devices, like other iPhones. More recently, some Android-enabled devices have had access to a similar feature called AirDroid.What makes Apple\u2019s feature particularly vulnerable to cyber flashing is that it automatically shows the recipient a preview of the image, then asks the user to accept or decline it. The only way to block the image is to set the AirDrop feature only for use between phone contacts (which is the default setting from Apple) or to turn it off completely.It is already a misdemeanor in New York State to harass someone by telephone, mail or other forms of written communication. But that law does not explicitly address the issue of visual images.The bill introduced on Wednesday would add language to the city code that would make it \u201cunlawful for a person, with the intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, to send by electronic device an unsolicited intimate image.\u201dDanielle Citron, a professor of law at the University of Maryland and the author of a book on hate crimes in cyberspace, said that clarification could be helpful. New York may be the first municipality to consider a specific law targeting the practice, she said.\u201cThis is unwanted electronic harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cJust like we have telephone harassment laws that have been upheld by federal and state courts, it is absolutely possible to regulate this.\u201dMs. Citron said there were no statistics tracking the prevalence of cyber flashing, adding the entire field of electronic harassment is \u201cwoefully understudied.\u201dSgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department, did not address the issue of cyber flashing directly, but said in a statement, \u201c Any complaints made in regard to aggravated harassment will be recorded and fully investigated.\u201dMr. Richards said that Apple and other tech companies should share the responsibility for warning users about the potential misuse, and modify the feature to be safer. \u201cThe onus can\u2019t just be on the Police Department,\u201d he said.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.For now, protection mostly consists of past victims warning others to look out. Ms. Odorisio was so upset by the explicit image she received that she posted a censored version of it on Instagram, with her own text over it: \u201cTo those who say \u2014 aw, come on, that doesn\u2019t happen \u2026\u201dUnder the image it read: \u201cNot asking for it.\u201dThere are two ways to restrict the AirDrop feature on an iPhone.In the main settings app, select \u201cGeneral,\u201d and then \u201cAirDrop.\u201d Then select either \u201cReceiving Off\u201d or \u201cContacts Only.\u201d The \u201cEveryone\u201d setting is when sexual harassers can send you photos.Alternately, swiping up from any screen will bring up the control center. Pushing down on the Bluetooth icon will open another menu, in which there is an AirDrop icon. Tap that, and the options for \u201cReceiving Off,\u201d \u201cContacts Only\u201d and \u201cEveryone\u201d appear.Advertisement"}

Do You Know Where Your Photos Are?", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the age of image abundance, purges are a way of life.In 2005, Yahoo acquired Flickr, the popular photo site. It already had a photo site, Yahoo! Photos, which was created in March 2000. But don\u2019t worry, the company said:\u00a0The two could happily coexist.In 2007, Yahoo announced it would discontinue that first photo service, and that users should move their photos to Flickr, which now required a Yahoo account to use. In 2013, the company announced that Flickr users would have a terabyte of space \u2014 for most people, an effectively unlimited amount \u2014 to store images for free. (\u201cWe want all your photos,\u201d said Adam Cahan, a Yahoo executive at the time.) By then, digital cameras were ubiquitous and smartphones had gone mainstream. People were producing more photos than ever, but it still wasn\u2019t clear where they were supposed to end up.This news came with a new default storage limit: 1,000 photos. Users could begin paying or take the rest elsewhere. A digital photo first uploaded to Yahoo at the turn of the century, in other words, when most people online were still dialing in to get there, and not once again rescued this year, may finally meet its demise. It would have had a better run than most. And here it is, almost 2019. Do you know where your photos are? Most of us don\u2019t, at least not exactly, or in terms that we fully understand. Holding on to pictures was, for most of the history of photography, a matter of material decay and physical storage. Are these prints fading, and how fast? Are they organized by year or by subject? Do I know where they are? To the people who took them, they were deeply valuable; to anyone else, mostly worthless. Their peculiar sort of pricelessness made archivists of regular people. The problem of what to do with ballooning digital photo collections, on the other hand, is perhaps the great unsolved tech support question of the last 30 years. In retrospect, well-intentioned guidance reads like a manual for the obliteration of memory. Hard drives die unpredictably. If you could produce a Zip drive in 2018, it would likely regurgitate whatever you fed it. CDs and DVDs rot, it turns out. The first services that beckoned us to what was not yet widely known as the cloud set the tone for what was to come. At the turn of the century a site called Zing promised, in a first, \u201cfree unlimited online storage\u201d for photos. By the end of 2001, its home page had been replaced with an apology letter. But online photo collections kept growing \u2014 where else would we go? Newer, more credible services hustled for users. Storage practices didn\u2019t get revised, they accumulated: Photos lived on old discs and drives, moving from site to site, cloud to cloud, from Photobucket to Flickr to Facebook and back, or maybe just waiting on ever-larger SD cards. (Those die, too.)\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve come across with my clients is not necessarily \u2018How do I store them?\u2019 but \u2018How do I move them to the newest application?\u2019\u201d said Kaitlyn Ackron, a 17-year-old student in Rio Rancho, N.M., who provides tech support for seniors through an organization called Teeniors. They worry about accidentally deleting photos from their phones, said Ms. Ackron, who shows them the \u201cRecently Deleted\u201d folder. They\u2019re alarmed when they can\u2019t see old images on a new computer. (The storage device is no longer compatible.) \u201cThere have been quite a few people frustrated with that kind of stuff,\u201d said Yannick Hutchinson, a 23-year-old student who also works with Teeniors. New and subtler forms of online storage, working in the backgrounds of our smartphones, cause particular anxiety. \u201cThe storage is not on their phone, but out there on this supposed cloud,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Well, where is it?\u2019\u201dNow, again, with services like iCloud, the tech industry is promising us all the space we need. This time, however, it has barely felt the need to pitch us. Photo glut is a common condition. These days, smartphone makers don\u2019t need to pitch; they tend to just make us aware of what\u2019s already happening automatically. If you use an iPhone, every picture can be uploaded to Apple\u2019s servers, until you run out of free space, at which point you\u2019ll either need to start deleting things or rent some more, from Apple.Google promises unlimited free \u201cstorage,\u201d sure: \u201csafe, secure, and always with you.\u201d But some of its other promises, the ones we haven\u2019t heard before, are strikingly of their time: \u201cNever worry about running out of space on your phone again.\u201dIt is a gentler approach than \u201cwe want all your photos.\u201d And this most modern solution quickly diverts our attention away from the old question \u2014\u00a0where will my photos end up? \u2014\u00a0to the newer ones attendant with photography as it exists today. People take pictures to remember things, for the benefit of others, or to record something beautiful or notable, but also according to the constant demands of social media, of keeping friends and family updated in real time, and of simply communicating on the phone. The various images we record, and those compelled from us, are something apart from a photo collection. Apple proactively processes a phone\u2019s images into categories, some of which wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the side of a shoe box, or the cover of a photo album: around dates or places; of particular people, who Apple identifies automatically with facial recognition. Sometimes Apple reminds you of a birthday party, and presents you with a moving video. Other times, as it did to a friend, it shows you a slide show of photos you took of a stereo to post it on Craigslist. Remember that day? Google\u2019s approach is more assertive. From your raw imagery, it will automatically edit together a sequence of your child\u2019s development. It will do the same for your dog, whose face it can also recognize. You can search your photos for almost anything: cars, sunsets or \u201cscreenshots containing text.\u201d Its album and videos and searches double as assurances: You may never organize your photos yourself, but we have some ideas; you may not remember taking them in the first place, but they still exist. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent like Flickr,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cTech companies are still selling a lot of very neophyte people a lot of problematic lies about things that matter a lot to them.\u201d Besides, even Flickr offered more than storage. It was a social network with a framework for sorting and tagging and categorizing and discussing photography. You can now export that data alongside your photos if you want, but this archive of metadata has few uses and fewer places to go. The prospect of removing your photos and videos from a service like Google Photo, which provides not just space but also the only interface through which your personal imagery makes any sense, is worse than daunting. Ms. Ackron\u2019s advice for seniors remains practical. \u201cYou always need to keep an eye on where you\u2019re storing your photos, to make sure things aren\u2019t going out of date,\u201d she tells them, describing the process as \u201ctedious\u201d but necessary. \u201cTechnology isn\u2019t slowing down.\u201dThey have advice, too. \u201cI just keep all my pictures on my phone,\u201d Ms. Ackron said. \u201cClients talk about how they kept scrapbooks and photo boxes and photo albums, and about how physically holding the pictures themselves is a different experience.\u201d Now, she said, she prints some favorites of her own. Beneath the roar of digital acceleration, there is still some shuffling of paper. A 2018 analysis by f/22 Consulting, a photo industry firm, noted that a printing business in turmoil has managed to siphon growth from America\u2019s bulging camera rolls. Traditional prints \u2014\u00a0shoe box fodder\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are growing again. But not as fast customized mementos and books, including some generated by tech giants using facial recognition and other artificial intelligence. It\u2019s not a solution, but it may be an escape. My own wedding was just over two years ago, photographed and recorded in a variety of ways. To the extent it existed on social media, it\u2019s in fragments. We have countless photos sitting in folders, and on various drives; some of our guests shared photos with us, others didn\u2019t, and we didn\u2019t bother most of them about it. Google has a cache, which it is tirelessly analyzing for clues and content. For a record of a single weekend, this nebulous digital archive is surprisingly unapproachable. And it has already begun its decay.There does exist a version of events, however, rendered in a coherent way, in the manner of photographs recorded for posterity \u2014\u00a0a pair of photo books printed for our parents, who requested a way to show photos that didn\u2019t involve their phones. If history is any guide, our best chance at having something to look back at when we\u2019re old won\u2019t come from the next Google, or whatever comes after that. It\u2019s that these books will survive all of it, and find their way back to us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Will Stop Revealing How Many iPhones It Sells. That\u2019s a Bad Sign.", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has giant revenues, profit margins that are the envy of corporations everywhere and a stock market value of $1 trillion.Despite those obvious strengths, Apple told investors on Thursday that it would stop reporting numbers central to understanding the performance of its biggest business: selling iPhones.The company said it would no longer disclose how many iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold each quarter. Without this data, investors will not be able to track the average selling price of iPhones, a crucial number for assessing whether consumers are balking at paying up for Apple\u2019s higher-priced phones.The decision, along with Apple\u2019s disappointing forecast for this quarter\u2019s sales, helped drive the company\u2019s stock price down more than 7 percent on Friday, a move that weighed on the wider stock market.Apple\u2019s move to cut back its disclosures also should serve as a jolt for all investors.For much of the year, investors seemed to ignore the warning signs hanging over large technology companies and pushed their stocks higher. Their plunge last month \u2014 Netflix\u2019s stock is down 26 percent from its high, and Amazon is off 19 percent \u2014 has most likely made investors more aware of the problems these companies face in their core businesses.But Apple\u2019s decision to make its iPhone sales less transparent may underscore the seriousness of these challenges. \u201cAn abrupt loss of disclosure suggests weakness beyond one quarter,\u201d Jeffrey Kvaal, an analyst for Nomura, wrote in a research note.Sales of iPhones have stalled in recent years. As a result, Apple has raised prices to bolster its iPhone revenue. The average selling price of an iPhone was $793 in the three months through September, a 28 percent increase from a year earlier. Without the tally of phones sold, calculating the average selling price won\u2019t be possible, and outsiders will find it harder to gauge consumers\u2019 sensitivity to the price of iPhones. \u201cWe believe unit volumes and A.S.P.\u2019s are reflective of the loyalty and satisfaction consumers have in their devices,\u201d Mr. Kvaal wrote in his note, referring to average selling prices.Selling iPhones at a premium price to a relatively small portion of the global smartphone market has been at the heart of Apple\u2019s strategy. With less data, investors will probably find it harder to tell whether this approach remains successful.Other big technology companies have removed data from their regular financial reports. And some simply do not disclose figures that would be helpful in determining trends in their business. Twitter, for instance, does not provide the overall number of daily average users, a number that Facebook gives out.Facebook does not disclose Instagram\u2019s revenue, a number that would help investors understand the attraction of each platform to advertisers.Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, on Thursday contended that removing the data would not affect investors\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s performance. Over the last three years, he said, there was no correlation between price and the number of phones sold. And Apple said it would disclose new information, including the cost of sales for its two main businesses, called products (selling items like iPhones) and services (for instance, subscriptions to Apple music).But the new information may not make up for what\u2019s being taken away. Sales of iPhones accounted for nearly three-fifths of the company\u2019s revenue in its latest quarter. And the decision to stop providing iPhone sales comes at a pivotal time for smartphones. Sales of smartphones in more affluent countries are slowing as consumers hold onto their phones longer. While sales are still growing in emerging markets, such as India, the handsets that dominate those markets are cheaper. So as the sales mix shifts to those countries, it could crimp profit margins.\u201cI think we\u2019re at peak smartphone,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, a tech sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook to Drop Forced Arbitration in Harassment Cases", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook said on Friday that it would no longer force employees to settle sexual harassment claims in private arbitration, making it the latest technology company to do away with a practice that critics say has stacked the deck against victims of harassment.Facebook acted one day after Google announced similar plans. Last week, 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout from the company\u2019s offices around the world to demand that it change the way it handled sexual harassment incidents. Microsoft changed its arbitration policy about a year ago, as did the ride-hailing company Uber six months ago.The technology industry, known for its groundbreaking products as well as its trendsetting office culture, has gone to considerable lengths in recent years to keep work-force disputes out of the court system. Forcing employee complaints into arbitration has become as common as free lunches and shuttle buses to the office.In arbitration, employment experts say, the playing field shifts toward businesses. Cases are decided by arbitrators instead of judges, and the more cases that companies take to arbitration, the better they fare, according to a 2011 analysis by Alexander J. S. Colvin, a professor at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.\u201cThis is a pivotal moment for our industry and corporate America more broadly,\u201d Lori Goler, a Facebook vice president, said in a statement. \u201cWe think this is the right thing to do and hope other companies do, too.\u201dThe use of arbitration clauses, embedded in the fine print of contracts, has soared in the last decade, as corporations try to keep disputes away from public scrutiny.Chris Baker, an employment lawyer and partner at the law firm Baker Curtis & Schwartz, said arbitration cases were often heard by a retired judge who may not be as empathetic as a jury to a harassment victim. They are often shrouded in confidentiality, and arbitration awards tend to be less than those in a jury trial.Mr. Baker said the moves by the tech firms could chip away at arbitration in all kinds of employee disputes because it would be hard for companies to draw the line at sexual harassment.\u201cI think it\u2019s the pebble that starts the avalanche,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very meaningful.\u201dBecause the claims are often kept under wraps in confidential arbitration hearings, critics say harassers often move easily to other jobs without warning to future victims.It has become a significant issue in Silicon Valley, where gender imbalance is stark and tales of sexual harassment are rampant. Critics of arbitration requirements have pushed companies to do away with arbitration and confidentiality clauses that often help companies keep the public and their own employees in the dark about bad behavior.The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has noted that forced arbitration \u201ccan prevent employees from learning about similar concerns shared by others in their workplace.\u201dFacebook said it would now make arbitration an option, but not a requirement, for employees reporting a sexual harassment claim. Facebook said it had been planning to make the changes to its arbitration policy for \u201ca while\u201d but did not specify a time frame. There is no indication the company was facing specific pressure to alter its policies.Lyft, Uber\u2019s top competitor, made a similar policy change around the same time.In December, as Microsoft faced a proposed class-action lawsuit by female technical staff claiming discrimination, it vowed to end the arbitration requirement for harassment claims. The women lost the case and are appealing.Microsoft\u2019s policy change was largely symbolic because the company rarely used arbitration clauses in its employment agreements. However, Microsoft also said it would support federal legislation making the requirement of arbitration in harassment cases unenforceable.Apple has never arbitrated a harassment or discrimination claim, said Kristin Huguet, a company spokeswoman. It had a forced arbitration requirement for new employees until earlier this year, but it made arbitration optional and then eliminated the clause from employment contracts altogether. She did not specify when. Ms. Huguet said that even Apple employees who had agreed to such an agreement were no longer bound by it.Companies large and small have figured out how to use arbitration to prevent employees from taking disputes to court and to prevent others, including customers, from banding together in a class action. Some state judges have called the ban on class actions \u2014 one of the few ways that ordinary citizens can fight deep-pocketed corporations over unfair business and employment practices \u2014 a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card for employers.In recent years, it has become tough to apply for a credit card, get cable service, rent a car or shop online without agreeing to settle any disputes in arbitration. The same is true for getting a job.The use of arbitration clauses can be traced back to a coalition of credit card companies and retailers that came up with a plan to shield themselves from expensive lawsuits. Starting around 1999, the group\u2019s legal teams began discussing how to use the fine print of contracts to stop class actions. Bank of America, Chase, Citigroup, Discover, Sears, Toyota and General Electric all attended.Arbitration clauses that don\u2019t allow class-action suits are used by a wide variety of companies, including Macy\u2019s and Kmart. In 2016, when Gretchen Carlson sued Roger E. Ailes, her former boss at Fox News, over allegations of sexual harassment, his lawyers pushed for the case to move into arbitration.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg from New York.

{"Headline": "Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook\u2019s Leaders Fought Through Crisis", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySheryl Sandberg was seething.But it wasn\u2019t the looming disaster at Facebook that angered Ms. Sandberg. It was the social network\u2019s security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.\u201cYou threw us under the bus!\u201d she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.The clash that day would set off a reckoning \u2014 for Mr. Zuckerberg, for Ms. Sandberg and for the business they had built together. In just over a decade, Facebook has connected more than 2.2 billion people, a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the way, Facebook accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that propelled the company into the Fortune 500.But as evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.When Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to President Trump, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.And when that failed \u2014 as the company\u2019s stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash \u2014 Facebook went on the attack.While Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.In Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms. Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook\u2019s reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.This account of how Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg navigated Facebook\u2019s cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.Facebook declined to make Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.\u201cThis has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\u201dEven so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook\u2019s conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of Facebook\u2019s data-hungry business model.\u201cWe failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u201d Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.His answer each time: a resounding \u201cNo.\u201dThree years ago, Mr. Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company\u2019s extraordinary success. Ms. Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, \u201cLean In,\u201d in 2013.But as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them. Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.The question was unusual. Mr. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Ms. Sandberg\u2019s domain. In 2010, Ms. Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook\u2019s chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Ms. Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Ms. Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.In video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company\u2019s terms of service to see if the post, or Mr. Trump\u2019s account, violated Facebook\u2019s rules.Mr. Kaplan argued that Mr. Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.\u201cDon\u2019t poke the bear,\u201d Mr. Kaplan warned.Mr. Zuckerberg did not participate in the debate. Ms. Sandberg attended some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.Mr. Schrage concluded that Mr. Trump\u2019s language had not violated Facebook\u2019s rules and that the candidate\u2019s views had public value. \u201cWe were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,\u201d he said in an interview.In the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement and account remained on the site. When Mr. Trump won election the next fall, giving Republicans control of the White House as well as Congress, Mr. Kaplan was empowered to plan accordingly. The company hired a former aide to Mr. Trump\u2019s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over internet companies.But inside Facebook, new troubles were brewing.In the final months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.Facebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Mr. Stamos.Mr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Mr. Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.Mr. Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations. At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.Mr. Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize the extent of Russian activity on Facebook. In December 2016, after Mr. Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Stamos \u2014 alarmed that the company\u2019s chief executive seemed unaware of his team\u2019s findings \u2014 met with Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.Ms. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner.Still, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg decided to expand on Mr. Stamos\u2019s work, creating a group called Project P, for \u201cpropaganda,\u201d to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Mr. Stamos\u2019s original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.But Mr. Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by American intelligence agencies that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr. Trump.If Facebook implicated Russia further, Mr. Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians\u2019 fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr. Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.Ms. Sandberg\u2019s subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators\u2019 concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.But inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance. By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a \u201cfive-alarm fire,\u201d said a person familiar with the discussions.Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on Sept. 6, 2017, the day of the company\u2019s quarterly board meeting.After Mr. Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Ms. Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Mr. Zuckerberg also asked Mr. Stamos and Mr. Stretch to brief the board\u2019s audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.Mr. Stretch and Mr. Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.The disclosures set off Mr. Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.When the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company\u2019s headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Mr. Bowles pelted questions at Facebook\u2019s founder and second-in-command. Ms. Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Mr. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.The same month, Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites \u2014 a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.Facebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Mr. Warner\u2019s former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Mr. Kaplan\u2019s team took a larger role in managing the company\u2019s Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.Ms. Sandberg also reached out to Ms. Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Ms. Sandberg\u2019s empowerment initiative. Ms. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s 2015 memoir, and the senator\u2019s chief of staff had previously worked at Ms. Sandberg\u2019s charitable foundation.But in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Ms. Sandberg complained about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Ms. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation. But she dialed down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Ms. Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.A spokesman for Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook\u2019s lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \u201cFacebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\u201d he said.In October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company. Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialized in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations \u2014 an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.Facebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.Google and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was championed by Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota who had pummeled Facebook over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and senior commerce committee member who was a frequent critic of Facebook.Facebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.When the bill came to a vote in the House in February, Ms. Sandberg offered public support online, urging Congress to \u201cmake sure we pass meaningful and strong legislation to stop sex trafficking.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.They were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \u201cPrivacy to us is a human right. It\u2019s a civil liberty.\u201d (Mr. Cook\u2019s criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.)Facebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \u201cWe Get It,\u201d meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.Then Facebook went on the offensive. Mr. Kaplan prevailed on Ms. Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company\u2019s American lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.On a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Mr. Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook.The rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company\u2019s political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients\u2019 enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.Mr. Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers\u2019 work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Mr. Cook\u2019s criticism upset Facebook.If the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \u201cmuddy the waters,\u201d Mr. Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, Calif., bar last month.In public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \u201cHere Together,\u201d to apologize to its users. Days before Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s good-will tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company\u2019s communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic \u2014 a suspicion confirmed by Facebook\u2019s pollsters.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s political instincts were no more well-tuned. During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.Mr. Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook\u2019s leader, Mr. Walden realized, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.Ms. Sandberg had said little publicly about the company\u2019s problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.Some colleagues believed that Ms. Sandberg \u2014 whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company \u2014 was protecting her own brand at Facebook\u2019s expense. At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Ms. Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.So Ms. Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company\u2019s Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Mr. Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its work force than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Ms. Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.Her top Republican target was Mr. Burr, whose Senate committee\u2019s Russia investigation had chugged along. The two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive, and met in person this fall. While critics cast Facebook as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.She made the same case in June at a conference of the National Association of Attorneys General in Portland, Ore. At the time, several attorneys general had opened or joined investigations into the company. Facebook was eager to head off further trouble.The company organized several private receptions, including what was billed as a conversation with Ms. Sandberg about \u201ccorporate citizenship in the digital age\u201d and a briefing on Cambridge Analytica.While Facebook had publicly declared itself ready for new federal regulations, Ms. Sandberg privately contended that the social network was already adopting the best reforms and policies available. Heavy-handed regulation, she warned, would only disadvantage smaller competitors.Some of the officials were skeptical. But Ms. Sandberg\u2019s presence \u2014 companies typically send lower-ranking executives to such gatherings \u2014 persuaded others that Facebook was serious about addressing its problems, according to two who attended the conference.In separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.By then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.In July, organizers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organizers held aloft signs depicting Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.Eddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.\u201cDepicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\u201d the organization wrote. \u201cProtest Facebook \u2014 or anyone \u2014 all you want, but pick a different image.\u201d The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \u201cextreme anti-Israel groups.\u201dFacebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \u201cmenace\u201d with \u201cneither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\u201dDefiners pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros\u2019s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros\u2019s son. (An official at Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support campaigns against Facebook.)Mr. Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook\u2019s New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.In July, as Facebook\u2019s troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, by then Facebook\u2019s most insistent inquisitor in Congress.Back off, he told Mr. Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Mr. Schumer\u2019s intervention. Mr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer\u2019s efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.A Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Mr. Schumer had not wanted Mr. Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.One morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook\u2019s Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.But Ms. Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 a pivotal encounter for her embattled company \u2014 and her aides were taking no chances.Inside the room, they labored to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialized in training corporate executives.Facebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Ms. Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Mr. Burr, who was determined to avoid a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.In the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labeled \u201cGoogle.\u201d Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Mr. Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive.Mr. Dorsey showed up. Mr. Page did not.As the hearing unfolded, senators excoriated Google for its absence, earning a wave of negative news coverage for Facebook\u2019s rival.Ms. Sandberg spread neatly handwritten notes on the table before her: the names of each senator on the committee, their pet questions and concerns, a reminder to say thank you.In large letters were her stage directions: \u201cSlow, Pause, Determined.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Survive the Next Era of Tech (Slow Down and Be Mindful)", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIn his final State of the Art column, Farhad Manjoo reflects on the industry\u2019s changes and presents a new guide for navigating the future of technology.At the time, technology felt thrilling and world-changing. You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d \u2014 and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder. But tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things \u2014 every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps \u2014 that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.So to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.Now the time has come to amend and update that advice \u2014 which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I\u2019m not going far: I\u2019ll be writing for The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section starting next year.)How should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.Not long ago \u2014 in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn\u2019t work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?Something strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.But ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?But you don\u2019t have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too \u2014 and for a better, healthier tech industry, it\u2019s best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.Best of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry. There are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices \u2014 so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple\u2019s service but not from Spotify. But it\u2019s precisely this sort of mischief that I\u2019m hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.One reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.The lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.That\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.Are these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful. Go slow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Fall, Wiping Out Gains for 2018", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market\u2019s gains for 2018 were erased on Tuesday, as a sell-off led by giant technology stocks continued. The renewed declines in the United States came after drops in Asia and Europe.The pain persisted for such companies on Tuesday with Apple and Amazon falling by more than 4 percent in early trading. But a new area of concern also flared after the retailer Target reported third-quarter sales and profit that missed Wall Street expectations.The softness in retail shares reflects growing investor concern that the strong American economy \u2014 which has so far shrugged off Federal Reserve interest rate increases and signs of weakness in China and Europe \u2014 is likely to face increasing challenges in 2019, as the impact of federal tax cuts and spending increases diminishes.Also weighing on stocks was a slump in crude oil prices, which hit their lowest point this year after dropping as much as 7 percent on Tuesday.Monday\u2019s slide in the United States had already spilled over into Europe and Asia before trading on Wall Street opened on Tuesday. By the end of the trading day, the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of eurozone blue-chips, had dropped more than 1.4 percent.Concerns about privacy lapses and mismanagement at technology companies weighed on stocks on Monday, adding to broader concerns about the impact of a trade war between the United States and China as well as signs of slowing growth around the globe.The pessimism continued in the Chinese markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen as the worries that hurt technology stocks in the United States hit stocks in other parts of the world.In Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, trade concerns helped to push the stocks of Chinese semiconductor makers and other big technology companies into the red. A drop in the stock price of the chip maker Nvidia several days ago after disappointing earnings may also have rattled investors in chip makers across China. The Chinese stock market is down by more than 20 percent so far this year.Shares of Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate, fell 3.3 percent in Hong Kong trading. A broader index of large Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong dropped by 1.6 percent, while the Hong Kong market closed the day down 2 percent.\u201cStocks look weak,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for Asia Pacific at the Dutch bank ING, wrote in a note to investors. \u201cOversupply in the semiconductor industry is an issue for Asia, and made worse by an apparent lack of demand for some well-known producers of high-tech products,\u201d he added.In Seoul, South Korea, and Taipei, Taiwan, the markets finished the day down nearly 1 percent.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong, Amie Tsang from London and Matt Phillips from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Google Walkout Was a Watershed Moment in Tech", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the artOutsiders have little leverage to force the industry to change. The companies\u2019 own workers are another matter.However Google responds, little at the internet search giant \u2014 and, perhaps, little in Silicon Valley \u2014 will be the same again.For two years, regulators, lawmakers, academics and the media have pushed Silicon Valley to alter its world-swallowing ways. But outsiders have few points of leverage in tech; there are few laws governing the industry\u2019s practices, and lawmakers have struggled to get up to speed on tech\u2019s implications for society. Protests by workers are an important new avenue for pressure; the very people who make these companies work can change what they do in the world. But the Google walkout suggests something bigger could be afoot. The walkout\u2019s organizers told me that they were aiming to keep that movement alive \u2014 to ask the most important questions about how their company operates in the world, and to inspire those in other parts of the tech industry to take up similar arms.\u201cSomething we\u2019ve discussed as a group, something we\u2019ve locked arms over, is that we\u2019re assembled now,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, a marketing manager at Google-owned YouTube who created the internal discussion forum in which organizers planned the walkout. \u201cWe have an incredibly engaged group of people, and we aren\u2019t going to stop escalating this,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe group isn\u2019t really going to back down from this or a host of other things. The walkout was not like a blowing-off-steam exercise.\u201dThe walkout was sparked by a specific grievance: a report in The New York Times that Google gave a $90 million exit payment to Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, after he was accused of coercing a woman to perform oral sex in a hotel room (a charge that he denies but that the company found credible). The organizers said their aims were far larger, though, than sexual harassment and abuse.\u201cOur discussions expanded very quickly,\u201d Ms. Stapleton said. \u201cWhat is it that we want the company to be, and what should we do with the power that we very quickly see we are harnessing? Is Google for good? Do we think that technology is toxic? Are we navigating through a host of complex issues online in a positive way?\u201dSpeaking to Ms. Stapleton and several of her fellow organizers, I was struck by their intoxicating optimism. They brimmed with confidence about their capacity to push for a new moral, ethical and social framework in tech. And because Google\u2019s culture is a model for the industry and much of corporate America, they saw the idea of changing the company as part of a larger social and political struggle to make a dent in the universe.\u201cI think what we did was disprove the myth that it\u2019s too hard to take collective action,\u201d said Celie O\u2019Neil-Hart, who works in YouTube\u2019s marketing department. She described the meticulous way that she and other organizers of the walkout distilled the thousands of discussions flowing through their group into a list of demands. Their secret? Google\u2019s own technology.\u201cI was getting hundreds of pieces of feedback on these demands, but ironically thanks to Google\u2019s products, like Google Groups and Docs and comments, I was able to get this constant stream of real-time feedback from a collective group of hundreds of Googlers, all while doing my day job,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neil-Hart said. She noted, too, that many Googlers had been hired for their work-endless-hours drive; now that drive was marshaled in the service of a movement.Stephanie Parker, a policy specialist at YouTube, described organizing the protest in a way that sounded to me like designing and releasing a new Google product, only with a group that was more passionate and personally invested.\u201cIt was really fun to see my fellow employees flex the skills that a lot of them had developed at Google \u2014 their program management skills, their marketing skills, their P.R. skills, but in the service of this movement,\u201d she said.A lot about the walkout was particular to Google\u2019s culture, which has always encouraged a more open form of debate than many tech peers. Companies more consumed with secrecy \u2014 Facebook, for instance, or Amazon or Apple \u2014 may be less tolerant of a large number of employees who use their tech skills to go rogue.But such a prospect is not out of the question. Tech workers have endless options when it comes to employment; the tight labor market gives them greater leeway in voicing their concerns, and the promise that their voices are valued gives them an expectation that they can effect change.\u201cI didn\u2019t think this would happen, but it\u2019s amazing to see,\u201d said Ellen Pao, a venture capitalist who sued her former firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, for sexual harassment and now works at the nonprofit group Project Include. \u201cIt\u2019s another point of pressure \u2014 maybe the most powerful one yet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd until recently, there really hasn\u2019t been much pressure at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In subsequent testing last week, The Times found that VoteWithMe no longer collected email addresses, street names and numbers, or company names. But OutVote continued to do so.

{"Headline": "In U.S.-India Trade, Trump Sees Only Harley-Davidson", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 When it comes to trade, it often seems that India and the United States are playing a perplexing game of multidimensional chess.\u201cThe sanctions threat and the tariffs are in many ways linked,\u201d said Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the school of international affairs at O. P. Jindal Global University outside New Delhi.Yet Mr. Trump has voiced little interest in such policy questions or the rounds of negotiations that have kept the two countries from an all-out trade war. Instead, he has been publicly riveted by one small pawn in the game: India\u2019s tariffs on a few hundred high-end Harley-Davidson motorcycles sold here each year.Three times this year when Mr. Trump brought up the American trade relationship with India, he complained about the import duties \u2014 currently 50 percent \u2014 that India levies on Harleys and other foreign-made motorcycles.Mr. Trump\u2019s single-minded focus on Harleys has mystified trade experts in both countries.Most of the 3,000 Harleys sold in India last year did not incur any tariffs. That\u2019s because they were cheaper, low-powered models made in a factory outside New Delhi. Even many of the fancier bikes sold here were assembled from kits of imported parts, which are taxed at 15 percent, not 50 percent.Harley-Davidson\u2019s biggest problem in India is a lack of demand.Harleys are bulky and heat up a rider\u2019s legs, making them a poor fit for the country\u2019s traffic-choked roads and sweltering climate. And they are expensive. With an average annual income of $1,700, people here overwhelmingly favor small, cheap bikes, some of which cost less than $1,000. Harley\u2019s iconic big cruisers cost more than most cars, with its top model exceeding $87,000 in Mumbai after all taxes and licensing fees.Darryl Mathias, operations manager for the Mumbai dealership, Seven Islands Harley-Davidson, said sales had dropped about 50 percent in the past two years. He blamed rising gasoline prices and the Indian government\u2019s efforts to crack down on cash transactions more than the tariffs.\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to show their wealth,\u201d he said.American officials say the president initially seized on the Harley tariffs after the Milwaukee company\u2019s chief executive, Matthew Levatich, complained to him about them. When Mr. Trump raised the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi this year, India dropped the tariffs from 75 percent to 50 percent.Harley-Davidson executives declined interview requests. In a statement, the company said it \u201csupports President Trump\u2019s efforts to lower tariffs and make American manufacturers more competitive.\u201dIndian and American government officials also declined to elaborate about the trade relationship, citing active negotiations and the pending decisions on tariffs and sanctions.For most officials in the two countries, the trade relationship is much more complicated than just motorcycles.The United States and India have been arguing over trade since the Obama administration, when they tangled over American exports of eggs and solar panels to India as well as India\u2019s weak protections for foreign intellectual property such as drug formulas.Trade hawks in the Trump administration such as Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, have made the $27.3 billion trade deficit in goods and services with India a key issue. American dairy farmers, for example, complain that they do not have fair access to India\u2019s markets because of high tariffs and India\u2019s requirement that all milk comes from cows that have not been fed the internal organs of other animals. That milk certification is important to Hindus, many of whom are vegetarians, but many American farmers cannot meet it.\u201cWe need to have reciprocal trade,\u201d Gilbert B. Kaplan, the American under secretary of commerce for international trade, said at a conference hosted by the U.S.-India Business Council here in September.This year, India irked American companies by increasing tariffs on products ranging from shoes to mobile phones to help balance its budget and stem a fall in the value of the rupee.Separately, the country announced that it would raise tariffs on 29 categories of American goods, including nuts, apples and finished metal products, in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs.The items targeted influential industries such as almond growers, who last year shipped $651 million of the nuts to India, their largest market. But India deferred the start of the tariffs from June to September and then to Nov. 2. The government may well delay the tariffs again, Mr. Chaulia said, to assess the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections in the United States and what effect that would have on the American negotiating position.India, for its part, wants the United States to reduce tariffs on its exports of clothing and textiles, for which it pays higher duties than neighboring countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan. The Modi administration is also adamant about maintaining its hefty subsidies for homegrown agricultural products to court Indian farmers, who are a key voting bloc.Looming over everything are geopolitical concerns.In addition to continuing oil purchases from Iran, Mr. Modi signed a deal with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, on Oct. 5 to buy Russian S-400 antiaircraft missile systems. The $5.2 billion purchase violates American trade sanctions against Russia and will eventually trigger penalties for India unless Mr. Trump approves a waiver.Trade experts predict that neither country will be quick to antagonize the other.\u201cUnder no circumstance would the Indian government give up its close relationship with the U.S. government,\u201d said Biswajit Dhar, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi who has represented the Indian government on trade issues and formerly served on the board of the Export-Import Bank of India.Mr. Chaulia said India was also clear about its economic commitment to Iran. India has invested heavily there, including hundreds of millions of dollars in the seaport of Chabahar in southeastern Iran. The Trump administration wants a regime change in Iran \u2014 and India does not, he said.Eliminating the Harley tariffs is a way to ease the trade drama and please the American president, Mr. Chaulia said. \u201cAll Trump needs is to declare a win,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about the nitty-gritty.\u201dAlan Rappeport and Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington, and Maria Abi-Habib from New Delhi.

That was the future Silicon Valley\u2019s greatest claim to fame in the 1920s, when it was a sleepy landscape of fruit orchards and farms far removed from the nation\u2019s industrial might. Seattle was a city of fishing and timber, where a young entrepreneur named Bill Boeing had so few customers for his airplanes that he briefly pivoted to making furniture. The most innovative companies in the world clustered in the ferociously inventive cities of the East and Midwest \u2014 cars in Detroit; cash registers in Dayton, Ohio; light bulbs in Cleveland.The high-tech geography began to flip in the 1950s, as electronics and aerospace boomed. Before the Eisenhower era was over, cities across the country and across the globe had started racing to capture some of the West Coast\u2019s high-tech magic. Silicon Valley and Seattle are now a long way from biplanes and prunes.So what can the new HQ2 city or cities learn from high-tech history?First and foremost: Yes, tech companies are a prize worth chasing. They offer jobs that are well-paying and productive, and attract a highly educated work force. Under the right conditions \u2014 the presence of strong research universities, access to capital and a quality of life that draws people in and keeps them there \u2014 a well-rooted tech community can seed several successive generations of companies, with the entrepreneurs of one era becoming mentors and investors and civic philanthropists in the next.This is what happened in Boston, in Silicon Valley and in Seattle, whose tech scene includes not only Amazon and Microsoft but also a wide variety of spinoff companies, as well as Facebook, Google, Alibaba and Baidu.San Francisco and Seattle were ill prepared for the tech wave that hit in the past decade. Current responses range from the promising but piecemeal (Amazon subsidizing additional city bus service in Seattle) to the impractical and divisive (San Francisco considering a ban on employee cafeterias in new office buildings to force tech workers to patronize local restaurants). Although tech companies and cities often find themselves fiercely opposed in these debates \u2014 most hotly in the recent attempt by Seattle to tax large employers like Amazon to pay for homeless services \u2014 there is some recognition on both sides that the current patterns are unsustainable.This means breaking out of the bubble and redefining the corporate bottom line to include measures that reduce inequality, sustain existing small businesses and protect housing affordability, and, yes, even supporting cities in raising the tax revenue they need.This isn\u2019t an impossible dream. The secret of Silicon Valley wasn\u2019t tax breaks and cheap real estate; it was a postwar era of generous public spending on research and education, as well as on affordable housing and public infrastructure. These investments were designed to help everyone, but they were critical to helping tech flourish.No place or industry rules forever. Ask Detroit, once the most innovative place in America. The new capitals of tech should not take this prosperity for granted.Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Mark Zuckerberg Became Too Big to Fail", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the artFacebook has had a turbulent two years. But almost no one in tech thinks Mr. Zuckerberg, the social network\u2019s chief executive, should step down from the company he built. I\u2019ll spare you the suspense. Just about everyone thought Mr. Zuckerberg was still the right man for the job, if not the only man for the job. This included people who currently work at Facebook, people who used to work at Facebook, financial analysts, venture capitalists, tech-skeptic activists, ardent critics of the company and its giddiest supporters.The consensus went like this: Even if Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 as Facebook\u2019s founder, chief executive, chairman and most powerful shareholder \u2014 bore most of the responsibility for the company\u2019s cataclysmic recent history, he alone possessed the stature to fix it. More than one of his supporters told me it was bad faith to even broach the subject \u2014 that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s indispensability was so plain that the only reason I might have to ask whether he should still run the company was the clicks I would get on this article. But even critics were not that excited about the idea of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s removal. Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, an organization that fights monopoly power, argued that Facebook\u2019s problems grew out of its business model and the legal and regulatory vacuum in which it has operated \u2014 not the man who runs it.\u201cTo be blunt, if we took Mark Zuckerberg out and we replaced him with Mahatma Gandhi, I don\u2019t think the corporation would change in any significant way,\u201d Mr. Lynn said.That few can imagine a Facebook without Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, underscores how unaccountable our largest tech companies have become. Mr. Zuckerberg, thanks to his own drive and brilliance, has become one of the most powerful unelected people in the world. Like an errant oil company or sugar-pumping food company, Facebook makes decisions that create huge consequences for society \u2014 and he has profited handsomely from the chaos.Yet because of Facebook\u2019s ownership structure \u2014 in which Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s shares have 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares \u2014 he is omnipotent there, answering basically to no one. This fits a pattern. Over the last two decades, the largest tech companies have created a system in which executives suffer few personal or financial consequences for their mistakes. Big tech has turned founders into fixtures \u2014 when their companies are working well, they get all the credit, and when their companies are doing badly, they are the only heroes who can fix them.There\u2019s another way to put this: For better or worse, Mr. Zuckerberg has become too big to fail.In America, it\u2019s not unusual for executives to escape punishment for how they steer their corporations (see Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis). Still, when companies step in it badly, there are often at least calls for their leaders\u2019 dismissal. The chief executives of Equifax and Target were pushed out after data breaches. The chief executive of Wells Fargo was ousted after a scandal involving sham accounts. Facebook\u2019s problems have not reached the level of lawlessness we saw at Uber, but they have been far more consequential. Besides the breach, Facebook has been implicated in a global breakdown of democracy, including its role as a vector for Russian disinformation during the 2016 American presidential election. If Facebook admits now that its problems were caused by a too-idealistic, move-fast culture, and if it is conceding now that its culture must change, how can we be sure that\u2019s happening if most of the people who run Facebook remain the same?When I asked Facebook about this, the company argued that things were changing. It just hired Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister of Britain, as head of global affairs \u2014 a move that the company said imbued it with a serious outsider\u2019s perspective.The social network also put me on the phone with a top executive who argued boisterously for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership, but declined to do so on the record. The executive explained that fixing Facebook would involve deep costs. The company is hiring more people to review content, for example, and it might have to slow down some of its most ambitious projects to address its impact on the world. The executive argued that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s total domination of Facebook\u2019s equity, plus the reverence in which employees hold him, allowed him to weather the financial consequences of these changes better than any other leader.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s supporters also argued that he has shown a deep capacity to understand and address Facebook\u2019s problems. After the company went public in 2012, its stock price languished for months because it had no plan to make money from consumers\u2019 shift to mobile devices.\u201cMark would tell you that he was too late in understanding the importance of mobile \u2014 but when that became apparent, Mark understood its gravity and he understood how to fix it,\u201d said Don Graham, a former Facebook board member and former publisher of The Washington Post. \u201cHe changed the direction of that company incredibly fast, in detail, not by one action but by 20 actions \u2014 and if you looked at the quarter-by-quarter numbers of what percentage of Facebook\u2019s revenue was coming from mobile, I couldn\u2019t believe how fast it changed.\u201dThe question at Facebook now is whether Mr. Zuckerberg has similarly seen the light on its current problems. He has said fixing Facebook was his personal challenge for 2018. But there are signs that its culture remains the same. \u201cI think he has demonstrably failed over the last two years, and the reason he\u2019s failed is because he\u2019s unaccountable,\u201d said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee who is now chief strategy officer for the Center of Humane Technology, an activist organization. \u201cGiven a scenario where shareholders and board members had more influence, it\u2019s hard to imagine that there would not have been changes faster.\u201d\u201cI think by taking the step to relinquish the position of the board chair, it\u2019s a very important structural change so that he would not have a completely free hand to muscle his way through decisions,\u201d said Jonas Kron, a Trillium senior vice president.A Facebook spokesman said the company had not yet taken a position on the resolution. In the past, similar measures have been voted down by Mr. Zuckerberg and his allies. Which leaves us here: Either Mr. Zuckerberg fixes Facebook, or no one does. That\u2019s the choice we face, like it or not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turbulent Stock Market Is Flashing a Warning About the Economy", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment is near lows not seen in half a century. The American economy is set for its best year since 2005. Large corporations are producing giant profits. Even wages are starting to rise.And the stock markets are a mess.On Tuesday, the S&P 500-stock index turned negative for the year, stoking fears that one of the longest bull markets in history could be at risk.The stock market\u2019s struggles may seem incongruous against the backdrop of strong economic growth. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data.In recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that President Trump\u2019s global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits. Commodities and the companies that depend on them have been pummeled by the prospect of weaker demand should the global economy slow. Five tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix \u2014 have shed more than $800 billion in market value since the end of August, the fallout from slowing growth and regulatory scrutiny.The S&P 500 closed on Tuesday at 2,641.89, down 1.8 percent. Other markets also flashed warnings, with oil dropping by 6.8 percent, falling deeper into bear territory.The pressure eased on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 rising about half a percent in early trading after Asian markets ended the day largely positive and shares in Britain, France and Germany began the day higher.The sell-off doesn\u2019t mean the United States is headed into a recession. The stock market suffered several sharp stumbles in recent years before climbing to new highs on the back of booming corporate profits and strong economic growth.But the recent market drop could portend problems. In 2018, a hefty dose of fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax cuts, allowed the United States to shake off the growth worries in China, Europe and the rest of the world. It won\u2019t have the same potency next year, leaving the American economy and stocks more vulnerable to a range of risks, including a slowing global economy and continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\u201cI think there are very clear signs that investors are beginning to worry about weaker growth in the coming year or so, and how that\u2019s going to feed through to corporate earnings,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.Mr. Trump, on Tuesday, pointed to the health of the economy and instead blamed the Fed for contributing to the sell-off. Mr. Trump, who has taken credit for the rising stock market, has been critical of the rate increases, saying they undermine growth.\u201cI would like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the rate is too high.\u201dUntil recently, investors were willing to ignore the domestic political dramas, geopolitical turmoil and other issues clouding the outlook for American companies. Now they appear jittery, selling stocks at small signs that vague risks may become realities.So far this year, strong growth and deep corporate tax cuts have supercharged corporate profits. Once all the results are tallied up, the third-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up more than 28 percent from a year earlier \u2014 outpacing previous quarters, according to the financial data company Refinitiv.But those numbers haven\u2019t satisfied the markets. Investors have instead grown concerned about risks they face both from continued economic strength and, alternatively, an economic slowdown. Either path could upend a nearly decade-long rally that has lifted the S&P 500 nearly 300 percent.Strong economic growth at home would most likely mean a prolonged rise in interest rates and rising costs in areas like wages, which would hurt corporate profitability. Weaker growth abroad would cut into sales.In recent days, both forms of fear have fed the market decline.On Tuesday, shares of the retailer Target dropped by more than 10 percent, on worries that rising costs \u2014 from increased wages to higher prices for the Chinese goods facing tariffs \u2014 could continue to crimp profits. Investors also dumped shares of Kohl\u2019s and TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, which both saw freight costs eat into earnings.Apple continued its slide on worries about softening demand. The tech giant tumbled 4.8 percent after Goldman Sachs equity analysts cut their price target, citing deteriorating demand, especially in China.China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil, has also been weighing on commodities. The price of crude, now just above $53 a barrel, has fallen nearly 30 percent since early October. On Tuesday, energy was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500, with companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and the oil-field services provider Schlumberger losing more than 2.5 percent.Oil prices have been sliding despite signs that major producers like Saudi Arabia are considering cutting production. And that has amplified worries that China and the rest of the global economy may be in a weaker spot than markets realized.Last quarter, China\u2019s growth slowed to its lowest level since 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis. Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, is also looking shaky, with the economy contracting in the third quarter, amid a slowdown in trade and investment.Germany, the powerhouse behind Europe, also shrank unexpectedly during the third quarter as trade slumped and car production faltered. If Germany stumbles, it will add to the economic and political turmoil in a region already dealing with Britain\u2019s chaotic exit from the European Union and Italy\u2019s budget dispute with the bloc.In 2018, America\u2019s economy proved largely immune to such issues. But the global slowdown could eventually spill over into the United States, particularly as the impact of this year\u2019s tax cuts fades in the coming years. Economists expect that domestic growth, which is close to 3 percent this year, will slow to 2 percent by 2020, according to estimates published by FactSet.For the economy, that is a respectable performance. But for investors, a slowdown is likely to be uncomfortable.Disappointing data and earnings updates could ignite periodic panics over the threat of recession, even if remote. Markets are likely to be much choppier that than they\u2019ve been in recent years. Gains could be lower.In other words, the market may be messy for a while.\u201cI think this is what a low-return environment starts to feel like,\u201d said Joe Davis, chief economist with Vanguard. \u201cThe past five years, although entirely welcome from an investment standpoint, is clearly unsustainable.\u201dClifford Krauss and Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Tried Facebook\u2019s New Portal Device (So You Don\u2019t Have To)", "Date": "2018-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what happened when two Times tech reporters installed Facebook\u2019s new Portal video-calling gadgets in their bedrooms.So we \u2014 Mike Isaac and Farhad Manjoo, two technology writers for The New York Times \u2014 took the $199 and $349 devices for a test run over the last week to see if they could make us feel more connected to each other. We both installed the Portal, which starts shipping on Thursday, in our homes (our bedrooms, to be exact). The devices are video-calling machines that people can use to talk through a screen to other Facebook users. They have a 12-megapixel camera with high-definition video and artificial intelligence software; the camera follows people about as they move around. Were we worried about what these always-on devices might collect on us? Here\u2019s how it played out.So I have to say, waking up next to you in my bedroom was, uh, quite an experience. I put my Portal Plus on the desk that sits bedside. The screen saver cycled through my photo albums on Facebook and Instagram \u2014 and also occasionally your face.What was your experience like initially? The unboxing process was funny to me. It felt like an Apple design moment; every piece of plastic and \u201cpull here\u201d tab was carefully placed, with the intentionality that Apple usually saves for its device packaging, but with a very Facebook-y twist on things. There was an iconic Facebook thumb on my power cord holder, for example.Setting up my Portal Plus was easy. Popped the thing out of the box, plopped it on my desk, plugged it in, connected to Wi-Fi and my Facebook account. From there, I think, I called you almost immediately.The great thing about these devices is that they are stationary and always on. When you want to call someone, you just tell it to call the person \u2014 no looking for your phone, no holding the phone while you chat. It all just works with a single utterance. (Everything old is new: These devices are like landlines!)The problem with Amazon\u2019s Echo Show is its fixed viewing angle \u2014 if you don\u2019t have it pointed exactly at you, it\u2019s hard to have a conversation. My kids, who use the Show to call my parents, are always fighting with each other about who gets to stand right in front of the screen.The Portal solves that problem in a neat way: It uses software to follow you around a room, always keeping the speaker in frame and cropped. I found this very useful.I will also admit I loved the augmented reality lenses, a flourish Facebook is adding to pretty much all of its camera-based apps. Just like Snapchat, I can choose a filter that turns my face into a werewolf, or stick a (live) cat on my head as a hat. Cat-as-a-Hat: a goofy gimmick worthy of Dr. Seuss \u2014 but it works!Facebook also went out of its way to let us know that all video chats are encrypted, and the company does not store the contents of the calls, nor does it listen in on them. But even that wasn\u2019t enough for me! Whenever I wasn\u2019t using the Portal, I unplugged it. I turned the camera around to face the window looking over the back yard. I would periodically check to make sure all lights or microphones were off when I took a phone call or text.I don\u2019t think he believes that anymore, and Facebook has been working to improve how users can manage their private data on the platform. Still, if you\u2019re going to choose between a calling device made by Facebook and one made by Amazon or Apple, you wouldn\u2019t be crazy to discount Facebook\u2019s device because of its business model and history.All that said, a lot of people are just fine with the level of insight Facebook has into their lives. If you already chat and call on Facebook Messenger on your phone, then chatting and calling from Portal isn\u2019t putting you in any greater danger.Portal is better than the Show at making calls, and for a first piece of hardware, it\u2019s quite impressive. But it\u2019s still a device of fairly limited functionality \u2014 a well-designed luxury at this point.I guess we\u2019ll always have our Slack chats.Advertisement"}

Liars?", "Date": "2018-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 Things We\u2019d Really Like to KnowFor better and worse, humans are only improving their ability to deceive themselves with technology.During the summer before the 2016 presidential election, John Seymour and Philip Tully, two researchers with ZeroFOX, a security company in Baltimore, unveiled a new kind of Twitter bot. By analyzing patterns of activity on the social network, the bot learned to fool users into clicking on links in tweets that led to potentially hazardous sites.The bot, called SNAP_R, was an automated \u201cphishing\u201d system, capable of homing in on the whims of specific individuals and coaxing them toward that moment when they would inadvertently download spyware onto their machines. \u201cArchaeologists believe they\u2019ve found the tomb of Alexander the Great is in the U.S. for the first time: goo.gl/KjdQYT,\u201d the bot tweeted at one unsuspecting user.Even with the odd grammatical misstep, SNAP_R succeeded in eliciting a click as often as 66 percent of the time, on par with human hackers who craft phishing messages by hand.A neural network can learn to recognize a dog by gleaning patterns from thousands of dog photos. It can learn to identify spoken words by sifting through old tech-support calls.And, as the two researchers showed, a neural network can learn to write phishing messages by inspecting tweets, Reddit posts, and previous online hacks.And a few we\u2019d rather not discuss\u201cIt would be very surprising if things don\u2019t go this way,\u201d said Shahar Avin, a researcher at the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. \u201cAll the trends point in that direction.\u201dExperts have long had the power to doctor audio and video. But as these A.I. systems improve, it will become easier and cheaper for anyone to generate items of digital content \u2014 images, videos, social interactions \u2014 that look and sound like the real thing.Inspired by the culture of academia, the top A.I. labs and even giant public companies such as Google openly publish their research and, in many cases, their software code.With these techniques, machines are also learning to read and write. For years, experts questioned whether neural networks could crack the code of natural language. But the tide has shifted in recent months.This technology could improve phishing bots such as SNAP_R. Today, most Twitter bots seem like bots, especially when you start replying to them. In the future, they will respond in kind.Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, can see a not-too-distant future in which governments create machine-learning systems that attempt to radicalize populations in other countries, or force views onto their own people.\u201cThis is a new kind of societal control or propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernments can start to create campaigns that target individuals, but at the same time operate across many people in parallel, with a larger objective.\u201dIdeally, artificial intelligence could also provide ways of identifying and stopping this kind of mass manipulation. Mark Zuckerberg likes to talk about the possibilities. But for the foreseeable future, we face a machine-learning arms race.Consider generative adversarial networks, or GANs. These are a pair of neural network systems that can automatically generate convincing images or manipulate existing ones.The second network does its best not to be fooled. As the pair battle, the image only gets more convincing \u2014 the A.I. trying to detect fakery always loses.Detecting fake news is even harder. Humans can barely agree on what counts as fake news; how can we expect a machine to do so? And if it could, would we want it to?Perhaps the only way to stop misinformation is to somehow teach people to view what they see online with extreme distrust. But that may be the hardest fix of them all.\u201cWe can deploy technology that patches our computer systems,\u201d Mr. Avin said. \u201cBut we cannot deploy patches to peoples\u2019 heads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Widely considered friendly with the tech industry, Mr. Khanna criticized Facebook on Friday for its aggressive tactics, and said the company should \u201ccertainly fire the people who were in any way involved in the decision to peddle opposition research.\u201dThe clash intensified on Friday when four Democratic senators wrote to the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to provide more details about Facebook\u2019s lobbying activities. The lawmakers also raised a potentially more explosive issue: whether Facebook had ever used its own data and platform against critics.\u201cWe need to know if Facebook, or any entity affiliated with or hired by Facebook, ever used any of the vast financial and data resources available to them to retaliate against their critics, including elected officials who were scrutinizing them,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of the Democrats who wrote the letter.\u201cAs more and more information comes out about how these guys operate, it\u2019s becoming conventional wisdom among Democrats that there is a serious policy problem here,\u201d said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated.\u201cThese companies are not credible,\u201d Mr. Stoller added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s becoming clear to Democrats that they aren\u2019t friends \u2014 they are the problem.\u201dFacebook cut ties with the opposition research firm this past week even as executives there denied acting improperly.\u201dOur strategy was to shore up the security on Facebook and make major investments there,\u201d said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, in an interview with CBS on Friday. \u201cIt was not what I was doing, nor was it the company\u2019s strategy, to deflect, to deny or to hire P.R. firms to do things.\u201dBut Facebook and other tech companies now face increasing criticism from within their own ranks. In an interview, Marc Benioff, the billionaire co-founder of the software company Salesforce and a major donor to Democratic causes, said his industry faced \u201ca tension between trust and growth.\u201d\u201cThese companies are going to have to recognize that they have to change,\u201d Mr. Benioff added. \u201cAnd the C.E.O.s have to change. And if they don\u2019t change, those C.E.O.s will be removed by boards and by shareholders.\u201dNo Democrat embodies the tensions between tech and Washington like Mr. Schumer himself. In 2011, he joined Ms. Sandberg to announce the opening of the company\u2019s first East Coast engineering office, in New York City, where he had worked to promote start-ups and other tech businesses.In 2015, Ms. Sandberg co-hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Schumer in her Bay Area home, according to a Facebook employee briefed on the event. (The same trip featured a Schumer fund-raiser held by Bruce Sewell, then Apple\u2019s general counsel, and attended by Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, according to an executive who declined to be named.).By the end of the 2016 cycle, Mr. Schumer had raised more money from Facebook employees than any other Washington lawmaker. All told, Senate Democrats have benefited from over $3 million in political contributions from Facebook\u2019s employees and founders over the years.Relations began to cool after the 2016 elections, when evidence mounted that Facebook and YouTube had become fertile ground for foreign interference and domestic misinformation, threatening not only the party\u2019s values but also its electoral prospects.Early last year, Senator Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat, walked over to the Capitol to deliver a warning to Mr. Schumer, newly elected as Democratic minority leader.Mr. Tester\u2019s warning grabbed the attention of Mr. Schumer and other Democrats, who began to press Facebook and other social media companies to fix the problem.Disinformation was a particular focus for Mr. Schumer, according to an aide with knowledge of the senator\u2019s thinking. In March last year, Mr. Schumer summoned Adam Mosseri, then a vice president overseeing Facebook\u2019s News Feed feature, for a briefing on how the company would limit the spread of bogus news and propaganda. He later sent two aides to Silicon Valley to keep pressure on executives at Facebook, Google and Twitter.But as it became clear that the companies had understated their problems \u2014 and were moving slowly to fix them \u2014 the senator steered a middle course. When he and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, unveiled the party\u2019s \u201cBetter Deal\u201d platform for the midterm elections, a proposal to attack \u201ccorporate monopolies\u201d focused on airlines, beer companies and eyeglass makers.\u201cI am more sympathetic because I think they\u2019re in very difficult position and I worry about government regulation,\u201d he said.Mr. Warner\u2019s growing focus on privacy concerns led to a clash with Mr. Schumer, who confronted Mr. Warner in July, The Times reported this week, warning him to back off Facebook.Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said that the senator \u201cworried that Facebook would bow to pressure from Republicans, who oppose the purging of the fake accounts and bots, and has urged Senator Warner and the Senate Intelligence Committee to make this the priority in their ongoing investigation of the company.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important for Facebook to recognize that this isn\u2019t a public relations problem \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental challenge for the platform and their business model,\u201d Mr. Warner said.Facebook previously signaled that it was ready to work with Mr. Warner and others in Congress on new regulation.

{"Headline": "Apple Raises Prices, and Profits Keep Booming", "Date": "2018-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since Apple introduced the iPhone 11 years ago, smartphones have become ubiquitous, and the market for them is saturated. To maintain growth, Apple has employed a shrewd strategy: Charge more for the devices.Journalists and analysts have explained how Apple is doing that by dividing the number of iPhones sold in a given quarter into the revenue Apple earns from them to calculate the average selling price.That\u2019s not going to be so easy anymore.Apple said Thursday that it sold about as many iPhones in the latest quarter as it did a year earlier but that iPhone revenue rose 29 percent. That was because customers paid nearly 29 percent more for the devices. (The average selling price is now $793.)The price increase helped propel Apple\u2019s profits 32 percent higher, to $14.13 billion.But after those figures were reported, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call that the company would no longer disclose how many iPhones, iPads or Mac computers it sold. As a result, journalists and analysts will no longer be able to track how Apple\u2019s swelling prices are improving its profits.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, explained the rationale with an analogy: \u201cIf you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier \u2014 and she says or he says, \u2018How many units do you have in there?\u2019 \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what\u2019s in the cart.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein, said Apple was trying to shift investors\u2019 attention away from the number of devices it sold. \u201cCompanies always try to put their best foot forward,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir best foot doesn\u2019t appear to be iPhone unit growth.\u201dAnother wildly profitable quarter for Apple showed its business has mostly avoided the turbulence that has roiled its Silicon Valley peers. Facebook, Google and Twitter have faced questions about their influence in the spread of disinformation and the proliferation of hate speech.Apple has tried to separate itself from other tech giants by trumpeting that it values its customers\u2019 privacy and hires people to curate its services rather than relying on computer algorithms. The company responded to criticism about the addictive nature of its smartphones by adding tools for people to track their time spent on them.Last month, Apple released its most expensive iPhone ever, the XS Max, which starts at $1,100. On Tuesday, it raised the starting price of its iPad Pro to $800 from $650 and of its MacBook Air to $1,200 from $1,000, while also making the devices faster and more powerful.Apple\u2019s strategy has worked for more than iPhones. Apple said that it sold 5.3 million Mac computers in the quarter, down 2 percent from a year ago, but that its revenues from Mac sales rose 3 percent to a record $7.4 billion. That was because customers paid nearly $1,400 on average for a Mac, up 5 percent from a year earlier.Apple\u2019s overall revenue increased nearly 20 percent in the quarter to $62.9 billion.Apple\u2019s other bet to maintain growth is its services business, which includes its cut of app sales and revenue from its own apps, like Apple Music, among other things. Services revenue rose 17 percent to nearly $10 billion in the quarter.Some analysts were concerned about Apple\u2019s prospects in China, where sales fell sharply several years ago. But revenues in the quarter there rose 16 percent from a year earlier.Apple\u2019s share price was down more than 6 percent in after-hours trading Thursday, likely because of its plans to stop reporting unit sales and because its revenue guidance for the current quarter was \u201clighter than expectations,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Advertisement"}

Shares of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, are down more than 10 percent since the market peaked, while Facebook and Amazon have dropped more than 20 percent.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing extreme selling in the only favored area that everybody ran to,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a slowdown underway globally,\u201d said James Bianco, president of financial market research firm Bianco Research in Chicago. \u201cThe U.S. has definitely been stronger than the rest of the world. But the fear is, that can\u2019t hold. If the rest of the world slows down, that will eventually slow us, too.\u201dThe potential for higher borrowing costs is also weighing on smaller companies that often borrow money by issuing floating rate debt, which can become more difficult to pay off as interest rates rise. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks is down 14 percent from its high. \u201cThis is simply a continuation of the recent repricing of risk, or growth scare, that we\u2019ve basically been seeing since the end of September,\u201d said Talley Leger, an equity strategist with Oppenheimer Funds. When the stock market hit its peak in September, technology had led the way, accounting for 50 percent of the gains for the year. The tech giants, at first, seemed immune to the sell-off that followed on broader economic worries. Not anymore. Through Friday, roughly a quarter of the market\u2019s decline since September was because of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet, according to data collected by S&P Capital IQ. The sharp sell-off on Monday will only add to that tally. Investors appear especially focused on any signs that extraordinary profits generated by these giant tech companies are under threat. Whether technology stocks can slough off the worries will depend, in part, on whether the companies can continue to deliver strong earnings growth even if the global economy does soften significantly. Recent earnings reports from major tech companies have done little to reassure investors. Since Apple\u2019s share price peaked at just over $232 on Oct. 3, the stock has plummeted by nearly 20 percent, lopping more than $200 billion off the company\u2019s market value. Its shares were down nearly 4 percent Monday.Amazon reported a slowdown in its core retail revenue growth in late October, sending the shares lower. To investors, who often view revenue numbers as a good gauge of the strength of demand in the economy, that was more important than the $2.9 billion in profit the company reported.But if they actually produce the numbers that Wall Street analysts expect, the recent slump in large technology stocks could present a buying opportunity for some investors. Key valuation measures of Apple and Alphabet hit multiyear highs this summer. But the recent drop has left those valuations substantially lower. Prices of Facebook and Amazon are relatively low compared with expected profits, meaning these stocks look \u201ccheap\u201d for certain investors. But they might have to get even cheaper before investors are tempted to snap them up. That\u2019s why some expect the sentiment in the market to get much worse before stocks can resume their climb. \u201cI\u2019m sort of looking for a little more bearishness,\u201d said King Lip, chief strategist at the wealth management company Baker Avenue. An earlier version of this article misstated which company Alphabet is the parent company of. It is Google, not Apple.Advertisement"}

Jack Nicas, who covers Apple, relies on some old-school methods.How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jack Nicas, a technology reporter for The Times in San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You write about Apple and other Silicon Valley companies. What are your most important tools for reporting?Reporting is not typically sexy. We spend a lot of time sending emails, leaving voice mail messages, chasing dead ends and trying to persuade people to tell us stuff they shouldn\u2019t. We don\u2019t have any shiny gadgets you see in spy movies. Some of my most reliable reporting tools are a pen and paper.Arguably my most interesting gadget for a time was a flip phone I bought from Target. Burner phones are great for talking to paranoid sources, contacting unsavory characters or trying to reach people who are screening my calls. But now, of course, there\u2019s an app for that. It\u2019s called Burner and it lets you make calls and send texts with different phone numbers. I can even pick the area code so my subject thinks I\u2019m calling from nearby, just like the spammers! (We have a lot in common, some people say.) For sensitive communications, I still use Signal, the encrypted messaging and calling app.I record some interviews with TapeACall Pro, an app that requires dialing in a third number that records the call\u2019s audio. But because that can store the audio in the cloud, for sensitive calls I revert to a tangled setup that involves a decade-old Olympus WS-400S voice recorder, headphones and an auxiliary cord. That keeps the audio on a recorder that never connects to the internet. For particularly sensitive conversations, I ditch all of that and try to meet in person.If I had to choose one favorite old-school reporting technology though, I\u2019d pick the doorbell.When has going door to door helped with your reporting? And when did it not work out so well?When I covered crime in Boston and Florida, I typically knocked on doors to find families and friends of victims. That often led to harrowing but fruitful interviews. Now I\u2019m usually trying to find people who don\u2019t want to be found \u2014 and that sometimes means I\u2019m not well received.That was the case on one of my first door-knocking experiences. My professor at Boston University, Dick Lehr, a longtime investigative reporter, took me under his wing to examine a 30-year-old questionable arson murder conviction. We showed up to the apartment of the man we suspected had actually started the fire in question. He was home, and appeared to be on drugs. We were invited in and, as we questioned where he was the night of the crime, we eyed a large knife on his table. When he became belligerent because I began writing, we left.In a past life you covered Google. Now you cover Apple. So, iPhone or Android?I\u2019ve had both and have a controversial opinion: They\u2019re basically the same. (Apple will not like this answer.) The top phones for either operating system are excellent, easy-to-use devices with virtually the same features and apps. The biggest difference is the business model.How so?Apple makes money by selling consumers expensive iPhones. Google makes money by giving away its Android software and services \u2014 and then charging advertisers for access to the billions of users it attracts.Google\u2019s approach has given it enormous data about the world and its inhabitants. Google is well positioned to use its mass collection of personal data for new products, like artificial intelligence, but it also draws new scrutiny to the company.Apple\u2019s less data-focused approach has allowed it to take the high road on privacy. That strategy has potentially insulated the company from regulations and public scorn, but it also could leave Apple with dumber products than its rivals.Internet trolls have targeted you for your coverage. What happened and how did you fend them off?I wrote a series of articles when I previously worked for The Wall Street Journal about problems with YouTube\u2019s algorithms that led the company to make changes that affected some YouTube video creators. One YouTube star accused me of doctoring evidence, and thousands then descended on my Twitter account and flooded my email inbox with hate mail and death threats.While Journal security and I monitored the attacks for any credible threats, I found a very effective approach to frustrating the trolls: ignore them. Their oxygen is attention, so when they realized I wasn\u2019t going to respond or get upset, they moved along.Outside of work, what tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with? \u201cThanks,\u201d it replies. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Facebook, Apple and Amazon have endured the greatest declines, all down $250 billion or more from their respective peaks.That is a marked reversal for one of the most popular trades on Wall Street. Investors piled into shares of the largest tech companies, betting their revenue would continue to grow strongly as these behemoths upended industries from retail to communication to media.By the end of August, the market value of Apple and Amazon had each surpassed $1 trillion, and Alphabet was flirting with $900 billion. The combined market value of the five had reached $3.6 trillion.But worries about global economic growth as well as lackluster earnings and outlooks the past two quarters have shaken investors\u2019 confidence. In particular, concerns have mounted about how many new iPhones Apple will manage to sell. Facebook has spent much of the year mired in scandal, raising the specter that the United States government will tighten regulation of big tech. All of that has investors questioning whether the values of these big tech companies have become too lofty.Of course, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet have faced steep sell-offs before, only to bounce back quickly. Just this year, the combined market value of those five companies has tumbled 7 percent or more during three separate periods. In each instance, the stocks resumed their march to fresh highs within weeks.The question now, though, is whether this time will be different.An earlier version of this article misstated the combined market value of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet at the end of August. It was $3.6 trillion, not $3.6 billion.Advertisement"}
