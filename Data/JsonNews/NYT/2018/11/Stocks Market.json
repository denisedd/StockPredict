Risks Repeating History", "Date": "2018-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsLarry Culp is only six weeks into his job as the head of General Electric, but he has already fallen into a familiar pattern.The chief executive of the $70 billion conglomerate said on Monday that he was looking to accelerate asset sales to reduce the company\u2019s debt. But other problems, like G.E.\u2019s troubled power business, still aren\u2019t close to being solved. Mr. Culp may have been trying to stop G.E.\u2019s share price slide; instead he exacerbated it.Mr. Culp\u2019s sudden appointment last month as the first outsider to lead the conglomerate in its 126-year history looked a lot like what G.E. needed. His record building up the conglomerate Danaher between 2000 and 2014 suggested that he could provide fresh thinking. G.E.\u2019s woes go back decades, though, including determined expansion into financial services and former boss Jeff Immelt\u2019s $11 billion purchase of France\u2019s Alstom in 2015, just as demand for gas-fired electricity-generating turbines peaked. Unwinding those problems will take time.Mr. Culp could use some early wins, but there might not be any.Selling G.E.\u2019s 62.5 percent stake in the oil-services company Baker Hughes sounds fairly straightforward. But the recent weakness in oil prices and disappointing third-quarter earnings have knocked a quarter off its market value since June, including a small decline after Mr. Culp\u2019s comments on Monday. G.E.\u2019s health care business, which is also on the chopping block, continues to grow revenue at a single-digit percent rate, but arranging an initial public offering, which Mr. Culp hinted at Monday, could take the better part of a year.All of which suggests that it will take time to whittle down the $46.3 billion of debt attached to G.E.\u2019s industrial businesses. The company\u2019s operations consumed more cash than they generated in the first nine months of this year, and executives acknowledge that they are likely to miss net debt reduction targets set by Mr. Culp\u2019s immediate predecessor John Flannery.Under its previous bosses, G.E. demolished its credibility with investors by repeatedly missing targets and failing to draw a clear line under its problems. Mr. Culp, who has already overseen a $22 billion write-down of G.E.\u2019s accounting good will, should be wary of doing the same. After his remarks on Monday knocked over 6 percent off its shares, G.E. now has a slightly smaller market capitalization than Danaher \u2014 a company with revenue just one-sixth the size.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Evelyn Y. Davis, Shareholder Scourge of C.E.O.s, Dies at 89", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvelyn Y. Davis, who spent more than 50 years haranguing American executives at shareholder meetings as she pushed companies to be more frugal and transparent, died on Sunday in Washington. She was 89.A spokesman for her charitable foundation confirmed the death, at a hospital, but did not specify the cause.Ms. Davis, who lived in Washington, spent much of each spring traveling to New York, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh and other cities to attend the annual meetings of numerous public companies in which she was an investor.One of a handful of well-known corporate gadflies, she often cut a distinctive figure, appearing in costumes that she thought would underscore her messages to company leaders. For an American Broadcasting Company meeting in 1966, not long after the network\u2019s campy series \u201cBatman\u201d had its premiere, she wore a Batman mask; for a meeting of U.S. Steel shareholders in 1968, she wore an aluminum dress.Her comments regularly drew catcalls, laughter, groans or shouts \u2014 or some combination thereof \u2014 from ballrooms full of men in suits gathered to hear company presentations.Ms. Davis thrived on the attention, even when it was negative.A shareholder at one Eastern Air Lines meeting in the 1970s grew so enraged, he pushed her into a flower pot. She once nominated Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and b\u00eate noire of the automobile industry, to be a director on the General Motors board \u2014 then left the room to do a television interview before she could cast a vote for him, returning only after the voting had ended. (Mr. Nader was not elected.)For all her antics, Ms. Davis could be effective. Her relentless questions about why chief executives were paid as much as they were, whether companies had donated money to political groups overseas, and how board elections were carried out were credited with helping to advance stricter rules for corporate governance.\u201cThe issues she raised were almost always excellent \u2014 they were well researched,\u201d Ms. Minow added. But, she said, Ms. Davis\u2019s personality sometimes got in the way. She could be flirty, flamboyant and long-winded. At times, she talked so long or interrupted proceedings so often that she was escorted out of the room.\u201cIt was kind of two steps forward, one step back with her,\u201d Ms. Minow said. \u201cIt made it too easy to marginalize not just Evelyn herself but anyone who wanted to raise those issues.\u201dIt was impossible to ignore Ms. Davis completely, however, and many chief executives adopted a strategy of placating her by giving her special attention, hoping she would agree not to show up at the next year\u2019s meetings. Occasionally, she would agree.Some executives courted her good favor by subscribing to her newsletter, \u201cHighlights and Lowlights of Annual Meetings,\u201d typically a slim booklet containing a jumble of her thoughts printed in italic font on thick, cream-colored paper, at $600 a copy. (She published it from 1965 to 2011.)In December 2008, Ken Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, escorted Ms. Davis as his date to a black-tie dinner at which he received the Banker of the Year award from the newspaper American Banker.Ms. Davis sometimes sounded like a voice from Main Street when she questioned chief executives at shareholder meetings. But at the 2008 gala with Mr. Lewis, she carried none of Main Street\u2019s anger at the country\u2019s biggest banks.The financial crisis was raging at the time, and Mr. Lewis was under fire for Bank of America\u2019s purchases of two teetering financial firms, Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch. But Ms. Davis said she still thought he was all right.When asked about the wave of foreclosures that were then pushing the United States economy into a deep recession, she said, \u201cI feel bad for all of these people who lost so much, but you have to expect that Wall Street is not a one-way street.\u201dEvelyn Yvonne DeJong was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in Amsterdam, the daughter of Herman H. and Marianna (Witteboon) DeJong. Her mother was a psychologist, her father a neurologist. The family was wealthy; Ms. Davis liked to say that she had been born on the wrong side of the Atlantic Ocean but on \u201cthe very right side of the tracks.\u201dThe DeJongs\u2019 Jewish roots made them a target of the invading Nazis after World War II began. Evelyn and several other members of her family were arrested. She was imprisoned for a time in a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia before she was released. Making her way to the United States, she, her parents and her brother, Rudolph, settled near Washington in 1942.After graduating from high school she attended Western Maryland University and George Washington University but did not graduate. She later moved to New York and began investing in companies and public bonds, using money she had inherited from her father when he died in 1956.Though she bought shares in more than 80 companies, Ms. Davis kept a significant portion of her money in safe, low-yielding bonds, which helped her weather several stock market slumps. Tax filings show her charitable foundation had assets of more than $11 million at the end of 2017.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018She married William Henry Davis, an accountant, a few months after her father\u2019s death. The marriage ended, after just 18 months, in divorce, as did three subsequent marriages \u2014 to Marvin Knudsen, Walter Froh Jr. and James Patterson. She kept Mr. Davis\u2019s surname.\u201cMoving fast is a habit with me,\u201d she wrote in 1970 after her second divorce. \u201cMy last marriage lasted only two months.\u201dOne stone boasts that she had been recognized \u201cby several presidents\u201d at White House news conferences. (She obtained White House press credentials because of her newsletter.)Ms. Davis saw to it that she would be remembered after her death in other ways as well. A spokesman for her foundation said she had left instructions to distribute most of its millions to a list of universities, hospitals and arts centers.She also directed that a portion of the money be used for something else: the maintenance of the plaques the charities would install in recognition of her donations. She asked that they remain intact and that they be polished in perpetuity.\u201cThe executor of my estate will check on this every six months,\u201d she told The Washington Post in 1995, \u201cto make sure I don\u2019t get double-crossed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Above, a group gathers around a new smartphone.But with election season around the corner, local officials from the country\u2019s ruling party, the B.J.P., are using the phones to target voters.Contractors have been calling recipients of the phones to ask whether they plan to vote and which party they intend to vote for, according to half a dozen people who made or received the calls. The phones even come pre-loaded with campaign apps.\u201cThey are misusing state machinery for personal gains,\u201d said one worker._____The intelligence agency had always been hesitant to definitively point fingers in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.But two sets of communications swayed the agency: intercepts of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s calls in the days before the killing, and calls by the kill team to a senior aide immediately after.The agency\u2019s new assessment adds pressure on the Trump administration to punish the kingdom, a longtime American ally and the centerpiece of its Middle East policy._____\u2022 Developers circle a rural patch of Hong Kong.The wetlands, hemmed by the skyscrapers in Hong Kong and the Chinese city of Shenzhen, are home to rare birds, traditional shrimp ponds and eucalyptus trees \u2014 a lush respite from the city\u2019s bustle.For decades, landowners have sought \u2014 and failed \u2014 to develop the area, as preservationists pushed back.But the people who visit the area, often cyclists and nature lovers, fear that the development companies will eventually win out.\u201cPeople in Hong Kong only care about the economy,\u201d said one cyclist.__________Tips for a more fulfilling life.Today, China leads the world in its number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires.

An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.This kind of reporting isn\u2019t easy. It requires having people on the ground with the smarts and experience to ask the right questions, and the tenacity to keep asking until they get to the truth.

{"Headline": "At Tiffany\u2019s, It\u2019s All Party, Party, Party", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few weeks ago, just after 1 a.m. on a chilly morning, Richard Moore, the divisional vice president of global store design and creative visual merchandising at Tiffany & Co., stood outside its Fifth Avenue flagship.The holidays were arriving: He watched as one of the windows filled up with (among other things) a handful of fiberboard gingerbread cookies, a bright orange neon light and, placed by a tattoo-covered hand, a Jean Schlumberger bracelet with gems like sapphires, amethysts and more than 1,000 diamonds.Tiffany\u2019s holiday windows and interior d\u00e9cor are planned more than a year in advance. (Yes, 2019 is already in the works.) Although the store\u2019s five windows \u2014 two on Fifth, three around the corner on East 57th Street \u2014 are changed around eight times a year, the seasonal iteration typically attracts the most eyes during the busy shopping period.\u201cSometimes we do the nose test,\u201d Mr. Moore said a couple of days later over a cup of tea in his bright Flatiron office. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve done a good window when there are a lot of greasy smudges on the window, because that means people have stopped and are looking in.\u201dThis year\u2019s theme is \u201cThe Holidays Made by Tiffany,\u201d with a perceptible feel of fun \u2014 like the headphone-wearing porcelain mouse, surrounded by diamond-pav\u00e9d rings, positioned near video of break-dancing robots on vintage TVs.Gene Moore \u201ctook the seriousness out of that experience of viewing on what people see as \u2018posh Fifth Avenue,\u2019\u201d said Esther Kremer, editor in chief of Assouline. \u201cHe was very democratic, and that spirit is reflected in the work.\u201dIts designs were contemporary and casual, even produced in platinum and diamonds and with prices as high as $790,000. And the 20-year-old Elle Fanning was the campaign\u2019s star; in one video advertisement, she wore the jewelry with ripped jeans and a loose sweatshirt, dancing on New York streets to a hip-hop soundtrack.As Richard Moore said one evening during the decorating marathon, quoting Mr. Krakoff, \u201cLuxury doesn\u2019t have to equal formality.\u201d\u201cThat was one of the very first things I thought about when I got here,\u201d Mr. Krakoff said in a later interview, \u201cbecause formality is often conservative, traditional, old-fashioned. What really was interesting, and more Tiffany, was doing things in a surprising way.\u201dA couple of days before the actual decorating began, Christopher Young, the vice president and creative director of creative visual merchandising, events and the Tiffany Archive, spent the afternoon at Spaeth Design. It produces the window displays for Tiffany and other retailers, including Bergdorf Goodman, across the street.In Spaeth\u2019s cavernous space in Woodside, Queens, Mr. Young \u2014 whose tattooed hand would later place the Schlumberger bracelet \u2014 tweaked details like the shade of pink used for an \u201cIce\u201d sign, the backdrop for (of course) an array of diamonds. Everything was created for the Fifth Avenue store, although each holiday\u2019s themes are integrated into displays at the more than 300 Tiffany boutiques worldwide (there are also 100 duty-free locations).It takes four consecutive weeknights to decorate the flagship. Mr. Moore and about two dozen people get to work after the store closes at 7 p.m.; they have to be out by 8 a.m., giving cleaners two hours to tidy up before shoppers arrive.This year, workbenches stocked with essentials like Goo Gone and X-Acto knives were set up alongside jewelry counters in the ground-floor sales area; props, including a vintage cassette-tape boom box, were placed temporarily on the cases of diamond rings and thick gold bracelets. And a well-worn utility cart, spray-painted in Tiffany\u2019s trademark light blue (Pantone 1837), held stocks of cookies and chocolate-covered peanut butter cups from Trader Joe\u2019s.Despite all the planning, some decisions were last-minute. Around 3 a.m. one morning, a worktable wrench became a window prop, nestled alongside silver canisters ostensibly filled with balloon helium.One thing that Gene Moore never had to worry about: Instagram. At this time of year, Tiffany\u2019s windows are heavily featured in posts. \u201cWe really design the windows as great windows,\u201d Richard Moore said, \u201cbut great windows make great Instagram posts.\u201dAnd the seasonal windows do drive sales, whether they\u2019re seen in person or online. \u201cHoliday windows play a really critical role,\u201d said Marshal Cohen, chief industry adviser at the market research company NPD Group. \u201cIn Tiffany\u2019s case, it becomes even more important because you\u2019re in an environment where luxury has been challenged in many cases, because some of the other retailers are vying for that same limited customer.\u201dTiffany\u2019s displays do have a proven rate of success. Last November, on the day the holiday d\u00e9cor was unveiled, a six-carat diamond engagement ring was purchased right out of a window.\u201cThat\u2019s ultimately what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cWe\u2019re a store and we\u2019re trying to sell amazing pieces of jewelry. If we can create a scene and capture somebody\u2019s imagination so they want that piece from the window, that\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s your validation. That\u2019s your job done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Election Showed a Divided Country. Investors Can Live With That.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks jumped on Wednesday, extending a recovery from the sharp sell-off in October with broad-based gains, after midterm elections that will split control of the United States government between both major parties.The S&P 500 rose 2.1 percent, led by giant technology companies including Amazon, Apple and Google. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 2.6 percent, its strongest gain this month.Stock in consumer discretionary companies climbed 3.1 percent, in a sign of growing optimism that President Trump, stung by his party\u2019s loss of the House of Representatives, could seek a win by striking a trade bargain with China at the Group of 20 summit meeting this month. Shares of Wynn Resorts, the casino company with significant business in China, jumped 3.9 percent.After weeks of uncertainty heading into the election, investors seemed to focus again on the strong fundamentals for American businesses, helping fuel the gains on Wednesday.In the voting on Tuesday, Democrats secured control of the House in the next Congress, while the Republicans padded their majority in the Senate. A divided government is conventionally thought of as good for stock investors, because it means lawmakers are unlikely to produce sweeping policy changes.\u201cInvestors can basically refocus their mental energy away from the macro and back to the micro, where earnings are really good and valuations are really reasonable,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at the institutional brokerage BTIG.Industrial shares rose, bolstered by renewed hope for a bipartisan infrastructure-spending bill. The construction machinery maker Caterpillar, which also has large exposure to China, rose 4.5 percent.Health care shares rallied on the prospect that major health legislation is much less likely. Managed care companies that sell contract Medicaid services to state governments and insurance products on health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act rose sharply.\u201cYou worry less about large sweeping regulatory change,\u201d said Zack Sopcak, an equity analyst covering managed care companies for Morgan Stanley. \u201cIt means a repeat of \u2018repeal and replace\u2019 is off the table,\u201d he added, referring to the potential for a wholesale replacement of the law, commonly known as Obamacare.After an ugly sell-off in October, investors appear to have regained their appetite for stocks. The S&P 500 has risen in four of the first five trading days of November. The 2.1 percent gain on Wednesday for the broad index of large companies was its third-best showing this year.That turn of events reflects a dizzying swing in market sentiment. As recently as Oct. 29, the market was down more than 1 percent for the year after a rout that started in September had vaporized nearly 10 percent in gains.At that time, investors saw ubiquitous threats to the nearly decade-long rally for stocks. The potential pitfalls included rising interest rates, climbing commodity and wage costs, signs of slowing growth in China and Europe and the tariff war between the United States and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies.Most of the issues remain unresolved, but the markets have found their footing and trading seemed to suggest investors see reasons for optimism now that the elections have concluded.Equity investors are now sitting on gains of more than 5 percent for the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Obama and Baker, a Lament for a Lost Consensus", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoHOUSTON \u2014 If there ever really was a so-called Washington consensus, it was sitting on stage \u2014 a former Democratic president and a former Republican secretary of state sharing laments about the days when the political system seemed to work better.Barack Obama and James A. Baker III on Tuesday night embodied what has become of that consensus, the decades-long accord between the two parties in favor of free trade, democratic values and an internationalist foreign policy built on alliances with like-minded countries.Where once the likes of Mr. Obama and Mr. Baker ran Washington and the world, now they are left to gather along with other \u201cformers\u201d at conferences and dinners and in the conversation held here at Rice University to discuss where it all went off track. In the age of President Trump, the great disrupter of the way things have always worked, the architects and preservers of the old approach are still struggling to come to terms with how it has frayed.\u201cA legitimate critique of that consensus, which I consider myself to be part of and still believe in, is that we did not adapt quickly enough to the fact that there were people being left behind and that frustrations were going to flare up and all these changes that were happening were happening really quick,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cThe Washington consensus, whatever you want to call it, got a little too comfortable,\u201d Mr. Obama added. \u201cParticularly after the Cold War, you had this period of great smugness on the part of America and American elites thinking we got this all figured out.\u201dNeither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Baker directly addressed Mr. Trump \u2014 indeed, the incumbent president was declared by the moderator, the historian Jon Meacham, to be the Voldemort of the evening: He who must not be named. But their very presence together was a message of its own.Mr. Baker, who worked for three Republican presidents, ran five presidential campaigns and served as secretary of state at the end of the Cold War, made a point of inviting Mr. Obama, the last Democrat to live in the White House, as the featured guest at the gala 25th anniversary of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice.The hundreds gathered in a cathedral tent set up at Rice for the event represented the sort of bipartisan crowd rarely seen in Washington these days. Some cheered any mention of Ronald Reagan; others applauded Mr. Obama\u2019s defense of his Affordable Care Act. All of them, it seemed, expressed approval for the notion that the two parties should work together more.\u201cThe fact is that members of Congress are primarily motivated around keeping their seat,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cAnd it\u2019s getting worse and worse,\u201d Mr. Baker agreed.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times during my presidency I would have former colleagues of mine in the Senate, who are good people and sensible people, say, \u2018Mr. President, I\u2019d love to help you but I\u2019d get killed,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cI totally agree with that, Mr. President,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cI think another way to put it is the responsible center in American politics has disappeared.\u201dThe two offered several reasons familiar to these sorts of discussions, including the gerrymandering of congressional districts that make incumbents more afraid of losing to more extreme members of their own parties in primaries than to an opponent from across the aisle.They also pointed to the fragmentation of the media, which rewards the loudest voices and increasingly takes sides. \u201cDivisiveness sells. Comity doesn\u2019t sell,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cIf you can get somebody to say something outrageous, that person can get on TV, right?\u201dHe said Fox News is perceived as the \u201chouse organ of the Republican Party\u201d and MSNBC the \u201chouse organ of the Democratic Party,\u201d adding that \u201cour media today are no longer objective reporters of the facts the way they were when I was there.\u201dBecause of that, Mr. Obama complained, Americans do not even start with the same understanding of the facts before debating what the facts mean.\u201cThe biggest challenge we\u2019re going to have over the next 10, 15, 20 years is to return to a civic conversation in which if I say this is a chair we agree this is a chair,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cNow we can disagree on whether it\u2019s a nice chair, whether to replace the chair, whether you want to move it over there. But you can\u2019t say it\u2019s an elephant.\u201d\u201cI thought we were supposed to be against Obama-chair,\u201d Mr. Meacham quipped, drawing peals of laughter.Mr. Baker recalled that Mr. Reagan and Speaker Thomas P. \u201cTip\u201d O\u2019Neill, a Democrat from Massachusetts, disagreed on nearly everything but still managed to collaborate. \u201cThey\u2019d fight like hell during the day and at night they would retire somewhere at 5 o\u2019clock, start telling Irish jokes and drinking bourbon,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they found ways to cooperate and ways to get the nation\u2019s business done.\u201dHe noted that Mr. Reagan worked with Democrats to overhaul the tax code while paying for it \u2014 unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut financed by deficits. \u201cIt was a true tax reform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t jack up the budget deficit.\u201dAnd he defended the value of NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other organizations that Mr. Trump has denigrated. \u201cThese institutions make America better and we ought not to be running them down,\u201d Mr. Baker said.Mr. Obama used the opportunity to defend his presidency, noting that energy production and stock markets increased on his watch.\u201cThat whole suddenly America\u2019s the biggest oil producer \u2014 that was me, people,\u201d he said. As for Wall Street tycoons who complain that he was anti-business, Mr. Obama said, \u201cHave you checked where your stocks were when I came to office\u201d and where they were when he left? \u201cWhat are you complaining about? Just say thank you, please.\u201dMr. Baker repeated one of his favorite laugh lines when asked his most important accomplishment: \u201cLeaving Washington unindicted.\u201dMr. Obama played off that. \u201cNot only did I not get indicted, nobody in my administration got indicted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was the only administration in modern history that can be said about.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alan Greenspan\u2019s Ode to Creative Destruction", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.At age 92, Alan Greenspan remains a towering figure in American finance. He was the second-longest serving chairman of the Federal Reserve (after William McChesney Martin). Dubbed a \u201crock star\u201d by The Economist, Greenspan achieved an unprecedented level of celebrity for a Fed chairman as stocks soared to record levels in the 1990s, and then notoriety, as his legacy was undermined by the Great Recession that began in 2008, less than two years after he left office.Greenspan was appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1987 and reappointed by three successive presidents from both parties. That a lifelong champion of free markets and an early acolyte of the objectivist author and philosopher Ayn Rand could so successfully straddle the political spectrum for so long is a testament to the bipartisan free-market ideology that followed the end of the Cold War. At the time it all seemed like the ultimate triumph of democratic capitalism.Now, 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers provoked a global financial panic and led to what Greenspan refers to as \u201cthe great stagnation,\u201d the self-congratulation seems to have been premature. Both parties have largely repudiated Greenspan\u2019s precepts, with Republicans lurching toward protectionism and a nativist hostility for globalization and Democrats lurching toward something he would surely find equally repugnant: income redistribution, ever-expanding government entitlements and identity politics.Less a conventional history than an extended polemic, \u201cCapitalism in America: A History,\u201d by Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, a columnist and editor for The Economist, explores and ultimately celebrates the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter\u2019s concept of \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d which the authors describe as a \u201cperennial gale\u201d that \u201cuproots businesses \u2014 and lives \u2014 but that, in the process, creates a more productive economy.\u201d While this approach risks oversimplifying centuries of American economic history, it provides a useful lens for analyzing America\u2019s current polarization and for understanding the centrifugal forces that have given rise to a President Trump, on the right, or a Bernie Sanders on the left.Other than a few paragraphs arguing the case that the Fed\u2019s easy money policy had little to no impact on the housing bubble that led to the Great Recession, \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d has almost nothing to say about Greenspan\u2019s own role in recent economic history, and he offers no defense of his tenure as Fed chairman.But that isn\u2019t his purpose here. \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d is Greenspan and Wooldridge\u2019s plea to re-embrace America\u2019s long-held capitalist traditions and entrepreneurial culture in order to rescue the country from its current \u201cfading dynamism.\u201dWhile \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d begins with the colonial era, when Americans were already enjoying \u201cthe world\u2019s fastest growth rate,\u201d Greenspan and Wooldridge hit their narrative stride and ideological sweet spot when they reach the late-19th-century \u201cAge of Giants,\u201d a name they prefer to the prevailing \u201cRobber Barons,\u201d who may have been rich but, as self-made men, were neither robbers nor hereditary barons.In the authors\u2019 approving view, men like the banker John Pierpont Morgan, the oil baron John D. Rockefeller and the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, all born within a few years of one another in the 1830s, were \u201cgiants of energy and ambition\u201d who \u201cexercised more power than anybody other than kings or generals had exercised before.\u201d These men (and they were all men) are \u201cheroes of creative destruction\u201d because they \u201chelped to produce a massive improvement in living standards for all.\u201dThat they also produced social and economic upheaval for many is a small price to pay, the authors contend. The rise of their great corporations, not to mention the industries they helped build and finance, from railroads to autos to retail chains like Sears, Roebuck, displaced millions of workers and small-business owners who were rendered obsolete. Cyrus McCormack\u2019s threshing machine displaced a quarter of the world\u2019s agricultural workers. \u201cPeople seldom achieve great things without being willing to ride roughshod over the opposition,\u201d the authors note.Not surprisingly, these \u201cgiants\u201d attracted popular hostility and resentment \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt called them \u201cmalefactors of great wealth.\u201d Their success and attendant wealth unleashed a populist backlash. Williams Jennings Bryan campaigned against Wall Street and its \u201ccross of gold.\u201d Congress passed the first antitrust laws. The first federal income tax paved the way to income redistribution.History\u2019s harsh judgment of the era (which culminated in the 1929 stock market crash and ensuing Great Depression) suggests why creative destruction has had trouble gaining much of a following. Like the Robber Barons, today\u2019s drivers of creative destruction, technology and internet entrepreneurs, \u201care seldom the easiest of heroes, nor the nicest,\u201d the authors note. \u201cThey will sacrifice anything, from their own peace of mind to the lives of those around them, to build a business empire and then protect that business empire from destruction.\u201d Such people are prone \u201cto what the Norwegians call Stormannsgalskap, or the \u2018madness of great men.\u2019\u201d Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, who merits several approving mentions, comes to mind. The disruptive forces they unleash generate \u201cunease: the fiercer the gale the greater the unease.\u201dAnd not all destruction, it should be said, is creative. In a nod to the exotic derivatives and mortgage-backed securities that led to the Great Recession (and went largely undetected by Greenspan\u2019s Fed), Greenspan and Wooldridge acknowledge that \u201ccreative destruction can sometimes be all destruction and no creation.\u201dThe popular reaction is typically a well-intentioned but misguided effort to preserve the status quo. \u201cPeople link arms to protect threatened jobs and save dying industries. They denounce capitalists for their ruthless greed. The result is stagnation: In trying to tame the creative destruction, for example by preserving jobs or keeping factories open, they end up killing it,\u201d the authors contend.In their view, America today is already well along that path to stagnation. \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d barely mentions Trump beyond condemning his \u201cdangerous\u201d trade policies and warning about the fiscal recklessness of his tax cuts. But the entire book is an indictment of Trump\u2019s stands on immigration and protectionism and his attempts to resurrect fading mining and industrial concerns \u2014 attempts that, as \u201cCapitalism in America\u201d shows repeatedly, are almost surely doomed.At the same time, Greenspan\u2019s admiration for the rugged individualists who populate the novels of Ayn Rand (who merits a nod in this history) and the frontier spirit that animated America\u2019s early development shows no sign of weakening as Greenspan has aged. He and Wooldridge lament that Americans are \u201closing the rugged pioneering spirit\u201d that once defined them and mock the \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d and \u201csafe spaces\u201d that now obsess academia.The authors quote Winston Churchill: \u201cWe have not journeyed across the centuries, across the oceans, across the mountains, across the prairies, because we are made of sugar candy.\u201d But now, they conclude, \u201csugar candy people are everywhere.\u201dTheir prescription for American renewal \u2014 reining in entitlements, instituting fiscal responsibility and limited government, deregulating, focusing on education and opportunity, and above all fostering a fierceness in the face of creative destruction \u2014 was Republican orthodoxy not so long ago. Before the Great Recession it was embraced by most Democrats as well, and more recently by President Bill Clinton, the recipient of glowing praise in these pages.No longer. \u201cCapitalism in America,\u201d in both its interpretation of economic history and its recipe for revival, is likely to offend the dominant Trump wing of the Republican Party and the resurgent left among Democrats. It\u2019s not clear who, if anyone, will pick up the Greenspan torch.America is now \u201ctrapped in an iron cage of its own making,\u201d the authors contend. But \u201cwe have shown that America has all the keys that it needs to open the cage. The great question is whether it has the political will to turn them.\u201dJames B.

Falling oil prices deserve some of the blame.The average yield on risky company bonds \u2014 measured by the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index \u2014 has climbed to 7.3 percent. Yields rise when bond prices fall.Notably, junk bond yields have moved higher as the rate on Treasuries has retreated. That has pushed the difference between them to its highest level in about two years. The wider spread is an indication that investors are demanding greater compensation against the risk of default.What does the price of crude oil \u2014 which has dropped more than 30 percent in the past two months \u2014 have to do with this?American energy companies have been the biggest issuers of high-yield bonds since 2015, according to Dealogic, and their bonds account for about 15 percent of the market. As the price of crude falls, investors\u2019 concerns about the health of these companies and their ability to pay off the bonds grows.It\u2019s not for nothing. In 2014, when oil prices began to slide, hundreds of smaller drillers went bankrupt, and manufacturers and other businesses that supply the energy industry also took a hit.But energy companies or high-risk companies aren\u2019t the only reasons for the growing caution. As concerns about the global economy and the strength of earnings mount, investors are demanding more to buy the debt of highly rated companies as well.Such moves, if they persist, suggest the favorable borrowing conditions that companies have enjoyed for years won\u2019t be as agreeable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slowing Global Growth May Lessen the Threat of Rising Rates", "Date": "2018-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the biggest threats to stock prices is suddenly looking less scary.Investors\u2019 concerns about rising interest rates have helped fuel the recent selling that has left the S&P 500 stock index nearly 6.6 percent off its high. But there have been signs in recent days that interest rates may not rise as quickly as investors previously expected.Officials at the Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, made remarks last week that suggested they were becoming more mindful of a slowing global economy.While that may mean stock investors will soon be able to worry less about rising rates, the slowdown in growth could still weigh on stock prices.Central bank policymakers tend to hold off on raising interest rates if they believe the economy is decelerating. Higher rates push up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. That, in turn, may prompt them to spend less, which can weaken the economy.Rising rates can hurt stock prices in another way. They make the returns from bonds more attractive compared with stocks. That may cause investors to shift some of their money to bonds from stocks.But the case for steadily higher rates may be weakening.The bond markets are signaling increasing concerns about global economic growth. After hitting 3.24 percent earlier this month \u2014 a move that underscored investors\u2019 belief that rates were on their way up \u2014 the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell last week to close at 3.07 percent on Friday.A shift is also occurring in the market that investors use to bet on the Fed\u2019s future interest rate decisions. A majority of investors no longer expect the central bank to raise rates twice between now and when policymakers meet in March. A week ago, investors were forecasting a 54 percent chance of two increases.While the tone of Fed officials may also have softened a bit, they have not said they will hold off on interest rate increases. The gentler tone is apparent in comments about growth. When asked last week what headwinds the economy faces, Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, mentioned slowing global growth, calling that \u201ca real thing.\u201d He also listed the waning effect of the United States\u2019 tax cuts and the Fed\u2019s own interest rate increases.\u201cThese are things we are well aware of, though,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cWe know that when we\u2019re making policy, and we think about those, and kind of have a sense of what they might be.\u201dOn Friday, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, Richard H. Clarida, noted that slowing abroad could affect the United States\u2019 economy. \u201cIt impacts big parts of the economy through trade and through capital markets and the like,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC.Advertisement"}

We all feel it. I feel it too. At Google, we set a very high bar, and we clearly didn\u2019t live up to our expectations.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cmoments like this show we didn\u2019t always do it right.\u201d He promised that \u201cthere are concrete steps coming up,\u201d but he hesitated to say that Google has a toxic culture.\u201cSexual harassment is a societal problem and Google is a large company,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are definitely doing our best.\u201dMr. Pichai\u2019s tenure atop Google has been marked with internal clashes and external finger-pointing.\u201cWe are a company that\u2019s about freedom of expression and information,\u201d Mr. Pichai said, adding that \u201cwe allow people to speak up\u201d but \u201calso have a code of conduct.\u201dMr. Pichai said on Thursday that Google, which is based in Northern California, has \u201clocal left-leaning employees and local right-leaning employees\u201d but stressed that the company has a global mindset. Besides, he said, personal political leanings are \u201cdifferent than how we build our products, and we are committed to doing it in a nonpartisan way.\u201d\u2014 Tiffany HsuHow many times does some tweet or policy action or statement by President Trump leave Peter Thiel, one of his most vocal supporters, in disbelief?Actually, he said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201dOn Thursday, he acknowledged that the current political environment is \u201cnot healthy\u201d but said that the country has been \u201cpolarised since the late 60s\u201d and that President Trump is \u201cnot the main cause.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated thing to get right,\u201d he said.\u201cI tend to think that the inaccuracies President Trump tells are basically exaggerations of the truth,\u201d Mr. Thiel said.\u2014 Tiffany HsuA month after relinquishing the role of chief executive officer at Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein was still defending the firm he now chairs.\u201cI would say that we\u2019re pretty compliant,\u201d he said late Thursday afternoon at the DealBook conference in Manhattan. He was responding to a question about federal criminal charges filed hours earlier against two former Goldman investment bankers over their role in helping to finance a Malaysian government fund from which about $4 billion went missing. \u201cBut here in this case, at the very least, and this part I know, one of our people lied to us and evaded our systems and our controls.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d he added.On Oct. 1, the longtime investment-banking chief David M. Solomon succeeded Mr. Blankfein as C.E.O. Mr. Blankfein, 64, has stayed on as senior chairman of the board through the end of this year. Beyond joking about the idea of unfettered tweeting, he has said little so far about his future plans.On Thursday afternoon, looking relaxed in a navy suit and blue tie, he reminisced about his more than twelve years running Goldman and addressed some of the c-suite mysteries that had enveloped his tenure. As to whether longtime firm president Gary D. Cohn could have ever succeeded him as C.E.O., he was equivocal.\u201cI think his leaving coincided with a new administration,\u201d said Mr. Blankfein, \u201cbut I hadn\u2019t done him the favor of telling him when I was leaving at that point.\u201dAs to whether he would have done anything differently to help Goldman weather the financial crisis, he said more proactive public relations would have helped burnish the firm\u2019s image.\u201cOur mantra was our clients should have the exposure, not us. We\u2019re in the background,\u201d he said of the firm\u2019s approach to publicity in the pre-crisis years. \u201cThat hurt us a lot.\u201d\u2014 Kate KellyMaking a rare public appearanceThursday at the DealBook conference, the 47-year-old executive discussed the family\u2019s latest round of deal making and what it could mean for the family\u2019s other assets. In particular, he spoke about the newspaper business under News Corp, a roster that includes The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, as well as The Times and The Sun in Britain.The sale of Fox\u2019s film and TV studios to Disney prompted a question about whether his father would ever sell The Wall Street Journal, which Mr. Murdoch acquired in 2007 for over $5 billion.\u201cI never thought we\u2019d sell the TV studio, the film studio, so who knows?\u201d Lachlan responded. In the next breath, he said of his father, \u201cHe loves journalism. He loves The Wall Street Journal and what it represents.\u201dThe businesses that will remain under the control of the Murdochs after the close of the Disney deal early next year will center on news and sports. That means Lachlan will run Fox News, the Fox Broadcasting network and the FS1 cable sports network.Fox News, in particular, has come under heavy criticism for its close ties to the Trump administration. That has led to charges from critics that Fox News, and the larger Murdoch TV business, is actually a red state media organization.Lachlan disagreed. \u201cI think about it as an all-state media organization,\u201d he said, later adding that, \u201cwe program to everyone. It\u2019s to the coasts. But also everywhere in-between.\u201dHe cited figures that showed more Fox viewers are tuned to its sober news segments than the fiery opinion hours. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d he said.\u2014 Edmund LeePadma Lakshmi believes in redemption for men brought down amid the #MeToo movement.But that redemption should come from genuine remorse and understanding of the impact of one\u2019s actions, as Ms. Lakshmi said Thursday, and shouldn\u2019t be driven by a man\u2019s being good at a certain job.It was one of the lessons that Ms. Lakshmi and her fellow panelist, Lisa Borders, sought to impress on their audience. The women discussed how the #MeToo movement continued to revolutionize gender dynamics across the workplace, culture, in social circles and in sports and education. Both have become vocal leaders.The op-ed was published as two women came forward to detail accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and President Trump questioned why one of the women, Christine Blasey Ford, didn\u2019t report the incident when it happened more than 30 years ago.The conversation was wide-ranging as Ms. Borders and Ms. Lakshmi described the need for a cultural shift, not just in the workplace, but particularly in how men are socialized and boys are raised.\u201cWe need to stop equating aggression and masculinity because I think that\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d Ms. Lakshmi said.Ms. Borders said there needed to be more transparency, particularly on the issue of salaries, so women would know if they were being underpaid. She said that companies should understand that policies and practices that empower women also help organizations as a whole.\u201cWe add value,\u201d Ms. Borders said.Both women said the ability to share stories through social media had helped strengthen the #MeToo movement and create a time of real social change. Ms. Borders said there was a recognition among what she called survivors of sexual abuse that their stories were not \u201cour burden to bear but society\u2019s burden to bear.\u201d\u201cAnd it lit fire,\u201d she said.Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, the maker of the disappearing-message app Snapchat, said broadcasting regulations offer a framework for how to think about the dangers of social media.\u201cIf you look historically at America, a place that\u2019s always celebrated things like free speech, we\u2019ve actually always thought about broadcasting really differently than how we thought about communication,\u201d he said.While Americans have long accepted most forms of speech, even the distasteful kind, they have been less tolerant when that speech is widely distributed, he said, noting that broadcasters are subject to regulations on what they can and can\u2019t say or show.\u201cI think we\u2019re in this weird moment in time where this behavior\u2019s been enabled technically and the regulatory framework actually hasn\u2019t caught up to that reality,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.When asked if he was suggesting that social media should be regulated, Mr. Spiegel said only that there was much to learn from how Americans have thought about the responsibility of broadcasters in the past. The challenge, though, is identifying what, exactly, broadcasting is, he said.\u201cWe understand what one-on-one communication is, but let\u2019s say your Uncle Joe, for example, has some very extreme, maybe not so accurate, views on the world and he wants to reach 500 people. Is that OK? If he wants to reach 50,000 people, is that OK? If he wants to reach 100,000, is that OK? Where do we draw the line in terms of where broadcasting is versus communication with friends?\u201dSome have argued that social media has enabled social change, but Mr. Spiegel said that view is overly simplistic.\u201cOne of the more dangerous things that I\u2019ve seen is this idea that just using your voice is going to make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of it, that\u2019s half of it, but the other half is really taking action to implement that change.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiTo address corporate America\u2019s diversity problem, Ken Frazier sees a lesson in his own past.The chief executive of Merck is one of only three black chief executives in the Fortune 500. But growing up as the son of a janitor in inner-city Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier faced an opportunity gap. Fortunately for him, a desegregation policy and a 90-minute daily bus ride that gave him time to read helped to overcome it.\u201cI look back at my own life and I realize that I was treated in an extraordinary way in this country,\u201d he said.As the nation increasingly self-segregates, Mr. Frazier said, the workplace is one of the few remaining places that offers that same opportunity for people of different backgrounds to interact \u2014 and business leaders, he says, have a responsibility to uphold that basic American value.That conviction led Mr. Frazier to step down last year from President Trump\u2019s manufacturing advisory council, the first of many executives to do so after the president equivocated in his response to white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017.\u201cFor me, it was a very clear personal decision as a matter of conscience,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cI happen to believe that political discourse, political speech, has consequences.\u201d\u2014 Niraj ChokshiMary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said that the company plans to roll out a ride-sharing service that would rely on autonomous vehicles in 2019, a development that would advance the already-heated race to bring self-driving cars to market.\u201cWe\u2019re on track, with our rate of learning, to be able to do that next year,\u201d Ms. Barra said, adding that the company had a strategy to show how its vehicles are safer than human drivers. The vehicles can currently run safely at speeds of up to about 30 miles per hour, and the service will be limited to a small geographical area, Ms. Barra said.She did not say where the service would operate, but noted that the company has been testing in San Francisco.Autonomous vehicles rely on what Ms. Barra described as \u201ca suite of sensors,\u201d including radar, cameras and a technology known as lidar. G.M. is focused on advancements to lidar, which will drive down costs and enable the vehicles to travel at higher speeds, she said.\u201cWe do believe in an all-electric future,\u201d she said.\u2014 Niraj ChokshiNancy Dubuc, the newly installed chief executive of Vice Media, announced at the conference today that the company will be profitable by \u201cthe next fiscal year.\u201d That would be an important milestone for a business that was most recently valued at $5.7 billion.\u201cIt actually was profitable a couple years ago, and then with all the expansion and investment, we made it not profitable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut very, very quickly it\u2019ll be profitable again.\u201dCost cutting will help. But Ms. Dubuc characterized the forthcoming changes as a way to become more efficient. \u201cWhen you have expansion everywhere, you\u2019re obviously going to have duplication everywhere too,\u201d she said.Vice started as a free punk magazine in Montreal in 1994 and has traded on its irreverent, brash tone to become a global media company with about 3,000 employees. Backed by media giants like the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, Vice now includes an advertising agency, a TV network, a film-production business and programs on HBO.Vice founder Shane Smith responded to the article by pledging a series of changes, including pay equity and reaching gender parity within the work force. In a statement, he said, \u201cfrom the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive.\u201dMs. Dubuc praised Mr. Smith for his response.\u201cShane did a powerful thing and that was to take seriously the changes that needed to happen at Vice,\u201d she said, later adding that her being named aschief executive was an important signal for the company to send.\u201cI could have a pretty dramatic impact,\u201d she said.\u2014 Edmund LeeFor someone who speaks often and loudly about taking a stand and doing good, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock spends a lot of time thinking about gray areas.\u201cThese things are not black or white,\u201d he said on Thursday at the DealBook conference in New York.BlackRock has $6.5 trillion under management, giving it great influence over many of the world\u2019s top public companies. In a conversation that ranged from tariffs to bitcoin, Mr. Fink returned repeatedly to ideas about corporate accountability.\u201cI\u2019m not a nanny either,\u201d Mr. Fink said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not telling companies what their purpose should be. But I do believe it\u2019s up to the company to identify what their purpose is.\u201dOther executives \u2014 including Mr. Dimon, Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone and Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber \u2014 also dropped out of the event. Despite his refusal to attend what he called a \u201cvery public showcase\u201d of the kingdom\u2019s strengths, Mr. Fink said that BlackRock would continue to conduct business in Saudi Arabia, adding that he \u201cnever believed that decision would cost us all the business.\u201dBut he stressed that his attention to social responsibility is not a passing fad.\u201cI certainly never did this to be in vogue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because we\u2019re being asked.\u201d\u2014 Tiffany HsuSteve Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, concluded his presentation on Thursday with the results of a poll he recently helped run: 61 percent of the people surveyed cared about using researched facts to help form their opinions on policy, beating the 54 percent who said their values shaped their opinions.For Mr. Ballmer, that is central to a project he has been working on since he retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014 and has poured millions of dollars into: USAFacts, a nonpartisan database of federal, state and local government revenue and spending.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the better part of four years trying to understand where government gets its revenue, where it spends its revenue,\u201d Mr. Ballmer told the audience on Thursday.In a wide-ranging presentation, Mr. Ballmer ran through some highlights of the types of data his website provides, hitting on hot-button issues in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.Mr. Ballmer has called USAFacts \u201cthe equivalent of a 10-K for government,\u201d referring to the kind of annual financial filings that companies make. In charts, Mr. Ballmer showed how he believes USAFacts can help Americans filter the increasingly convoluted noise.On immigration, for example, the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States rose from about 10.5 million to 12.1 million in recent years, according to USAFacts\u2019 analysis of government data. The number of border agents has risen sharply from about 4,000 to 19,000 over the same period, while border apprehensions have decreased from roughly 1.7 million to 300,000, Mr. Ballmer said.The numbers raise natural questions, Mr. Ballmer said. Why are there more border agents today, fewer apprehensions, but more undocumented immigrants?\u2014 Mihir ZaveriDavid Gelles, Corner Office columnist at The New York Times, presented the findings of a DealBook conference task force on diversity in the workplace, characterizing it as a \u201creally lively discussion\u201d that could have gone on for hours. Nonetheless, \u201cwe made a remarkable amount of progress in an hour,\u201d he said.Among the conclusions of the report:\u2022 Aspirational goals are in general a good thing, but they\u2019re not enough, said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer for Goldman Sachs. Companies also need to be transparent in how they\u2019re achieving those goals. In addition, there can\u2019t be separate business and diversity scorecards \u2013 diversity needs to be part of the business.\u2022 Legislation and federal policies need to play a role. John Hope Bryant, founder and chief executive of Operation HOPE spoke about the need for a federal policy to give credit to companies that offer internships and apprenticeships, and when the effort is especially aimed at women and people of color, \u201cyou should get a double credit for that double reach,\u201d he said.\u2022 Companies have to realize diversity is a long-term goal, and it has to be baked into its culture. \u201cYou can have policy and tactics, but if the culture is not ready to receive it,\u201d it won\u2019t work, said Thasunda Duckett, the chief executive of consumer banking at JP Morgan Chase. And everyone has to join the conversation, she said.\u2014Alina TugendRebecca Blumenstein, the deputy managing editor of New York Times, described the conversations of a DealBook conference task force, intended to establish guidelines on how to ethically implement A.I., as one of the \u201chighest level discussions she has ever seen\u201d about the technology.Among the conclusions of the panel:\u2022 Companies should take care to scrutinize their machine learning initiatives (and algorithms in general) for biases that may be passed on from their creators, said Dipayan Ghosh, a Pozen Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. These technologies should be developed with greater consideration for the public interest.\u2022 In New York City, when considering artificial intelligence in transportation, companies should be transparent with the data they use in order to ensure the technologies are a benefit to society, said Cordell Schachter, the chief technology officer of the New York City Department of Transportation.\u2014 Mihir ZaveriA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified the people shown.

{"Headline": "Apple Will Stop Revealing How Many iPhones It Sells. That\u2019s a Bad Sign.", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has giant revenues, profit margins that are the envy of corporations everywhere and a stock market value of $1 trillion.Despite those obvious strengths, Apple told investors on Thursday that it would stop reporting numbers central to understanding the performance of its biggest business: selling iPhones.The company said it would no longer disclose how many iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold each quarter. Without this data, investors will not be able to track the average selling price of iPhones, a crucial number for assessing whether consumers are balking at paying up for Apple\u2019s higher-priced phones.The decision, along with Apple\u2019s disappointing forecast for this quarter\u2019s sales, helped drive the company\u2019s stock price down more than 7 percent on Friday, a move that weighed on the wider stock market.Apple\u2019s move to cut back its disclosures also should serve as a jolt for all investors.For much of the year, investors seemed to ignore the warning signs hanging over large technology companies and pushed their stocks higher. Their plunge last month \u2014 Netflix\u2019s stock is down 26 percent from its high, and Amazon is off 19 percent \u2014 has most likely made investors more aware of the problems these companies face in their core businesses.But Apple\u2019s decision to make its iPhone sales less transparent may underscore the seriousness of these challenges. \u201cAn abrupt loss of disclosure suggests weakness beyond one quarter,\u201d Jeffrey Kvaal, an analyst for Nomura, wrote in a research note.Sales of iPhones have stalled in recent years. As a result, Apple has raised prices to bolster its iPhone revenue. The average selling price of an iPhone was $793 in the three months through September, a 28 percent increase from a year earlier. Without the tally of phones sold, calculating the average selling price won\u2019t be possible, and outsiders will find it harder to gauge consumers\u2019 sensitivity to the price of iPhones. \u201cWe believe unit volumes and A.S.P.\u2019s are reflective of the loyalty and satisfaction consumers have in their devices,\u201d Mr. Kvaal wrote in his note, referring to average selling prices.Selling iPhones at a premium price to a relatively small portion of the global smartphone market has been at the heart of Apple\u2019s strategy. With less data, investors will probably find it harder to tell whether this approach remains successful.Other big technology companies have removed data from their regular financial reports. And some simply do not disclose figures that would be helpful in determining trends in their business. Twitter, for instance, does not provide the overall number of daily average users, a number that Facebook gives out.Facebook does not disclose Instagram\u2019s revenue, a number that would help investors understand the attraction of each platform to advertisers.Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, on Thursday contended that removing the data would not affect investors\u2019 understanding of the company\u2019s performance. Over the last three years, he said, there was no correlation between price and the number of phones sold. And Apple said it would disclose new information, including the cost of sales for its two main businesses, called products (selling items like iPhones) and services (for instance, subscriptions to Apple music).But the new information may not make up for what\u2019s being taken away. Sales of iPhones accounted for nearly three-fifths of the company\u2019s revenue in its latest quarter. And the decision to stop providing iPhone sales comes at a pivotal time for smartphones. Sales of smartphones in more affluent countries are slowing as consumers hold onto their phones longer. While sales are still growing in emerging markets, such as India, the handsets that dominate those markets are cheaper. So as the sales mix shifts to those countries, it could crimp profit margins.\u201cI think we\u2019re at peak smartphone,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, a tech sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.Advertisement"}

What actually happened, according to Nicholas Confessore, Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance of the NYT:When a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the initial F.T.C.-mandated assessment in 2013, it tested Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Microsoft and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handset. In both cases, PricewaterhouseCoopers found only \u201climited evidence\u201d that Facebook had monitored or checked its partners\u2019 compliance with its data use policies. That finding was redacted from a public version of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report released by the F.T.C. in June.\u201cFacebook claimed that its data-sharing partnerships with smartphone manufacturers were on the up and up,\u201d Mr. Wyden told the NYT. \u201cBut Facebook\u2019s own, handpicked auditors said the company wasn\u2019t monitoring what smartphone manufacturers did with Americans\u2019 personal information, or making sure these manufacturers were following Facebook\u2019s own policies.\u201dStocks dropped again yesterday as investors worried about the future of big technology companies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 2.8 percent, while the S&P 500 fell 2 percent.Apple remains a key concern.

Including Monday\u2019s gain, 17 of those moves have come since the start of October, when concerns about trade, slowing global economic growth and higher interest rates began to batter stocks.That\u2019s not far from how things usually go with stocks.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Typically Rises After Midterm Elections. This Year Is Anything but Typical.", "Date": "2018-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThere has been a deficit of cheerful news lately about American politics. And with the midterm elections looming, it may be difficult to think clearly about anything else.So here\u2019s a tidbit that may be diverting and even mildly comforting: The midterms have consistently been good for the stock market.Remarkably, this has been true for every midterm election since World War II.The data shows that it hasn\u2019t mattered who won or lost or which party controlled the White House or Congress, either before the voting or as a result of it. Whatever the political configuration or the election results, the midterm election season has been an excellent one for stocks.The pattern \u201cgives a very positive message for the market,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States Strategist for Ned Davis Research. \u201cIt\u2019s only part of the picture, but it\u2019s a positive part.\u201dThe numbers tell the story. Since 1946, in years with midterm elections, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has gained a median of 18.4 percent in the nine-month period from Sept. 30, just ahead of voting, through June 30 of the following year, according to data compiled by Ned Davis Research. In that same period in nonvoting years, the index gained 4.9 percent.Diving a little deeper into the Ned Davis data, the pattern is evident when presidential terms are broken down into three-month quarters. Each four-year presidential term has 16 quarters, and the best one has typically been the quarter we are in now, the fourth quarter of a midterm year.In this midterm quarter, the stock index since 1946 has gained 7.5 percent on average. The next best two quarters in performance have been the next two quarters chronologically \u2014 the first and second quarters in the year after the midterm election \u2014 with average gains of 7.5 percent and 6.6 percent.There have been declines within these periods \u2014 including one, in 1946, as large as a 15.4 percent loss \u2014 but in every case, the net result for the nine-month midterm season was a market gain.The main working hypothesis is a cynical one: Presidents are politicians who care overwhelmingly about their own re-election. (And to a much lesser extent, two-term presidents look to ensure the election of their successors.) They stimulate the economy \u2014 and, indirectly, the stock market \u2014 for maximum effect as their own elections grow closer, or so the theory goes.That implies that their first year in office is the best time to make politically painful moves, which won\u2019t hurt them in the polls later. And it follows that it\u2019s better to gin up the economy in the second half of their tenure, starting around the midterms. If the good times are going to roll, let them roll closer to a presidential election.Cause and effect have been difficult to prove. The one case with a smoking gun occurred, naturally enough, in the Nixon administration.Mr. Nixon took other actions, including the imposition of wage and price controls to curb inflation, all aimed at improving his standing in the polls. And he crushed Senator George McGovern in the presidential election of 1972.Still, the patterns in the stock market over a very long period appear to be persuasive. (Even for Mr. Carter, the stock market eked out a small gain, 0.4 percent, in the midterm election quarter.)But even if the overall pattern is more than an elaborate series of coincidences, and even if presidential self-interest causes it, it\u2019s possible that President Trump may be so singular that little of this applies.Will the midterm pattern be sustained once more? Its overwhelming consistency is formidable. But so is Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to shatter convention.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the chief United States Strategist for Ned Davis Research.

{"Headline": "The Stock Market\u2019s Dangers Are Easier to See Now", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesProject ahead a year or two: It is much easier to make a case for a troubled stock market than for a booming one.Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, regularly tallies what he calls \u201cthe pros and cons\u201d of the stock market. I asked him for an informal update: He came up with 14 pros versus 22 cons.That abundance of negativity isn\u2019t intended as a quantitative assessment of the market\u2019s prospects, but it does give a rough sense of his view and, I think, of the perspective of many skittish investors.\u201cWe were bullish for a long time, but right now I\u2019d say I\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a time to be cautious.\u201dI also asked James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in Minneapolis, for his sense of the market. An economist, Mr. Paulsen is worried about stocks because he is worried about the economy, he said. While the United States is not in a recession now, he said, \u201cwe have moved into the ballpark of a recession.\u201d\u201cIt gets somewhat easy, with a little experience, to recognize when you\u2019re in the ballpark of a recession,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cThat is where we are now, and that alone is quite a bit of information.\u201dGiven his current outlook, which is that the probability of a recession within two years is reasonably high though not certain, \u201cthis is a good moment to take a little risk out of your portfolio, just in case things turn down,\u201d he said.The stock market, Mr. Paulsen said, often moves in advance of a recession \u2014 and a declining market can help cause a recession \u2014 making investment timing extremely difficult now. In this dangerous environment, he said, \u201cright now, I\u2019d be a little careful.\u201dMr. Hickey, too, advises caution, because when he enumerates the pros and cons for the market, the positive side is scanty. It includes factors like these:\u25a0 The yield curve \u2014 the difference between long- and short-term interest rates \u2014 remains in a bullish zone, although that positive margin has been narrowing and bears close watching.\u25a0 Finally, there is already so much bad news about the stock market that it amounts to good news. According to contrarian logic, Mr. Hickey said, the negatives are baked into stock prices, so the market has room to rise.That last item may be a stretch. It is an indication, he said, that he is having difficulty being upbeat.The stock market negatives on Mr. Hickey\u2019s list, by contrast, are straightforward. A sampling includes these items:\u25a0 The trend of stock prices has been quite negative. While a string of strong days could turn that around, momentum is bearish.\u25a0 Despite Mr. Powell\u2019s latest comments, the Fed is still tightening monetary policy, which could easily derail the stock market and the economy.\u25a0 The fiscal stimulus provided by the tax cut is, increasingly, behind us. Combined with tighter monetary policy, the loss of fiscal stimulus could hurt the American economy.\u25a0 Tariffs have been rising, and business sentiment has been depressed by the prospect of widening trade wars.\u25a0 Global economic growth has been slowing, and many stock markets around the world are already in bear market territory.\u25a0 The domestic housing market has weakened, homebuilder stocks have plunged, commodity prices have fallen, and auto sales are relatively weak.\u25a0 The tech sector, which propelled the market higher earlier in the year, has now lost hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Because of the importance of stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Alphabet (Google) and Apple, the psychological \u201cimpact of their weakness can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d Mr. Hickey said.\u25a0 Corporate debt levels are high, creating new vulnerabilities.\u25a0 The rate of earnings growth is likely to decline. That could disappoint Wall Street analysts and shake up the market.And that\u2019s just a start. The negatives go on and on.Yet even despite these portents, a gloomy financial outlook may not be entirely appropriate. For example, neither Mr. Hickey nor Mr. Paulsen is confident that the bull market is over or that a recession is likely to arrive soon.\u201cThere could be another strong bull run,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a good sense of that until at least the end of the year.\u201dI asked Mr. Paulsen to make the strongest case he reasonably could for upbeat economic and market outcomes for the next two years. In response, he said it was possible that the Fed would soften its monetary policy enough to extend the economic recovery and bolster the stock market. If the economy keeps growing and corporate earnings keep rising, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks will rise, too.The odd conditions of 2018 have already made stock valuations more attractive. Because prices have been flat while earnings have risen, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has declined to about 18, from about 23.5 in January, he pointed out.If that trend continues, Mr. Paulsen said, stocks might become rather enticing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go into a recession and if interest rates don\u2019t rise too much, at some point stocks could look good enough to set off another bull run,\u201d he said.But he added that he wouldn\u2019t bet on it with money needed to pay the bills in the next couple of years.After a nearly 10-year bull run, the downside of the market is becoming increasingly obvious.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Small Companies Avoid I.P.O.s, Sapping U.S. Economy\u2019s Vitality", "Date": "2018-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRyan Smith spent years planning to sell shares of his software company, Qualtrics, on the stock market, meeting with bankers, carefully auditing financials and shaping a Wall Street-friendly narrative about the company\u2019s prospects. Two weeks ago, the finish line was close, with a listing on the Nasdaq just a few days away.But shortly before a staff meeting to update Qualtrics\u2019 employees about the public listing, Mr. Smith received a phone call from Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP. \u201cIt\u2019s on,\u201d Mr. McDermott told Mr. Smith.Mr. Smith then stunned Qualtrics\u2019 workers with a totally different message: SAP had agreed to buy the company for $8 billion in cash, nearly double the valuation bankers had set for the company\u2019s public listing. It was a decision, Mr. Smith said in an interview, that he did not second-guess one bit.\u201cI\u2019ve never felt more peace in my life,\u201d he said.That kind of last-minute deal, an increasingly common occurrence in the tech industry, is contributing to a major reshaping of the American financial landscape that has been underway for years.Small and midsize companies are fading from stock markets, leaving far fewer publicly traded companies. Many of the smaller companies are bought by larger organizations or are enticed to stay private by the sharp rise in venture capital money, both of which allow them to avoid the volatility and scrutiny that come with going public. The number of listed companies peaked in the late 1990s, before the dot-com bust, plummeting 52 percent by 2016.Some economists say the buyouts of early-stage companies by large dominant players help explain why, by many measures, the American economy has been less dynamic in recent years. Less competition can contribute to sluggish rates of entrepreneurship, business creation, wage growth and productivity, they say.Even some companies that do go public can find that their time there is short-lived. In March, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft, a software integration company, just a year after its public offering.\u201cCompanies like Qualtrics are saying, \u2018Huh, why bother the fighting in the public markets if I can do just as well by presenting myself for acquisition in sort of a premarket sale?\u2019\u201d said Andrew Karolyi, a Cornell University finance professor who has studied the decline of publicly traded companies.The traditionally vibrant American small business sector was long viewed as a strength for the economy. Small businesses are more likely to develop innovative new technologies, forcing large companies to reinvest significant amounts of profits to keep pace. The economy benefits from that competition, improving productivity and generating new and higher-quality products and services for consumers.The ability of large, cash-rich companies to buy smaller businesses before they have the chance to emerge as formidable competitors has altered the corporate landscape, said Thomas Philippon, a professor of economics at New York University, who has studied the increased dominance of large companies in many American industries.From 2001 to 2017, the median age of a venture-backed start-up going public was 11 years, according to a study by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. That\u2019s three years older than in the 1980s and 1990s, excluding the dot-com boom.Big tech companies like SAP and Cisco are attracted to the reliable revenue streams of the new class of cloud-based software providers, which charge monthly subscription fees for their offerings.\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for some of these big companies that need to adapt to a new way of doing business,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a provider of I.P.O.-related research and services.\u201cThe public markets would not have awarded these companies those kinds of multiples,\u201d Ms. Smith said.While Qualtrics is growing quickly, its $290 million in annual revenue will not make an immediate difference in the earnings of SAP, which brought in more than $20 billion in 2017. But Mr. Smith of Qualtrics said that joining with SAP would help him accomplish in two years what would have taken five.\u201cOur only reason to go public was not for the financial side. It was to go take this to the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got that in one swoop.\u201dTraditional investors in early-stage companies that used to go public have had to adjust to the new reality. For instance, the asset manager and mutual fund company T. Rowe Price, based in Baltimore, has increased its investing activity in pre-I.P.O. companies, including Airbnb and Uber, as well as Snap, the social media company, before it went public in 2017.\u201cWe are seeing opportunities to invest in companies with very similar characteristics to what would have been early-stage public market companies decades ago \u2014 only these companies are oftentimes raising money through private markets instead,\u201d Corey Shull, an analyst who leads early-stage internet investments at T. Rowe Price, wrote in an email.Investing in hot private start-ups is not generally available to the public. Retail investors seeking to ride the wave of hot cloud companies, for example, have had numerous opportunities to jump on an enterprise tech public offering this year. But some of the most notable ones, including Qualtrics, Adaptive Insights and Mulesoft, are now under the umbrella of much larger conglomerates.\u201cIf they don\u2019t have to tap the public markets to raise money, then why would you?\u201d said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who focuses on I.P.O. advisory work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Firearms Industry Appears Stuck in the Doldrums", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis holiday season is not shaping up to be the gun industry\u2019s best.Firearms sales slumped after President Trump was elected in 2016, as fears of gun control melted away with the administration\u2019s vocal support of the gun industry.But two years later, demand still appears damp.In October, slightly more than a million background checks of prospective firearms buyers were conducted through the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation trade group, which adjusts federal figures to roughly approximate market conditions.That\u2019s 11.2 percent fewer checks than in the same month a year earlier. So far this year, nine out of 10 months had fewer checks than the same period in either 2016 or 2017.Some analysts attribute the weakness to an absence of significant federal gun control legislation, or to the firearms industry\u2019s cyclical nature.\u201cWe are definitely in a business cycle,\u201d said Jurgen Brauer, chief economist of Small Arms Analytics, a research firm. \u201cFor those who have been around for 30 years, this kind of thing is old hat, and you just deal with it.\u201dAnd if the past few weeks are any indication, gun companies have more stress coming.The company\u2019s financials are still adjusting.Lee Belitsky, the chief financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts that \u201cthe broader industry has decelerated and remains weak.\u201d Mr. Stack said on the call that the company stripped hunting products from 10 stores and replaced them with outerwear, licensed products and baseball items.Background checks are only a rough estimate of sales figures. The true number is likely to be much higher, as buyers can submit to a single check and then purchase multiple guns, and in many cases can skip the process entirely when buying a firearm in a private sale.\u201cThis is not a political statement about constitutional rights,\u201d Christopher Ailman, the chief investment officer of the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, said in a statement. \u201cIt is a joint assertion by all of the involved signatories that investors have a stake in advancing public safety.\u201dThe implication \u2014 that the powerful trade group\u2019s grip on American gun owners might be loosening \u2014 did not escape investors of several gun companies.

{"Headline": "The Market\u2019s Been Falling. I\u2019m Putting My Money in Stocks Anyway.", "Date": "2018-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe stock market has been plummeting and my own retirement portfolio has been shrinking.Am I worried? Sure. But I\u2019m still buying stocks.Week after week lately, I\u2019ve been stubbornly funneling part of my paycheck into diversified equity mutual funds in the hope of long-term gains, knowing full well that I\u2019ve been losing money.It\u2019s not because I\u2019m confident the market will start a big rally soon. I\u2019m sticking with stocks precisely because I have no idea where the market is heading, and the statistics show that mistiming market rallies is excruciatingly costly. And I\u2019m doing it out of faith in the future. Over the long run, the stock market has produced marvelous returns. I hope that will still be true, if I wait long enough.The dangers of short-term investing are clear. A new, eye-opening study by Doug Peta, senior vice president of BCA Research in Montreal, points out the danger of trying to time a long bull market. Mr. Peta analyzed all previous United States bull markets \u2014 defined as an increase in the S&P 500 of at least 20 percent \u2014 from 1966 through 2007. He divided each of them into 10 equal chronological periods.He found that by far the biggest returns have occurred at the very beginning and the very end of bull market runs.What does this mean now? We don\u2019t know how much time the bull market that started in March 2009 has left. If it is now late in its life, exiting early will hurt long-term portfolio returns. And if the bull market is just getting started, despite its advanced chronological age, staying on the sidelines will be even worse.Long-term is the critical thought here. Based on history \u2014 admittedly, an imperfect guide \u2014 the market is highly likely to rise over extended periods, meaning stretches of at least 20 years.The long-term returns have been fabulous over the last 40 years. From the end of October 1978 through October this year, the S&P 500 returned an annualized 11.8 percent, with dividends included, for a cumulative return of 8,679 percent. That\u2019s 5.6 times the cumulative return of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Total Return index, which tracks the bond market. A stock bonanza that large may not recur, but substantial, positive returns seem a reasonable long-term bet.Despite a one-day bounce the day after the midterm elections, November so far has been a mediocre month for the market. I\u2019ve been wincing as I examine my own portfolio, even though I\u2019ve buffered my stock holdings with healthy allocations of bonds and cash.What\u2019s worse, some persuasive analysts marshal strong arguments that the main trend for stocks at the moment is downward. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that the bull market is already over, that it ended in September, and that a bear market has begun,\u201d said Doug Ramsey, the chief investment officer of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.Rising interest rates are a disturbing portent for stocks, he noted, and they are climbing rapidly now. \u201cThe rate of change, not the absolute level of interest rates, is what drives the market, and the rate of change has been very high,\u201d he said. It\u2019s probably not a coincidence, he said, that the stock market ran into trouble in late September, just as bond yields were reaching new highs for the year.Despite recent declines, Mr. Ramsey said, the American market is still overvalued. He calculated that stocks need to fall 25 percent below their Oct. 31 levels in order to reach their median valuations since 1970. Stocks outside the United States are about 10 percent underpriced compared with their historical valuations, he said, so there are better opportunities in market niches around the world.But while Mr. Ramsey is concerned about American stocks, he says it makes sense for long-term investors to stick with them and stocks elsewhere, too, for the standard reasons. He can\u2019t forecast short-term market returns accurately either, he said, and equities have provided superior returns over extended periods.In a nutshell, he advises: \u201cAsk yourself, what is the range of stock allocation you\u2019re comfortable with? Once you\u2019ve answered that, I\u2019d reduce the stock in your portfolio to the lowest level that is within that range.\u201dWhat proportion of stock anyone should hold is a personal and contentious decision, one that I\u2019ll return to. Mr. Ramsey said that older retirees should probably hold very little stock. For nearly everyone else, he puts the lower limit at about 30 percent of a portfolio that also includes bonds and cash, and the upper limit for stocks at about 70 percent, depending on market conditions. \u201cI\u2019d also be sure that I diversified internationally,\u201d he said.And with every paycheck, I\u2019m funneling more money into stocks, while maintaining that rough portfolio allocation. It was much more pleasant when stocks were rising relentlessly. But I remind myself that even if stocks fall for a long while, I\u2019ll be scooping up shares at cheaper prices. (Dollar-cost averaging is the fancy name for this kind of investing.) Eventually, if I wait long enough, low prices now will mean a bigger payoff later. That\u2019s what I believe, anyway.Because the financial future may not look anything like the past, this is an act of faith, based on history and hope. It\u2019s not a sure thing \u2014 but if stocks weren\u2019t risky, they wouldn\u2019t return as much as they do.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Fall, Wiping Out Gains for 2018", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market\u2019s gains for 2018 were erased on Tuesday, as a sell-off led by giant technology stocks continued. The renewed declines in the United States came after drops in Asia and Europe.The pain persisted for such companies on Tuesday with Apple and Amazon falling by more than 4 percent in early trading. But a new area of concern also flared after the retailer Target reported third-quarter sales and profit that missed Wall Street expectations.The softness in retail shares reflects growing investor concern that the strong American economy \u2014 which has so far shrugged off Federal Reserve interest rate increases and signs of weakness in China and Europe \u2014 is likely to face increasing challenges in 2019, as the impact of federal tax cuts and spending increases diminishes.Also weighing on stocks was a slump in crude oil prices, which hit their lowest point this year after dropping as much as 7 percent on Tuesday.Monday\u2019s slide in the United States had already spilled over into Europe and Asia before trading on Wall Street opened on Tuesday. By the end of the trading day, the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of eurozone blue-chips, had dropped more than 1.4 percent.Concerns about privacy lapses and mismanagement at technology companies weighed on stocks on Monday, adding to broader concerns about the impact of a trade war between the United States and China as well as signs of slowing growth around the globe.The pessimism continued in the Chinese markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen as the worries that hurt technology stocks in the United States hit stocks in other parts of the world.In Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, trade concerns helped to push the stocks of Chinese semiconductor makers and other big technology companies into the red. A drop in the stock price of the chip maker Nvidia several days ago after disappointing earnings may also have rattled investors in chip makers across China. The Chinese stock market is down by more than 20 percent so far this year.Shares of Tencent, the Chinese internet conglomerate, fell 3.3 percent in Hong Kong trading. A broader index of large Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong dropped by 1.6 percent, while the Hong Kong market closed the day down 2 percent.\u201cStocks look weak,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for Asia Pacific at the Dutch bank ING, wrote in a note to investors. \u201cOversupply in the semiconductor industry is an issue for Asia, and made worse by an apparent lack of demand for some well-known producers of high-tech products,\u201d he added.In Seoul, South Korea, and Taipei, Taiwan, the markets finished the day down nearly 1 percent.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from Hong Kong, Amie Tsang from London and Matt Phillips from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBased on a simplified extrapolation, it works out to about $122 gained a month for a typical family \u2014 which for some would be wiped out by higher mortgage rates.It helps to look beyond the overall economic data to understand this disconnect. After all, you can\u2019t eat G.D.P., and good jobs numbers aren\u2019t the same as a place to live.If you look instead at the actual financial lives of average middle-income families from 2016 \u2014 their incomes, spending, assets and debt \u2014 and how shifts since Election Day in 2016 would have been likely to affect them, you get a more mixed picture.Wages haven\u2019t risen much. Inflation has been low, helping keep the price of most staple goods down, though with gasoline prices a costly exception. The tax cut has left more money in most middle-class families\u2019 pockets, but only a bit. In terms of assets, the typical middle-income family has either zero or minimal holdings in the stock market, meaning the surge since November 2016 hasn\u2019t paid direct benefits. But a majority of households in this income bracket do carry some credit card debt, which has become more expensive amid rising interest rates.And in terms of housing costs, rents haven\u2019t risen much \u2014 but a sharp rise in mortgage rates has made homes less affordable for anyone looking to buy.Add it all up, and while the benefits of a surging economy, tax cuts and the rising stock market are real, they net out to a less favorable economic reality for a family in the middle of the income scale than the economic headlines might imply. This math is oversimplified \u2014 it doesn\u2019t reflect how families may have changed their spending and saving patterns in the last two years, and conflates different definitions of middle income. But the back-of-the-envelope results are revealing:If you take the benefits of higher wages and the lower taxes, subtracting higher costs for consumer goods and higher interest rates on credit card debt \u2014 it works out to a gain of $122 a month.The median pay for a full-time worker in the United States \u2014 now $893 a week \u2014 has risen enough since late 2016 to generate an extra $204 a month in pretax earnings for a household with a single earner, a 5.6 percent gain.Subtract payroll taxes and federal income taxes on that raise, and that family is looking at $158 a month in additional earnings. Wages may not be growing very fast for middle-income people, but the good news is that prices of most of the things they buy have been rising even more slowly.The Consumer Price Index excluding housing costs is up only 3.2 percent since November 2016, adding about $101 to the monthly expenses of a family with spending patterns that match those of an average family in the middle 20 percent of the income distribution that year.When you look at individual items that compose a large portion of family budgets, the relatively low inflation comes through.Grocery prices \u2014 \u201cfood at home\u201d in the Labor Department\u2019s terminology \u2014 are up only 1.1 percent in the nearly two years since November 2016, adding $3.33 to the monthly grocery bill for an average family in the middle 20 percent of income.Outside of food, the pattern mostly recurs. Electricity bills are up 0.42 percent, a mere 50 cents a month of additional expense. Apparel is slightly less expensive than it was in November 2016, saving a middle-class family $1.22 a month. An 11 percent drop in the price of cellphone service saves that family $10.48 each month.The big exception is gasoline; its price has been marching steadily higher since late 2016. The 23.5 percent run-up in the price of motor fuels adds $37.38 to the typical family\u2019s monthly expenses.When it comes to housing, it matters a lot whether you\u2019re renting and planning to continue renting; renting but seeking to buy a home; or already own one.For renters who plan to stay renters, costs are rising modestly, just like overall inflation \u2014 3 percent since November 2016, tacking an extra $26.54 onto monthly costs for the average renter.Homeowners typically have their monthly mortgage costs already set. Their wealth \u2014 the value of their home \u2014 has risen a bit in two years. The median sale price for a home in the United States was $214,000 in November 2016, according to data from Zillow, and the national appreciation rate since then implies such a house would now be worth $230,000.Things are trickier for a renter looking to buy a home, because of rising mortgage rates. A side effect of the surging economy and deficit-increasing tax cuts has been higher rates, which means that even though home prices aren\u2019t up all that much in the last two years, the cost for a buyer needing credit is considerably higher.The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.5 percent at election time two years ago, and is now 4.83 percent. Combined with the rise in the price of the median home, a middle-income American family looking to buy with 20 percent down would be looking at a monthly mortgage payment that is $196 a month higher now than in November 2016, wiping out gains from higher wages and lower taxes.The Trump administration has pointed to the booming stock market as evidence of success: The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has returned about 29 percent, including reinvested dividends, since November 2016.But middle-income families typically have minimal direct exposure to the stock market. Their financial holdings tend to be modest at best, meaning that rising stock prices create only a small wealth increase.Among middle-income families in 2016, only 52 percent held stocks either directly or indirectly, such as through a mutual fund. And of those 52 percent, median stock holdings were only $15,000. (That would be up to around $19,000 now if they left the money in an S.&P. 500 index fund since then without making further contributions.)Stock investments are much more a feature of upper-income brackets. The same survey showed that 94.7 percent of families in the top 10 percent of income held stocks, with a median value of $363,400.Many middle-income Americans, 84.3 percent of them, do tend to hold some form of debt. And rising interest rates in the Trump economy \u2014 a consequence of strong economic growth and Federal Reserve actions meant to prevent the economy from overheating \u2014 are making that debt more costly.In other words, debtors \u2014 and the average middle-class American fits that description \u2014 are paying a price for the surging economy even as they enjoy the benefits of higher pay and low inflation.Given the limitations in the data on which these calculations are based, it\u2019s best to think of this analysis as an impressionistic painting rather than a high-resolution photograph of the economic lives of the middle class.But it is a telling one, and helps explains the limits of a political message built on what seems to be a booming economy. It booms for some people more than others.To develop this portrait, we started with two government surveys from 2016: the Labor Department\u2019s Consumer Expenditure Survey, which provides details of household spending patterns broken down by income bracket, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, which details assets and debt.Then, we simply extrapolated forward to the fall of 2018. If those patterns among middle-class families held steady as they were buffeted by economywide forces, would they be better or worse off in the days before the midterms?This is assuming that they had no radical changes to their financial lives like getting a lucrative new job or winning the lottery, and that their wages, costs and investment performances plugged along at average rates over the last 23 months.Because of limitations in the data available for the recent past, we had to combine data sources that aren\u2019t really meant to be combined. We had to switch between different definitions of middle income, and we made some simplifying assumptions. (For example, we calculated how higher gasoline prices would increase people\u2019s spending without adjusting for how they might react to higher prices by driving less.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 Reasons Cryptocurrency Prices Are Plunging Again", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The news on Wall Street this week has been bleak: sharp declines, fears of a bear market and high-flying technology stocks that suddenly took a tumble.Traditional stock investors may be taking a beating, but they should be glad they didn\u2019t put their money in cryptocurrencies. As of Wednesday, the price of a Bitcoin had fallen about 25 percent in a week and was down more than 75 percent from its peak in December.Other digital tokens have fallen even more sharply in value.The latest declines are occurring almost a year after cryptocurrency markets, fueled by a rush of new, wealthy investors, went into overdrive. There are several factors behind the collapse in prices, with many of them the flip side of what drew people to cryptocurrencies in the first place.Relying on unregulated infrastructure and exchanges is risky.The activities of another large exchange, OKEx, have also led traders to question whether they can trust the institutions at the center of the cryptocurrency industry.Regulators are cracking down. Cryptocurrencies are managed by communities of developers. That can get messy.The people backing Bitcoin Cash subsequently had their own disagreements. This week, they splintered into two groups. In the software world, it\u2019s known as a fork: Bitcoin Cash was split into two new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV.The new forks have not altered the original Bitcoin. But they have created chaos in the trading markets, as exchanges struggle to define which coin customers are trading. The battles have also raised questions about one of the fundamental attractions of cryptocurrencies: their apparent scarcity.The creator of Bitcoin said only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. But how scarce do those 21 million Bitcoins seem if there are also 21 million tokens of each new copycat?As Naeem Aslam, the chief market analyst at the trading firm ThinkMarkets, put it in a note to clients this week: \u201cForking has become so common that it puts at risk the notion of limited supply altogether.\u201dCryptocurrencies were going to solve all kinds of real-world problems. But the real world hasn\u2019t had much use for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was supposed to make it easier to send payments instantly over international borders. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency network until recently, was going to create a kind of global super computer. Thousands of other tokens were also designed to be used for high-minded purposes. But so far, about the only thing the tokens have been used for is speculative trading.Governments could get into cryptocurrencies, and do a better job of managing them. But Ms. Lagarde added a note of caution. While saying cryptocurrencies could improve on current payment networks, she also said governments could manage them more effectively and eliminate the issues of trust that have hobbled them. The remarks could have a chilling effect on existing, nongovernmental tokens.Advertisement"}

In an earlier era, before computers and the internet, this advantage was largely brain power: Warren Buffett plucking a nugget from an annual report or George Soros making a seismic bet against a currency.Today, information is just another commodity. And the edge belongs to algorithms, data sets and funds that track indexes and countless other investment themes. This has been devastating for hedge fund and mutual fund managers who make their living trying to outsmart the stock market.With their business models under attack, they are searching for answers.

But in the recent period of low interest rates, his main mutual fund\u2019s performance has suffered.\u201cI failed to understand that in this period of zero rates, inferior companies would outperform high-quality companies,\u201d said Mr. Royce, who was part of a group that spent a long weekend talking books and big ideas with Mr. Parrish in Hawaii two years ago.Mr. Royce has embraced Mr. Parrish\u2019s core principles.

His first day was Aug. 28, 2001, and he was soon promoted in the tumult that followed the Sept. 11 attacks.

{"Headline": "Now, the Markets Can Worry About Other Things. Here\u2019s a List.", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesSo much for the midterms.Now the markets can start obsessing about gridlock, impeachment and the 2020 election.And they can resume worrying about bread-and-butter issues like corporate earnings, interest rates and the threat of rising tariffs and recession.Uncertainty about control of Congress has at last been lifted: Come January, the Democrats will run the House, while the Republicans will retain a slender majority in the Senate.From the standpoint of the markets, that welcome clarity on Wednesday set off the biggest one-day midterm election rally since 1982. And while investors were relieved that the results conformed with Wall Street expectations, longstanding financial concerns were made even more visible while introducing a series of other political problems.\u201cThe midterm results only highlight the ongoing political divisions within the country and the parties,\u201d John Raines, head of political risk at the business information service IHS Markit, and Lindsay Newman, a principal analyst there, wrote on Wednesday.Sooner rather than later, the focus of financial markets is likely to shift to new sets of political and economic concerns.On the political side, these include:\u25a0 The likelihood of investigations of the Trump administration in the House of Representatives and perhaps, down the road, impeachment proceedings.\u25a0 The prospect of congressional gridlock and vituperation.\u25a0 Rising partisan conflict as politicians prepare for 2020.At the same time, the markets will refocus on the bread-and-butter concerns that have weighed on stock and bond returns for much of the year.Among these worries are the possibilities that:\u25a0 The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases will slow the economy, puncturing the prices of risky assets like stocks, which have already begun to lose altitude.\u25a0 After a long recovery, the economy will fall into a recession in the next two years, pushing stocks into a deep bear market.This may seem like an excessively glum list, right after elections that sent the stock market into a bout of euphoria. If the markets abhor uncertainty, then these midterm elections were wonderfully reassuring.\u201cThe consensus was right,\u201d John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial, wrote on Wednesday. Wall Street generally viewed the election\u2019s broad outcome as highly probable and fairly desirable, though not the outcome thought most likely to produce the highest future stock returns.That would have been a Republican sweep with a large majority in the Senate as well as the House, leading to a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and cuts in programs like Social Security and Medicare.The UBS Global Wealth Management Chief Investment Office gamed out the various possibilities ahead of the election, concluding that such a sweep \u201cshould boost global stock markets, limit increases in long-term bond yields, and support the U.S. dollar.\u201dBut the data bears this out only when a Democrat has been president and Republicans have held either the House or the Senate. Since 1901, in all such cases, the Dow Jones industrial average has outperformed its long-term average, an analysis by Bespoke Investment Group shows. When a Republican has been president during a stretch of gridlock, the market has lagged.In the five previous congressional sessions since 1901 in which Republicans controlled the White House and the Senate while Democrats controlled the House \u2014 the political alignment in Washington starting in January \u2014 the annualized return has been a loss of 1.69 percent. That\u2019s not encouraging, though the data is too scanty to use \u201cas a blueprint for what to expect this time around,\u201d Bespoke said.But President Trump could demand that a deal on the Dreamers be paired with funding for his coveted border wall, an objective that many Democrats abhor.The stock market fell sharply during the truncated Nixon impeachment process, but that is likely because of the recession that began in November 1973. That downturn continued until March 1975, impairing the political prospects of President Gerald Ford, Nixon\u2019s successor.That is a reminder that while the stock market can withstand political stress, it is one of the many victims of recessions, which throw people out of work, destroy wealth and alter political destinies. A recession would be the market\u2019s biggest worry. It might become Mr. Trump\u2019s, as well.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

But that goal has been quietly abandoned. It struggles to compete with the Shenzhen bourse, which attracts start-ups to its ChiNext market. Hong Kong, too, increasingly woos the likes of Xiaomi.Shanghai, meanwhile, is an overweight state-owned dinosaur. But after years of lobbying Beijing for help attracting tech outfits, it finally got its wish.A long-promised registration-based listing system will replace the tedious process of applying to the China Securities Regulatory Commission for permission to sell shares. Authorities closely manage the pace and pricing of initial public offerings, resulting in a backlog of hundreds of companies. When indexes correct, the commission also tends to freeze approvals because mom-and-pop investors tend to think new issues suck money away from existing stocks.The system warps China\u2019s primary market. Price guidance, at 23 times earnings, has resulted in huge first-day trading jumps, with shares almost always rising by the maximum 44 percent. That, plus scarcity, turns I.P.O.s into one-way bets with double-digit returns. The difficulty of listing also makes tickers themselves valuable, so shares in dual-listed companies such as Bank of China cost an average 20 percent more on the mainland than in Hong Kong.Letting companies decide when to list, and for how much, would eliminate such distortions \u2014 but not painlessly. Companies that are most likely to list on the new Shanghai board will be small and private, and those businesses are not prone to best-in-class corporate governance. The history of new markets in China also suggests there is a high chance for shareholder abuse in early the early days. Indexes could suffer if retail buyers react by selling.The biggest risk, however, is that short-term pain causes officials to reverse this long-overdue liberalization, as they have done before. For now, that makes the Shanghai board itself less a more of a \u201chold\u201d than a \u201cbuy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s a warning shot for all debt investors. American companies owe more money than ever, and the quality of their loans and bonds has deteriorated. Rising interest rates and slowing growth could make this a big problem.The ailing $75 billion conglomerate is an extreme case, but it exemplifies much of what has happened in corporate America and around the world over the past decade. Historically low interest rates fueled a massive borrowing boom, enabling healthy companies to expand operations or buy back shares, and zombies to keep staggering along.United States nonfinancial corporate debt stands at a record level of more than 73 percent of gross domestic product, according to the Bank for International Settlements. It never exceeded 65 percent before the 2008 financial crisis. France\u2019s corporate debt-to-G.D.P. ratio has risen by nearly a third over the past decade, and China\u2019s by more than two-thirds.This growing quantity has been accompanied by a marked decline in quality. G.E., which recently lost its coveted single-A credit rating, is again illustrative. Many other U.S. companies have been downgraded. As a result, the debt of those carrying triple-B ratings \u2014 the lowest investment-grade category \u2014 more than doubled from pre-crisis days to a record $2.7 trillion at the end of 2017, according to S&P Global Ratings.At the same time the United States junk-bond market has swelled to more than $1.2 trillion and leveraged loans now total $1.3 trillion, much of it in so-called covenant-lite products with few investor protections. That prompted Senator Elizabeth Warren on Thursday to warn that leveraged lending \u201cexhibits many of the characteristics\u201d of the subprime mortgage boom that triggered the 2008 financial crisis.Up until now, many investors have shrugged off such risks, comforted by surging corporate earnings \u2014 which were up nearly 29 percent for the S&P 500 index in the third quarter of 2018. But earnings growth is expected to drop into single digits next year, according to estimates from the data and insights company Refinitiv . Meanwhile the expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve next month will ratchet up the cost of borrowing.The numbers don\u2019t add up to a crisis yet, but the trend is heading in that direction.Advertisement"}

Lael Brainard, a fellow Fed governor, said they would \u201cweaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system.\u201d But Greg Baer of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said they don\u2019t go far enough.More details from Kate Conger, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Katie Benner of the NYT:\u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel that we\u2019re unequal or we\u2019re not respected anymore,\u201d said Claire Stapleton, 33, a product marketing manager at Google\u2019s YouTube who helped call for the walkout. \u201cGoogle\u2019s famous for its culture. But in reality we\u2019re not even meeting the basics of respect, justice and fairness for every single person here.\u201dIt\u2019s the latest sign of how the tech industry\u2019s rank and file employees are embracing activism \u2014 and pushing back against their leaders. Workers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies have recently spoken out about their employers\u2019 willingness to work on military projects, the gender pay gap and other issues.Last month was painful for investors. At its worst, the S.&P. 500 was down more than 9 percent, though it rebounded in the last few days to finish October with losses of around 7 percent.Only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. The S.&P. 500 has been dragged down disproportionately by smaller, domestically focused companies, cyclically sensitive industrial firms and global manufacturers like Caterpillar.And he also lists the issues that spooked investors:President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.The streaming service has changed its stance on not showing movies in theaters before streaming them. It will screen three movies that it wants to be considered for Oscars, including Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cRoma,\u201d in theaters for several weeks before they go online.Netflix\u2019s modified distribution approach should persuade more theaters to participate. But the move is really about winning Oscars and wooing Hollywood talent.Academy Awards voters \u2014 unlike the Emmys electorate \u2014 have been cool to Netflix. Heavyweights like Steven Spielberg, for instance, have chafed at the company\u2019s policy of streaming movies immediately, suggesting that the service\u2019s original films should be considered television. Top directors like Mr. Cuar\u00f3n, who won an Oscar in 2014 for directing \u201cGravity,\u201d also want their work to be seen on big screens, which has made it harder for Netflix to compete with studios for projects.But the move will give Netflix a new headache: explaining to its other filmmakers why their productions didn\u2019t get a theatrical release.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Widows Are Faring Better Financially. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlthough they became widows 20 years apart and at opposite end of the age spectrum, Kayla Murdoch and Mary Thomas are strikingly similar in their approaches to their financial lives.Ms. Murdoch of Manchester, N.H., is a 28-year-old paramedic whose husband died suddenly in 2016.Ms. Thomas of Cincinnati is a retired schoolteacher in her 80s who lost her husband in 1996.Both managed to steer quickly past the familiar story of the widow left financially vulnerable when her husband dies, though, by setting their intentions on not only staying afloat independently, but also prospering.And now, the number of widows like them appears to be on the rise.Alice Zulkarnain, one of three researchers behind the center\u2019s study, said the financial climb was rooted in advances in women\u2019s work histories and education levels.But widows still have a way to go before they catch up to women whose spouses are still alive, only 2.6 percent of whom are poor, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s figures.Kathleen M. Rehl, a financial adviser who travels the country offering money workshops to the demographic she refers to as \u201cthe sisterhood,\u201d said attitudes like Ms. Murdoch\u2019s and Ms. Thomas\u2019s may be helping.\u201cWidows are becoming more confident financially,\u201d said Dr. Rehl, 71, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes training fellow advisers to work with widows. Her interest in widows is personal: She became one 12 years ago. \u201cEven though I had my own business, I felt like a bag lady,\u201d she said.Among her goals is to encourage gains in financial literacy through helping advisers understand widowhood\u2019s side effects. \u201cYou get Jell-O brain,\u201d she said. \u201cIt affects you cognitively. You need to work with someone who knows how to talk to you.\u201dAs Ms. Murdoch and Ms. Thomas found, though, options for avoiding the feeling of helplessness are not limited to holding the hand of a sensitive, expensive financial adviser.Local investment clubs are a third.Eve Lewis, a 64-year-old widow in Milford, Ohio, needed no convincing to join a nearby nine-woman investment club just after she lost her husband to cancer in 2008.She had nurtured a flair for finance throughout her 25-year marriage. \u201cI would tell my husband about all the different stocks I was interested in, and he would listen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was really my interest.\u201dTeaming up with other like-minded women nearby helped her further her investment skills.\u201cI figured, I have more time now, I\u2019d better join a club,\u201d she said.The experience has paid dividends beyond the $50 each throws in at every gathering.\u201cWe meet once a month to discuss our portfolio, and everybody has a stock they study, so we have brief reports,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the things we try to avoid is having too many stocks and too little invested in each.\u201d\u201cBecause the market is up, we\u2019re doing well,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. But as with the famous Beardstown Ladies, a group of mostly widowed women in Illinois who started an investment club in the 1980s and went on to inspire women across the country with folksy books about smart investing, the goal isn\u2019t just making money.So it is with Ms Lewis\u2019s group. \u201cA lot of people think they can\u2019t do this, that investing is too complicated,\u201d said Ms. Lewis, whose goal is to maintain what she called her middle-class lifestyle through her investments. \u201cBut if you join an investment club, you can learn for as little as $20 a month.\u201dMs. Thomas credits her family\u2019s multigenerational financial know-how for what she learned at a similar group. Just after her husband died in 1996, a friend from church suggested that she take a class in personal finance at a local university or join an investment club. She decided to join a club.\u201cThe president was a taskmaster. I had to learn fast,\u201d she said. Her willingness to study eventually led to what she called better than average financial gains, and she is now financially secure through investing.When the group disbanded in the mid-2000s, Ms. Thomas wasn\u2019t finished sharing her self-made stock-picking skills. She started a new club. But instead of recruiting acquaintances, she enlisted her four grandchildren, now 22 to 35. Five years ago, they paid for a family cruise to Alaska with club earnings.\u201cThat\u2019s when we really appreciated it,\u201d she said.Ms. Zulkarnain said the average age of widows in 2014, the year on which she and her colleagues based their study, was 67.\u201cIt\u2019s a very accessible education in investment,\u201d she said.Her goal is to retire in her late 30s through a combination of investments and working overtime. \u201cSo far, everything I\u2019ve learned through websites has worked,\u201d she said.She credits a simple strategy \u2014 one recommended by lots of investment advisers. \u201cI invest in funds, instead of individual stocks, which means less risk.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing complicated and nothing intimidating about it.\u201dPat Steele Nielsen, 60, of Portland, Ore., also was equipped to handle herself financially when both of her husbands died.\u201cI had always taken care of the bills,\u201d she said. But when her second husband died last year, the financial terrain was more difficult to navigate than when her first husband died in 1997.\u201cWe had a lot more assets, pension accounts and other accounts that had to be dealt with,\u201d she said.\u201cWild Money,\u201d one such course, \u201cmade me face reality in terms of how I\u2019m going to live,\u201d Ms. Steele Nielsen said. \u201cIt made me look at my priorities, like do I want to travel, or do I want to move, in conjunction with what my income is going to be.\u201dDespite what may be an upswing in widows\u2019 actively lifting themselves out of financial straits, Ms. Hounsell said most were still struggling. \u201cThe ones we see don\u2019t want to be doing investments or anything like that,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of them are in bad shape.\u201dBarbara Shapiro, a financial adviser in Dedham, Mass., who started attracting a local following among widows after she became one herself two years ago, is familiar with that type. But she is hopeful.\u201cMany of the women I see abdicated their financial responsibilities during their marriage and they\u2019re really at a loss,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make mistakes. But are they helpless little old ladies? No. They\u2019re asking questions. They want to learn.\u201d\u25a0 Don\u2019t rush. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018Must I decide today, or can it wait until I\u2019m thinking more clearly?\u2019\u201d Dr. Rehl said. \u201cFor example, pay monthly bills, but delay investing life insurance money. Don\u2019t make hasty decisions about your house.\u201d\u25a0 Beware of financial predators. Often, unscrupulous types to try to sell financial products and services to the recently bereaved. Be wary.\u25a0 Take stock. Those emerging from early grief should analyze what they own versus what they owe. \u201cCompare income and expenses, and include bank accounts, savings, retirement plans, other investments and your house. Debts include credit cards, education, car and mortgage loans. Are changes needed now that you\u2019re single?\u201d\u25a0 Don\u2019t be a purse. \u201cFamily members and others may ask for money. Explain you\u2019re still figuring out new goals.\u201d\u25a0 Consider working with a financial planner to build confidence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Markets Are Revealing the Sum of All Risks ", "Date": "2018-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s not a main reason for the sell-off, but a widening sense of unease that several types of problems are rising at once. The most telling thing about the pummeling that the stock market has taken recently, and especially this week, is that there\u2019s no simple single cause to point to.That reflects the fundamental economic risk for 2019 and beyond. There isn\u2019t a lone caution on the horizon that can be identified and monitored and that policymakers can respond to.Rather, markets reflect a widening sense of unease that several different types of risks are rising at once \u2014 and that although any one of them might be manageable, together they could lead the economy into serious trouble in 2019 or 2020.And while stocks are down 9.5 percent since early October, the yield on longer-term Treasury bonds is at about the same level. The bond market tends to be more closely tethered to the direction of the overall economy than stocks, so that suggests investors in recent weeks have not radically reshaped their view on future growth.But when you tick through the list of fears causing the sell-off, it\u2019s easy to see why stock investors in particular are getting jittery, driving steep market drops Monday and Tuesday.The giant tech companies that have propelled the market for years are facing risks of slowing growth (especially Apple) and new regulation (especially Facebook). Oil prices are plummeting, sending the share prices of energy companies downward. Investors are starting to worry that companies with heavy debt loads could struggle to handle them, with General Electric as Exhibit A. The trade war, long at a steady simmer, could boil over at any time.But before running for the hills in panic, there are a few things worth considering. First, bad things happen all the time in the economy, and in markets. Usually, the damage is localized to the industries directly affected.Bondholders and credit ratings agencies lost confidence in those industrial icons\u2019 corporate debt, causing plenty of pain for the automakers\u2019 employees and stock prices. But the overall economy kept humming along. (It was a recession rooted in other sectors, three years later, that dragged American automakers toward bankruptcy.)Similarly, it\u2019s easy to look at the slowdown in home sales and building activity, for example, and fear that it could lead to a repeat of the 2008 recession.But in that episode, housing starts peaked in January 2006. For nearly two years, the economy largely held up; as housing contracted, other sectors grew. It was only after the housing downturn triggered a financial crisis that a recession began in December 2007.In terms of a slowing global economy, in 1998 an emerging markets crisis seemed to endanger a booming American economy enough that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates late that year to try to guard against damage. As it turned out, 1999 was a boom year.What these episodes all show is that adjustments \u2014 whether in the credit markets, the housing market or emerging markets \u2014 tend to cause huge economic disruption only if there are compounding factors, or inadequate policy responses.The implicit message: If all of these negative forces really do start to harm growth, the Fed will slow the pace of rate increases, rather than stick to some preordained path.The great fear for the economy in the next couple of years shouldn\u2019t be the risks we know about.

{"Headline": "Turbulent Stock Market Is Flashing a Warning About the Economy", "Date": "2018-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnemployment is near lows not seen in half a century. The American economy is set for its best year since 2005. Large corporations are producing giant profits. Even wages are starting to rise.And the stock markets are a mess.On Tuesday, the S&P 500-stock index turned negative for the year, stoking fears that one of the longest bull markets in history could be at risk.The stock market\u2019s struggles may seem incongruous against the backdrop of strong economic growth. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data.In recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that President Trump\u2019s global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits. Commodities and the companies that depend on them have been pummeled by the prospect of weaker demand should the global economy slow. Five tech giants \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix \u2014 have shed more than $800 billion in market value since the end of August, the fallout from slowing growth and regulatory scrutiny.The S&P 500 closed on Tuesday at 2,641.89, down 1.8 percent. Other markets also flashed warnings, with oil dropping by 6.8 percent, falling deeper into bear territory.The pressure eased on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 rising about half a percent in early trading after Asian markets ended the day largely positive and shares in Britain, France and Germany began the day higher.The sell-off doesn\u2019t mean the United States is headed into a recession. The stock market suffered several sharp stumbles in recent years before climbing to new highs on the back of booming corporate profits and strong economic growth.But the recent market drop could portend problems. In 2018, a hefty dose of fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax cuts, allowed the United States to shake off the growth worries in China, Europe and the rest of the world. It won\u2019t have the same potency next year, leaving the American economy and stocks more vulnerable to a range of risks, including a slowing global economy and continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\u201cI think there are very clear signs that investors are beginning to worry about weaker growth in the coming year or so, and how that\u2019s going to feed through to corporate earnings,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.Mr. Trump, on Tuesday, pointed to the health of the economy and instead blamed the Fed for contributing to the sell-off. Mr. Trump, who has taken credit for the rising stock market, has been critical of the rate increases, saying they undermine growth.\u201cI would like to see the Fed with a lower interest rate,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the rate is too high.\u201dUntil recently, investors were willing to ignore the domestic political dramas, geopolitical turmoil and other issues clouding the outlook for American companies. Now they appear jittery, selling stocks at small signs that vague risks may become realities.So far this year, strong growth and deep corporate tax cuts have supercharged corporate profits. Once all the results are tallied up, the third-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up more than 28 percent from a year earlier \u2014 outpacing previous quarters, according to the financial data company Refinitiv.But those numbers haven\u2019t satisfied the markets. Investors have instead grown concerned about risks they face both from continued economic strength and, alternatively, an economic slowdown. Either path could upend a nearly decade-long rally that has lifted the S&P 500 nearly 300 percent.Strong economic growth at home would most likely mean a prolonged rise in interest rates and rising costs in areas like wages, which would hurt corporate profitability. Weaker growth abroad would cut into sales.In recent days, both forms of fear have fed the market decline.On Tuesday, shares of the retailer Target dropped by more than 10 percent, on worries that rising costs \u2014 from increased wages to higher prices for the Chinese goods facing tariffs \u2014 could continue to crimp profits. Investors also dumped shares of Kohl\u2019s and TJX, the owner of T. J. Maxx, which both saw freight costs eat into earnings.Apple continued its slide on worries about softening demand. The tech giant tumbled 4.8 percent after Goldman Sachs equity analysts cut their price target, citing deteriorating demand, especially in China.China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of oil, has also been weighing on commodities. The price of crude, now just above $53 a barrel, has fallen nearly 30 percent since early October. On Tuesday, energy was the worst-performing part of the S&P 500, with companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and the oil-field services provider Schlumberger losing more than 2.5 percent.Oil prices have been sliding despite signs that major producers like Saudi Arabia are considering cutting production. And that has amplified worries that China and the rest of the global economy may be in a weaker spot than markets realized.Last quarter, China\u2019s growth slowed to its lowest level since 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis. Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, is also looking shaky, with the economy contracting in the third quarter, amid a slowdown in trade and investment.Germany, the powerhouse behind Europe, also shrank unexpectedly during the third quarter as trade slumped and car production faltered. If Germany stumbles, it will add to the economic and political turmoil in a region already dealing with Britain\u2019s chaotic exit from the European Union and Italy\u2019s budget dispute with the bloc.In 2018, America\u2019s economy proved largely immune to such issues. But the global slowdown could eventually spill over into the United States, particularly as the impact of this year\u2019s tax cuts fades in the coming years. Economists expect that domestic growth, which is close to 3 percent this year, will slow to 2 percent by 2020, according to estimates published by FactSet.For the economy, that is a respectable performance. But for investors, a slowdown is likely to be uncomfortable.Disappointing data and earnings updates could ignite periodic panics over the threat of recession, even if remote. Markets are likely to be much choppier that than they\u2019ve been in recent years. Gains could be lower.In other words, the market may be messy for a while.\u201cI think this is what a low-return environment starts to feel like,\u201d said Joe Davis, chief economist with Vanguard. \u201cThe past five years, although entirely welcome from an investment standpoint, is clearly unsustainable.\u201dClifford Krauss and Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It is a bad time of the year to sell new equity and Tencent has already pared back its plans. A subdued deal would confirm fears that the window for sizable offerings is closing fast.A global stock sell-off has already hit Tencent\u2019s plan to spin off its majority-owned streaming arm, which owns the QQ Music app. In May, the $354 billion gaming and social media company hoped to raise as much as $4 billion in a deal that would have valued Tencent Music Entertainment at $25 billion, sources told International Financing Review. The Chinese company delayed its October plan to go public after halving the size of its planned offer, according to Reuters.Large investors in the United States prefer to shy away from big deals during the festive period. Just three companies have launched December New York offerings of more than $1 billion in the past decade, according to data from Refinitiv. Tencent would stretch the precedent: The Financial Times says shares of the music unit will start trading on Dec. 12, later than any of these earlier year-end offerings.Other Chinese technology outfits rushing to market have had to lower their valuations. The Alibaba-backed parenting site, Babytree, has just priced its Hong Kong debut at the bottom of the marketed range, valuing it at $1.5 billion, compared to the $2 billion it was pegged at earlier this year. The online travel agent Tongcheng-Elong, which counts Tencent as its largest shareholder, set its I.P.O. valuation almost 30 percent lower than in a May funding round.The execution risk hardly seems worthwhile. Tencent Music doesn\u2019t obviously need fresh funds: The unit is already profitable and had roughly 9.5 billion yuan, or around $1.4 billion, in cash as of June, according to its I.P.O. prospectus.Anything less than a strong and compelling deal before New Year\u2019s will signal a gloomy year ahead for others waiting to I.P.O.Advertisement"}

Try Making It a Game", "Date": "2018-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringWhen Gabi Stack imagines herself at 75, she pictures a life that ideally includes a move to Germany, lots of travel and ample time for lingering at cafes with friends.So she was startled last week when she received a digitally \u201caged\u201d photo of herself that didn\u2019t match her self-image of an active, independent person. \u201cI truly hope I don\u2019t look like the picture,\u201d she said, noting extra wrinkles creasing her forehead and a \u201cfatter\u201d face. \u201cI\u2019ll find out in 20 years if I look like that.\u201dMrs. Stack, now a 55-year-old mental health care coordinator for the State of Hawaii, volunteered as a lark with Prudential Financial, her retirement plan administrator.Despite the shock of the photo, Mrs. Stack still thought taking it was fun. And that reaction is precisely what many employers and retirement plan sponsors are aiming for, with new tactics to entice workers into planning for retirement \u2014 a task almost universally acknowledged as unpleasant. Employers are luring their workers with new techniques like applying computer programs to artificially age photos and using games and quizzes to engage them on retirement and financial topics.Brian Moto, chairman of the board for the State of Hawaii Deferred Compensation Plan, which helped organize the benefits fair, said AgingBooth could be off-putting, but useful even for those who watched from a distance. \u201cSome of them cautiously say, as I did, \u2018Oh, no, thank you, I really don\u2019t want to see myself,\u2019\u201d Mr. Moto said. \u201cFor a lot of people aging is something serious \u2014 it\u2019s not always easy either to accept or deal with, but at least we got them to think and pause.\u201dSome employers are reporting greater success at reaching their workers using games and quizzes rather than more traditional brochures and spreadsheets. With this in mind, the retirement plan provider and investment firm TIAA created a competition for its clients, Square Up Your Savings and Financial IQ, held at more than 7,000 plan participant offices around the country.For one game in particular, men and millennial players appeared especially motivated by competition, with men logging 40 percent and millennials 50 percent more clicks on their rankings than other demographic groups, according to TIAA. Millennial employees, too, showed greater interest in the games than older workers did \u2014 in one instance, employees 24 to 34 years old represented the highest number of repeat users, logging eight quizzes per player, the company said.Stephanie Maksymiw is one of those avid players. Among the first to take TIAA\u2019s quiz, she understood the difference between stocks and bonds and was confident her knowledge about investing would help her ace the financial questions in the online competition held at her workplace, SRC Inc. But to her surprise, when she took the quiz for the first time, the results revealed big gaps in her understanding, like the definitions of bear and bull markets. Determined to improve her score, Ms. Maksymiw played every day for three weeks, ultimately getting an \u201cabove average\u201d ranking compared with her colleagues.\u201cIt was competitive,\u201d recalled Ms. Maksymiw, 37, a quality systems analyst SRC, a military research nonprofit based in Syracuse, about how she and her co-workers tracked their rankings on their retirement plan sponsor TIAA\u2019s public scoreboard.Preparing for retirement can be a confusing and overwhelming task, and three-fifths of non-retirees reported \u201clittle or no comfort in managing their investments\u201d in self-directed retirement savings accounts, according to the Fed report, in which 12,246 people were surveyed. On average, those surveyed answered fewer than three of five basic financial literacy questions correctly.While there is some question about the efficacy of education alone to improve financial decision-making, investment firms behind the efforts say games can bring more people into a conversation about retirement planning, making it less stressful and dull.David Ray, a TIAA senior managing director, said the games\u2019 competitive aspect helped draw people in. \u201cIt\u2019s just human nature\u201d to compare yourself with others, he said. \u201cThe fact that we maintain a leader board stokes those competitive fires even more \u2014 you can move along the scale from a more novice rating to an expert rating \u2014 everyone wants to be an expert.\u201d\u201cWhat worries me is people have this intuition that it\u2019s all about information,\u201d according to Dan Ariely, the James B. Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University. \u201cInformation alone is very unlikely to help,\u201d he said.Other organizations, such as the nonprofit Commonwealth based in Boston, are aiming to bridge the gap between thinking and doing. With support from the Treasury Department, Commonwealth tested an app aimed at helping lower-income high school students, called Ramp It Up, in which players complete college and career-readiness projects like creating a financial aid account, or searching for scholarships, in order to advance in the game.Ms. Maksymiw, for one, said the games helped her decide to double her contribution to her company\u2019s retirement plan, and she now reads her quarterly statements. After yielding much of the responsibility for managing her savings and investments to her father \u2014 \u201che\u2019s been doing that since before I was born,\u201d she said \u2014 she now says her goal is to take over more of the decisions for her own money outside her retirement plan.\u201cYour future self is an abstract concept,\u201d Dr. Sims said. Even a simple writing exercise focusing on the ways you would like to take care of an older you can help people perceive their future more clearly. This could help spur planning for retirement, shifting a discussion away from the downsides of aging to, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a scary, frightening thing but this is something I look forward to,\u201d she said.It was this idea of an exciting new chapter that motivated Mrs. Stack to move up her target retirement age a few years ago, to 58 from 62, and prompted her to take a hard look at her expenses and income in retirement.\u201cOf course you can always have more money, but how much do you really need?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd what is more important, to enjoy your life or to amass these large amounts of savings but you have nothing to show for it?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bond Market Signals Weakening Case for Interest Rate Increases", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA measure of investors\u2019 expectation for inflation over the next five years has fallen in recent weeks. The difference between the yields on five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, and the corresponding Treasuries hit 1.74 percentage points Wednesday, its lowest level of the year, according to Tradeweb. That spread is effectively the market\u2019s forecast of where inflation is heading, and it\u2019s down from 2.04 points at the start of October.Inflation is core to the Fed\u2019s mission. The central bank has a dual mandate of spurring full employment and keeping prices stable. This market\u2019s forecast for inflation is below the Fed\u2019s target for inflation of 2 percent.Critics of measures like the one above say it\u2019s too sensitive to short-term moves in markets such as oil (and, indeed, the most recent pullback in inflation expectations has corresponded with the tumble in oil prices over the past nine weeks).Still, the recent slide in the expectations is an indication that investors have grown more concerned about global growth and less worried that the United States\u2019 economy will overheat and cause a jump in inflation.The Fed has pressed ahead with rate increases this year as the economy has strengthened. Already, the central bank has raised its main policy rate three times and is expected to do so again next month.But in recent weeks, Fed officials also have appeared to soften their tone about future rate increases. On Wednesday, stocks surged after remarks by the central bank\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, were interpreted by investors to suggest the Fed could be nearing the end of its push to lift interest rates.Mr. Powell said interest rate increases were approaching a \u201cneutral\u201d level at which it would no longer provide a stimulus to economic activity. The description contrasted with his statement in October, following the last change in the benchmark rate, that the rate was still \u201ca long way\u201d from neutral.The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, has ticked up this year and was at 2 percent in September.Advertisement"}

Then, in its latest earnings call, Ralph Lauren said it had opened 10 additional stores in mainland China in the last quarter, putting it on track to open more than 50 by the end of 2019. And Coach said it would stage its first runway show in China on Dec. 8, a blockbuster spectacle and after-party titled \u201cCoach Lights Up Shanghai.\u201dChina\u2019s great luxury promise appears to have the sector\u2019s biggest power players well and truly in its thrall. But in the background, dark clouds have also been gathering.A brewing trade war with the United States, the weakening renminbi and the sputtering growth of China\u2019s economy in recent months all have executives on edge. During the fall Golden Week, a holiday period around the Oct. 1 National Day observance when many Chinese consumers splurge on travel and luxury goods, sales grew at the slowest pace since 2000, according to data from China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce.The painful luxury industry downturn that occurred worldwide between 2013 and 2016 in the wake of a Chinese government clampdown on corruption and a spate of terrorist attacks in Europe \u2014 ending years of soaring sales growth \u2014 is still fresh in the minds of many. Could a similar situation be about to unfold again?An inflection point came in early October, at the end of Golden Week, when social media posts showing emptied shopping bags, luggage searches and snaking lines at airport customs checks suggested that the state was cracking down on the practice known as daigou, when Chinese travelers buy high-end merchandise on trips abroad and sell the items at a profit after they return home. Spooked that the appetite for luxury goods in China could tip into a rapid slump, investor jitters prompted a global market sell-off, largely hitting European players such as LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Kering, Richemont, Burberry and Prada. Companies in the United States, like Tapestry and Tiffany & Co., also felt the strain.Some brands have sounded notes of caution about the current and future state of Chinese consumer confidence.\u201cIn the past few months I would say there has been a slowing down of consumption, and probably the Chinese consumer is becoming more careful in what he or she does,\u201d said Ermenegildo Zegna, chief executive of the Italian men\u2019s luxury house of the same name. \u201cI am more cautious than three months ago. For next year, we are going to plan a conservative budget because there are many uncertainties in the air and you have to be realistic.\u201dSo what will come next for a sector that Bain & Co. still predicts will grow by 6 to 8 percent, to \u20ac281 billion from \u20ac276 billion, this year? Given the money still being plowed into the region by brands and investors alike, could the stock market be overreacting?\u201cClearly stocks were hit dramatically in past weeks, with investors keen to avoid being stung as they were in the last downturn,\u201d said Erwan Rambourg, global co-head of consumer and retail research at HSBC. \u201cHowever, it is possible that these macro fears are overextended and we can expect more of a soft landing.\u201cWe believe the current \u2018slowdown\u2019 is more to do with being a period of normalization, after two years of phenomenal growth,\u201d he added. \u201cThe sector decline will not be on as steep a slope as the market seems to expect.\u201dThomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods equity research at Citigroup, concurred. He noted that many luxury brands had re-evaluated their expansion strategies in China in recent years, particularly around retail networks, targeted digital marketing and pricing, so their business \u2014 and bottom lines \u2014 are better protected in the event of another cyclical downturn.He also added that luxury\u2019s latest bull run had not been wholly dependent on Chinese spending: The American market has improved significantly in the last year, while many brands have posted double-digit sales growth in both Europe and Japan.\u201cClearly China has been the white-hot engine for luxury growth lately \u2014 but this is also a global story, and price harmonization across markets is better than it was a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Chauvet said. \u201cThe central question now should be whether international demand drivers are still in place to support a healthy level of sales and earnings growth over the next 12 months as China moderates.\u201dHowever, some market observers have highlighted positive consumer trends in China. As the country looks for ways to shore up its domestic economy, the government crackdown on daigou and the lowering of import duties this summer to encourage consumers to make purchases at home rather than chasing lower prices abroad are likely to make their mark, according to Angela Wang, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group and co-author, with the Chinese investment holding conglomerate Tencent, of a recently published study on China\u2019s luxury market. She said that, although Chinese customers now are responsible for 32 percent of luxury goods sales worldwide, that number is still expected to grow to 40 percent by 2024 and power 75 percent growth of the global market. Unsurprisingly, millennials \u2014 particularly educated women \u2014 will be the driving force.\u201cLuxury shoppers in China have an average age of 28, a majority have college degrees and are far better educated than their parents,\u201d Ms. Wang said, noting that more than 50 percent of luxury customers now lived in second- and third-tier cities like Tianjin and Dalian, bolstering the importance of online platforms as there are few premium malls in those locations.\u201cSocial shopping is now 11 percent of total luxury commerce in China and growing at a tremendous rate,\u201d she added. \u201cAll this momentum won\u2019t disappear in the wake of the recent slowdown.\u201dThe fact that many major players have continued to double down on their presence in China despite the recent uncertainty suggests that long-term opportunities will continue to trump short-term volatility. Richemont\u2019s deal with Alibaba will allow sites like Net-a-Porter to begin business on Luxury Pavilion, an invitation-only luxury platform on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall site \u2014 even as many Western brands are continuing to be cautious in their embrace of Chinese e-commerce and alliances with local internet platforms, primarily because of fears of counterfeiting and the risk of diluting the exclusivity of their products. Also, the action follows an investment last year by JD.com, Alibaba\u2019s rival, in the luxury online marketplace Farfetch.\u201cOur digital offering in China is in its infancy,\u201d said Johann Rupert, Richemont\u2019s chairman, \u201cand we believe that partnering with Alibaba will enable us to become a significant and sustainable online player in this market.\u201dWestern companies are not the only ones looking farther afield to secure growth prospects.Despite the vast market on their doorsteps, a handful of Chinese luxury investors have been exploring a new market of their own in search of greater returns: Europe. This year, Shandong Ruyi bought the Swiss leather brand Bally while Fosun acquired the French fashion house Lanvin, both moves devised to reap profits from their countrymen\u2019s appetite for luxury marques that otherwise would go into the pockets of Western companies.The day after the event, Michael Evans, president of Alibaba Group, talked about it at The New York Times International Luxury Conference, held in Hong Kong: \u201cPart of the reason we invest so much into the infrastructure of Singles Day \u2014 a day where we delivered over one billion packages in 24 hours this year \u2014 is because we believe a time will come when we will be operating at that scale every single day.\u201dNow, eyes are turned to see how consumer desire for high-ticket handbags, ready-to-wear and sneakers \u2014 as well as lower-priced items such as cosmetics and fragrances \u2014 will fare during the important fourth quarter of the retail calendar.\u201cTo say that the luxury sector is entering another perfect storm would be too aggressive,\u201d said Mr. Chauvet, of Citigroup. \u201cThen again, when consumers don\u2019t feel a sense of optimism or feel worried about the world around them, luxury purchases are often the first to go. For now, the industry mode has got to be \u2018wait and see.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Myth of Steady Retirement Spending, and Why Reality May Cost Less", "Date": "2018-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringIt\u2019s the question at the heart of so much retirement planning: How much money will I need in savings when I\u2019ve stopped working?To arrive at that number, many people start calculating an estimate of what they will need to live on each month. The figure they come up with often relies on a popular rule of thumb: the so-called 4 percent rule.This rule holds that if you invest in a mix of roughly 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, you can safely spend 4 percent of your savings annually over 30 years without fear of depleting your nest egg.So if you retired at 65 with $1 million, you could withdraw $40,000 (adjusted each year for inflation) for living expenses until you run out of money at 95. Add this $40,000 to Social Security and any other income you may be collecting, and that\u2019s your annual spending budget in retirement. Need more than that? You\u2019ll either have to cut expenses or save more money before you\u2019re ready to retire.There\u2019s a lot of research to suggest that following the 4 percent rule \u2014 or something close to 4 percent \u2014 is a good way to make your savings last. This approach is at the heart of many popular online retirement calculators.But does retirement spending actually work that way? Do retirees really spend a fixed amount each year for the rest of their lives?They do not, many financial advisers and academics say. \u201cThis is my 35th year in practice, and I can tell you none of my clients has ever spent on a straight line,\u201d said Neal Van Zutphen, a certified financial planner with the firm Intrinsic Wealth Counsel in Tempe, Ariz. \u201cYour spending habits and your spending needs will change over time.\u201dHere\u2019s one reason that\u2019s important: You may be closer to having enough money to retire than you think.\u201cThe frustration for clients is they have to save this big bunch of money to produce this big number,\u201d Mr. Van Zutphen said. \u201cSome of them hate their jobs, and they can\u2019t wait to get out. As a planner, you feel like you\u2019re torturing the client by making them stay longer and work harder. Instead, why don\u2019t we sit down and figure out what\u2019s really happening with them?\u201dAlthough his clients Rod and Jeannie Koleno didn\u2019t hate working in Mr. Koleno\u2019s dental practice in Eugene Ore., they hoped to sell it and retire in 2001, when he turned 59. Mr. Van Zutphen showed them that they had enough money to retire a year earlier if they wanted. Their reaction? \u201cYippee!\u201d Ms. Koleno recalled.Mr. Van Zutphen was counting on the Kolenos to spend more in their first years as retirees and less as they got older. Which is what has happened. Expenses that hit them hard in their early retired years \u2014 helping out their six children a bit and caring for their aging parents \u2014 have dropped away. Now they\u2019re living frugally and happily in Ketchum, Idaho.Financial advisers have a few ways of describing the decline in retirement spending over time. One of the most popular, coined by the certified financial planner Michael K. Stein, is to view retirement as three stages: your Go-Go years, your Slow-Go years and, finally, your No-Go years.J. P. Morgan Asset Management has studied the spending patterns of its customers and witnessed the same trend. Spending drop-offs are even more pronounced among retirees with $1 million to $3 million in assets, said Katherine Roy, the firm\u2019s chief retirement strategist.\u201cIt appears the more you have, the steeper the spending decline in real terms,\u201d she said.Ms. Roy figures that traditional financial planning tools \u2014 ones that expect spending to keep pace with inflation for 30 years \u2014 \u201ccould overstate spending in late retirement by 30 percent or more.\u201dOne of her firm\u2019s studies grouped 613,000 JPMorgan Chase customers into profiles based on their spending patterns. These included homebodies, globe-trotters, health care spenders and foodies.It\u2019s worth figuring out which profile matches your spending, said Wade Pfau, a professor at the American College of Financial Services and director of retirement research at McLean Asset Management. If you fall into one of the first three groups, you may be looking at spending increases throughout your retirement. But people in the biggest group \u2014 the 39 percent who spend more than others on food and drink \u2014 can reasonably expect the \u201cGo-Go, Slow-Go, No-Go\u201d progression.\u201cThis is the group that tends to spend less as they age,\u201d Dr. Pfau said.Those later-year gains in spending are almost always related to health care, Dr. Blanchett said. Even with those increases, however, retirees in their 70s and 80s still tend to spend less than when they first quit working.\u201cThe real change in annual spending through retirement is clearly negative,\u201d Dr. Blanchett said.This is something financial advisers should go over with their clients, he added. \u201cThey can say, \u2018The most common assumption is that you\u2019re going to increase your spending by inflation, but here\u2019s the deal: The average person doesn\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d he said.Dr. Blanchett suggests running a separate retirement-spending projection that assumes your spending grows by 1 percentage point less than inflation.\u201cHow does that change how you can spend your money?\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing it can do is free up money when you can most enjoy it. Take that cruise when you\u2019re 65 or 70 because you\u2019re probably not going to be able to take it when you\u2019re 80.\u201dNot every financial adviser thinks it\u2019s a great idea to count on lower spending in your later years. Michaela Herlihy, president of Beacon Financial Planning of Cape Cod in Hyannis, Mass., will happily create alternate spending projections for clients who request them, but her recommendation is to stick with the 4 percent rule.\u201cIf clients are front-loading their spending because they\u2019re waiting to supplement it with Social Security or a pension later, I\u2019d feel better about it,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise, I would prefer they didn\u2019t.\u201dOne danger is that spending more in early retirement, combined with a sharp market downturn, could put your portfolio in a deep hole, jeopardizing your later years. Even without a market crash, it can be jarring to watch your investment account shrink.\u201cWhen you say, \u2018I\u2019m going to retire,\u2019 and you turn on the spigot from your savings, the shift in psychology is so big,\u201d Ms. Herlihy said. \u201cThe people who are able to do it more healthily are the ones who see stability in their nest eggs. They go through their retirement years with less worry. The other ones are constantly asking, \u2018Are we going to be O.K.?\u2019\u201dPlanning your retirement around the \u201cGo-Go, Slow-Go, No-Go\u201d spending pattern does require a higher level of risk tolerance, advisers agree. It also takes some discipline. You can\u2019t just go on autopilot. You need to track carefully how much you\u2019re spending and be prepared to adjust if necessary.This is exactly what Rod and Jeannie Koleno, now 77 and 74, do. They get quarterly updates from their financial adviser, Mr. Van Zutphen, and once a year they carefully plot their expenses for the next 12 months.\u201cWe\u2019re spending less than we used to, but more on things like entertainment and vacations,\u201d Ms. Koleno said. \u201cNot big splashy trips, just fun things with friends and family, things that fit our values.\u201dLooking back, do they have any regrets about spending more freely in their early retirement? Not a chance, Ms. Koleno said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled with the way things have turned out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Boardwalks take the place of sidewalks on the village streets.In the years after World War II, Shoyna was a thriving fishing port, with old Soviet newsreels telling stories of the fishermen here heroically exceeding their production targets.But overfishing not only depleted local stocks; it probably ruined the area\u2019s ecosystem. Trawlers scraped the sea floor clean of silt and seaweed. And with nothing to hold the sand in place anymore, waves started washing it ashore, each of the trillions of grains a reminder of the reckless depredation of the seas.This disruption of the seabed, perhaps combined with a natural change in the bed of the river that flows through Shoyna and into the White Sea, is the best suspect to blame for the sand invasion, said Sergey Uvarov, the marine biodiversity project coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund in Russia. But no formal environmental studies of the remote region have been conducted.In the summertime, small airplanes, and the occasional helicopter, are the only way to reach Shoyna.Evdokiya Sakharova, 81, serves as an informal greeter at the sandy landing strip. In her youth, the now desert-like area was filled with grassy meadows where cows would be taken to pasture, and villagers had their own little farms next to their homes.\u201cI remember the village when it was full of life, not sand,\u201d she said.During its heyday as a fishing port, Shoyna\u2019s quay could barely fit the more than 70 fishing vessels coming in and out every day. At its height, the village\u2019s population was over 800; today it\u2019s home to 285 people.The emptying out didn\u2019t happen all at once. First the fish processing plant closed, then the brickworks. The farms held on for a while. \u201cWe kept planting vegetables, fertilizing the soil and sweeping away the sand advancing from the shore,\u201d Ms. Sakharova said. \u201cUntil it became pointless.\u201dThe people in this village, where trails left by ATVs, humans and dogs crisscross the sand between the houses, don\u2019t expect much in terms of amenities. The village has no sewage system, and water has to be carried from wells. Houses are heated with firewood or coal.Food supplies in Shoyna\u2019s only store cost almost twice as much as in the nearest town, and many residents turn for sustenance to the natural areas outside the village where the sand has not yet reached.Arctic cloudberry grows in the tundra. Harvesting it is backbreaking labor, but it\u2019s both delicious and lucrative. Locals sell it to middlemen, and it ultimately fetches almost as much as red caviar in city stores. In the fall, wild geese can be hunted and enough meat stored to last the winter. Sometimes nomadic reindeer herders stop by, exchanging meat for other goods.Small-scale fishing still happens throughout the year, in the summer for food and in the winter for trade. It\u2019s quite a way to the nearest market, however. Fish has to be hauled along a frozen river on snowmobiles for eight to 10 hours to the nearest town, Mezen.Shoyna runs on its own schedule. If you need bread, you have to place an order at a bakery open four days a week. At the village\u2019s bathhouse, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are reserved for women, Thursdays and Fridays for men.\u201cThere\u2019s little entertainment out here,\u201d said Karina Kotkina, an intern at the local meteorological station. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have internet connection.\u201dEvery Saturday there\u2019s a dance night at the local community center frequented by the few young people still living in the village, as well as soldiers from the nearby military base.\u201cI still can\u2019t forgive my commander for letting me go on a leave to the village 23 years ago,\u201d joked a former soldier, Viktor Schepakov, who now works at the village\u2019s diesel power station. \u201cThis is when I met my future wife and decided to stay in Shoyna.\u201dDebates about staying in Shoyna or moving along have been going on for decades.Resettlement can be subsidized under a federal assistance program for residents of far northern regions. Many young people do leave to study, work and travel. But some of those who have bolted come back after a while: It can be hard to adapt to urban life after years spent in the village.\u201cShoyna drags you in,\u201d said Pavel Kotkin, 21. \u201cI spent four years studying in the city and came back. I love Shoyna and want to spend my life here.\u201dBut what about the sand?\u201dI can\u2019t do without it,\u201d Mr. Kotkin said. \u201cMy feet hurt after walking on asphalt.\u201dFor those who stay, jobs are scarce. Most of those available are in the public sector, like teaching or serving on the village council. The weather is also an employment driver.Anna Kravets is the director of the local meteorological station that monitors what can be the extreme conditions here. She came to Shoyna from Rostov-on-Don, in Russia\u2019s mild south. \u201cI miss fresh vegetables,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stuff from the local store is too green and tasteless.\u201dWhile she\u2019s now accustomed to the sand, it took time. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to walk on it, your feet and legs get tired too quickly,\u201d Ms. Kravets said. \u201cI had to say goodbye to my high heels.\u201dWhen the fishery was closed, some large vessels were just abandoned on the shore, and the rusting hulks look like mythical beasts.\u201cWhen we were kids, we used to play hide-and-seek there, build our little houses there,\u201d Mr. Kotkin reminisced. \u201cThese ships were our whole world.\u201dPeople bring their old machinery to join these ships on the shore. But it\u2019s a junkyard with a broader purpose: The rusting clutter\u2019s last mission is to serve as an improvised breakwater, helping shield houses on Shoyna\u2019s shore from crashing waves.There are some signs that Shoyna\u2019s ecosystem may be recuperating. Grass started reappearing in Shoyna in the last five years. Fishermen, too, tell tales of seaweed tangling in their nets where there was none before.But for now, the sand continues to come.The wind carries the sand from the shore to a lighthouse on the beach, still the village\u2019s most visible landmark. From there, the wind picks up the sand from the dunes lining the lighthouse\u2019s foundation and carries it further toward the village. Grains of sand rattle against the windows and whip the faces of passers-by.Some of this sand will eventually end up on the porch of Ms. Sakharova, the airport greeter. She grabs a shovel every morning and gets to digging her house out little by little.\u201cMy kids and grandchildren are asking me to move to the city, but I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said. \u201cShoyna is my home. It\u2019s nice and calm out here.\u201dNigina Beroeva contributed reporting.Produced by Gaia Tripoli.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Two Words From Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Sent Markets Soaring", "Date": "2018-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith just two words on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve\u2019s chairman sent stocks surging by raising hopes that the central bank might be closer to ending its push to drive up interest rates.The chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate was \u201cjust below\u201d the neutral level, meaning the central bank was close to the point where it would not be tapping on the brakes or pressing on the gas. Only last month, Mr. Powell had said it was \u201ca long way\u201d from neutral, leaving investors worried that the rate increases would crimp growth.The small change sent stocks soaring 2.3 percent, erasing the losses from a rocky November. To investors, the new wording meant that the Fed might leave rates closer to their current level, keeping in place the steady fuel that low rates have provided to a 10-year-long bull market.Analysts quickly warned that investors were overreacting. There was little evidence in the rest of Mr. Powell\u2019s speech that he intended to signal a change in plans.But the market\u2019s euphoria underscored the chairman\u2019s struggles to strike the right pitch in an increasingly challenging economic and political environment, as President Trump attacks the Fed and the country\u2019s growth comes under pressure. The market has been jittery over concerns that further rate increases could undermine the economy at a time when the prospects for companies and consumers may be softening.\u201cWe\u2019re in the 10th year of the expansion, and there are some soft points,\u201d said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, a former chief economist at the Ford Motor Company and the Commerce Department who is now the associate director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Energy Institute. \u201cThe auto sales cycle has peaked, and the housing cycle also has peaked.\u201dMs. Hughes-Cromwick said that she did not foresee an imminent end to growth, but that higher interest rates, combined with rising inflation and faltering corporate confidence, could set the stage for a recession. If those things happen, \u201cI don\u2019t really see how the economy can keep powering ahead,\u201d she said.Most economic forecasters, including at various government agencies and big Wall Street banks, expect the American economy to continue growing in 2019. But there is a broad consensus that the pace will slow as the sugar high provided by the Trump administration\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut and spending increases begins to wear off. Some forecasters see a small, but growing, chance of a recession.\u201cThis is a geriatric expansion,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management.He noted that if growth continued through next summer, this would become the longest expansion of the American economy since at least the Civil War. Economists have long argued that expansions do not die of old age. But the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s stimulus is likely to drop growth back toward a 2 percent annual rate, leaving little margin for error.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take much to go wrong to put us into a recession,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, tried to play down such concerns on Tuesday.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of pessimism I\u2019m reading about. Maybe it has to do with a mild stock market correction,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, before saying such fears were misplaced. He rattled off recent economic data \u2014 including the latest jobs report, which he described as \u201cvery spiffy\u201d \u2014 before concluding, \u201cWe\u2019re in very good shape.\u201dMr. Powell also reiterated Wednesday that the economy was doing well, that inflation was under control and that no glaring risks were on the horizon. Against that backdrop, the Fed is still expected to raise its benchmark rate in December. Mr. Powell emphasized that the Fed would make decisions about future increases by keeping a close eye on the economy.In the view of many analysts, Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell themselves pose the greatest threats to continued growth.The Fed\u2019s interest rate increases are also weighing on some parts of the economy, including home building. Sales of new and existing homes have fallen in recent months as interest rates on mortgage loans have risen.\u201cI\u2019m not being accommodated by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Post. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the Fed. They\u2019re making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else\u2019s brain can ever tell me.\u201dIn publicly berating the Fed, Mr. Trump is breaking sharply with the practice of recent administrations, which maintained a studied silence about monetary policy.One reason is that urging the Fed to move can be counterproductive. The Fed likes to present itself as a technocratic institution that floats above the political fray. While some policymakers and economic analysts argue that the Fed should suspend rate increases, such a pause would now expose the Fed to criticism that it is acceding to Mr. Trump.Mr. Powell has insisted that the Fed will act without regard to Mr. Trump\u2019s statements. In a recent speech, he emphasized that the central bank is overseen by Congress, not the president.But Mr. Powell added to his own challenges in October, in an unscripted answer to a question about how high the Fed might need to raise rates.\u201cWe may go past neutral,\u201d Mr. Powell said during an interview at the Atlantic Festival, \u201cbut we\u2019re a long way from neutral at this point, probably.\u201dMr. Powell\u2019s subsequent remarks on the subject strongly suggest that he would have liked to have chosen his words more carefully. Mr. Powell and other Fed officials also have emphasized that the exact level of the neutral rate is not important to the central bank\u2019s plans.Some Fed officials, however, have said they want to pause at that point to consider whether further increases are warranted. Others have said they want to raise rates more, judging that the economy will need a little restraint.Richard H. Clarida, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said on Tuesday that deciding how high to go would require \u201cjudgment and humility.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Went to a Steak Dinner Annuity Pitch. The Salesman Wasn\u2019t Pleased. ", "Date": "2018-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyLOS ANGELES \u2014 The pitch arrived in my aunt\u2019s mailbox, just after her 80th birthday and in the wake of a few frightening weeks for retirement investors. \u201cTired of the stock market roller coaster ride? Want to protect your principal and lock in interest earnings?\u201d the invitation read. It offered the opportunity to hear all about it at a \u201ccomplimentary gourmet meal,\u201d featuring \u201cNew York steak.\u201d Even better, it would be at a restaurant in Granada Hills that her mother, Vi, had loved.The mailer was addressed to another member of the family who no longer lives there, but my aunt had no problem registering when she called the number on the card. It said a guest was welcome, too. I volunteered, and she registered me as well. I had long wanted to attend one of these steak dinners, and if you are in or near retirement, or sort the mail of people who are, you might be curious about them as well. Such dinners have been a cause for concern.I genuinely hoped not to encounter any such thing Tuesday night. But I did.In short (and short is hard when trying to break down products like these), equity indexed annuities tend to work something like this: You hand over a sum of money to an insurance company for a period of time, and at the end you are guaranteed to get at least that much money back if you don't take some money out along the way. You generally don\u2019t get a monthly check, and you agree not to take large amounts out during that period unless you are willing to pay a penalty. As for that equity index part, the insurance company will generally add money to the amount you initially plunked down, providing a portion of the gains reflected in whatever stock index the insurance company is using. Mr. Halaby\u2019s staff distributed material before dinner that included a chart that looked like the one at the front of the room. It showed an equity indexed annuity performing 8.29 percent better, after an 18-year period from 1998 to 2016, than the S&P 500 stock market index.But the pamphlet\u2019s chart has some fine print \u2014 so small that my 47-year-old eyes could barely make it out \u2014 that disclosed the following: The index it was using was not accounting for the reinvestment of dividends from all those stocks.A quick email the next morning to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, confirmed the following: When you do reinvest dividends, that basket of stocks does 33.72 percent better than the annuity.I had hoped to ask our host some questions after the steak, which was cooked medium unwell (no one asked how I wanted it prepared). But by then, Mr. Halaby, who has an active license to sell insurance, including annuities, was gone.I made an appointment to meet him at his office the next morning, and he did not seem happy to see me once I told him who I was. He disparaged my employer and profession and accused me of attending under false pretenses. I tried to ask him a long list of questions, starting with a few about that chart. At first, he said he would talk to me if I gave him five references of other people I had written about. (I sent him several names later that day.) Then, he gave me the name of a person he identified as his lawyer and told me to contact her about the chart. (She eventually declined to answer any of my questions.)When I turned my line of inquiry to the cease-and-refrain order, he got up from his chair and said, \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d Then he showed me the door.He told me over the phone on Thursday night, after I returned to New York, that he did not deliberately send mail to people over 70 years old and resented what he called the \u201cdog whistle\u201d effect of writing about someone older than that, as if I were trying to imply that he was preying on people well into their older years. I said no one had asked my aunt\u2019s age when she R.S.V.P.\u2019d. Another point I made: I know that mailing list rental firms aren\u2019t perfect \u2014 the 50-something relative whose invitation arrived at my aunt\u2019s hadn\u2019t lived there for 15 years \u2014 but my aunt had also given me an identical invitation that a 76-year-old friend received at his home address. To learn more about the chart in the pamphlet, I contacted the annuity company that created it, American Equity Investment Life Holding Company. I asked Steven D. Schwartz, vice president of investor relations for the company, why the chart doesn\u2019t show the returns for the S&P 500 with reinvested dividends. He said it was because the point of the chart is to show the lack of volatility of an equity indexed annuity compared with the S&P 500.Of course, showing the S&P 500 with reinvested dividends would also do that.In any event, Mr. Schwartz said, Mr. Halaby should not be using that chart, because the company has discontinued the annuity it depicts. \u201cIt is expected that our independent producers will use current materials,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote in an email, using industryspeak for salespeople who don\u2019t work directly for the insurance companies. When I asked Mr. Halaby about that, he told me that someone who had not been working for him for very long put the old chart in the pamphlet. He added that the chart behind him at the dinner, which to my eyes looked identical to the one in the pamphlet, was in fact different. He would not tell me what company had created it. While the steak dinner pitch might not be a con game, it is a bit of a psychological dance. You attend, you eat free food and by the time the cheesecake arrives, you may feel you owe a salesperson a one-on-one meeting.Then you\u2019re on the hook. If these meals didn\u2019t catch lots of people, salespeople wouldn\u2019t keep paying for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Give Gig Economy Workers Equity? The S.E.C. Is Considering It", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe gig economy has created economic opportunities for millions of people. Uber and Lyft have empowered everyday drivers to become paid chauffeurs. Airbnb has made homeowners hoteliers. And TaskRabbit has opened new markets for handymen and other laborers.But much of the wealth created by these companies is not passed along to workers through conventional wages, but to a small number of insiders who own stock.In each case, employees and investors reap the vast majority of those profits, while the gig economy workers \u2014 arguably the ones creating much of the value for these companies \u2014 can\u2019t partake in those winnings. That\u2019s because they are contractors, not regular employees, and federal securities law restricts private companies from issuing shares to such workers.That may soon change.In considering a change, the S.E.C. is tacitly acknowledging that for all the value gig economy companies are creating, they are also, in some ways, contributing to the stark income inequality that is roiling society.Though contractors provide much of the labor for these tech companies, the S.E.C. noted that gig economy workers were not traditional employees who enjoyed conventional benefits and wages.Companies were supportive of the idea. Uber, Airbnb and Postmates, a food-delivery start-up, all chimed in, saying they would welcome the change.\u201cAs a sharing economy marketplace, Airbnb succeeds when these hosts succeed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe believe that enabling private companies to grant hosts and other sharing economy participants equity in the company from an earlier stage would further align incentives between such companies and their sharing economy participants to the benefit of both.\u201dEven gig workers chimed in.Yet even if gig economy workers did have access to equity, there is no guarantee that it would solve their financial woes. Though it\u2019s not clear if such equity grants would replace or reduce wages, labor experts say that relying on private company stock is risky, especially for workers lacking financial security.\u201cEquity is not wages, it\u2019s risky,\u201d said Louis Hyman, a professor at Cornell University and author of \u201cTemp,\u201d a recent book on the labor market. \u201cFor people who need to have a steady paycheck, this is not the answer.\u201dShould the S.E.C. move ahead with such a plan, there are plenty of details still to be sorted out, including the tax treatment of such equity grants. If gig economy workers receive private company stock without any way to sell it, they could be liable for taxes on those gains, without having any easy way to pay those taxes.The S.E.C. could also need to modify other rules that stipulate that if companies distribute stock to more than 2,000 people who are not employees, such as accredited investors, they need to adhere to more rigorous public reporting requirements. And in one of the rare instances when a company tried to do something similar, it failed spectacularly.Despite the inherent risks in such an arrangement, it\u2019s a fair bet that most gig economy workers would jump at the chance to get even a sliver of equity in a company like Uber or Airbnb.\u201cIt\u2019s said that \u2018the greatest social program is a job,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sament wrote the S.E.C. \u201cBut a job or contractor position with stock benefits would help hundreds of thousands of people to do more than just tread water financially.

{"Headline": "Holiday Spending Should Be Strong. And Then?", "Date": "2018-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConsumer confidence points to open pocketbooks in the short run. Trade tensions, market upheaval and other factors may make the new year less bright.Americans are upbeat about the economy heading into the holiday shopping season. But that good cheer may not last long. \u201cYou see momentum going into the season, cutting across a large range of categories,\u201d said Stephen Sadove, a former Saks Fifth Avenue chief who is now a senior adviser for Mastercard. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the healthiest growth we\u2019ve seen in the past half-dozen years.\u201dIt\u2019s too soon to say whether the drop will rattle consumers. But even before the sell-off, many economists were warning that a combination of factors \u2014 including rising interest rates, a weakening housing market and a new round of tariffs set to take effect in January \u2014 could begin to slow down the economy in 2019.Last year\u2019s holiday season was the best for retailers in more than a decade. Americans are feeling even better this year.Thirty-seven percent of Americans say their finances are in better shape than they were a year ago, while 17 percent say they are worse off, according to a survey conducted for The New York Times in early November by the online research platform SurveyMonkey. Last November, just 28 percent said they were better off.Consumers say they are feeling even more positive about the future. Forty-one percent expect to be better off financially a year from now \u2014 versus just 14 percent who expect to be worse off \u2014 and a majority of survey respondents said \u201ccontinuous good times economically\u201d were in store over the next five years.\u201cConsumers are dressing up and stepping out a bit,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got money for discretionary spending, they\u2019re traveling a lot.\u201dHouseholds are also getting help from gasoline prices, which have fallen sharply in the last month after rising earlier in the year.Then there is the actual tax cut. The $1.5 trillion tax law that Republicans passed last year helped pump up consumer spending earlier this year, and economists said the effect is lingering into this holiday season. Over all, households\u2019 finances are in their strongest shape in years, with low levels of debt and rising after-tax income.United States gross domestic product has posted two straight quarters of strong growth, driven largely by robust consumer spending. Most economists expect that growth to slow in the final three months of the year as the effects of the tax cuts fade.Those concerns may be part of what has driven the stock market\u2019s recent drop. Retail stocks fell on Tuesday despite strong results, as investors worried that rising costs could eat into earnings.The market turmoil could affect consumer sentiment, especially among wealthier households more likely to own stocks. The University of Michigan survey found that confidence fell more among higher-earning households in November.But falling share prices are unlikely to hurt holiday sales much, Mr. Song said. Most Americans don\u2019t own stocks outside of their retirement accounts, and many have already set their holiday budgets \u2014 or have even begun to shop. A Bank of America survey found that about 20 percent of consumers started their holiday shopping before November, and 67 percent said they planned to shop over the extended Thanksgiving weekend.\u201cI have a tough time really seeing this hurting consumer spending,\u201d Mr. Song said of the market declines. \u201cA lot of the shopping is already baked in.\u201dSurveyMonkey took its survey the week of the election, conducting about 4,300 online interviews on or before Election Day and 5,000 after the results were known. Among Democrats and independents, the results changed little over the course of the survey.But for Republicans, there was a clear shift in outlook: Among Republicans interviewed before the election, 66 percent said they expected their finances to improve over the next year. Among those interviewed afterward, that share fell to 59 percent. The effect was particularly pronounced among strong supporters of Mr. Trump, who showed a nine-point decline after the election in the share expecting their finances to be better a year from now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Utility Customers May Be on Hook for Billions in Wildfire Damage", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs wildfires ravage large swaths of California for a second year, one of the state\u2019s biggest utilities has declared that it faces billions of dollars in potential liability \u2014 far more than its insurance would cover.The potential losses could leave the company\u2019s customers on the hook to pay the bill, exposing businesses and consumers to higher costs. The utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, could even face bankruptcy, putting pressure on the state for a bailout.With its financial liabilities mounting, the company\u2019s shares dropped by more than 20 percent on Wednesday. More than half of its market value has been wiped out since late last week as the fires have spread.Many fires in recent years have been caused by downed power lines serving California\u2019s utilities. State officials have determined that electrical equipment owned by PG&E, including power lines and poles, was responsible for at least 17 of 21 major fires in Northern California last fall. In eight of those cases, they referred the findings to prosecutors over possible violations of state law.Citigroup estimates that PG&E\u2019s exposure to liability for those fires is $15 billion \u2014 and that it could face another $15 billion in claims if it is found responsible for the Camp Fire, a number that could rise because the fire is only a third contained.\u201cThe damages, if you add 2017 and 2018, obviously are going to be really significant,\u201d said Praful Mehta, a Citigroup analyst.The compounding costs of the year-after-year wildfires are making it increasingly difficult for any party to absorb the expenses, said Mark Cooper, senior research fellow for economic analysis at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School.If the utility is forced to increase rates sharply, the costs may take an economic toll. Manufacturing companies could choose to move their businesses out of the service area or even the state. Residential customers within the utility\u2019s territory then could be left to cover the costs.\u201cThis becomes a humongous challenge,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cIf they try and raise the prices, they may not be able to get them. Should they even be allowed to recover all the cost, if they were guilty of imprudent behavior?\u201dPG&E said its liability insurance for the year that began Aug. 1 amounted to $1.4 billion.Lynsey Paulo, a spokeswoman for PG&E, said the utility was focused on helping fight the current wildfires rather than the company\u2019s economics. The company has set up a base camp with 800 employees in the area of the Camp Fire, she said, a figure that is expected to grow to 1,000 by the end of the week and could reach 3,000.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to speculate on what may or may not be impacting the stock market,\u201d Ms. Paulo said.PG&E\u2019s \u201csafety culture\u201d has been the subject of a three-year investigation by the state\u2019s Public Utilities Commission. The agency is expected to act on the inquiry\u2019s findings as early as this month.In addition to wildfires, PG&E was found at fault in one of California\u2019s biggest disasters in this decade \u2014 a natural-gas explosion in 2010 that devastated the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno and killed eight people. PG&E was fined a record $1.6 billion by the state for failing to maintain its pipeline system properly, and paid $900 million to resolve lawsuits related to the explosion.\u201cWe\u2019ve got failure of systems to hold PG&E accountable for the destruction and devastation that\u2019s been caused,\u201d said Frank Pitre, a lawyer who has represented PG&E customers in the gas explosion and the wildfires, including 35 people who lost property in the Paradise fire. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been ongoing. How many more lives have to be lost? How many more communities have to be destroyed? It\u2019s got to stop.\u201dShares of the parent companies of the state\u2019s other investor-owned utilities \u2014 Edison International, which operates Southern California Edison, and Sempra Energy, which owns San Diego Gas and Electric \u2014 also dropped earlier this week as wildfires spread in both Northern and Southern California.The state\u2019s power supply is not likely to be at risk, but PG&E could face bankruptcy if it cannot cover the liabilities it faces, wiping out shareholders\u2019 equity and eating into bondholder investments. It has already been through bankruptcy once, in 2001, during an energy crisis after a botched deregulation effort.Legislators intervened this year to shield PG&E and the state\u2019s other investor-owned utilities from overwhelming legal claims, allowing them to pass the expense on to ratepayers. But the law, Senate Bill 901, applies to fires beginning in 2019, and in some of last year\u2019s incidents \u2014 not to this year\u2019s fires.Paul Payne, a spokesman for Senator Bill Dodd, who sponsored the measure, said the bill was a response to the potential costs PG&E and its customers were already facing. \u201cWe were focused on 2017 and protecting the ratepayers from that fire,\u201d he said.Some analysts say California\u2019s regulators and lawmakers could take steps to extend similar protection in this year\u2019s blazes.\u201cIt is our expectation that regulators will utilize the tools or framework outlined in S.B. 901 to address any potential 2018 wildfire-related costs,\u201d Jeffrey Cassella, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, wrote in an email.Under the bill, utilities could sell bonds to cover their liability costs and pay them off over time through higher rates. PG&E estimates that the cost to the average consumer could be $5 a year for every $1 billion in bonds issued.But Mr. Mehta of Citigroup said there were questions about a second intervention. \u201cIt is unclear whether the political will exists because it might be seen as a bailout,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why the stock is reacting the way it is.\u201dInvestors have been scrambling to assess the size of the financial hit that PG&E might suffer and whether the company had enough money to make it through the turbulence. The company said it had exhausted its revolving credit and raised concern about liquidity and cash flow.Some prominent investors may have been hit. Baupost Group, run by Seth A. Klarman, an investor with a reputation for spotting undervalued stocks, added more than 14 million PG&E shares to its holdings in the third quarter, according to securities filings, while Viking Global, the hedge fund of O. Andreas Halvorsen, bought 5.7 million shares. Baupost and Viking declined to comment.Although jarring, the move to draw down its credit lines gives the company a pool of funds that it can use to pay expenses and make debt repayments due in the coming months. Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase were among the banks that set up the credit lines, according a PG&E securities filing from 2015.The company said it had about $3.5 billion of cash after drawing down the credit lines.Last December, in anticipation of possible damage claims from that year\u2019s wildfires, PG&E suspended dividend payments. Its stock has fallen sharply, but the company is still worth $13 billion.\u201cBankruptcy is not the worst thing customers have to fear from PG&E,\u201d said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network, which represents consumers before the Public Utilities Commission. \u201cThe worst thing that customers have to fear is the wildfires. The legislature cannot make policy based on the fear of PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tax Cut and the Balance of Payments (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLots of financial maneuvering, signifying nothingOpinion ColumnistNow that Democrats have taken the House, it seems likely that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will turn out to have been the only major piece of legislation enacted under Donald Trump. There might conceivably be an infrastructure bill, but don\u2019t get your hopes up: Trump\u2019s people seem dead set against straightforward public spending, i.e., just building the damn infrastructure, and Democrats probably won\u2019t agree to privatization disguised as public investment.Now, the TCJA played almost no role in the midterms: Republicans dropped it as a selling point, focusing on fear of brown people instead, while Democrats hammered health care. But now that the election is past, it seems like a good idea to revisit the bill and its effects. What I want to focus on in this piece is the effects on the balance of payments.Why the balance of payments? Because the theory of the case - the not-necessarily-stupid rationale for the corporate tax cuts at the heart of the bill - depended crucially on claims about what tax cuts would do to international movements of capital. So one important piece of any attempt to assess the results so far involves looking at the balance of payments changes since the lower tax rate went into effect.And looking at those changes in the balance of payments also offers a good way to debunk some of the fallacies that all too often creep in when we discuss these issues. So let\u2019s dive in, beginning with a recap of how the TCJA\u2019s supporters claimed it would work.What tax cuts were supposed to doThe claim by tax cut advocates was, however, that the tax cut would be passed through to workers, because we live in an integrated global capital market. There were multiple reasons not to believe this argument in practice, but it\u2019s still worth working through its implications.What tax-cut advocates argued was that the rate of return in the U.S., net of taxes, is set by global forces. Suppose that there is a global rate of return r*; then the U.S. will have to offer r*/(1-t), where t is the corporate tax rate.Now imagine cutting t; the figure shows a complete elimination of corporate taxes, but the logic is the same for simply reducing the rate. This should lead to inflows of capital from abroad, increasing the capital stock, which both raises GDP and reduces the rate of return. In the end the after-tax return on capital should be back where it started, with all of the tax cut passed through to wages instead.The crucial point, however, is that for this to happen you have to have a large increase in the physical stock of capital - it\u2019s not an immaculate financial transaction. This in turn means that those inflows of capital have to enable a massive wave of real investment in plant and equipment. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean directly importing machinery; it could mean importing consumer goods or exporting less stuff of our own, either way freeing up resources for producing capital goods here at home. But the logic of the pro-tax cut case depends on the cut facilitating a period of large trade deficits. (I don\u2019t think anyone told Trump about this.)This is not, however, the way most reporting on the issue has framed it. Instead, reports have mostly focused on corporations moving funds home from their overseas subsidiaries, and asked what they are doing with that money. That\u2019s not exactly wrong, but \u201cmoving money home\u201d doesn\u2019t mean what people think it means, and is very loosely connected to the important economic issue here.On \u201cmoving money home\u201dU.S. corporations have large assets overseas. Some of these assets reflect past investments made for fundamental business reasons - e.g., auto plants built to serve foreign markets. But a lot of those overseas assets reflect tax avoidance strategies.But what did these big numbers correspond to in reality? Quite possibly nothing.Imagine a U.S. company whose overseas subsidiary has $1 billion in a London bank account. Following the enactment of the tax cut, it decides to transfer that $1 billion back to the parent company - but the parent keeps the money where it is. In that case the balance of payments statistics show a big drop in net direct investment abroad, because the parent firm is reducing its apparent stake in the subsidiary. But the reality is that the company still owns that same $1 billion in London - it has just shifted from owning it indirectly via the subsidiary to holding it directly. It\u2019s just accounting, with no real-world effect.Of course, the company could choose not to keep that $1 billion in a London bank; it might do something else with it, such as buy shares back from its stockholders. But what happens to the money then? The shareholders might themselves buy assets overseas; even if they buy stock here, whoever sells them the stock might invest the proceeds abroad.In other words, looking at corporate financial maneuvering after the tax cut doesn\u2019t really tell us anything about whether the cut is, in fact, attracting global capital into the United States. To make that assessment, we need to look at net sales of assets to foreigners by the U.S. as a whole - or, equivalently, at our net sales of goods and services, because the balance of payments always balances: the trade balance is by definition the inverse of the net capital inflow.What actually happened to capital inflows?If we\u2019re trying to assess the possible effects of the TCJA on the U.S. ability to invest, we need to know how much, if at all, it promoted true inflows of capital - resources made available to the United States that let us invest more than we ourselves are saving. These inflows can be measured two different ways. One is to look directly at the international financial account: asset transactions with foreigners, where selling assets is an inflow and buying assets an outflow. The other is to look indirectly at the difference between sales and purchases of goods and services, because the trade balance broadly defined (including investment income) - aka the balance on current account - is the flip side of capital inflows.In principle these two methods should give the same result. In practice there is sometimes a significant \u201cstatistical discrepancy,\u201d probably because some financial transactions don\u2019t end up being properly reported. This is less of an issue for goods and services, although some of the same strategies used for tax avoidance can distort this balance too. Anyway, I\u2019ve prepared a little chart showing quarterly measures of capital inflow since 2016, by both methods (Figure 3.)There are big statistical discrepancies in a few quarters. As I like to say, in the fourth quarter of 2017 America was a big exporter of errors and omissions. But overall the data tell a consistent story about what has happened to capital inflows since the tax cut went into effect, which is \u2026 nothing much. That elaborate financial dance between corporations and their subsidiaries seems, in fact, to be an accounting maneuver with little real-world relevance. The international consequences of the tax cut appear to be minimal.And that\u2019s a big deal, because promoting capital inflows was at the heart of the halfway reasonable argument for the tax cut. So far, that argument appears to be not totally stupid, but also, as it happens, quite wrong.The big giveawayOn its face, a corporate tax cut looks like a big giveaway to stockholders. Proponents of the TCJA claimed that this was misleading, because large capital inflows would ensure that the cut went to workers instead. But there\u2019s no sign of those big inflows, so what looks like a big giveaway to stockholders is, in fact, a big giveaway to stockholders.And about 35 percent of that giveaway is to foreigners, so the tax cut makes America as a whole poorer.Can we see this in the data? Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to extract this signal from the noise. If corporations returned all of the tax cut to stockholders via increased dividends, you might be able to see it in increased payments of investment income to foreigners. But much of it was used for stock buybacks, which won\u2019t show up in the same way.True, stock buybacks should raise the price of the stocks remaining, and you could try to allocate 35 percent of this capital gain to foreigners. When Trump boasts about rising stocks, or laments declines that he blames on Democrats, remember: higher stock prices actually make America poorer, because they don\u2019t add anything to our real wealth while increasing foreign claims on the nation as a whole.But stocks fluctuate so much, for so many reasons (or no reason at all), that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s productive to try and guess how much of that fluctuation is due to the tax cut. Better to focus on the fundamentals: corporate taxes have been cut by around $100 billion a year, so that\u2019s around $35 billion going to foreigners.OK, that concludes my wonkiness here. The moral of this story is that the tax cut seems to have produced some biggish financial activity on the part of corporations, but it\u2019s all basically accounting maneuvers signifying nothing. A balance of payments perspective, like other perspectives, points to a tax cut that, surprise, cut taxes on corporations, but had few real consequences for the economy.Advertisement"}

The sharp sell-off on Monday will only add to that tally. Investors appear especially focused on any signs that extraordinary profits generated by these giant tech companies are under threat. Whether technology stocks can slough off the worries will depend, in part, on whether the companies can continue to deliver strong earnings growth even if the global economy does soften significantly. Recent earnings reports from major tech companies have done little to reassure investors. Since Apple\u2019s share price peaked at just over $232 on Oct. 3, the stock has plummeted by nearly 20 percent, lopping more than $200 billion off the company\u2019s market value. Its shares were down nearly 4 percent Monday.Amazon reported a slowdown in its core retail revenue growth in late October, sending the shares lower. To investors, who often view revenue numbers as a good gauge of the strength of demand in the economy, that was more important than the $2.9 billion in profit the company reported.But if they actually produce the numbers that Wall Street analysts expect, the recent slump in large technology stocks could present a buying opportunity for some investors. Key valuation measures of Apple and Alphabet hit multiyear highs this summer. But the recent drop has left those valuations substantially lower. Prices of Facebook and Amazon are relatively low compared with expected profits, meaning these stocks look \u201ccheap\u201d for certain investors. But they might have to get even cheaper before investors are tempted to snap them up. That\u2019s why some expect the sentiment in the market to get much worse before stocks can resume their climb. \u201cI\u2019m sort of looking for a little more bearishness,\u201d said King Lip, chief strategist at the wealth management company Baker Avenue. An earlier version of this article misstated which company Alphabet is the parent company of. It is Google, not Apple.Advertisement"}

Facebook, Apple and Amazon have endured the greatest declines, all down $250 billion or more from their respective peaks.That is a marked reversal for one of the most popular trades on Wall Street. Investors piled into shares of the largest tech companies, betting their revenue would continue to grow strongly as these behemoths upended industries from retail to communication to media.By the end of August, the market value of Apple and Amazon had each surpassed $1 trillion, and Alphabet was flirting with $900 billion. The combined market value of the five had reached $3.6 trillion.But worries about global economic growth as well as lackluster earnings and outlooks the past two quarters have shaken investors\u2019 confidence. In particular, concerns have mounted about how many new iPhones Apple will manage to sell. Facebook has spent much of the year mired in scandal, raising the specter that the United States government will tighten regulation of big tech. All of that has investors questioning whether the values of these big tech companies have become too lofty.Of course, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet have faced steep sell-offs before, only to bounce back quickly. Just this year, the combined market value of those five companies has tumbled 7 percent or more during three separate periods. In each instance, the stocks resumed their march to fresh highs within weeks.The question now, though, is whether this time will be different.An earlier version of this article misstated the combined market value of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet at the end of August.

{"Headline": "Country Music Will Talk About the Hurt, but Not the Politics", "Date": "2018-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Wednesday, when this year\u2019s awards are presented in Nashville, there is one thing guests probably won\u2019t be doing: having any discussion of gun laws.\u201cAs far as country music goes, it\u2019s sort of no-man\u2019s-land to really go out and make a political statement,\u201d said Andy Albert, a songwriter based in Nashville who writes mainly for country performers.Cultural and political conservatives are a significant portion of the fan base, of course, and most performers take pains not to alienate them, whether they agree with them personally or not. But country music is far from the politically crimson monolith it is often assumed to be. Big cities in the North and West are major markets for the industry, and in recent years its fans have become younger, as well as increasingly urban and suburban.Over the last decade, the music itself has become less political, and less macho. Country music of the early to mid-2000s tended toward the jingoist and the masculinist, especially after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Stars like Toby Keith, Trace Adkins, Montgomery Gentry and others brought a bulked-up rural brawn to the genre, in an era when country music was its most publicly conservative.The emergence of the bro archetype at the turn of the 2010s began shifting the tone, as male performers \u2014 who still dominate the industry, along with a few female superstars \u2014 focused more on partying than cultural, or actual, politics.Over the last couple of years, the genre has shifted again to a gentler, less brute kind of male star: the gentleman. The music has been stripped clean of much of its overt masculinity, and most performers strenuously avoid political conversation.\u201cIt\u2019s just sort of in the water, it\u2019s just understood that none of these artists are trying to use this as a soapbox,\u201d Mr. Albert said of the songs he writes for other musicians. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to get liked and heard and recorded if we can find a way to navigate a political topic without pressing an opinion on the listener. And I think it becomes more universal when you\u2019re able to do that.\u201dThe association declined to make its chief executive available on Thursday for an interview about its plans for the coming show.Country stars have tended to limit their statements after shootings to condolences for the victims, avoiding any gun debate.Some precisely wrought sentiments also have started trickling into the music.The musician Kane Brown is releasing an album called \u201cExperiment\u201d on Friday that includes the song \u201cAmerican Bad Dream.\u201d Mr. Brown was at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas last year and performed the night of the shooting.The song begins by reminiscing about how ninth grade used to be about \u201cgetting laid\u201d and skipping class. It continues: \u201cNow you gotta take a test in a bulletproof vest/Scared to death that you might get shot.\u201d\u201cBefore, you never saw on the news there was a shooting today,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, the next day, there\u2019s another shooting, and then the next, repeating. I\u2019m basically just saying, stop being on the left side or the right side, just wake up and realize that we\u2019re in a screwed-up world and we need to try and fix it.\u201d\u201cYou can blame it on hate or blame it on guns,\u201d the song swells. \u201cBut mamas ain\u2019t supposed to bury their sons.\u201dMs. Underwood and Mr. Paisley, the perennial co-hosts of the C.M.A. Awards, addressed the Las Vegas shooting during last year\u2019s show, which included the faces of the victims in the \u201cin memoriam\u201d segment.Referring to the massacre, along with other calamities of the previous year including hurricanes and the Charlottesville white-supremacist rally, Ms. Underwood said: \u201cThis has been a year marked by tragedy impacting countless lives including so many in our country music family. So we\u2019re going to do what families do: Come together, pray together, cry together and sing together, too.\u201dJon Caramanica and Joe Coscarelli contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Business Reaches a Turning Point", "Date": "2018-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI think as a group of business leaders, we have to think about the impact to our society of what\u2019s happening in the political discussions in our country.\u201d That\u2019s what Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck & Co., said last week, just days before the midterm elections. It was the crystallization of a theme that has emerged louder than ever over the past several years among a c-suite that for much of the last half century tried to avoid politics and considered its role in society in simple terms: delivering profits to shareholders, often at the expense of other constituencies.But as our society appears more polarized than ever, and as Washington seems in no hurry to heal this divided country, executives are finding themselves in the unwanted position of trying to play the role of uniter \u2014 or in some cases, picking sides.\u201cWe\u2019re not here to take political stands,\u201d Mr. Frazier told me. \u201cMy employees don\u2019t need to know what I believe about politics. But I do think, frankly, if you look around at what\u2019s happening in our society, there\u2019s more division than I think I can ever remember.\u201cPolitical discourse is such that we think that people who disagree with us are our enemies now,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd if you look at our society, our public schools are more segregated than they have been in generations; we live in communities that are essentially enclaves of people that are like us.\u201cThe media we consume now because of cable and social media \u2014 you can choose to go and just talk to people who agree with you. I actually think the workplace is the last place in our society where people can\u2019t choose necessarily who they work with.\u201dMr. Frazier, the most prominent African-American chief executive in the country, articulated the challenge that business faces in the middle of this political maelstrom, but also the chance: \u201cBusiness leaders have an opportunity to help bridge some of these chasms in understanding in our society.\u201dExecutives, of course, have long liked to talk about leadership and made proud declarations about their role in society, but all too often the promises have rung hollow.This time may actually be different.Over the course of a day of conversations with some of the top executives in the nation during last week\u2019s conference \u2014 DealBook: Playing for the Long Term \u2014 a common refrain was heard, echoing the sentiments of Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the largest investor in the world with more than $6 trillion. He implored other chief executives in a letter earlier this year to be more thoughtful about their roles in society.\u201cWhat\u2019s driving a lot of the change now is millennials,\u201d Mr. Fink said, expanding on the letter. \u201cThey are asking more of their companies.\u201dHe said he believed that we were at an inflection point.\u201cI do believe that the demand for E.S.G. is going to transform all investing,\u201d Mr. Fink said, referring to how investors are beginning to meaningfully evaluate companies based, in part, on environmental, social and governance metrics.\u201cThat may be one or five years away from now, but it\u2019s not that far away.\u201dResponding to a critique that his words are just public relations and that business shouldn\u2019t get involved with issues beyond the bottom line, Mr. Fink said, \u201cI\u2019m not a nanny.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not telling companies what their purpose should be. But I do believe it\u2019s up to the company to identify what their purpose is.\u201dSundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, said that although he started as an engineer, the way he spends his day has changed; increasingly, he devotes much of his time to thinking about how \u201ctechnology impacts society at scale.\u201dHe said part of his job description had turned into \u201ctechnologist-policy-maker-diplomat.\u201dIndeed, companies like Google are at the center of the debate, facing questions about their size and their impact on issues like privacy but also whether they support working with the United States government on sensitive projects like artificial intelligence for the Defense Department \u2014 a project Google chose to end, in part, because of a backlash from its employees. That outcome bolstered Mr. Fink\u2019s analysis that employees have become remarkably powerful inside some of these companies, especially as the job market continues to tighten.Mr. Pichai said he didn\u2019t run the company \u201cby referendum,\u201d but the day we spoke he was grappling with the fallout from a walkout by Google employees around the world over accusations of sexual harassment in the workplace, which some employees argued was prevalent in the company\u2019s culture.At most companies, such a walkout would be unthinkable. Mr. Pichai said he welcomed it. And while he said the debate was painful for the company, there is something unique even about the shift in business culture that would allow for such a widespread outcry.The technology industry, perhaps more than any other, is scrambling to defend itself against arguments that its products, once viewed as changing the world for the better, might be having the opposite effect.Evan Spiegel, chief executive of Snap, was candid. \u201cThese platforms have created an environment,\u201d he said, \u201cthat incentivizes negative behavior.\u201d He added: \u201cI think we\u2019re in this weird moment in time where this behavior\u2019s been enabled technically, and the regulatory framework actually hasn\u2019t caught up to that reality.\u201dAnd while Washington seems woefully behind, at least some companies are taking things into their own hands.Edward W. Stack, chief executive of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, recalled how he decided that his company would no longer sell AR-15 rifles after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. He described crying after watching the news. \u201cI said: \u2018This system doesn\u2019t work. This system is broken and we need to do something about it,\u201d he said.He said he \u201cwent to Washington and talked about the inconsistencies in the gun laws. A number of people in Washington didn\u2019t even know this, but you have to be 21 years old to buy a handgun from a federally firearms licensed dealer,\u201d but you can be 18 to buy an AR-15.Companies are not all going to be virtuous, and many decisions business leaders will make are hardly black and white, but the idea that executives are starting to consider their impact is at least the beginning of progress.Advertisement"}
